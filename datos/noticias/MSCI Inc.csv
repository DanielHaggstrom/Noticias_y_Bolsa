MSCI executives were outraged, pointing out that the decision to include Chinese equities followed detailed consultations with clients and lengthy negotiations with Beijing that resulted in market reforms.Mr Pettit phrases his responses diplomatically. “We will see more critics arguing that index providers have too much influence but we stand by the integrity of our processes. There really isn’t anything sinister going on. The inclusion of countries within MSCI indices is technically driven and our processes are transparent to regulators and our clients,” he says.Throughout the interview in MSCI’s office in London, he appears entirely relaxed, leaning back in his chair while answering questions.Established 1969Benchmarked assets $12.3tn

Listings New York Stock ExchangeEuropean regulators introduced new rules governing financial benchmarks in 2018 to prevent a repeat of the Libor scandal. Index providers had effectively been unregulated before this but Mr Pettit says the new rules have had minimal impact. “Index companies are coming under greater regulatory scrutiny for sure. We are fine with it. The rule changes involve more logging of our actions, the editorial processes and decisions. But it would be a concern if regulators started to impose divergent rules in different markets as we effectively run a global process,” he says. Arguably the biggest challenge facing investors across the world is assessing the potential risks of climate change for their portfolios, a process fraught with uncertainties.MSCI is aiming to help clients to better integrate environmental considerations into their investment processes with a new climate value-at-risk model, which has just been launched following the acquisition last year of Carbon Delta, a specialised data and analytics provider.“The climate VAR model can provide clients with a means to identify assets that are at risk from extreme weather hazard such as flooding. Nearly 7 per cent of the facilities owned by the 3,046 companies in the MSCI All Country World index are threatened by coastal flooding. Half of these facilities might become untenable by 2050,” he says.MSCI expects to see large-scale reallocation of capital over the next few decades because of the shift to a low-carbon economy and a significant repricing of financial assets as investors integrate environmental, social and governance considerations more fully into their asset allocation decisions.“More and more data is showing that incorporating high ESG standards can reduce risks. It will become harder to argue going forward that ESG is not part of an asset owner’s fiduciary duty,” says the 55-year-old and father of three. In November, MSCI made ESG ratings on more than 2,800 companies publicly available. The ratings are constructed using 1,000 data points from company reports and alternative data sources. MSCI plans to expand the ESG ratings to 7,500 companies before the end of this year.“We want to encourage an open discussion among investors and companies on how to improve sustainability across the board,” he says. He adds that “real regulation” will be needed from governments to curtail damaging carbon emissions. “ESG can be a positive accelerant but it will not be sufficient on its own to reduce carbon emissions.”Born 1964 LondonTotal pay $2.9m in 2018Education1982-85 Master of arts in history, university of Cambridge1985-87 Master of science in foreign service, Georgetown UniversityCareer1992-00 Bloomberg, sales manager2000-01 MSCI, head of European client coverage2001-12 MSCI, global head of index2015-17 MSCI, chief operating officer2015 to present MSCI, global head of products2017 to present MSCI, presidentMSCI in January agreed to pay $190m to acquire a minority stake in Burgiss Group, a provider of performance data covering close to 10,000 private investment vehicles that hold assets of $7tn.Mr Pettit says that MSCI aims to bring more transparency to the reporting of private assets. MSCI will also gradually integrate its ESG analytics with Burgiss private markets data.“Private equity firms are showing an interest in ESG for sure. The main problem is data availability and some frictions may arise around transparency requirements. A lot of work needs to be done but it is moving in the right direction.”About $12.3tn in assets is benchmarked against MSCI’s public market indices, the core of its highly profitable business. MSCI’s indexing unit generated a 72.8 per cent profit margin in 2019. Fee rates for ETF managers have been declining slowly but price declines have been more than offset by huge increases in assets in tracker funds. Assets in ETFs linked to MSCI indices reached $934bn at the end of 2019, up 34 per cent on the previous year-end. The combination of massive investor inflows into index tracking funds and multiple stock markets reaching new peaks has helped to turbo-charge MSCI’s earnings growth. It reported net profits of $564m in 2019, up 11 per cent.MSCI shares, which have returned 2,325 per cent (including dividends) since the US stock market reached its post-crisis low in 2009, trade on an eye-wateringly high valuation, about 40 times estimated earnings for 2020. Manav Patnaik, an analyst at Barclays, who has an “overweight” recommendation, says investors frequently question the high valuation. But he believes the premium is justified because prospects for MSCI revenue streams related to its derivatives, private markets and analytics operations are under appreciated. “MSCI addresses the themes that are growing in importance to investors including the shift from active into passive strategies, the globalisation of financial markets, ESG investing, multi-asset risk analysis and the rise of illiquid private assets,” says Mr Patnaik.Mr Pettit’s recipe for MSCI’s future is straightforward.“We survive and prosper if what we do is transparent, high quality and reliable. Investors have a choice whether to use MSCI or not,” he says."
1;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-03-04T04:00:35Z;Heavy flows into ESG funds raise questions over ratings;Providers under spotlight on the integrity of their scoring systems;ESG ratings are becoming embedded in financial markets. A growing number of investment indices now hinge on companies’ rankings for environmental, social and governance criteria, and some banks are even offering better borrowing terms to companies with strong ESG scores.But these are not like credit ratings, which are regulated, and tend to be governed by specific triggers such as a company breaching a certain threshold of leverage. And with so many different methodologies on the market, from a growing number of providers, there can be a wide spread of views on the same company.Facebook, for example, was docked to a rating of 21 out of 100 last year by S&P Global, which worried about its privacy and transparency standards. Yet MSCI’s rating for the social media platform has hovered in the “average” range, fluctuating between double-B and triple-B.ESG ratings are becoming “increasingly important, but the level of public scrutiny and supervision of them . . . is far from optimal,” said Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, at an event last month.The first step is often determining what factors are material to the company the agency is looking at.Sustainalytics, one of the most prominent ESG ratings providers, has set out 138 “sub-industry” groups and designates “exposure scores” for each factor within each sector, according to Simon McMahon, head of ESG research. For example, mining companies may be more vulnerable to the physical effects of climate change than the tech sector, so those risks are weighted more heavily in the miners’ ratings.Ratings are reviewed annually and updated to incorporate new risks as they pop up. “It’s a combination of a data-driven process and a process that incorporates analyst insight,” said Mr McMahon.Paris-based Vigeo Eiris, one of the world’s oldest ESG rating agencies, now owned by Moody’s, has identified 38 so-called “sustainability drivers” and sets out a weighting for each, across 40 different industries. JetBlue, an airline that recently signed a loan tied to its Vigeo Eiris ESG score, is rated on about two dozen drivers relevant to the airline sector, said Benjamin Cliquet, the company’s head of ESG-linked loans.Vigeo Eiris also updates its assessments frequently. But in cases such as JetBlue, where it is important to be able to compare year-on-year data to set the terms of its loan, the agency will produce reports consistent with the original methodology so that BNP Paribas, the bank providing the loan, can make an apples-to-apples comparison.One of the biggest challenges in ESG ratings comes from self-reported data, said Remy Briand, head of ESG at MSCI. For starters, many companies offer up data only on metrics where they perform well, he said.On top of that, the data is typically unaudited. “You have to look for evidence elsewhere to make sure companies are doing what they’re saying,” said Mr Briand, explaining MSCI spends a lot of time looking at other data sets such as regulatory fines or product recalls to vet what they receive from companies.This has paid off in cases such as Equifax, the consumer credit agency that revealed a breach of its systems in September 2017. MSCI’s ESG team had downgraded the company to triple-C more than a year earlier. “Privacy and security [carried] a big weight in that sector, and we scanned [databases] and saw they already had a poor record of being hacked and not doing anything about it,” he said.Sustainalytics’ research is also based on a combination of self-reported data and external verification. And if a matter has been deemed material, Sustainalytics will score a company on it whether or not it provides information, said Mr McMahon. “We have identified the risk. There’s a need for that risk to be managed.”Baer Pettit, president of MSCI, expects there may be some convergence between scores from different providers, but he does not believe it will ever achieve the kind of homogeneity of credit ratings.This will provide little consolation for investors looking for quick and easy ways to put a sustainability stamp of approval on their portfolios. But the providers argue that a certain level of variance is a good thing — and shows that ESG analysis can be used by investors to gain an informational edge.Mr Pettit compares the market to Wall Street analysts’ ratings of listed companies, where there tends to be a wide range of views. “We are making a forward looking judgment with a variety of inputs, not all of which are standardised,” he said.“Turning unstructured data into actionable insights is hard to do,” added Mr McMahon from Sustainalytics. “That’s why there’s an opportunity.” Additional reporting by Anna Gross
2;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T05:04:22+0000;US stocks close lower again for worst week since 2008;Late rebound fails to snap losing streak as Fed promised to ‘act as appropriate’ in response to coronavirus;Global stocks gave up four months of gains this week as investors were seized by anxiety over the coronavirus, wiping one-tenth off equity values on mounting concern that the outbreak will stunt economic growth and corporate profits.The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent on Friday, bringing its losses to 13 per cent since it hit a record high on February 19 and marking the worst week for global equities since 2008. Demand for the 10-year Treasury note, a haven for investors in times of stress, pushed its yield to 1.114 per cent, a new record low, before settling at 1.163 per cent.The Federal Reserve issued a statement at 2.30pm stating it would “act as appropriate” to support the economy in response to the “evolving risks” posed by the spread of the coronavirus.You have to respect the volatility in the markets when fear takes overThe Stoxx Europe 600 and the FTSE 100 both dropped by 3.4 per cent on Friday while MSCI’s Asia Pacific index fell 2.6 per cent, leaving global markets down by 11.2 per cent for the week.“There is fear in the streets,” said Patrick Kaiser, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global Investment Management. “No one wants to have exposure over the weekend.” The World Health Organization raised its risk assessment over coronavirus to “very high” but refrained from talking about a pandemic. Michael Ryan, a senior WHO official, said: “This is a reality check for every government on the planet. Be ready — we can avoid the worst but our level of concern is at the highest level.”First cases of the flu-like illness, also known as Covid-19, were reported in countries as far afield as Mexico, Nigeria, Iceland and New Zealand as the number of confirmed infections rose to nearly 84,000 and deaths from the virus reached more than 2,800.Iran suspended its parliament after at least four members became infected, and in Japan the governor of Hokkaido, an island home to 5m people, declared a state of emergency.In Europe, the German authorities put 1,000 people under quarantine at home in North Rhine-Westphalia after the state registered 14 new cases, and some 50,000 people remain locked down in Italy’s industrial north.Worries about the economic impact intensified as governments and businesses raced to contain its spread.A decision by the Swiss authorities to ban events attended by more than 1,000 people led to the cancellation of the Geneva Motor Show, which had been due to start on Monday, and the Baselworld trade show for the Swiss watchmaking industry.US stocks staged a late rally in the final minutes of trade after initially dropping 4 per cent when markets opened. Energy, financials and materials stocks were the worst performing sectors for the week. American Airlines was the worst performing US stock for the week, losing 31.5 per cent, while Citi and Bank of America lost 17 per cent, the most of the big Wall Street banks.Utility companies, typically a safe harbour for equity investors in times of market strife, were the worst performing stocks on Friday, surprising veteran traders. “There are really unique things happening the market,” said Jim Smigiel, head of portfolio strategies group at SEI Investments. “Those rules you have in your mind . . . have been broken.”An index of European travel and leisure stocks tumbled 19 per cent from last week in the heaviest decline since the terrorist attacks in September 2001.“Whereas, just a week ago, investors were regarding the coronavirus as being predominantly a Chinese issue, it is now understood to be a fast-spreading global concern,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors.Bank of America has predicted global growth will slow in 2020 to below 3 per cent — the weakest pace of the post-crisis era, while Goldman Sachs said that US corporate profits would stagnate this year, slashing its previous expectation for earnings growth.“The market is rapidly pricing in a very dire scenario comparable to what we’ve seen in China,” said Tai Hui, head Asia market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. Gold had been in back in heavy demand this week, as a hedge against sliding stock markets, but it fell on Friday with the price easing 3.7 per cent to $1,584 an ounce, its biggest one-day drop since 2013. “We attribute this to forced selling aimed at offsetting losses elsewhere and covering so-called margin calls,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank.The Vix index, one of the most closely watched measures of expected volatility in Wall Street stocks, jumped to as high as 49 — its highest since early 2009 — before easing to 40 by late afternoon. It has risen almost three-fold in the past week as traders look to hedge against further tumult. “This is very difficult for central bank policymakers to handle,” said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco. “You have to respect the volatility in the markets when fear takes over.”Investors have aggressively sold the riskiest US corporate debt — a market that is watched closely by the Fed as a proxy for investor sentiment and financial conditions. The premium in yield demanded to hold so-called junk bonds has lurched higher to 4.6 percentage points, from 3.7 points last Friday. Oil prices fell further on Friday with Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropping 3.3 per cent to $49.99 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, fell 4 per cent to $45.21, its lowest level in four years.“People are running scared,” said Andrew Sullivan, director at Hong Kong brokerage Pearl Bridge Partners.Subscribers can use myFT to follow the latest ‘coronavirus’ coverage
3;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-02-26T09:51:41Z;Has the bull market run out of puff?;The global equity market has reached new highs, but has not exceeded previous ratios against cash flows;"Stock markets went downhill fast at the beginning of this week as investors took fright over coronavirus. Serious worries are emerging over whether the fast-spreading disease will cause a regional or global economic slowdown.It seems an apposite moment to take the temperature of the bull market, which next month will mark its 11th birthday. It is one of the longest of all time. Someone investing £1,000 in global equities at its start, on March 9 2009, would now have £4,302 at an annual compound growth rate of 14.23 per cent, using MSCI data.The question is: when will it end?In an attempt to avoid the question, I have been trying to see how bull market longevity compares with that of the animal itself. Easier said than done.A Norfolk farmer friend eventually came to the rescue with a pithy text saying: “Eight to 10 if he’s sound.” As an analogy, this longevity comparison works out better than I expected. But is it helpful?Dig a bit and you can always find statistical outliers: the cow named Big Bertha which lived to the age of 48; the Australian bull market that is now over 20 years old.Geoffrey West, a British physicist, wrote in his book Scale that the life expectancy of many mammals seems to be inversely proportional to their heart rates. A mouse, whose heart beats around 250 times a minute, typically lives three or four years. An elephant’s heart beats about 30 times a minute for its 60 years.This bull market may be old, but its pulse has been slow, which may have aided its longevity. It has been the shallowest recovery since the second world war.You might conclude that this is all a pile of something else associated with bulls. In short, guessing when a bull market will end simply by its age is as pointless as guessing when a farmer will need to call in the vet to bid adieu to a prized Rockland Hereford. You would be right.And yet, the age of this bull has influenced investor behaviour. It is clear that many people have been holding back from buying equities. They are worried that the market is going to turn. They look back in anguish at the returns they have missed but are frightened to invest now in case they catch the top of the market. And they were just as frightened at the beginning of 2019, a year in which the FTSE 100 rose 17 per cent (in sterling) and the S&P 500 by 32 per cent (in US dollar terms), once you included dividends.Looking backwards is unhelpful. A share today is either worth buying or not and that decision should be taken on the basis of its current prospects and valuation. The share may have fallen or risen a lot in the past but this should not affect today’s judgment. The company’s financial history and record are essential ingredients to a decision; the share price history much less so.Similarly, we should avoid this psychological bias when deciding whether to sell a share. The decision should be based on today’s evidence, not on whether one has made a profit (a bad habit known in the market as cutting the heads off daisies) or a loss (something most of us are very inclined not to take, however strong the evidence).And, finally, looking backwards is unhelpful in another way. There are some who are far from cautious. They see the growth of the past 10 years and simply extrapolate forward another 10. This is equal folly.So let’s focus on today. A bull market relies on the heart holding up. The things that keep the corporate heart beating are cash flow and growth. Many companies continue to produce solid year-on-year increases in cash flows, especially US companies and technology stocks.The end times for many bull markets are presaged by market exuberance — heartbeats racing until the bull wears itself out. There is little evidence of that yet. We have seen some dubious IPOs but little sign of the ill-advised mergers and acquisitions that marked the takeover boom of the late 1980s, when there was more testosterone than sense coursing through global boardrooms.Although the global equity market has reached new highs, it has not exceeded previous ratios against cash flows. The best illustration of this is the dividend yield. This has to be paid out in real cash, so is a more accurate reflection of profitability than the price/earnings ratio. Earnings numbers are easily manipulated in company accounts, which often need sophisticated interrogation.Market yields in mid-February were around 1.8 per cent in the US and Japan, 4.4 per cent in the UK and 3.4 per cent in Europe, according to Refinitiv data. These suggest equities still offer value as well as growth potential compared with bonds or cash: UK 10-year gilts currently yield 0.6 per cent to redemption.If you want to know what will bring down this bull market, look at factors beyond old age. Potential matadors include central bank policymakers overreacting to signs of inflation (usually after a prolonged period of not doing enough).Think too about what economists like to call “exogenous shocks”. Coronavirus may fit into that category. It is easy to overreact, and markets tend to, but they can also be remarkably resilient and more often than not bounce back strongly. In 20 years we would hope to struggle to spot the virus’s effect on charts of global market indices.In the meantime, while we cannot predict events, we can prepare. This is why investors diversify and do not leave themselves overexposed to a handful of stocks, one asset region or one asset class. It is why we encourage people to drip-feed money regularly into the markets to take advantage of dips without betting the house on a bounce. We think this is good sensible investment management and it is something investors should practise whatever stage of the cycle we are in — or however old the bull market.Simon Edelsten is the manager of the Artemis Global Select Fund and the Mid Wynd Investment Trust.

Deals have been a key to his expansion strategy, such as the acquisitions of Barra, the analytics company founded by the fabled quantitative investor Barr Rosenberg, and JPMorgan’s RiskMetrics, the developer of the widely used “value-at-risk” metric, in 2004 and 2010 respectively.In September, MSCI acquired Carbon Delta, a Zurich-based boutique focused on climate-change scenarios analysis. It also has the firepower to pursue additional deals that complement its existing ESG analytical capabilities.These deals also bring MSCI into more direct competition with one of its most important clients, BlackRock. The world’s largest asset manager paid $1.3bn last year to acquire eFront, a provider of private market analytics. BlackRock has integrated eFront into its existing Aladdin technology platform which also offers a wide range of sophisticated risk and portfolio management services.Sign up to the weekly FTfm weekly newsletter and receive the best of the FT’s asset management coverage delivered to your inbox every Monday morning.Sign up here with one click
5;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-01-20T05:00:27Z;The index providers are quietly building up enormous powers;Passive investing’s rise has helped make the benchmark setters the new gatekeepers of capital;Last summer, US senator Marco Rubio sent an incendiary open letter to MSCI — a financial index provider and analytical software provider little-known outside the world of investing. He accused it of putting US pensioners at risk, supporting Chinese human rights abuses and even imperilling American national security.The trigger was MSCI’s 2018 decision to include some Chinese stocks in its benchmarks, especially its influential MSCI Emerging Markets index. The company gradually increased the weighting of Chinese equities during 2019 to 4 per cent of the EM index, which is used as a benchmark by investors managing nearly $2tn.Many of those investors are American, and the prospect of US money gushing into China’s stock market at a time of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing infuriated the Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate. “We can no longer allow China’s authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency,” Mr Rubio thundered, demanding that MSCI explain how and why its decision was made.It is easy to dismiss this intervention as uninformed political grandstanding. The inclusion of China in MSCI’s emerging markets benchmark was widely desired among the investment management groups that are its customers. The carrot of index inclusion can also be a powerful motivator for countries to improve their capital markets. Moreover, US investors can and already do trade Chinese securities irrespective of whether they are in any index. Given that China is easily the world’s biggest EM — it may soon even surpass the US as the world’s biggest economy — it would look odd to keep it outside the most important EM index. The transparency, corporate governance and technical standards of China’s financial markets may lag far behind the US, but it is little different from many other parts of the developing world. Nonetheless, the controversy highlights an under-appreciated fact. The huge shift from traditional, active asset management to passive, index-tracking funds since the financial crisis has made the major index providers enormously powerful.The global index fund industry has grown fivefold over the past decade to $11.4tn by the end of November last year, according to data compiled for the FT by the Investment Company Institute. BlackRock estimated in 2017 that there was another $6.8tn in index-tracking strategies managed internally by sovereign wealth funds, endowments and pension plans. Assuming the same growth rate since then, there are now roughly $20tn of investments that strive only to mimic an underlying index.Regulators, politicians, academics and activists have often focused their attention on the influence of the biggest passive investment managers, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. But when it comes to their index funds, in practice they outsource their investment decisions to another “Big Three”: the dominant index providers MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell. A new paper entitled “Steering capital: the growing private authority of index providers in the age of passive asset management”, by Johannes Petry, Jan Fichtner and Eelke Heemskerk at the universities of Warwick and Amsterdam, spells out why this is such a big deal, saying: “We argue that these index providers have become actors that exercise growing private authority as they steer investments through the indices they create and maintain.” The index providers say that inclusions, exclusions and weighting changes are largely a technical matter and they have very little discretion in these decisions. The three academics argue that this is something of a cop-out. The criteria may be informed by their asset management clients, but they are defined and formalised by the index providers. “Hence, in this new age of passive asset management, index providers are becoming gatekeepers that exert de facto regulatory power and thus may have important effects on corporate governance and the economic policies of countries,” the paper concludes.Controversies such as China’s inclusion in the MSCI EM index obscure this far bigger issue: as passive investing continues to grow, so too will the power of those that provide indices for these funds to track. Some investment groups are experimenting with “self-indexing” — making their own benchmarks to save the money that goes to the big providers — while Vanguard has shifted some of its funds to indices constructed by Chicago Booth’s Center for Research in Security Prices. Companies like Morningstar are trying to crack the indexing oligopoly, earlier this month poaching one of FTSE Russell’s top executives to lead its efforts.But this is unlikely to dent the overall trend. Index providers are an under-appreciated power in finance, and that power is only likely to grow. At some point, politicians and regulators will have to stop scrambling after facile headlines, and attempt to tackle this far thornier, more complex issue.
6;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-12-30T12:08:02Z;Lex investment outlook: think again;Spectres that could give investors a fright include US-China trade tension, tech IPOs and a Swedish teenager;If you have to forecast, do it often, opined one economist. He’d have a busy old time in 2020. Wild cards include new(ish) governors at three of the world’s most influential — and hitherto dovish — central banks. Here are other spectres lurking in the wings that could give investors a fright.Climate change/environmentA Swedish teenager has left oil producers, airlines and other carbon emitters quaking in their boots. Spurred by Greta Thunberg and other activists, shareholders demanding greener credentials have pushed valuations of energy groups, airlines and carmakers to 10-year lows, based on forward price to cash flow multiples relative to that of the MSCI world index. They will stay cheap as cost of capital rises and lenders take a tougher stance on dirty industries.Tech stocks/IPOsLex is going to go against the flow: despite a disastrous year (more if including China), tech IPOs will hit a sweet spot. Buoyant equity markets will lure delayed initial public offerings. But expect a higher calibre than cash guzzlers like Uber, which has suffered a share price collapse. Airbnb, for example, claims it was in the black last year. Asana, scourge of office workers for whom list making is anathema, boasts reliably recurring revenue and relatively low costs. Tick those boxes.US/China decouplingInvestors have fretted about trade friction between the two biggest powers ever since China first sought membership to the WTO. US President Donald Trump upped the ante since taking office. In China, trade tensions have combined with slowing economic growth and a rash of defaults to keep a lid on stock prices. But despite trailing world indices, Chinese equities do not look particularly cheap, trading roughly at their 10 year average forward price to earnings. The combo of a pugilistic President Trump and a hardcore Xi Jinping will keep investors on their toes in 2020.Brexit/Whither the US dollarBrexit is inevitable and sterling has finally stabilised. Thank heaven say holidaying Brits. A slippery sterling has served to prop up the dollar. Removing that support for the greenback unleashes the usual litany of side-effects associated with a weaker dollar: rising prices of commodities and emerging market equities. The latter economies gain from cheaper financing. That suggests a better year for those two asset classes.The scale of these trends contrasts with the relative calm of the nineties and early 2000s. Epochal disruption is well-advanced in geopolitics, energy and politics. We knew Francis Fukuyama was wrong when he called the end of history in 1992. The surprise is just how wrong he is turning out to have been.
7;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-11-27T07:33:23Z;MSCI pressures Chinese regulators over market access reforms;Index provider demands progress on settlement cycle issues and lack of hedging tools;Index provider MSCI increased its pressure on Chinese regulators to push through sensitive market access reforms on Wednesday, stating it will not include more Chinese stocks until its concerns over hedging and other problems are addressed.The inclusion of so-called A shares into MSCI’s flagship emerging markets index in 2018 was expected to bring in more than $100bn in foreign investments this year. MSCI has gradually increased their weighting throughout 2019.The company completed its final scheduled adjustment at the close of trading on Tuesday, with the weighting reaching 4 per cent in the emerging markets index, an influential benchmark tracked by global investors managing about $1.9tn.But MSCI drew a firm line on Wednesday on conditions for inclusion of more stocks. It said in a statement that it would not hold further consultations on increasing the weighting until regulators addressed a list of concerns, including access to hedging tools, and problems with China’s settlement cycle and holiday schedule.“MSCI will launch a public consultation on further inclusion of China A shares in MSCI indexes only after all the above-mentioned concerns have been addressed by the Chinese authorities in order to continue to facilitate international investment,” MSCI said in a statement.If we were allocating to China but can’t control the volatility, then there’s a limit to how much we could allocateThe company has previously asked authorities to address those problems but had not made regulatory changes a condition for future consultations.Foreign investors have stressed for several years that increased allocation to Chinese securities would need to come hand in hand with access to derivatives such as index futures and options contracts in order to hedge against downside risks.Without hedging tools, funds that require volatility controls will find limits to how much they can invest in Chinese securities, said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions at BNP Paribas Asset Management.“If we were allocating to China but can’t control the volatility, then there’s a limit to how much we could allocate,” Mr Sandhu said, in reference to funds requiring volatility protection.Regulators this year have told several foreign investment managers that such changes were under way, however there is still no clear timeframe for opening up new areas of market accessibility.Derivatives are a sensitive area for Chinese authorities and are viewed as a channel for foreign investors to short Chinese stocks and promote volatility in the stock market, which is dominated by retail investors.Some experiments with hedging tools have in the past resulted in crises. For example, an incident involving a large bond futures order in 1995 resulted in the collapse of China’s largest securities broker and the shuttering of the bond futures market until 2013.MSCI has also called on Chinese authorities to resolve problems with the country’s settlement cycle, which is shorter than most other large markets and presents operational problems. China’s holiday schedule does not match that of Stock Connect, a channel used by international investors to access Chinese shares, MSCI said.The company also cited complaints about China’s trading mechanism, which does not allow them to place single orders on behalf of multiple clients.MSCI has been criticised this year for its inclusion of Chinese stocks such as Kangmei Pharmaceutical, a drugmaker that admitted in May to overstating cash holdings by more than $4bn.
8;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-11-21T12:24:36Z;China/MSCI: losing its marbles;ArtGo’s spectacular fall undermines the stamp of approval of index inclusion;Index compilers are the new active managers. The point is illustrated by an embarrassing U-turn by MSCI. It has backtracked on plans to add ArtGo, a controversial marble company, to its China All Shares index. Shares that had produced a 3,800 per cent annual return plunged 98 per cent on Thursday.MSCI’s index criteria once again appears flawed. This time, the damage to its reputation could be serious. The U-turn highlights the way index funds reflect subjective stock selections, disproving claims they eliminate human error.It would have helped if Hong Kong-based activist investor David Webb worked for MSCI. Mr Webb had warned investors to avoid ArtGo. The company traded at a crazy 20 times net tangible assets. The anomaly persisted despite a first-half loss of $4.1m on revenues of just $6.8m. ArtGo, a stolid quarrying company, had an enterprise value to trailing ebitda valuation of more than 120 times at one point.This is not the first time an MSCI inclusion has stirred controversy. Shares of Hong Kong-listed China Ding Yi Feng gained 8,500 per cent over five years without earnings to back its valuation. Hong Kong regulators suspended trading and launched an investigation in March.The spectacular fall of ArtGo further undermines the stamp of approval of index inclusion. ArtGo shares more than doubled after MSCI selected them earlier this month. Vanguard and State Street were among top shareholders, according to S&P CIQ. You can see how reweighting MSCI’s China All Shares index could bolster China’s faltering stocks, as some pundits propose.Chinese stocks fell short of adequate standards across 18 metrics used for MSCI inclusions through 2017. Since then, concerns have multiplied over the rapid increase in the weighting of Chinese shares in MSCI indices. US lawmakers worry this could channel US money into businesses involved in human rights abuses or espionage. The MSCI China All Shares index has returned about 17 per cent this year. Better returns — and transparency — were available elsewhere. The more often China’s lax governance and accounting standards force MSCI to rejig selections, the more it looks like a stock tipper rather than a dispassionate statistician.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

10;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-09-17T16:13:02Z;Value funds/oil: crude calculus;Don’t expect too much from banks;The bombing of Saudi Aramco’s oil processing facilities has triggered a topsy-turvy period for oil markets. Crude prices have soared, lifting the shares of neglected energy producers. Energy stocks, along with financials, usually fall into the category of inexpensive equities labelled “value”. These have long trailed the broader market. Value fund managers, the perennial underdogs of the investment world, have grounds to believe they are now alpha animals. They should think again.Value encompasses those shares trading at low valuation multiples versus their respective earnings, or book values, and those offering high dividend yields. Many oil and gas companies, such as Chevron and Total of France, fit this screening. So do banks. Financials are by far the largest sector in MSCI’s value index, with nearly a quarter of the weighting. Both financials and energy tend to suffer from relatively low price-to-book ratios. European banks on this ratio trade near decade lows. This means the market has a lower opinion of these assets than the companies do themselves. Technology groups have less shareholder equity, but deliver higher returns on it.Integrated oil companies with increasing amounts of free cash flow will receive more attention from now on even if crude prices only move sideways. Large European oil producers offer dividend yields of around 6 per cent.But without a much steeper bond yield curve, to lift loan profitability, expecting a lot more from banks seems a stretch. Yes, there have been exceptions, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America. Their peers in the US and elsewhere have lagged well behind.Any hiccup in the bond market, pushing up yields, tends to attract value hunters. Unfortunately, a sharpish sell-off in longer-dated US Treasury notes this month has now fizzled out. Moreover, the value factor usually springs to life at the early stages of recovery, not late in an economic cycle. Value will have its day, just not today.
11;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-09-17T03:00:35Z;Credit rating agencies join battle for ESG supremacy;Moody’s and S&P enter race to provide environmental, social and governance scores;A flurry of dealmaking has begun among firms that provide companies with environmental, social and governance ratings, fed by increasing demand for the data among investors and regulators.The sector has traditionally been dominated by index providers such as MSCI and a handful of specialist firms, such as Sustainalytics. Now Moody’s and S&P Global, two of the big three credit rating agencies, are elbowing their way in, offering separate ESG scores on companies in addition to their traditional assessments of creditworthiness.Moody’s made a splash earlier this year when it bought a majority stake in Vigeo Eiris, one of the most prominent European ESG research outfits, which traces its roots back to the beginning of the socially responsible investing movement in the early 1980s. Moody’s also later bought Four Twenty Seven, a climate research specialist named after one of California’s emissions targets — 427m tonnes of carbon.S&P has a long history of partnering with RobecoSAM, an asset manager that specialises in sustainability research, to create the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, but it is now staking out its own ESG ratings business. The New York-based company published its first ESG evaluation in June.Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners, an equity analyst who covers MSCI, estimates that the global market for ESG ratings is currently worth about $200m and says that could grow to $500m within five years.Last year, MSCI’s ESG research division saw a 30 per cent rise in turnover, to $71m, and has kept up a similar rate of expansion this year.Moody’s and S&P “know this will be a big market in the future and it will only grow,” said Florian Berg, postdoctoral research associate at MIT Sloan School of Management.ESG ratings have risen in popularity among investors who have started focusing more heavily on matters of sustainability. The European Parliament and EU member states agreed to new sustainability disclosure rules in March. The regulation is likely to force the hands of investors that, to date, have shied away from ESG disclosures, said Remy Briand, head of ESG at MSCI.“In some shape or form, essentially, we think investors will have to report on climate risk,” he said. The company bought a climate research company called Carbon Delta last week to broaden its ratings business, Mr Briand added.The third of the big three credit rating agencies, Fitch, has so far stayed out of the ESG ratings market, but is also making a push to highlight how it uses ESG to determine companies’ creditworthiness. Incidents such as the bankruptcy of California utility Pacific Gas & Electric, which was held liable for billions of dollars in damages from wildfires, show how ESG factors such as climate change can create material financial risks.“PG&E made everyone wake up and say this is for real and this isn’t going away,” said Christina Wong, director at Sustainability, a research consultancy.In regular credit ratings, companies are graded only on ESG risks that have a direct impact on their ability to pay their debts. “ESG factors may or may not be material. If they are, we will write about them. If not, we’re not going to talk about it,” said Susan Gray, the global head of corporate ratings at S&P.For separate ESG ratings, the analysis goes deeper. “The goal on ESG ratings is to look at the sustainability of the business model of the issuer,” said Myriam Durand, global head of assessments at Moody’s. However, what that means varies from agency to agency.This lack of standardisation can be confusing for companies, whose ESG scores often do not match up across agencies. Research conducted by Mr Berg shows ESG ratings from different sources are aligned in about 6 out of 10 cases, whereas regular ratings for creditworthiness match 99 per cent of the time.Industry bodies such as the San Francisco-based Sustainable Accounting Standards Board are trying to fix this problem, but industry experts think a single rating spectrum is a long way off yet.“I don’t think there will ever be just one rating,” said Ms Wong. “I think of it like sellside research . . . You’re never going to have one analyst who knows every market and every company.”
12;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-07-31T03:00:29Z;MSCI chief looks beyond traditional indices for growth;Chairman Henry Fernandez says the future lies in private capital and ESG;When in 1996 Henry Fernandez asked Morgan Stanley’s investment bankers to estimate the value of its modest indexing joint venture with Capital Group, he was told that the division he ran was probably worth no more than $20m.He believed this was far too pessimistic. The Mexico-born, Nicaragua-raised and US-educated financier had become enamoured with the technology world after doing an MBA at Stanford in the early 1980s, and thought the joint venture had the potential to become not just a provider of emerging market indices — its original purpose — but the Microsoft of the investment industry, supplying asset managers with tools and services they might need.While it may lack Microsoft’s heft, today MSCI is an independent, publicly listed company valued at almost $20bn. This is thanks to the fact that it sits at the heart of some of the biggest trends reshaping global finance.“We’re still in the early innings of what is achievable,” MSCI’s chairman and chief executive said in an interview. “There’s an enormous amount of savings that need to be professionally managed, and that is an incredibly complex task that requires a lot of analytical tools. We are the leading supplier of those tools.”Many were picked up through acquisitions. Back in the 1990s, Mr Fernandez compiled a list of dream targets that for years he carried around in his wallet, and would tick off one by one as MSCI snapped them up. Several slipped away, such as Lehman Brothers’ bond indices (now owned by Bloomberg). But Barra, the analytics company founded by fabled quant investor Barr Rosenberg, and JPMorgan’s RiskMetrics — the home of the “value-at-risk” measurement that dominates finance — were captured. These have profited from the trend towards more analytical, global investing during the past decade.Yet indices remain the biggest part of MSCI’s business. The company compiles more than 200,000 — there was $14.8tn benchmarked against its gauges at the end of the first quarter. Together with derivatives referencing MSCI indices, they pulled in $835m last year, well over half MSCI’s overall revenues, and helped lift its profit margin to an eye-watering 53.9 per cent.“It’s a very strong business model,” said Toni Kaplan, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Indices are the crown jewel. It’s high margin and strong growth, with new areas to expand into.”MSCI owes at least some of its indexing success to an astute partnership with Barclays Global Investors in the mid-1990s, providing the benchmarks that underpinned its foray into exchange traded funds. This ultimately became the $2tn iShares ETF behemoth now owned by BlackRock. As a result, about $820bn of ETFs now slavishly track its indices, up threefold during the past five years. The increasing influence of indices means that some critics argue that benchmark providers such as MSCI are too powerful, given that promotions or relegations can send or sap billions of dollars from a country’s stock market. The planned three-step increase in the weighting of Chinese stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets index from 0.7 per cent to 3.3 per cent by the end of 2019, for instance, has so far helped stoke a 28 per cent gain for the Chinese stock market this year. The inclusion and weighting increase came after heavy lobbying from Beijing — Marco Rubio, the US Republican senator, lambasted the move. “We can no longer allow China’s authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency, and place US investors and pensioners at risk,” Mr Rubio said in a letter to Mr Fernandez.MSCI’s chief executive conceded that “there’s not a country that doesn’t call as soon as a review is announced” but said there were “huge embedded checks and balances” in the process. “The concept that index companies are so powerful and influential ignores the fact that we are agents of our clients. The minute we go against the wishes of our clients, it will be the beginning of the end,” he said.“We are trying to marry the needs of suppliers of capital and the consumers of capital. If we don’t do that well — whether influenced by big investors with an agenda or a country — then it will become very apparent very quickly.”Regardless, Mr Fernandez predicts that MSCI’s traditional index business will become relatively less important over time thanks to the growth of its more sophisticated “factor” benchmarks, sustainable investing and — hopefully — a future private capital analytics business.So-called environmental, social and governance investing is now the fastest-growing part of the company’s operations. “MSCI is obsessed about becoming the world’s biggest supplier of ESG tools . . . there might be a point where MSCI gets defined by ESG,” Mr Fernandez said.MSCI’s ambitions for private capital — non-listed, more opaque asset classes such as loans, real estate, private equity and infrastructure — are currently more aspirational, with acquisitions expensive. The company is therefore looking for partnerships or, failing that, building up a new business organically. “It’s not an option to do nothing,” Mr Fernandez said. “I think the world is going to see a revolution in private capital investing over the next decade.”
13;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-07-22T02:00:18Z;UK funds with small-cap weighting at higher risk of liquidity shock;Eight funds assessed as exceeding the SEC’s 15 per cent cap in MSCI study;UK funds are among the most vulnerable to a liquidity shock, especially large products that invest in small companies, according to a wide-ranging analysis of Europe’s asset management industry.Research company MSCI analysed the portfolios of the 412 equity funds with more than €1bn in assets and identified several that would struggle to sell their underlying holdings at a fast enough pace in the event of heavy redemptions without resorting to a fire sale.The liquidity of retail funds has emerged as European investors’ top concern this year, following the suspension of trading in Neil Woodford’s flagship Equity Income fund last month.MSCI analysed funds based on a US Securities and Exchange Commission assessment of liquidity, which judges assets as illiquid if it would take more than a week to sell 5 per cent of the holding in normal market conditions. US funds are prevented from holding more than 15 per cent of their portfolios in illiquid assets.The Woodford Equity Income fund was found to be by far the most illiquid in the analysis, though seven other funds were assessed as over the SEC’s 15 per cent cap. Funds aimed at UK investors, those whose net asset values were quoted in sterling, dominated the list of most illiquid. MSCI did not give the funds’ names.Under European Ucits rules, fund managers are restricted from investing more than 10 per cent of their assets in unquoted stocks, a cap Mr Woodford breached twice last year. Yet MSCI classified 85 per cent of the fund’s exposure as illiquid.Andras Bohak, head of risk management and liquidity research at MSCI, said: “You can have companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, but if they are not traded then they are not much better than a non-listed stock.”
14;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MSCI upgrades Kuwait to emerging markets status;;Kuwait has become the latest country to receive the coveted emerging markets status from MSCI, in a move that is expected to result in billions of dollars of investor inflows into the Gulf country's stocks. MSCI, the world's top equity indexing provider, said in a statement late on Tuesday that it would reclassify its MSCI Kuwait Index benchmark to emerging markets status. Kuwait was previously classified as a frontier market. The upgrade, which comes following MSCI's latest market classification review, will see nine Kuwaiti blue chips included in MSCI's emerging markets benchmark from May next year, with an index weighting of 0.5 per cent . MSCI's emerging markets index is tracked by about $1.9trn in investment funds globally. The reclassification of Kuwait as an emerging market could see the country's stock market lure an additional $2.8bn in passive investment flows, according to NBK Capital. In comparison, China's much larger equity markets is expected to see $125bn in inflows as its presence in the emerging markets benchmark expands.NBK Capital said that the upgrade for Kuwait could boost liquidity, corporate governance and earnings growth in the Gulf nation's equity market. The upgrade is subject to the Kuwait market meeting certain stipulations and reforms. In the year through to May 31, Kuwaiti stocks returned 22 per cent, versus 4 per cent for emerging markets overall. The Gulf bourse's biggest names include National Bank of Kuwait and global logistics business Agility.

Washington has accused Beijing of reneging on trade commitments, while China on Monday announced it would impose tariffs on $60bn of US imports starting on June 1, knocking investor sentiment further.China’s offshore renminbi, which is widely traded in London, stood 0.1 per cent weaker at Rmb6.9400 per dollar around the start of full European trade. It has weakened nearly 3 per cent over the past two weeks as economic hostility between the world’s two largest economies have weighed on the currency.The offshore renminbi is the “focal point” for trade tensions, analysts at ING said. “Were it to hit 7.00, alarm bells would ring even louder around the world.”MSCI’s broad index of emerging market currencies has fallen 0.9 per cent since Friday, its biggest weekly fall since August last year when Turkey’s currency was in free fall, and fifth consecutive week of declines. It slipped 0.4 per cent to 1614.22 on Friday morning in London.The uncertainty is also spreading through many of Asia’s trade-sensitive economies. The Singapore dollar has suffered its worst week since October, as the island state’s economy has shown signs of weakening, while the New Taiwan dollar has notched its biggest one-week declines since the same time.Amid the risk-off sentiment, emerging market bond funds recorded their largest outflows since June 2018 in the week to May 15, according to Barclays. Passive funds largely drove the moves, but active funds also saw outflows for the first time since February.“The resilience of inflows by institutional investors into EM bond funds may be tested over the next weeks,” the bank’s strategists said.Overall, flows into dedicated bond and equity emerging market funds fell around $5bn, Barclays said.Aside from the trade tensions, “the aggregate growth picture in emerging markets has not been particularly positive,” said Paul Fage senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities, pointing to recent data including weakening industrial production.“Probably the most important thing for emerging markets whether they can generate in aggregate a decent pick-up in growth to the developed markets and particularly the US, that has been one of the weaknesses coming into this year,” he said.
16;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-04-26T14:55:46Z;Emerging market currencies set for biggest weekly drop since August;Turkish and Argentine woes hit the asset class;Emerging market currencies are on track to record their worst weekly performance since Turkey’s currency crisis in August as a strong dollar combined with political and economic woes battered the asset class.The MSCI’s broad currency index has fallen about 0.8 per cent since Monday, led by Turkey and Argentina as it marked six consecutive days of decline that put it on track for the biggest weekly drop in eight months.The Argentine peso has been the worst performing currency this year with a 16.4 per cent decline versus the dollar. The Turkish lira, shedding 2 per cent this week, has returned to a level last seen in October.“A glance at our currency indices shows moves over the past few days that remind us of the dollar reaction during the [emerging market] turbulence last August,” currency strategists at Commerzbank said.The renewed pressure on the Turkish lira came as the central bank backed away from its earlier commitment to raise interest rates if needed, coupled with questions over the level of foreign currency reserves.Concerns over pressure from the government of President Tayyip Recep Erdogan on monetary policy were rekindled on Thursday as the Turkish central bank left its main policy rate unchanged at 24 per cent but removed a reference added in March that “further monetary tightening will be delivered” if necessary.With inflation close to 20 per cent and the lira down 11 per cent since the start of the year, analysts expect the central bank’s 5 per cent inflation target to be missed by a wide margin.The Argentine peso, down 7 per cent this week, faces another bout of selling pressure. The popularity of President Mauricio Macri’s government is waning as the country suffers from accelerating inflation and a recession ahead of a presidential election in October.The central bank last week tightened monetary policy in an effort to tame inflation while the government relaunched price controls.South Korea’s currency fell this week following the release of poor growth data that showed the export-led economy suffering its first quarterly contraction since the global financial crisis. The Korean won lost almost 1 per cent after the release of government statistics on gross domestic product. It extended that decline to more than 2 per cent for the week.
17;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-04-15T03:00:35Z;Pakistan slide calls emerging market status into question;Investors shun Karachi bourse only two years after promotion from frontier status;In 2017 the Pakistani stock market was promoted from frontier to emerging market status by MSCI, the dominant index provider — a rare vote of confidence in an all too often troubled country. However, just two years later, the nation’s place in the mainstream emerging index, a berth that should be considered a bare minimum for a country of 200m people, is already coming under threat.While it will probably emerge unscathed from MSCI’s annual June review of its indices, the fact that its place is even being questioned so soon after promotion is a sign of the country’s struggle to punch with even a fraction of its potential weight.“Pakistan is becoming so illiquid that it may come back to frontier,” said Oliver Bell, manager of the T Rowe Price Frontier Markets Equity fund. “When it became emerging it seems the wheels flew off in every direction. It coincided with political issues and currency problems and there is now a lack of interest in the country.”When Pakistan was promoted from frontier status in June 2017 it boasted six stocks that met MSCI’s threshold of a minimum $1.6bn market capitalisation and adequate liquidity, twice the minimum number needed to gain entry.Since then, however, Pakistan’s KSE 100 index has plunged 44 per cent in dollar terms, not helped by the 26 per cent slide in the Pakistani rupee against the greenback, and its MSCI country index is down 52.2 per cent.Among EM countries, only Argentina has performed worse since 2017, with the Karachi bourse even undershooting that of crisis-hit Turkey, as the first chart shows.Unsurprisingly, the sextet of stocks that earned Pakistan its place in the grown-ups league has not escaped unscathed.Only one, Oil & Gas Development, now meets the $1.6bn criterion, and even it has seen its share price tumble 37 per cent in dollar terms. MCB Bank and Habib Bank, the next largest companies, now have market caps of $1.57bn and $1.27bn, respectively, with the latter’s shares diving 65 per cent in dollar terms since June 2017, as illustrated in the second chart.Pakistan now accounts for just 0.03 per cent of the MSCI EM index, far below the 8 basis points both Morocco and Jordan represented when they were downgraded to frontier status, according to EFG Hermes, a regional investment bank.Consequently, few foreign investors are paying much attention to the Karachi bourse. Based on its weighting, the typical EM fund manager should spend just 47 minutes a year analysing Pakistan, compared with four months for the Chinese stock market, according to calculations by Renaissance Capital, an emerging market-focused investment bank.“China is now 33 per cent of the benchmark. Fund managers say to me ‘I have got to get it right. If it doubled or halved and I had got it wrong my career would be at risk. If Pakistan doubled and I had ignored it, it wouldn’t matter, it’s completely irrelevant’,” said Daniel Salter, head of EM equity strategy at RenCap.“Pakistan has to prove itself to be a great opportunity for people to bother. They have to invest time in understanding the politics, whether there is going to be an IMF bailout, what geopolitical problems will emerge in the future. The sense we get is that most EM funds just decided they wouldn’t bother,” he added.Moreover, EM fund managers are coming under increasing pressure to run more concentrated portfolios, “not just sit there and follow the index”, Mr Salter said.Yet any fund that ran an equally weighted 50-stock portfolio would be 66 times overweight Pakistan if it held a single Karachi stock — a benchmark risk few may be willing to take on.RenCap’s data suggest that 82 per cent of actively managed MSCI EM-benchmarked funds now have no exposure to Pakistan at all.Pakistan is likely to remain in this less than satisfactory limbo.MSCI operates a buffer to prevent countries rising and falling between indices like yo-yos. To retain its place in the EM benchmark, Pakistan merely needs to have three stocks with a market cap above a cut-off that was $1.05bn as of November last year — a figure that can change between half-yearly reviews. This is well below the criteria for entry in the first place, assuming the country also meets rules on free float weights and market access.Even if it fails to achieve this, Pavlo Taranenko, executive director of index management research at MSCI, said the index provider could simply choose to draft a smaller Pakistani company into the EM index to meet the minimum requirement of three stocks, an arrangement that could in theory last into perpetuity.In the past, MSCI chose to keep Nigeria and Egypt in its indices when its market access rules were violated, and the Czech Republic when a corporate event took away one of its three eligible stocks.“We want to have the index investable but at the same time we don’t want to have excessive turnover or volatility,” said Mr Taranenko, who added that Pakistan’s lowly 3 basis point index weighting would not have any “specific bearing” on any future decisions MSCI might make.“MSCI would be inclined to disregard short-term moves in the markets, in order to not have countries bounce up and down,” said Mr Salter. “Demotion from EM is a step that MSCI would not take lightly, and we would expect a lengthy consultation process before any action is taken.”Mr Bell agreed, saying: “Typically they are on a watchlist. They are very concerned about moving things up and down. I think they will resist it for some time.”The debate, though, does raise the question of whether Pakistan would have more success in attracting foreign portfolio flows if it was still in the frontier universe, where it basked in the glory of an 8.9 per cent weighting immediately prior to its elevation.The question is difficult to answer definitively as, while the MSCI EM index is believed to have about $1.9tn of assets benchmarked against it, the index provider declined to say how much followed its frontier equivalent. Moreover, frontier managers tend to have a lot of freedom to stray from the underlying benchmark.However, Charles Robertson, chief economist at RenCap, estimated that frontier market inflows triggered by any future demotion would be “double the size of likely outflows of passive EM funds”.“When it went up it wasn’t the right thing for the country,” said Mr Bell. “It was [approaching] 10 per cent of frontier, now it’s less than 0.1 per cent of the EM index so it is largely ignored. This means that foreign scrutiny of its companies has diminished because it is of little interest to people.”This is exacerbated by the fact that, even at the peak, only half a dozen Pakistani companies were ever in the EM index, whereas a much larger number would be included if it was back in the frontier universe, as smaller companies are eligible for the latter. MSCI’s Investable Market Index version of its Pakistan country index currently contains 25 stocks.“Part of our role is to help these countries develop and, by having international scrutiny at a company level, passing on international best practice, you do that,” said Mr Bell. “I think there should be a minimum threshold to come up [to EM]. Maybe it should be 0.5 per cent of the index, say.”Mr Salter agreed that frontier investors “may be able to look at the long tail of smaller companies that EM investors are not going to bother with”.More broadly, he argued that the issue called into question the future of the developing world indices. With mainland Chinese stocks now being steadily added to the mainstream EM indices, sucking investment from elsewhere as every other country’s weighting falls, Mr Salter said it was “conceivable that we will be talking about Asia ex-China” benchmarks in the future.Mr Robertson agreed, saying: “It does raise the question of what the right design should be for a frontier/EM index. The current EM Index has a two-thirds allocation to China, Taiwan, South Korea and India. The FM Index has a one-fifth allocation to Kuwait. The current FEM [Frontier Emerging Market] Index has a one quarter allocation to the Philippines. None are satisfactory to most investors seeking non-mainstream EM exposure,” he said.
18;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-25T19:42:26Z;No relief for EM equities as growth worries offset Fed boost;;Those hoping for a respite in the sell-off in emerging market stocks were left disappointed on Monday.The MSCI Emerging Market Index — a benchmark for developing country equities — fell for a second straight session, dropping 1.2 per cent to 1,046.49 as concerns over sputtering global economic growth continued to unsettle investors.Monday’s decline — which adds to a 0.9 per cent fall on Friday — threatens to drag the gauge back below its 50-day moving average, a key short-term momentum level often watched by traders. The last time the index fell below its 50-DMA, which sat at around 1,040 on Monday, was in early January.The flight from risk — which also drove a sharp rally in sovereign bonds — took hold on Friday after a run of surprisingly weak eurozone economic data and the inversion of a closely watched part of the Treasury yield curve triggered fears of a deepening slowdown.The sell-off reached Asia in full force on Monday, with mainland China’s CSI 300 tumbling 2.4 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng sliding 2.2 per cent.The two-day decline effectively wiped out the boost the Federal Reserve gave to the MSCI EM index last week when — in a more dovish than expected policy shift — it ruled out further rate hikes this year and announced plans to halt its balance sheet shrinkage by September.“The sell-off validates our scepticism that a dovish Fed will be sufficient for capital inflows into risky assets witnessed over the past few months to prove sustainable,” said Rabobank in a note to clients on Monday.“We believe this is especially so considering the outlook for the global economy is clouded by uncertainties caused by trade tensions, Brexit and prevailing vulnerabilities in various emerging markets.”Adding to the macroeconomic headwinds are country specific issues — including fresh economic turmoil in Turkey and political developments in Brazil that threaten to derail the new president’s reform agenda.EM currencies were steadier on Monday however amid a broader dollar retreat. The JPMorgan Emerging Market Currency Index, having tumbled 1.7 per cent for its biggest one-day decline since last August on Friday, was 0.7 per cent higher.
19;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-20T18:08:17Z;Hong Kong regulator freezes stock that romped more than 5000%;Huge rise in share price of China Ding Yi Feng was enough to rank it in MSCI index;Hong Kong’s top financial regulator has sounded an alarm over China Ding Yi Feng, a locally-listed company which saw its share price rocket high enough to earn it inclusion in a key emerging market benchmark tracked by $1.9tn of funds.On Wednesday the Securities and Futures Commission issued notices to nine local brokers, banning them from dealing in shares of Ding Yi Feng, a Shenzhen-based group controlled by a “master sinologist” and former vice-mayor of a Chinese city. The SFC said the freeze – the most wide-ranging order over brokerage accounts in the regulator’s history – related to “suspected market manipulation” in the shares from the middle of last year.The company was suspended from trading earlier this month and said in a statement this week that its offices had been raided by the regulator. Calls to the company’s office went unanswered.“The regulator seems to be growing quite stringent on these small-cap stocks now,” said Ben Kwong, a director at regional brokerage KGI Securities. “But it’s still debatable whether this has been enough to safeguard investors.”The company, which has lost money in seven of the last eight years, has become a poster child for the erratic and often hard-to-explain ascents and dives in obscure securities in Hong Kong. Until its suspension, Ding Yi Feng had the best three-year return of the 1136 companies on the MSCI Emerging Markets index, up more than 5,760 per cent to a capitalisation of almost HK$29bn ($3.6bn).The company was added to MSCI’s index in 2018, meaning investors tracking the benchmark had no choice but to buy it. BlackRock, for example, held 2.29 per cent of the stock, according to the latest listing of shareholders from Bloomberg. An MSCI spokesperson said that the index provider has a “methodological approach to inclusion” which takes into account a stock’s market value, free float and liquidity.The SFC said its probe into Ding Yi Feng was focused on whether a false market had been created in the trading of its shares in both Hong Kong and in mainland China, where investors have access to some Hong Kong stocks. The regulator noted that the share price was “irrationally high.”The company’s net profit for the six months ending in June last year was just over HK$6m, on revenues of HK$36m.The accusations from the SFC come as it unleashes a number of investigations into unusual share price movements on the market. Some brokers have questioned if new probes and tougher standards for initial public offerings will solve the problem.Ding Yi Feng is a close-ended investment fund that listed in Hong Kong under another name in 2002. The company was a penny stock for most of its existence until China-born Sui Guangyi bought a controlling stake in 2015.The company’s website said Mr Sui was a “traditional sinology master with profound knowledge and great and influential virtue.” It also noted that he was once the vice mayor of a city in Jilin province in China’s north-east, and that his personal mission was consistent with that of China’s Communist party.With reporting by Nikou Asgari in London
20;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-18T19:47:21Z;Saudi Arabia takes first step into foreign equity benchmarks;Admission into FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones comes ahead of MSCI inclusion in June;Saudi Arabia’s $536bn stock market took its first step into the world’s main equity benchmarks on Monday when it was admitted into indices run by FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones.The moves will be added to in June, when Saudi stocks will be added to the widely followed MSCI Emerging Markets index, which MSCI says is tracked by $1.9tn of assets.Saudi Arabia’s stock market, known as the Tadawul, is projected to be the eighth-largest bourse in the MSCI EM index by September, when it is fully included, with a weight of 2.7 per cent, according to Renaissance Capital. That is greater than Mexico, Indonesia and Poland.The entry of many of Saudi Arabia’s largest companies into the world’s most influential EM equity indices comes only months after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s consulate in Istanbul caused an international outcry.A pick-up in foreign interest on the back of the inclusions, which were decided last year, has so far failed to materalise. Investors outside the Gulf owned just 5.1 per cent of the market as of last week, only a little above the 4.7 per cent they had before plans to include Saudi Arabia in global benchmarks were announced.“The feedback we get from investors so far is that they are not that excited about it,” said Daniel Salter, head of emerging market equity strategy at RenCap, who pointed out that the Tadawul is relatively expensive, trading on a multiple of 15.1 times forward earnings, compared with an EM-wide average of 12.Figures collated by Copley Fund Research, a consultancy that analyses 180 EM equity funds with combined assets of $350bn, suggests that Saudi stocks accounted for just 0.11 per cent of their portfolios at the end of last year, suggesting no great enthusiasm to get ahead of their inclusion in the indices. Instead government-related entities own almost 41 per cent of the Saudi market.Khalid Al Hussan, the chief executive of Tadawul, said that “inclusion into these pre-eminent indices is a testament to growing investor confidence in the Saudi market and reflects the successful implementation of far-ranging capital market reforms”.Its inclusion comes as the Tadawul has risen 11 per cent so far this year, building on last year’s 8 per cent gain. Mr Salter cautioned that the outlook might dim if oil prices flatlined and US interest rates failed to rise further.Tighter US monetary policy, transmitted to Saudi via the currency peg it has with the dollar, has helped improve margins for the large financial sector, headed by Al Rajhi Bank and National Commercial Bank. Together with materials, the two sectors account for 79 per cent of the MSCI Tadawul 30 index, leaving it highly concentrated.No foreign institution is allowed to hold more than 1 per cent of Sabic, the largest stock in the materials sector. For most equities the ownership limit is 10 per cent per institution and 49 per cent for foreign investors as a whole, except for some stocks based in Mecca, where it is zero.Some investors are upbeat about the prospects for the market, however.“It’s a country with a proper [sized] population, it has the oil background and it is going through fairly dramatic reform,” said Oliver Bell, whose T Rowe Price Middle East & Africa Fund has a 25 per cent weighting to Saudi Arabia.“It’s probably a bit under-appreciated because it’s been a bit of a black box of a country, but it’s tangible the change that is going on with Saudisation [replacing foreign workers with Saudis] the treatment and inclusion of women into the workforce.”
21;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-15T13:34:33Z;MSCI/China A-shares: weighty matters;In the near term, MSCI’s emerging markets index will become a lot riskier  ;Overseas investors love China. Shares are up 21 per cent this year. Foreign net inflows this year into mainland-listed A shares, at $22bn, are already half 2018’s total. One reason is MSCI’s decision to increase the weighting of Chinese equities in its emerging markets index at a faster than expected pace. The expansion is expected to draw at least $8bn into Chinese equities this year. Not everyone believes the index group has made the right call. It is too early for such an abrupt reweighting of an index tracked by funds worth $1.9tn. Not enough has changed since MSCI rejected the inclusion of A-shares on three previous occasions, most recently in 2017. MSCI has previously faulted China on several important measures. Last year it highlighted inadequate corporate governance standards, including scant protections for shareholders and the need to strengthen board independence. Beijing’s ability to restrict trading during a crash, in some cases for months, was also a concern.There have been some moves in the right direction. These include efforts to ease foreign investment restrictions, a decline in the number of suspended stocks and a doubling of limits for investments in overseas funds. Some investors may consider the reweighting as positive in the long term. China A-shares are currently heavily skewed towards financials. This should correct as the MSCI completes the inclusion of more shares. That will give investors access to a broader portfolio, including fast-growing media and healthcare as well as some mid-cap stocks. Volatility should also come down as a disproportionate cohort of retail investors is diluted by institutional investors. These incomers will bring with them pressure for better corporate governance.In the near term, MSCI’s emerging markets index will become a lot riskier.

22;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MSCI denies politics swayed inclusion of more Chinese shares;Index provider insists move to increase weighting of equities came down to investors;The head of MSCI has said there was “zero politics” in the index provider’s controversial decision to add more Chinese shares to an influential equity benchmark tracked by investments worth $1.9tn.By the end of the year Chinese shares will have a weighting of 3.3 per cent in MSCI’s flagship emerging market index, up from less than 1 per cent now and none before last year when they were included for the first time.The move by New York-based MSCI last month to hand Chinese equities a greater weighting, and on a faster timetable than had been planned, drew criticism from some investors concerned over the standards of corporate governance in China and the frequency with which shares are suspended from trading.It was also reported that MSCI’s decision was driven by concern that Beijing would stymie its effort to expand in China, the world’s second-largest economy and one that is opening its capital markets to foreign investors.Henry Fernandez, who as chief executive and chairman of MSCI has led the $16bn company for more than two decades, insisted there was “zero politics” behind the decision that followed a consultation period with investors.“It’s based on the analysis we come up with, a consultation . . . we take the information and create a thesis and talk to hundreds of investors,” Mr Fernandez said. “It’s impossible to be subject to political influence. The indices are a means to an end. The indices reflect the accessibility and demands of investors around the world.”Chinese stocks have been among the most volatile in recent months, as speculation on whether Beijing and Washington will end their trade feud drives sentiment. China’s CSI 300 index, its benchmark index, tumbled 25 per cent last year but has powered back in 2019 with a 23 per cent gain.The rebound in Chinese equities, say analysts, has been given extra fuel by MSCI’s decision which also underlined the influence wielded by a handful of major index providers over capital flows in a world in which more money tracks indices.Analysts have estimated that lifting the weighting in the EM index could send as much as $125bn into Chinese stocks.In a sign of the opportunities China offers MSCI, earlier this week it struck an agreement with the Hong Kong stock exchange to launch futures on the portion of Chinese shares included in its EM index.It already has similar contracts with Germany's Eurex and SGX of Singapore, which help international investors to hedge risk from their exposure to Chinese equities.Mr Fernandez also said the futures could be licensed to exchanges in China, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, as the market opens up.“We would anticipate this being available to other index businesses,” he said. “China is such a huge market.”
23;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-14T21:00:27Z;Chinese stock rebound has fingerprints of retail investors;The role of overseas institutions is dwarfed by that of local shareholders;The world’s most powerful asset managers may be establishing a foothold in Chinese stocks, but retail investors still hold considerable sway over this year’s best-performing major equity market.University students, migrant workers and elderly patrons of trading halls make up the retail investors that were at the heart of last year’s rout and have been central to 2019’s rebound. They accounted for almost all of the 1m new trading accounts opened in January, according to China Securities Depository and Clearing.“[China’s] retail investors are more momentum driven, and that’s why you have seen such strong market moves,” said Alexious Lee, head of China capital access at the investment group CLSA.This year’s gains for the benchmark index in Shenzhen, home to far more of the mid and small-cap companies that institutional investors typically shun, underlines the role of retail investors in this year’s rally. It has jumped 28 per cent this year compared to a 20 per cent advance for the bourse in Shanghai, where larger stocks dominate.It is a point emphasised by the giddy rise in Shenzhen’s tech-heavy ChiNext, a small-cap board modelled on Wall Street’s Nasdaq, that has done even better, jumping 30 per cent. Part of this outsized rise is down to smaller stocks having tumbled further during last year’s rout.Retail investors who were previously locked into all these pledged shares or trading-suspended stocks were unleashedThe first rise in a year in margin lending, which helped to drive the stock market surge of 2015, is another sign retail investors are “back into active mode”, according to Mr Lee. Such momentum is one reason CLSA has tipped the Shanghai Composite index to break above the 3,500 points level before the end of June.While last month’s decision by the index provider MSCI to increase the weighting of Chinese stocks in its widely-followed Emerging Markets index — a trend many expect to continue as part of Beijing’s attempt to open up its capital markets — analysts say retail investors will still wield considerable clout.Shanghai Stock Exchange figures for 2017 show that retail investors accounted for the vast majority of trading accounts and 82 per cent of turnover, and are estimated by Aberdeen Standard Investments to hold more than a third of the market’s free float.Their influence has also been sharpened after Chinese authorities freed up about Rmb2tn (about $297bn) worth of shares. They had been ensnared last year after trading in up to 265 stocks was halted as companies sought to prevent large-scale selling of shares pledged to banks as collateral for loans — a common practice in China. CLSA estimates the government deployed more than Rmb250bn to boost the liquidity in these listed companies.“Retail investors who were previously locked into all these pledged shares or trading-suspended stocks were unleashed”, Mr Lee said.As well as volatility, international investors who follow MSCI into China will have to accept valuations that would raise eyebrows elsewhere. Naura Tech Group, a mid-cap stock on MSCI’s pro forma inclusion list, for example carries a price/earnings ratio of 153, about eight and a half times that of the S&P 500 index.Moreover, local fund managers point out that the interest of retail Chinese investors do not line up neatly with those from offshore.“Chinese investors have been grabbing brokerage stocks recently, as these have good elasticity but they will never be favoured by foreign investors,” said Daniel Li, chief investment officer for equities at Gaoteng Global Asset Management.But Thomas Gatley, China corporate analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, said Beijing was serious about making shares listed in mainland China a “plausible, reliable citizen of the global financial market”, in large part to bring home the tech unicorns that now prefer listing in New York and Hong Kong.Beijing has begun to pin those hopes on Shanghai’s nascent Technology & Innovation Board, announced by President Xi Jinping in November. The board, slated to finish trading systems testing in May, would be the first in China to allow listings without prior regulatory approval. It would also require investors to have two years of trading experience and an account balance of at least Rmb500,000.“This eliminates the majority of individual investors, which in our view is the right approach as it will strike the right balance between market liquidity and potential risk,” analysts at HSBC Qianhai Securities noted.But as of last week Shanghai’s exchange said it had yet to receive any applications from companies hoping to file for an initial public offering on the new board. And many involved in China tech listings privately express doubts that top start-ups would want to raise capital in China’s uncertain regulatory environment.“It’s going to be very challenging for people to feel as comfortable about [the new board] as they do about the Nasdaq or the Hong Kong exchange,” said one lawyer with experience overseeing China tech listings abroad.Additional reporting by Yizhen Jia in Shanghai and Louise Lucas in Hong KongFollow @KangHexin on Twitter
24;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-11T15:20:55Z;Ryanair and KT face stock turmoil over removal from indices;MSCI considers ejecting low-cost airline and telecoms group in shake-up;Low-cost airline Ryanair and KT Corp, South Korea’s largest telecoms company, could be set for a bout of unusual turmoil in their stock prices, as MSCI considers removing them from global equity indices because of distortions caused by their share structures.Both companies are candidates for ejection because of the way the New York-based indexing company treats depository receipts — instruments issued by a company and traded overseas as a proxy for its shares.MSCI is concerned about valuation gaps between depository receipts and the companies’ primary listings, which could make life difficult for investors trying to track indices. In a recent consultation paper, MSCI picked out KT, which has a market capitalisation of $6.4bn, and Ireland’s Ryanair, as companies that would be affected by a shake-up.Ryanair, for example, has depositary receipts that trade on Nasdaq, as well as listings in London and Dublin. But the US shares typically trade at a premium to their European counterparts.Pavlo Taranenko, executive director in MSCI’s index research team, said there was often little opportunity for investors to buy Ryanair’s European shares, because of scarcity in the market. The company also banned non-EU investors from buying its European shares 17 years ago, so they had no option but to buy the more expensive US depository receipts.Mr Taranenko noted that MSCI used Ryanair’s European shares in the MSCI Ireland index, and related composites such as MSCI Europe and MSCI World. Non-EU investors had reported that these indices did not reflect the prices they were seeing.The change could prompt investment funds that track these indices to sell the stock, but it is unlikely to deter many active investors. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary told the Financial Times last week that if the carrier were to be removed from MSCI’s indices, he “wouldn’t be worried about it”.KT Corp was not immediately available for comment.The episode highlights the power of index providers to shape investment flows, as more money is channelled toward passive fund managers tracking indices rather than trying to pick individual winners. Globally, the amount held in exchange traded funds, for example, has soared to $4.6tn from less than $100bn at the turn of the century, according to consultancy ETFGI.Shares in IAG, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, fell 7 per cent in two days last month when it emerged that the stock would be tossed out of several MSCI indices. IAG had fallen foul of an MSCI rule known as “foreign room”, which sets minimum thresholds for the amount of shares still available to foreign investors.MSCI’s consultation lasts until the end of this week and the index provider intends to announce its decision by the end of the month. The review of Ryanair’s inclusion had nothing to do with potential caps on ownership because of Brexit, Mr Taranenko said.
25;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-11T02:19:25Z;HKEX and MSCI to launch futures for China stock market;Would be first channel for investors using stock connect links to hedge A-share risk;Hong Kong’s stock exchange and MSCI have agreed to launch futures contracts on the A-share portion of the global index provider’s flagship Emerging Markets index, laying the groundwork to allow international investors to hedge risk from their exposure to Chinese equities.The announcement comes just over a week after MSCI decided to fast-track an increase in China’s weighting in its EM index — an influential benchmark tracked by $1.9tn of funds — bringing forward to November the move originally planned for May next year.“This new agreement with MSCI will facilitate the development of a key risk management tool for international investors who need to manage their A-share equity exposure,” said Charles Li, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing chief executive, in a statement on Monday.The MSCI China A Index, for which futures are to be made available, will comprise 421 large and mid-cap stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen and accessible via the stock connect programmes between the two mainland exchanges and the Hong Kong exchange. The Hong Kong exchange said the China A Index would represent the A-share portion of the MSCI EM index.The futures contracts announced by HKEX on Monday would represent the first channel for investors using the stock connect links to hedge risk in the A-share market.They are set to be introduced, subject to regulatory approval, in November, when MSCI is slated to complete the inclusion of 168 mid-cap A share stocks in its EM index.Thomas Gatley, China corporate analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics, a Beijing-based macroeconomic research group, said the move would address one of the few remaining issues for MSCI, which noted the absence of a broader use of equities futures contracts in its inclusion announcement earlier this month.“If there is a freely available liquid futures contract then that really helps,” Mr Gatley said.As a result of the impending inclusion, China’s weighting in MSCI’s flagship emerging markets index will rise to 3.3 per cent by November from 0.71 per cent now. Analysts estimate that the reweighting could result in as much as $125bn of offshore money flowing into mainland Chinese stock markets.Although there are stock index futures available domestically in China for major benchmarks such as the CSI 300 index of large-cap Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks, international access to these is limited to approved foreign institutional investors.But while the new futures contracts would provide international investors with a tool to mitigate risk from exposure to A shares via MSCI’s EM index, they would stop short of allowing investors to take long or short positions on an individual stock.HKEX said it would provide further details on the contracts and announce their launch date once the latter was determined.

Consumer staples, real estate and materials were the lone sectors in the red. For the week, it is up 0.4 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8 per cent.With Friday’s gains, the S&P snapped a three-session losing streak — its longest of 2019 — that trimmed its February gain to 3 per cent. However, the benchmark index was up 11 per cent over the first two months of the year, its best annual start since 1991, amid growing hopes for a US-China trade deal and reduced expectations for interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve.US data on Friday showed personal spending in December fell more than expected.

27;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-03-01T10:57:54Z;MSCI hands Chinese stocks bigger role in global markets;The decision by the index provider could send up to $125bn into the Chinese market;The world’s leading equity index provider, MSCI, took its biggest step yet to integrate China’s domestic stock markets with international capital on Friday in a move that could see an estimated $125bn flowing into the country’s equities this year.China’s weighting in MSCI’s flagship emerging markets index, an influential benchmark tracked by $1.9tn of funds, will rise to 3.3 per cent by November from the current level of 0.71 per cent, the New York-based company said.Funds which measure their performance against the index are obliged to buy the underlying stocks, triggering inflows to China. The decision helped drive Chinese stocks higher, with the benchmark CSI 300 rising 2.2 per cent. That takes its gain for the year to 25 per cent, trouncing the performance of every other stock market.The move underscores how China’s government — which aggressively pushed for the increased weighting — has opened its capital markets in spite of growing political and trade tension with the US. Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, will meet Donald Trump, the US president, in April in an attempt to resolve the current trade war.“At the end of the day, [MSCI A-share inclusion] is driven by the [Chinese] authorities,” said Remy Briand, chairman of the MSCI index policy committee. “They have been very active.”Foreign funds buying has resuscitated the fortunes of the A-share marketsChinese stocks listed offshore in Hong Kong and the US already feature broadly in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index with a 31 per cent weighting. The importance of MSCI’s latest decision is that it creates a stronger link between the domestic Chinese stock market — the second largest in the world — and international capital.By November this year, the total weighting in the MSCI index for offshore and domestic Chinese stocks will be about 34.3 per cent — by far the largest country weight.“Foreign funds buying has resuscitated the fortunes of the A-share markets,” said John Lin, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, an asset management company.An MSCI executive said that about $80bn in offshore money is expected to flow into A-shares this year as a result of the increased China weighting in the MSCI index.This corresponds with a forecast made by Fang Xinghai, deputy head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, that inflows of foreign capital into the stock market would total about Rmb600bn ($89bn) this year. This was double the net inflow of Rmb300bn last year, he said.However, analysts said that up to $125bn of offshore money could flow into domestic Chinese stocks because of the reweighting.François Perrin of East Capital in Hong Kong said he expects the inflows to continue in the first half of this year. “The pace of inflows has accelerated significantly to reach US$20bn year-to-date and we expect the momentum to continue [in the first half of this year],” he said.The MSCI decision will mean the inclusion of more Chinese A-shares in the MSCI EM index, so that by November a total of 253 Chinese large-capitalisation stocks and 168 mid-capitalisation stocks will feature. Among these will be 27 stocks from ChiNext, the Chinese equivalent of the US’s Nasdaq market.“The largest ChiNext names will join the index and offer an opportunity to get exposure to the most dynamic and innovative side of the Chinese economy,” said Mr Perrin.Nevertheless, the addition of so many Chinese stocks that are often troubled by poor governance and insufficient transparency could prove a headache to some international investors.“Active managers have a difficult job to do. They have to analyse a much larger universe of stocks,” Mr Briand said. “But if you do your homework you can add value,” he added.MSCI is ultimately aiming for “full inclusion” of A-shares into the MSCI EM index, Mr Briand said, at which point the total weight of offshore and domestic stocks in the index may reach about 40 per cent.But the speed towards this goal will depend on the willingness of Chinese authorities to reform. For one thing, MSCI would like to see the settlement period for stocks lengthened to “T+2”, or two days after a transaction is agreed, up from the present same day or the following day. In addition, MSCI would like to see a broader use of equities futures contracts, allowing offshore funds to hedge their risks in the market.The increased weighting for domestic Chinese stocks in the index is set to happen in three steps in May, August and November this year, MSCI said. This timetable represented an acceleration of proposals made during consultations with clients over the past few months, MSCI executives said.“The timing of the whole review process by MSCI and the pending announcement is ahead of our initial expectation,” said William Yuen, investment director at Invesco. “There is a fair probability that we can see full inclusion within five to 10 years, as China continues to adopt [a] more free-market mechanism and approach.”
28;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-02-28T22:17:01Z;MSCI speeds up boost to China’s weighting in emerging markets index;Analysts say new mix could draw up to $125bn into A-shares this year;MSCI has accelerated an increase in China’s weighting in its flagship emerging markets index, an influential benchmark tracked by $1.9tn of funds, reflecting how Beijing has opened up its markets to foreign investors in recent years.The index provider had originally planned to increase the weighting of A-shares in the MSCI EM index to 3.3 per cent by May next year but it said it is fast-tracking the process so that this weighting will be in place by November this year.“Some investors did not want to wait so long for mid-cap inclusion so we decided to bring it forward,” said Chin Ping Chia, head of Asia-Pacific research at MSCI.MSCI included Chinese A-shares — stocks in China-based companies that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges — in its EM index last year, but with a modest inclusion factor of 5 per cent of the float-adjusted market capitalisation that was added in two stages in May and August.On Thursday, MSCI lifted the inclusion factor to 20 per cent, which will in practice triple the Chinese weighting in its EM index from 0.71 per cent to 2.82 per cent by August this year. The later addition of more mid-sized Chinese companies will lift the weighting to more than 3 per cent by May 2020.“The successful implementation of the initial 5 per cent inclusion of China A-shares has been a positive experience for international institutional investors and has fostered their appetite to increase further their exposure to the mainland China equity market,” Remy Briand, chairman of the MSCI Index Policy Committee, said in a statement.This is going to increase the buyer pool investing in China, and that is very bullish for the countryAnalysts believe a larger MSCI weighting could help to generate up to $125bn of inflows into Chinese A-shares this year. “This is going to increase the buyer pool investing in China, and that is very bullish for the country,” said Andrew Slimmon of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, who has a large exposure to China.China’s stock market has already been on a tear this year, with the CSI 300 index of stocks listed in Shenzhen and Shanghai climbing nearly 22 per cent and clawing back much of last year’s losses. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which has long been open to foreign investors, is up 10.8 per cent, after losing 9 per cent of its value last year. The gradual weighting increase is likely to pour more fuel on the rally.MSCI started consulting last September with asset managers on increasing the weighting in China’s A-shares, and the results — despite how under-developed and volatile Chinese equities still are — indicate that international investors are keen to see the country become a bigger part of the global ecosystem.“This is a substantial step in so far as it signals that China’s capital markets are becoming integrated into the world’s capital markets,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It recognises how far China has come in terms of market opening measures, accessibility and transparency, and it will cause international fund managers to put more money into the country.”Alongside the move by MSCI, Bloomberg is also giving China a more central role in its indices. In April, Bloomberg will add Chinese renminbi-denominated government and policy bank bonds to its Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, an arrangement first announced in March of last year.MSCI and Bloomberg’s decisions come as China has taken multiple steps to open its capital markets in recent years. In 2014, for example, the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect was launched to allow foreign investors to buy mainland stocks via Hong Kong.“There’s been a pretty dramatic shift in both the circumstances and mindset in roughly the last three to four years,” pointed out Baer Pettit, president of MSCI. “Western managers have realised that this China thing is real.”
29;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-02-27T21:00:24Z;Buoyant Chinese stock market awaits MSCI decision;Index provider is expected to increase China weighting despite governance worries;The end of a month in which Chinese shares have trounced every other market may appear the perfect backdrop for MSCI, one of a trio of index providers that have an outsized role in shaping the global flow of money.The New York-based company is set to announce later this week that the weighting of Chinese shares in its Emerging Markets index, which is the benchmark for about $1.9tn of funds, will more than triple by August, according to people familiar with the matter.A big jump in the weighting would underline how Beijing is opening its capital markets to foreigners despite tensions with Washington, coming less than a year after MSCI admitted Chinese A-shares, or those listed on exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, to its index for the first time. It would also show how concern over the volatility of Chinese stocks and corporate governance have not been an impediment, either.“Lest we forget, despite China being the world’s second-largest economy, it’s still emerging, and the stock market is immature versus developed markets [and] there’s massive volatility,” says Ashley Dale of Harvest Global Investments.Analysts estimate that the plan, which is expected to push the weighting of A-shares in the index from 0.71 per cent to 2.82 per cent, as well as other initiatives to unlock China’s markets, could draw in about $100bn of foreign investment to the country’s mainland bourses this year. The CSI 300, China’s benchmark equity index, has surged 22 per cent this year after plunging by a quarter in 2018.MSCI, whose own shares have doubled since the start of 2017 thanks to the boom in cheaper, passive investing, started consulting last September with asset managers on the increase in A-shares.Alongside the move by MSCI, China has taken other steps in recent years to open its capital markets. In 2014, for example, the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect was launched to allow foreign investors to buy mainland stocks via Hong Kong.“MSCI inclusion in 2018 marked a breakthrough year for foreign inflows, and we expect 2019 to be another record year of A-share globalisation,” says Steven Yang, a strategist at CLSA.He estimates that stocks on the Chinese mainland will see between $83bn and $108bn of foreign inflows this year, when combined with other measures, including allowing more foreign funds to be distributed in mainland China, and the prospect that other index providers such as FTSE and S&P include A-shares. That is up from $45bn in 2018.“Overseas investors, rather than domestic fund managers, will become the most important players,” Mr Yang adds. Foreign fund managers have sharply increased their exposure to A-shares since they were first included in the MSCI EM index in May last year.“With the MSCI weighting set to get bigger, those managers who are underweight A-shares will need to add to their position,” says Eric Bian, a fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Until now, foreign investors have concentrated on blue-chip names, but as the index weighting gets larger, the hunting ground will become bigger.”But even as those outside China have stepped up their buying, foreign ownership of the overall market value of A-shares stands at just 3.5 per cent, according to BNP Paribas. This compares with 20 per cent for stocks in India, about 30 per cent in Japan and Korea, and nearly 40 per cent in Taiwan.MSCI’s decision to beef up China’s weighting comes despite it conceding that the number of trading suspensions among China A-shares was “by far the highest in the world”. This was particularly prevalent during a plunge in Chinese shares in 2015, when more than 1,400 companies, about half of the total, suspended their shares.In an effort to assuage concerns, last year MSCI created a rule that prevented companies whose shares had been suspended for at least 50 consecutive days from being included.But real fears over corporate governance remain.According to MSCI’s own ranking last year of environmental, social and governance standards, the A-shares that were included in its EM benchmark fared far worse than their counterparts in other emerging markets.“For now there aren’t many companies that meet the standards we would expect before we commit our clients’ money,” says Nicholas Yeo, head of China equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “We place heavy emphasis on fundamentals such as earnings and valuations and take account of good governance.”Mr Yeo hopes that, ultimately, the opening of China’s capital markets through decisions like MSCI’s will “expose the management of companies to global standards of accountability and best practice.”In the meantime, many investors are likely to have to increase their exposure to A-shares – and hope that last year’s volatility becomes a distant memory.

Thanks to the cap, the number of non-EU shareholders in IAG had hit the maximum permitted amount and thus there were insufficient shares available to other non-EU investors.Late on Tuesday FTSE Russell, a rival compiler, suggested IAG’s cap might affect the airline’s status in its global equities indices, as part of its review in March. There will be no impact on IAG’s eligibility or weighting in UK indices, the company added.IAG’s shares dropped 4.3 per cent to 617p.Alex Paterson, analyst at Investec, said the change was “unhelpful” to IAG because it decreased demand for its stock among EU investors ahead of Brexit, making them sellers “at this moment when you want them to become buyers”. He called it “a real kick in the teeth” for the company.MSCI confirmed on Tuesday that IAG, which has a market capitalisation of £12bn, would be deleted from its Global Investable Market indices, effective at the end of February 28. It will also apply to MSCI Spain Indexes and composite indices that include Spain, it said. IAG — a Spanish company headquartered in the UK — declined to comment.The change will prompt passive investment funds tracking MSCI indices containing IAG to trade out of the stock, said Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, but is unlikely to deter active investors.Bernstein has estimated that passive funds hold 45m IAG shares based on MSCI membership, which represent 2.3 per cent of IAG’s 2bn shares.MSCI said index membership was based on “a set of quantitative criteria” that included the company’s size and its free float of shares, and that the removal did not imply any subjective judgment of a company.Under IAG’s cap, any non-EU investor who tries to buy IAG shares will have the shares’ voting rights removed and will be required to sell them within 10 days. The company has said: “There can be no assurance as to when, or if, the permitted maximum will be removed.”

Shares in UK-headquartered, Spanish registered IAG trade both in London and Madrid.The group’s shares will be deleted from MSCI’s Spanish index effective March 1, MSCI said late on Monday evening.The index provider’s decision came after IAG said earlier this month it had fixed the maximum level of share ownership by non-EU persons at 47.5 per cent, its current level, ahead of Britain’s exit from the bloc in late March.IAG shares in London fell 3.8 per cent on Tuesday, while their Spanish counterparts dropped 3.2 per cent.MSCI was not immediately able to provide further details on the decision.
32;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Xiaomi among winners as MSCI sticks with dual-class shares;One of biggest index providers adds dual-class shares for first time since 18-month review;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi and Tencent Music will be included in stock benchmarks this month, after MSCI parted with rivals by deciding to keep companies with controversial dual-class share structures in its widely-followed indices.Such structures typically hand a company’s founders far more power than other shareholders and have drawn scrutiny in recent years. That prompted New York-based MSCI to conduct an 18-month review of whether such lopsided companies should be included in indices whose power to direct capital flows has strengthened in the last decade.Dual-class structures have proved popular with US and Chinese entrepreneurs, as the unequal split in voting power allows founders to keep a tight grip on the strategic direction of companies when they go public. The additions of Xiaomi and Tencent Music are among the first with dual-class structures that MSCI has added to its benchmarks since finishing its review late last year.The debate over whether unequal voting power is appropriate among shareholders of publicly listed companies intensified last year after the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing and Singapore’s SGX, eager to lure Chinese tech companies to their bourses, said they would allow businesses with dual-class shares to list for the first time. Tensions were inflamed further after Snap, owner of the messaging service Snapchat, became the first company in the US to sell shares without voting rights.This is a particularly worrying development in Hong Kong since the overwhelming majority of IPO issuers there are from the People’s Republic of China, and [are] effectively emerging market companies“Our voice is diluted as a result of the structure and there are pernicious issues around the asymmetry of returns, in that you could have substantial economic interest in a company but only a small voting interest,” said David Smith, head of corporate governance for Asia-Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “So we’re concerned about putting up dollars but being unable to vote for our clients.”MSCI, a $15bn New York-based company that has been a big winner from the growth of passive investing, temporarily stopped companies with dual-share structures from joining its indices when it began its review, which consulted banks and asset managers, in the middle of 2017.In total, nine companies with dual-class shares will be added by MSCI. Seven of the companies joining the All Country World index are Chinese, while two are based in the US. The decision by MSCI comes after rival index providers FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones moved to exclude some companies with multiple share classes from their indices. MSCI has said it would create new indices that focus on voting rights within its criteria for stock inclusion, to give investors choice.“Dual-class shares or weighted voting rights place a disproportionate amount of decision power in the hands of controlling shareholders, at the expense of public investors,” said Philippe Espinasse, a former head of equity capital markets at Nomura. “This is a particularly worrying development in Hong Kong since the overwhelming majority of IPO issuers there are from the People’s Republic of China, and [are] effectively emerging market companies.”The February inclusion comes just as Chinese equities rebound, following a torrid 2018 in which the CSI 300 benchmark was the worst-performing share index globally.Foreign investors poured a record $9bn into Chinese equities in January, the largest single-month inflow on record, according to stock exchange data. The shift in sentiment follows dovish comments from policymakers at the US Federal Reserve, which has given a big boost to emerging markets.
33;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2019-01-07T01:00:00Z;Progress slows on boardroom gender diversity;;Women will not fill 30 per cent of board seats until 2029, two years later than first predicted, according to research.MSCI, the index provider, said global progress in boosting gender diversity at the highest level has been slower than expected despite the issue benefiting from various initiatives by business leaders and policymakers.“There seem to be lingering attitudes, conscious or unconscious, that make this hard,” said Meggin Thwing Eastman, one of the report’s authors.Over the past year more large investors have pushed for a greater mix in investee companies, partly because of the recognition that diversity can improve financial performance.Last year a group including BlackRock and the Government Pension Investment Fund in Japan signed up to an initiative pushing for 30 per cent of women on FTSE 350 boards and 30 per cent of women in senior management at FTSE 100 companies by 2020.This was co-ordinated by the 30% Club, a campaign group pressing for greater participation of women in top corporate jobs.Thirty per cent is a “tipping point” beyond which the presence of women moves past tokenism, said Ms Thwing Eastman, who is head of impact and screening research for MSCI ESG Research.MSCI said the slow pace of change had “galvanised initiatives to accelerate progress” but warned that the goals they set could be challenging “in light of progress to date”.The group found that women held 17.9 per cent of directorships at companies on its ACWI Index, which covers almost 3,000 groups worldwide, at the end of October. This is up from 17.3 per cent in 2017 but well short of the 19.4 per cent predicted by MSCI in 2015.More than a fifth of the 2,694 companies in the index had all-male boards, most of which were based in east Asian countries.Norway, France and Italy, which have all implemented female quotas, were the only large countries whose indexed companies all had at least three women on the board.
34;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-11-26T05:00:00Z;Race to cut costs poised to disrupt index industry;;The index industry is in the pink. The rise and rise of passive investing, and particularly of exchange traded funds, has delivered double-digit revenue growth — and the forecast is for more of the same.The industry’s global revenue climbed by a fifth to $2.7bn in 2017, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting, part of the TP ICAP group. Profit margins are also robust, exceeding 65 per cent for the top participants, company filings show.The economies of scale in the index business are clearly attractive.Asset managers are a little pale in comparison. BlackRock, for example, reported revenue growth of 12 per cent in 2017 and an operating margin of 42 per cent.The big three index providers, S&P Dow Jones, MSCI and FTSE Russell, have increased their dominance in recent years. Their combined market share has risen to nearly 80 per cent from about two-thirds in 2012, according to Burton-Taylor.Competition has sprung up but so far has had little discernible effect on the fees the big three charge investors and asset managers to use their indices, either to track or as benchmarks.There are signs of a revolt, though, as fund managers seek cheaper options, faced with pressure to cut the cost of investing for their customers. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund manager, was a trendsetter when it ditched MSCI for 22 of its funds in 2012, engaging the services of the Center for Research in Security Prices and FTSE Russell instead.More recently, in September this year, State Street Global Advisors swapped out MSCI for German index firm Solactive for four of its ETFs, cutting in half expense ratios on the funds following the change (although the switch was also from smart beta indices to market cap-weighted ones). Solactive charges flat fees rather than a share of assets under management.In a more fundamental challenge to the index industry, fund managers are creating their own indices. Factor investing specialists such as WisdomTree were among the first to take this route and others have followed suit, including BlackRock, State Street, Invesco and Charles Schwab.Fidelity has taken the fight a step further by launching four self-indexed US mutual funds that carry zero charges. The fund group’s strategy is to undercut Vanguard, the leader in low-cost investing, rather than disrupt the index industry. Cutting out the licence fee to an index provider helps achieve that aim, though.Fidelity is a big enough brand name to persuade investors they don’t need the reassurance of an S&P or MSCI index behind the tracker funds they buy. It can also afford to absorb the costs of offering a loss-leader, possibly offset by cross-selling other products to investors in its zero fee funds.Other big groups have the potential to follow Fidelity’s lead. Smaller fund managers will have to work hard to counter such a challenge.The move to self-indexing raises governance issues and regulatory concerns. Transparency is essential, with investors able to check easily on the rationale behind an index, its construction and methodology. That will help to allay any suspicion that fund managers are simply data mining, where they keep backtesting an index strategy until it achieves the desired result.Self-indexing is a small part of what is still a fast expanding business. The number of indices on offer is fast heading to 4m, having risen 12 per cent over the year to June to 3.7m. Big growth areas are fixed-income indices, benchmarks that take account of environmental, social and governance factors, and smart beta indices that tilt towards factors such as value, momentum, and quality.Innovation is welcome, provided it benefits investors. Endless proliferation and confusing variation just complicates investment decisions.Current trends do not favour the chances of index rationalisation. Presenting an investment strategy as a low-cost rules-based package called an index is the easiest way to sell it for now. That plays into the hands of the index providers, who are outstripping asset managers in revenue growth and profitability. Self-indexing is a logical attempt to disrupt that trajectory, but what is to stop index houses playing the same game and launching funds themselves?With the lines between active and passive management increasingly blurred, the distinctions between asset managers and index providers may likewise break down.
35;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-11-14T14:02:06Z;Passive boom sees number of market indices hit 3.7m;Increasing use of benchmarks in ethical and fixed-income investing drives the growth;Indices measuring markets have ballooned in number by another 438,000 to more than 3.7m in the past year, as providers produce a blizzard of bond market, environment, social and governance benchmarks.Gauges designed by benchmark providers to measure everything from the performance of small Chinese companies and African debt derivatives to the music streaming industry or groups that adhere to Catholic values have been spurred by the rising popularity of passive investing.As a result, the number of indices globally climbed by 12 per cent from June 2017 to 3.73m this June, according to the second annual survey of the landscape by the Index Industry Association, a trade body set up by 14 of the biggest players in the benchmarking business, including MSCI, S&P Dow Jones indices and FTSE Russell.“Last year we were able to quantify the index landscape for the first time ever. Now that we have a baseline, it’s fascinating to see the amount of innovation coming out of fixed income where investors are looking for more fine-tuned benchmarks,” Rick Redding, the chief executive of the IIA, said in the report.While the number of stock market indices dipped 3 per cent to just over 3m in the 12 months to June 2018, as providers retired some smaller sector-focused indices, the bond benchmarking business continues to grow at a healthy clip — now accounting for about 16 per cent of the overall index universe.Fixed income is a key focus for many passive investment fund providers such as BlackRock and State Street, and a host of new entrants into the industry. While index and exchange traded funds have long been around and have become entrenched in the equity market, development of the passive bond fund ecosystem has lagged behind.Nonetheless, bond ETFs have attracted more than $100bn of investor money this year even as broader ETF inflows have slowed, according to Bloomberg data, leading some industry analysts to predict an inflection point for bond indexing.The fastest-growing corner of the indexing industry, however, are benchmarks that track and weight companies according to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.ESG has become one of the biggest trends in the global asset management industry, with an increasing number of institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments seeking to screen out or at least lessen their exposure to companies in more controversial fields, such as gun-making.The number of ESG indices swelled by 60 per cent in the year to June 2018, according to the IIA, with strong growth also coming in the “smart beta” and factor indices, that weight financial securities according to specific characteristics, such as the momentum of their earnings or the cheapness of their stock.“While these areas still represent a small portion of the total index landscape, investors are demanding more choices and as a result, providers are creating new indexes where they can offer more targeted exposure,” Mr Redding said.Critics say that indexing has run amok, with some arguing that index providers now de facto enjoy under-appreciated power over the fate of financial markets. Industry insiders scoff at this, arguing that providers take their cue from asset managers, but it has certainly become one of the best-performing pockets of the financial industry.MSCI, the purest index provider of the industry’s three biggest players, has seen its shares gain nearly 17 per cent this year, even as BlackRock, the biggest asset manager, has fallen 20 per cent.Since its financial crisis low in October 2008, MSCI’s stock has climbed 1,143 per cent, compared with the S&P 500’s 158 per cent gain over that period.Knowing what you buy and why is a must in 2018 / From Marie Owens Thomsen, Geneva, SwitzerlandIndex picking is just as hard as stock picking / From Elly Lawther, Limpsfield, Surrey, UK
36;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-10-30T22:49:31Z;MSCI decides against restricting stocks with unequal voting rights;;MSCI has decided against altering its benchmarks to exclude or adjust the weighting of companies with dual share classes that leave control in the hands of founders, bowing to the views of many big investors.The index provider will launch a new index series that will account for unequal voting structures in their weighting, but its existing suite of benchmarks will remain untouched, MSCI said in a statement on Tuesday — concluding an 18-month consultation on the controversial issue.“MSCI supports fully the one share one vote principle as we believe that having equal voting rights should be an important consideration in equity investing,” it said. “The one share one vote principle has also gathered overwhelming support from participants in the consultation. The treatment of unequal voting structures in equity benchmarks, however, has proven to be a polarizing question among international institutional investors.”While some investors have argued that big index providers like MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell should exclude or downgrade the benchmark weighting of companies that do not give shareholders equal control, many have argued that this should be a question left to markets and regulators.In a public letter released earlier this year, BlackRock vice-chair Barbara Novick said:“While the objectives of MSCI’s proposal are aligned with our view that ‘one vote for one share’ is the preferable structure for publicly traded companies, we believe that an alternative approach would be more effective in achieving this objective while avoiding the significant changes to existing MSCI broad market indexes that would be required to effectuate MSCI’s proposed solution . . . We believe that regulators in conjunction with listing exchanges should be the arbiters of corporate governance standards for publicly listed companies.”

It’s not a question you hear every day, but it is one investors will have to address in the approach to Saudi Arabia’s inclusion in emerging market equity indices next year.The inclusions seem certain to go ahead. A spokesperson for FTSE Russell, which will add Saudi equities to its Emerging All Cap Index from March, to a weight of 2.88 per cent, said that in the light of the Khashoggi affair it had nothing to add to its decision, taken in March this year.MSCI, which will add Saudi Arabia to its Emerging Markets index from May, to a weight of 2.6 per cent, declined to comment.Those are chunky weightings. MSCI says its EM indices are used as benchmarks for $1.9tn in assets. Saudi equities, owned by few investors worldwide, stand to receive a flood of money.Saudi officials described reports of the torture and killing of Jamal Khashoggi by people close to Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago, as “lies”.Looking at Saudi asset prices, it is easy to conclude that, whether they believed the denials or not, investors were rattled. Saudi stock prices fell sharply, as bond yields soared.But it is just as likely that Saudi asset prices, as they generally do, were following those of oil, which also fell sharply (rather than rising, which is what you would expect if they had been influenced by the affair).Charles Robertson, at Renaissance Capital, sees no chance of the index providers changing their plans. But he does believe the Saudi administration presents a risk.By RenCap’s own measure, Saudi Arabia’s ESG score (for environmental, social and governance issues) is just 66 out of 100, 12 points below the expected score for a country with its per capita income.Despite some recent improvement, he said, Saudi Arabia lost points for being an autocracy and for failing to make progress in areas such as health and education.Steven Holden, of Copley Fund Research, who tracks the holdings of 180 EM equity funds with combined assets of $355bn, notes that Saudi Arabia “is very under-owned considering its potential size in the upcoming index rebalance”. Only about 7 per cent of funds he follows have any exposure, compared with 40 per cent with exposure to Argentina, for example — which MSCI decided not to add to its EM index beside Saudi Arabia.Many investors have been put off by issues such as transparency and governance. The added suggestion of barbaric violence at the top will be no help.“It is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile investing responsibly with investing in illiberal regimes,” said Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management. “Added to the many other mis-steps . . . the Saudi equity story faces an uphill battle.”Additional reporting by Aime Williams
38;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-10-03T04:00:40Z;Busting the myths of investment: who needs income?;Tax and a higher market price mean reinvested dividends are no bargain;There seems to be something so alluring about dividend income that it often seems to lead investors to abandon common sense or be encouraged to do so by the investment industry.For example, how many times have you heard it said that the majority of returns from investment in equities comes from reinvestment of the dividends? This assertion is usually accompanied by charts which show the difference in returns from an index with the dividends paid out versus one where the dividends are reinvested. Unsurprisingly, the latter has a significantly higher return. But this is not the same as demonstrating that the majority of returns come from reinvested dividends. In fact, they come from retained profits.Take the example of an average S&P 500 company. Currently it has a payout ratio of 52 per cent — in other words half its profits are distributed as dividends — a return on equity net of tax of 15 per cent and its shares trade on a price to book (market value divided by book value) of 3.5 times.So, which generates more value for shareholders, reinvestment of the dividend paid out, or the reinvestment of profits by the company?The first handicap of reinvested dividends is that dividends are taxable in the hands of most shareholders. The exact amount of tax payable will depend upon where the shareholder is resident and which tax band they are in. If you are in the UK and a higher-rate taxpayer, dividend income will be taxed at 32.5 per cent, so you will only be left with 67.5 cents out of every dollar of dividend to reinvest. (I am using US dollars as I chose the S&P Index for the example, but the principles are the same for the FTSE 100 and sterling.)Handicap number two is that you reinvest at the market price for the shares which, given the price to book is 3.5x, means that you will get to own just 28.5 cents (100 ÷ 3.5) of the company’s capital for every $1 you reinvest. For every $1 of dividend paid out you get 67.5 cents after tax, which buys you just 19 cents of the company’s capital (67.5 ÷ 3.5).That doesn’t sound like much of a bargain. In contrast, every $1 of retained income which also belongs to you as a shareholder suffers no additional tax and is reinvested in the company’s capital at book value, so you get 100 cents of capital for every $1 retained.As if that is not enough of a reason to prefer retained earnings to dividends, each $1 which is retained on your behalf is turned into $3.50 of market value because the company’s shares trade on 3.5x book.This is the arithmetic of compounding and it is what equity investors should seek to capture, as those in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway have done since it has not paid a dividend since Mr Buffett took control in 1965.The chart illustrates this. It shows the performance of Berkshire Hathaway’s stock since 1977 as it actually occurred (the earliest date for which data are available for this analysis) — with all the earnings reinvested. Against this we have compared what would have happened if instead half the earnings were paid out and then reinvested after tax (estimated at 30 per cent) at market price.The effect on investors’ returns is startling, as the table shows.This is a feature of equities which no other asset class possesses. A portion of the returns that companies generate are retained and automatically reinvested on your behalf. This creates more value than you can ever capture by reinvesting dividends — except, of course, when the reinvestment is done badly with management investing when returns are inadequate.It is not a feature of bonds or property assets. Investors receive interest or rent from these investments, but they are not reinvested for you. This advantage of equities is magnified if instead of investing in an average company you invest in a company with a higher than average rate of return on capital.Given this, it seems remarkable that income funds outsell all other types of funds by some margin. Because of this marketing phenomenon, funds use income in their name and seek to qualify for the Investment Association’s equity income sector.Amazingly, they can claim membership if they have a yield which exceeds the yield on the FTSE All-Share index by any amount, no matter how small, over a three- year rolling period, which is a rather low bar. In the event that a fund fails this test and is excluded from the sector, it is not required to remove the term “income” from its name. And the investment industry wonders why it gets a bad name.But why do people want income from equities in the first place? The need to get spending money from your investments once you’re retired is obvious. But why does it have to come from dividends? Surely the right approach is to invest for the maximum total return you can achieve and then redeem whatever units you have to provide for your spending needs.The benefit of this alternative approach is evident if you compare the performance of the MSCI World Index with the High Dividend Yield (HDY) subset of the same index (see below).The index outperformed the high-yield stocks, and this comparison understates the performance advantage of avoiding the high-yield stocks since they are still included in the MSCI World Index. Investors could invest in an index tracker, sell enough units to match the HDY yield and be left with more capital than they would have if they had bought the High Yield Index. Yet most investors seem to regard this idea of redeeming part of the capital sum to provide income as the road to perdition.Terry Smith is chief executive and chief investment officer of Fundsmith LLP
39;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-09-28T04:00:32Z;Emerging markets — basket case or opportunity?;The US-China trade war has sent last year’s high-performing fund sector into a tailspin;"What do you get if you combine a trade war between the US and China with higher US interest rates, a stronger dollar and an economic crisis in Turkey and Argentina? Answer: an emerging markets meltdown that is certainly no joke.But battered markets also mean lower prices. And some analysts say now is the time to invest, not run for the exit. FT Money looks at the forces roiling emerging markets, the areas worst affected — and those where fund managers think value beckons. What strategy should individual investors adopt to come out on top in this volatile sector?What a difference a year makes. In 2016 and 2017 emerging markets could do no wrong. Rising commodity prices, a global economic recovery and low interest rates sent money flooding into markets such as China, Taiwan and South Korea.The MSCI Emerging Markets index, a major benchmark of stocks, gained more than 30 per cent in 2016 and another 25 per cent last year in sterling terms — more than double the return of the S&P 500 that year — peaking at a record high in January 2018. Emerging market currencies surged too: the MSCI Emerging Currency index hit its strongest level on record against the dollar at the start of 2018.From this point, though, things started to sour. The twin spectres of rising interest rates and a strong dollar in the US led to currency crises in Argentina, Turkey and South Africa and triggered a contagion that rippled through emerging currency and stock markets, leaving investors thinking the bubble might have burst.“Emerging markets are facing a perfect storm in 2018 with their currencies, stock and bond markets all taking a battering,” says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Group.In the year to date, the MSCI Emerging Markets index has lost just under 8 per cent and volatility has spiked. Emerging market funds were among the best performing of any last year, but the average Investment Association emerging market fund is now the worst performing of any sector.In the UK, investors pulled more than £255m from emerging markets funds between June and July 2018, according to the Investment Association. Emerging markets funds experienced net outflows from retail investors in four of the first seven months of the year.“A key driver of emerging market performance [this year] has been the tightening of US monetary policy and the subsequent rise in the dollar,” says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity. “A strong US currency is typically bad news for emerging markets as it encourages a flight back to safety in the US, and also makes life more difficult for borrowers with dollar-denominated debts, which become more expensive to service.”Higher US rates and a stronger dollar have long been triggers for money flooding out of emerging markets. The theory is that when the dollar strengthens, the volume of debt that emerging markets have sold in dollars, rather than their local currency, becomes more expensive and harder to pay back, which makes investors fearful.Since 2016, US rates have moved from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, with six rises in total. That caused a run on emerging market currencies this year, according to Lena Tsymbaluk, analyst at Morningstar.“A stronger dollar and interest hikes from the US Federal Reserve resulted in a big currency sell-off [at the start of the year],” she says. “Most emerging currencies weakened, but particularly those with large current account deficits and high external debt, like South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia.”So far this year the Argentine peso is down 50 per cent against the dollar, making it the worst-performing currency in the world over the period. The Turkish lira is a close second, sliding almost 40 per cent, while the Brazilian real, South African rand and Russian ruble have all suffered too.Argentina, which was only promoted to emerging market status in June after almost a decade as a riskier “frontier market”, has been punished hard after its current account deficit ballooned under pro-market president Mauricio Macri. Elected in 2015, he borrowed in dollars to plug the hole, raising the risks to the country by leaving about 80 per cent of its sovereign debt dollar-denominated.Turkey was also heavily dependent on foreign debt. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this year stoked economic tensions with his controversial comments on interest rates, which he called “a tool of exploitation”. The country’s central bank waited months to raise rates, despite double-digit increases in inflation and a run on the lira before finally taking action this month.Due to the relatively small weights that most emerging markets fund managers hold in countries like Turkey, few emerging markets funds have suffered losses close to the extent witnessed in those markets. But neither has any fund in the Investment Association global emerging markets sector delivered a positive return in the year to date.Tanvi Kandlur, analyst at FE, says: “Turkey and Argentina are not big weights in the index, so you won’t find many funds with large overweights to those. Emerging Europe funds or funds invested in Latin America are doing far worse than general emerging markets funds.”The average global emerging markets fund in the Investment Association Global Emerging Markets sector has fallen by almost 10 per cent in the year to date, compared to a 24.4 per cent total return in 2017. However the best-performing funds have lost far less.“The worst-performing funds were those with overweight positions in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey,” says Ms Tsymbaluk. “Even though Brazil has not suffered this year to the same extent as Turkey, it is a larger weight in the index and so managers might have held more of it. The same goes for South Africa.”Fund managers buying small- and mid-cap stocks also suffered as fearful investors sought safety in larger household names. For example, Jupiter Global Emerging Markets has so far lost almost 20 per cent in the year to date — putting it in the top three worst performers in its sector. Ross Teverson, fund manager, says his emphasis on small- and mid-cap stocks had weighed on performance in a year when “the market has gravitated toward highly rated, large-cap stocks which investors perceive as safe havens”.Investment trusts, whose share prices fluctuate based on sentiment and performance, have also been punished, with share price discounts widening across the sector. The average emerging market investment trust now trades on a discount of 7.3 per cent compared with an average of 5.8 per cent at the end of December 2017, according to Winterflood Securities.Winterflood analyst Simon Elliott says: “Double-digit discounts appear to have become ingrained in the case of mainstream global emerging markets trusts,” despite active share buyback programmes by several trusts in a bid to prevent such activity.2018 to date*: -43.65%; 2017: 58.45%2018 to date* -7.9%; 2017: 40.73%2018 to date*: -4.46%; 2017: 26.74%* MSCI figures correct 21/9/18. Source: FEA sell-off does not mean investors should head for the exit. In fact, it may signal fresh opportunities and bargains for the bolder investor. Emerging markets remain the engine of global growth and they are far from a uniform group: countries such as Taiwan and China are responsible for some of the brightest investment stories of tomorrow, even as Argentina sinks into recession.“When emerging markets are doing well, everyone is talking about the rise of the consumer, growing middle-class populations and strong GDP growth that we don’t enjoy in the west,” says Mr McDermott. “Then, when emerging markets start doing badly, suddenly we’re all saying they’re basket cases with rubbish currencies and massive debt piles. It isn’t true.”Argentina, Turkey and South Africa may be enduring serious economic problems, but the MSCI Emerging Markets comprises 24 countries including China, India and Taiwan. Twenty companies in the index are individually larger than the entire Turkish stock market, according to asset manager Franklin Templeton.“People are getting panicked by white noise,” says Mr Hollands. “But Turkey, for example, is a tiny component of the emerging markets universe. The big markets to pay attention to are China, South Korea and Taiwan.”Investors are also too easily spooked by dollar strength, say analysts. Not all emerging markets are equally vulnerable to the dollar, and many have spent the past five years overhauling their economies and reducing their foreign debt piles, meaning they have been unfairly treated in the most recent sell-off.Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore, says the volume of debt issued in dollars across emerging markets has shrunk significantly in the past five years. Local currency debt now makes up almost 90 per cent of all bonds issued, greatly reducing the potential for more currency shocks.“We’re at a more attractive entry point in emerging markets today compared with the ‘taper tantrum’ in 2013 [an emerging market crisis connected to US rate rises],” says Ms Kandlur. “The issue then was the fact that countries had enormous current account deficits, but five years on and many of those have either reduced, or turned into surpluses.”Meanwhile, the potential for growth in markets such as Taiwan and India remains far higher than in developed economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, developed and emerging economies are on track to grow by almost double the rate of the global economy in 2019 alone — at a rate of 5.1 per cent, compared to 3.9 per cent. And according to the McKinsey Global Institute, emerging economies have accounted for almost two-thirds of the world’s GDP growth and more than half of new consumption over the past 15 years, though performance in each varies significantly.The MSCI Taiwan, dominated by global heavyweight stock Taiwan Semiconductor, returned almost 5 per cent up to September 21. The index is currently trading on a price/earnings ratio of 13.8 times, according to Morningstar, indicating that investors believe it is likely to grow significantly.Prices for emerging market stocks are plumbing fresh lows. Equity valuations are trading at more than a 40 per cent discount to the US market on price/earnings terms, according to Mobius Capital Partners — the widest gap since 2002. And emerging market currencies (with the exception of China) are approaching pre-2008 crisis lows.“This is a time for contrarianism and a time for the brave,” says Mr McDermott. “If you are a high-risk equity investor, this could be a very good time to increase your emerging market exposure given the fact that it’s done so badly.”One of the biggest components of emerging markets funds is China. This week, an additional $200bn of US tariffs against Chinese goods came into effect, escalating Sino-US tensions to a new pitch and laying the ground for retaliation by Beijing. China is likely to see lower economic growth as a result, but could support its exports by cooperating with other trading partners and easing domestic policy to offset the negative shock.Ian Samson, market research analyst at Fidelity International, says: “Trade tensions between the US and China are escalating, but new developments will have a limited and temporary overall effect on the economies of both countries. We estimate US tariffs of 25 per cent on Chinese goods will somewhat dent China’s growth prospects, and provide a small one-off boost to US inflation.”But, he says, China’s bigger problems are arguably domestic. US exports account for only 5 per cent of the economy, according to Fidelity. Other Asian economies meanwhile remain less affected than investors might think.“There is no sign of damage from US tariffs in Korea, one of Asia’s most export-oriented countries,” says Mr Dehn. In August, he says, the rate of growth of South Korean exports accelerated by more than two percentage points. Other Asian countries such as Taiwan continue to power ahead: the MSCI Taiwan index has returned almost 5 per cent in the year to date, in large part due to the performance of Taiwan Semiconductor.2018 to date*: -20.53%; 2017: 24.33%2018 to date* 4.98%; 2017: 16.49%2018 to date*: -47.71%; 2017: 26.38%* MSCI figures correct 21/9/18. Source: FEBroad emerging market funds are the best option for most investors, according to analysts. Although certain countries or markets might look like good bets and investors might want to dodge some locations, the diversification of a broad-based fund generally offers better protection and a less volatile ride.“No matter what your attitude to risk, the best way to gain exposure to emerging markets is to start with a broad fund and then complement that with potentially a single country fund in a large emerging market,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen.Emerging market fund managers loosely differ between those more likely to invest in high-octane, high-growth stocks, those who invest in cheap, out-of-favour stocks and those that opt for stocks less likely to be punished in a downturn. Different styles are likely to suit different investors’ risk appetite and are likely to perform well at different points in a market cycle.Over the long term, the best-performing emerging markets funds have been actively managed and invested in small- and mid-cap stocks. JPM Emerging Markets Small Cap fund has returned more than 240 per cent over 10 years, compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets index return of 115.83 per cent.This is not for the faint-hearted, though. Over one year, the JPM fund has lost 3 per cent, and the wider list of top-performing funds looks very different. Investors with a lower risk profile may not be best served in a small-cap fund where returns are volatile and companies are punished hardest in the event of a downturn.Fidelity Emerging Markets fund, run by veteran manager Nick Price, is one defensive option, according to Mr Lowcock. Over the long term, Mr Price’s long-standing fund has failed to beat the benchmark consistently, but it has delivered smoother returns than rival funds.The best-performing investment trusts over the long term have been Utilico Emerging Markets, which invests in infrastructure projects, and JP Morgan Emerging Markets, which have both generated total returns of more than 134 per cent, easily beating the index.JPMorgan is also the strongest performer of any emerging markets trust over the medium term, returning more than 50 per cent over five years, far higher than the 40 per cent return of the MSCI Emerging Markets benchmark over that time and delivering a positive return of 1.6 per cent over one year. Austin Forey, its manager, has assembled a portfolio that includes Latin American ecommerce company Mercadolibre and Indian banks HDFC and Indusind.With trade wars, currency crises and more potential rises in US interest rates to contend with, emerging market investors face a rocky ride over the short term. But those brave enough to risk the journey could reach the destination of significantly higher returns in the long term.Mr Stevenson says: “There are certainly good reasons for this weakness but at some point the long-term positive growth story in emerging markets will start to look compelling. As such, the contrarian in me is starting to get interested here.”"
40;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-09-27T00:46:44Z;FTSE Russell to include China A-shares in key indices;;FTSE Russell will include China-listed equities in its global indices in a move that will see so-called A-shares constitute 5.5 per cent of the company’s key emerging markets index.The index provider said in a statement on Thursday that it would begin phasing in inclusion of eligible A-share stocks from June 2019. On completion Chinese equities will represent initial net passive inflows of $10bn of assets under management and are projected to account for 0.57 per cent of the FTSE Global All Cap Index.“China will also be added to our Watch List for possible inclusion in FTSE’s global bond indexes”, said Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE Russell. “The Chinese authorities have continued to introduce reforms designed to open their market to international investors and have transformed their economy into the second largest in the world.”The move follows an announcement on Wednesday by rival MSCI that it had proposed an increase in the weighting of Chinese A-shares in its flagship emerging markets index just months after including mainland-listed companies for the first time.The proposal would almost double the number of A-shares in MSCI’s EM index to 434 by May 2020, which the provider estimates would attract about $66bn from passive and active funds.Both companies’ announcements come during a rough patch for China’s equities market, as the CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks has fallen 15.2 per cent during the year to date.
41;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-09-26T04:41:34Z;MSCI eyes near-doubling of China weighting in EM index;Index provider consults wary markets about boosting exposure to A-shares;Global index provider MSCI has proposed an increase in the weighting of Chinese A-shares in its flagship Emerging Markets index just months after including mainland-listed companies for the first time, despite the country’s stock market slowdown this year.The New York-listed company said on Wednesday that it was consulting the market — which includes sovereign wealth funds, asset managers and central banks — about boosting exposure to A-shares in the MSCI EM index, which is tracked by $1.9tn of assets.The proposal would almost double the number of A-shares in the EM index to 434 by May 2020, which MSCI estimates would attract about $66bn from passive and active funds.The move comes four months after MSCI brought 235 A-shares into the flagship EM index following steps taken by China to make its equity market more accessible to foreign investors.The inclusion of A-shares had previously been rejected as a result of investor concerns over the number of Chinese companies that suspend their shares from trading, which was exacerbated during the market sell-off in 2015.The move to boost participation comes after the company scaled back plans to be more aggressive with the rate and pace of integrating A-shares, according to someone close to the situation. The person said some fund managers and investors were not prepared for the inclusion, while the trade war between the US and China also affected the decision.MSCI said it consulted “with a broad range of market participants [and] the feedback we receive guides our final decision”.According to a recent report by the Asian Corporate Governance Association, almost half of foreign investors did not think MSCI was right to include A-shares in its EM index this year, while 27 per cent of respondents agreed with the move.The latest proposal would involve quadrupling the free-float adjusted market value of A-shares in the index from 5 per cent to 20 per cent next year, in two phases.MSCI is also suggesting including companies from the technology-focused ChiNext exchange from next year, and mid-cap stocks from 2020.The index provider said China A-shares would represent 3.4 per cent of the MSCI EM index by mid-2020, up from 0.71 per cent now.“Even with the addition of a 20 per cent inclusion factor of China A mid-cap securities in May 2020, the weighting of China A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Market index would only be 3.4 per cent, which is still very small compared to the size of China’s market,” said Eugenie Shen, head of asset management at the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.Peter Alexander, managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, said the trading suspensions of 2015 remained “fresh in the minds of investors” who, in some cases, continued to have concerns about market access. However, he added, the scepticism was “misplaced and antiquated”, as the market had made vast improvements.“As the second-largest economy . . . that allocation to China will inevitably have a bigger part in the MSCI EM index, it’s a clear direction of travel.”But one analyst said: “There have been a number of institutions who will allocate based on what MSCI does but a lot of US institutions have made the choice not to allocate, or at least not match, what MSCI is doing with A-shares.”In response to concerns aired by some investors about governance in mainland-listed companies, MSCI has stipulated that any company whose shares have been suspended from trading for 50 consecutive days or more will be suspended from the index.“We can exclude any companies if they have prolonged suspensions,” said Chin Ping Chia, head of research for Asia Pacific at MSCI. “That sends an important signal to listed companies in China.”MSCI said it would accept feedback until mid-February and publish its decision at the end of that month.
42;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-09-19T03:00:29Z;Wall Street shake-up scatters US tech behemoths;A reclassification of S&P 500 sectors will see likes of Alphabet and Facebook moved;"Tech investors are braced for what some have called a “de-Faanging” of the sector, a reference to the handful of major US tech companies that have led Wall Street to record highs in recent years.Next week index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices will move Facebook and Alphabet from info tech into communication services, a revamped sector whose creation is the most striking change in a shake-up of the widely tracked classification system investors use to help navigate the world’s biggest stock market.When the dust has settled, seven tech stocks that represent roughly a fifth of the S&P 500 information technology sector will be reclassified as communication services, according to State Street Global Advisors.Some 16 stocks, including Netflix, whose combined market cap currently accounts for about 22 per cent of the consumer discretionary sector, will also join the renamed sector that is currently home to just three companies, including Verizon and AT&T.Given the explosive rise in passive investing over the past decade, the changes pose a challenge to investors who have used the sector system to gain exposure to the tech sector and the more defensive telecoms sector, as well as the active fund managers who use the sectors as benchmarks. In the short term some are expecting volatility as portfolios are rebalanced.“There is no question we will see elevated volumes in most of these stocks,” said Rob Nestor, the president of Direxion, an ETF provider, “whether that is enough to affect prices dramatically, it is hard to tell in advance.”As a rough estimate, he expected the entire sector reclassification to drive about $20bn in trading volume.The changes mean that the tech sector, which has swelled to account for about quarter of the total market value of the S&P 500 thanks, in part, to the meteoric rise of the Faangs, will shrink to about a fifth.What is left in the info tech sector will have a greater weighting towards hardware companies, including Apple, as well as chipmakers and traditional tech stalwarts like Microsoft.While the overhaul will scatter Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet across more sectors, analysts say that in other ways it will sharpen the prominence of the tech behemoths.Alphabet and Facebook’s departure for communication services will see trillion-dollar Apple’s sector weight within info tech rise to 22 per cent, from 17 per cent, according to analysts at UBS.The weighting within info tech of Microsoft, which is closing in on a $1tn valuation, will rise to 16 per cent up from 13 per cent at present. While the exit of Netflix means that Jeff Bezos’s ecommerce behemoth Amazon will account for almost a third of the consumer discretionary sector, up from the current 26 per cent.“The new sectors will be more concentrated, but that is the nature of the market because you have this handful of super-cap names,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek.The revamp of what is currently called the telecommunications services sector will also force investors to rethink what has historically considered a defensive part of the market with a high dividend yield.Given that Facebook and Alphabet will account for 16 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, of the new communications service sector that perception will be obsolete. The dividend yield for the renamed sector will drop to just 1.4 per cent, according to UBS, compared with 5.5 per cent from the telecoms sector at present.The proposed changes will also affect valuation. The telecoms sector trades at a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.2 times, according to Jeremy Zirin, strategist at UBS, while he estimated the forward P/E of the communication services to be 18.6 times.“Speaking to clients, the reason why they like it [the telecoms sector] is because of the more defensive characteristics and high dividend yield,” said Pam Woo, head of US equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “So there will be fewer sectors to find that defensiveness.”Some investors also said that grouping Facebook and Alphabet with highly regulated telecoms companies reflected expectations that the former would soon face heightened regulation, too. Facebook and Alphabet, along with Twitter, which is also joining the communications bucket, have been hit with concerns about privacy and security.“It is kind of a clever cluster of the names with some real regulatory risk,” Mr Colas said.Indeed, some investors expressed reservations about the new sector’s growth prospects.“I would not call the new sector particularly attractive given that the maturation of the heretofore tech names has already shown up in their more middling earnings,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors, citing second-quarter earnings disappointments for both Netflix and Facebook. The latter’s shares tumbled after warnings about future growth.“The rush for consolidation in the more traditional media names, for example Comcast, Disney and AT&T, will probably lead to both overpaying due to bidding wars and, to finance said bids, higher leverage,” he added. “Add to that stretched valuations and the increased regulatory risk . . . and it’s hard to get excited about the sector.”While the reclassification has been well telegraphed by the index providers, volatility before the market close on Friday cannot be ruled out.“Understanding the amount of rebalancing to take place is a bit like walking on the moon,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors. “You can do all of the prep, planning, simulation and analysis but you won’t know the exact experience until you are there.”After the close of trading on September 21, index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices will transform the existing telecommunications sector with major implications for the technology and consumer discretionary groups. MSCI will make similar moves a week later and in November.The new communication services sector will include AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink; consumer discretionary names like Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Netflix and Walt Disney and tech giants, like Alphabet and Facebook.As a result of the switch, the telecoms sector, which currently represents just 2 per cent of the S&P 500, will swell to 10 per cent.All told, the upcoming communications services reorganisation will affect 26 stocks across the three sectors boasting a market value of about $2.8tn and representing about a tenth of the S&P 500, according to Matthew Bartolini at State Street Global Advisors.Jeff Bezos’s ecommerce behemoth Amazon will grow from about 26 per cent to nearly a thirdThe changes are expected to have a bigger impact on the market because of the growth in exchange traded funds and exchange traded products, which had some $5.23tn in assets under management at the end of August.Many ETFs are “passive” and are designed to track indices. The Global Industry Classification Standard has a four-tiered taxonomy of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 68 industries and 157 sub-industriesMr Bartolini said that SSGA would be rebalancing its Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), which has $23bn in assets and tracks the S&P 500 information technology sector, “on or around” Friday. That involves selling shares of Alphabet and Facebook, as they exit the index.SSGA did not have a sector ETF for the S&P 500 telecoms sector given how small it was and housed those shares in its tech ETF, but those will be sold as well.In March, Vanguard said it would institute custom benchmarks for its funds that track the MSCI sector indices that will change “to minimise trade and market impact costs”.It began rebalancing in line with the new sector weightings in May. Its telecom sector fund will become the communication services fund. Assets of Vanguard-MSCI index funds total $193bn globally.At BlackRock, $6.6bn of the $60bn in assets invested in sector and industry-focused iShares ETFs follow the GICs methodology. The rest will not be directly affected because they follow indices provided by Dow Jones and Nasdaq.The changes come amid an increasing overlap in services provided by telecoms, media and some internet companies.They are also taking place to address concerns over the size of the telecoms sector, which dwindled to just three companies following a wave of consolidation and has been left vulnerable to major swings in any of its constituents."
43;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-09-17T03:00:46Z;EM technology sector cut down to size as BATs reclassified;Index revamps will see IT stocks scattered as financials reclaim pole position;The mighty information technology sector, which has surged to a dominant position in the world of emerging market equities, is about to be cut down to size.But some think this might be good news for Chinese internet heavyweights Alibaba and Tencent, which are about to be stripped of their status as tech companies — in the eyes of MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices at least.The two index providers are about to press the button on the largest revamp of their sector classifications for at least a generation.The reclassification will see a number of internet stocks expunged from the IT sector, headed by China’s fabled BAT trio of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. All are among the four largest stocks in the IT sector, with Tencent, the largest company in the entire MSCI EM universe with a weighting of 4.5 per cent.Netease, another Chinese group, and South Korea’s Naver are among the others that will no longer be classed as tech stocks.Most of these companies will be switched to a beefed up telecommunications sector, which will be renamed communication services. Ecommerce powerhouse Alibaba, sometimes described as China’s answer to Amazon, though, will instead be moved to the consumer discretionary sector.This latter sector will see its own exits, however, with Naspers — a South African media group whose prime asset is a 31 per cent stake in Tencent — Mexico’s Grupo Televisa and India’s Zee Entertainment Enterprises among those that will nestle alongside Baidu and Tencent, and incumbents such as China Mobile and America Movil, in the souped-up communication services bucket.“There have always been people who have complained in the past, for instance about Naspers being consumer discretionary when it should be IT,” said Daniel Salter, head of emerging market equity strategy at Renaissance Capital, an emerging market-focused investment bank.The changes mirror those occurring in developed markets, where the likes of Facebook and Alphabet (the parent company of Google) are being switched from IT to the new communication services sector, where they will be joined by evictees from the consumer discretionary sector such as Walt Disney, Netflix and 21st Century Fox.MSCI said the changes were designed to “reflect the fact that the way people communicate, share information and entertain themselves has significantly and fundamentally changed as a result of the rapid convergence between technology, media and telecom,” which has prompted companies to respond by bundling services such as cable, internet and telephone.In the emerging markets world, the rejig will have a marked impact on sector weightings. Based on current market prices, the IT sector’s weight in the widely followed MSCI EM index will fall from 27.1 per cent to 16.2 per cent, according to calculations by UBS.As a result, tech will be toppled from its hard-won perch as the largest sector in the index, a summit it reached in 2017, with financials regaining their crown. Indeed, the IT sector’s weight will be back to the levels of 2003-04, as the first two charts show.In contrast, the telecoms sector, currently a relatively puny 4.6 per cent, will, under its new communications services moniker, become the third largest industry, with a 14 per cent weight. UBS says the sector has not carried this importance since the glory days of the TMT bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Consumer discretionary will also be a net beneficiary, seeing its weight rise from 9.1 per cent to 10.7 per cent.The obvious question, of course, is how much this really matters. Some think it will make little difference.Klaus Bockstaller, co-head of global emerging market equities at Pictet Asset Management, said it would have no impact on his portfolios. On a broader basis, he suggested the reclassification would have more impact if sector-based exchange traded funds were a bigger force, rather than being relatively unimportant in the EM world.Geoff Dennis, head of global emerging market equity strategy at UBS, agreed the paucity of sector funds lessened the potential impact of the revamp, adding that, more broadly, EM equity investors were more likely to make country-specific bets rather than sector-specific ones.However, Douglas Morton, head of Asia research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, believed the reclassification could be beneficial for stocks such as Alibaba and Tencent in two ways.First, Mr Morton said that “the recent reality globally has been that in times of market uncertainty the IT sector has been more sensitive to selling pressure than its earnings may otherwise suggest, particularly within EM”. As a result, being outside the IT sector could help shield internet stocks during sell-offs.Second, he said that “investors are currently very wary of the ‘concentration risk’ implicit in such a large sector as IT. Under the current classification, for example, investors may be understandably nervous of fully investing in both Tencent and Alibaba,” Mr Morton added.This assertion is backed up by data from Copley Fund Research, which provides analysis of the holdings of 180 EM equity funds with combined assets of $355bn.Its data show that although fund managers have steadily increased their weighting towards IT since 2012, they have been reluctant to raise their exposure in line with the ever-increasing weighting of the sector in the MSCI index.As a result, a substantial underweighting has opened up, with the average actively managed fund now holding 3 percentage points less IT than a passive index tracking fund would, as depicted in the third chart.This pattern is also crystal clear in funds’ treatment of Alibaba and Tencent, which again they have been reluctant to chase up to their full weighting, as shown in the final two charts,Against this backdrop, Mr Morton said that “with the new classification system, investors may begin to reassess the divergent operational factors of [Alibaba and Tencent] and begin to feel more comfortable with any potential diversification benefit”.Balanced against this is a factor that could prove a negative for social media companies such as Tencent and Baidu, and even more so for US ones like Facebook and Twitter.One suggestion doing the rounds is that placing these companies in the same sector as “old” media companies such as Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox might increase pressure on the authorities to regulate them in the same way, ie by treating social media platforms as publishers, rather than intermediaries, meaning they are responsible for content posted by users. Such a move would be widely feared by the platforms.Some believe the shake-up could yield benefits, though, for emerging market telecoms companies, with some investors perhaps overlooking the sector due to its small size.Tim Edwards, managing director of index investing strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the creation of the supercharged communication services sector “may make telecoms companies more attractive as it makes the industry more investable”.On the downside, however, this sector will now be home to the EM world’s most volatile stocks, Mr Edwards added.Mr Dennis agreed the creation of the enlarged sector could increase interest in “plain vanilla telcos”.The move could also shed light on some chunky valuation differentials between new bedmates. While the MSCI EM consumer discretionary sector trades at a consensus forward price/earnings ratio of 15.3, and the telecoms sector at 14.8 times, new constituents Alibaba and Tencent trade at 25.4 and 28.3 times respectively.The changes are due to be implemented in the S&P Dow Jones family of indices, both in emerging markets and the likes of the S&P 500 in the US, at the start of trade on September 24 and in the MSCI indices as part of their November 2018 semi-annual review.

He said a decision on weighting would then follow.Asked whether the weighting for the shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen would surpass the 0.8 per cent level used by MSCI in its Emerging Markets index, Mr Makepeace responded, “I think we’re likely to go more than 0.8 per cent, but we’ll make the decision and we’ll announce it coming very soon”.He added, however, that the amount of A-shares included would need to take both limits on foreign ownership and trading restrictions imposed by Beijing into account.Mr Makepeace’s flagging of his company’s imminent decision comes shortly after MSCI finished ramping up its inclusion of A-shares to 5 per cent of the total free-float market capitalisation, or 0.8 per cent of the company’s EM benchmark, from the end of August. If 100 per cent of the A-share market were included it would push China to more than 40 per cent of the benchmark, according to MSCI.The decision also comes during a particularly rough patch for China’s A-shares. The CSI 300 index of large market-cap stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen has fallen nearly 20 per cent during the year to date as concerns over the ongoing US-China trade war have unnerved investors already wary about an equities market which suffers from insider trading and poor corporate governance.
45;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-09-07T04:01:00Z;The mystery of commercial rents: boom or bust?;Despite the exodus of tenants, rents on retail stores appear to be rising;"Something strange happened in UK retail property this spring. Stores fell like dominoes: Toys R Us UK and Maplin, the electronic outlet, entered insolvency; fashion retailer New Look closed dozens of shops in a company voluntary arrangement, followed by Poundworld and maternity and baby outlet Mothercare; retailer Marks and Spencer has announced store closures; and department store House of Fraser began preparing for retail closures. But despite the exodus of tenants, according to listed companies and published indices, rents on retail stores appeared to be rising. When demand takes a plunge, intuitively one would expect the opposite. So how was that possible?MSCI, the index provider, reported retail property rental growth of 0.9 per cent for the three months to the end of March and 1 per cent for each of the two quarters before that. Intu, a shopping centre landlord, said in February that its estimated rental values were up by 1 per cent in 2017. The property agency CBRE said rents for shopping centres were up 1.4 per cent in 2017 and 0.1 per cent in the first quarter.There is value in these numbers, but they do not tell the full story. The figures are based on what property people call “headline rents” — a figure that appears in contracts between landlords and their tenants. But headline rents do not take account of the various incentives from the landlord to the tenant. For example, it is standard to offer a rent-free period when a store (or office) opens, which generally lasts six months and can be as long as a year. At the same time, leases are getting shorter and lease breaks more common. If a landlord rents to a shop on a 10-year lease that can be broken after five years, with a one-year rent-free period, that incentive suddenly amounts to a fifth of the income a landlord can rely on receiving.But there is more. Landlords also offer cash incentives to businesses, so a lease might actually begin with a transfer of money from landlord to tenant, not the other way round. This contribution, often used to fit out the store, can amount to another 10 per cent of the value of the lease — or sometimes even more, agents say. Like the rent-free period, it is not included in the headline rent, which may in turn be used to calculate the “estimated rental value” of properties, a figure representing the rent you could reasonably expect to receive on a new lease.Incentives tend to vary through the property cycle, increasing when conditions for landlords are tough. For obvious reasons, landlords can be reluctant to share what incentives they are offering. So the total cost of renting a store is likely to fall when chains are closing and landlords are struggling to fill space — without any effect on the headline numbers.Incentives are not the only problem. When it comes to listed companies, there is no standard way of accounting for changes in rents. So even a reliable-sounding measure such as “like-for-like net effective rental growth” can turn out to be a little slippery. Landlords disagree on the nature of “like-for-like”. Some compare the exact same store but others will compare stores across a whole shopping centre. As the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which dictate how listed companies set out their accounts, do not specify how numbers like “estimated rental value” and “like-for-like estimated rental growth” are calculated, less scrupulous landlords can even change their methods from one reporting period to the next. The kicker: None of these figures account for stores that are completely empty, whether for refurbishment or because the tenant has gone bust.“Masking of rent became an art form post 2008,” says one agent who asks to remain anonymous because his job is to sell retail property. He says not all landlords are culpable, but dismisses some of the numbers in the market as “blatant nonsense”. So where can we look for numbers that will show us the true state of the retail property market?Robert Duncan, analyst at Numis, uses a comparison of MSCI’s rental growth figures with those of five years ago to get a sense of the market’s direction. MSCI produces a separate annual report on lease lengths and incentives, which has shown a long-term rise in rent-free periods across sectors. Transparency in the US market is slightly better: data providers such as REIS do produce figures on effective rents, as opposed to “asking rents”.Masking of rent became an art form post 2008For more specifics in the UK, try the latest results from Next. The retailer has more than 500 shops in the UK and Ireland and is vocal about the rent drops it is securing from landlords. Among 19 stores where leases were renewed in 2017-18, Next said net rents, taking into account capital contributions, were down 28 per cent. During the same period, indices showed rents across the market rising about 1 per cent. In 2018-19 Next anticipates it will secure rent drops of 27 per cent, not including the 10 shops it will close altogether.An even grimmer figure comes from looking at the rent reductions secured by store chains entering company voluntary arrangements (CVAs): where shops stay open, they tend to secure rent reductions between 30 and 40 per cent.Another clue is in the stock market itself. Of the two biggest London-listed retail-only landlords, at the time of writing, Hammerson is trading at a discount of more than 30 per cent to the book value of its assets and Intu at close to 50 per cent. Investors certainly think retail rents, and hence capital values, have some way to slide."
46;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Real winners of the passive gold rush are index providers;Shares in S&P Global have risen more than investments in some of its popular products;"The investing legacy of the gold rush was that the real money lay not in prospecting for precious metal but in selling the shovels to the hordes that believed they would get rich doing so. In an age where so-called passive investing, or tracking an index of stocks, has surged in popularity, the arguably equivalent play has been to buy shares in the index providers, such as S&P Global and MSCI.Since August 2008 the US S&P 500 index has generated a total compounded annual return of 10.5 per cent. Anyone who purchased and held shares in S&P Global, the company that operates the S&P 500 index and licenses it along with many other products to passive funds, has made a compounded annual return of 19.9 per cent with dividends reinvested. MSCI, the leading index operator, has generated 19.1 per cent compounded per year in the same time.Put differently, a dollar invested in S&P Global on the eve of the collapse of Lehman Brothers would today be worth just over $6, compared with just under $2.70 for holding the flagship index it runs.Observers could simply put this impressive performance down to the fact that the amount of assets invested in funds tied to the indices these companies license has surged over the past decade. Since 2008 the total money invested in so-called exchange traded funds, which are frequently used to cheaply mimic the performance of leading indices, has risen from less than $800bn to more than $4tn in 2017.But explaining these companies’ share prices through growth alone would be to underplay their increasingly entrenched positions as toll roads on trillions of dollars of retirement assets pouring into index funds. They are also companies that possess arguably insurmountable barriers to entry around their businesses. In the case of S&P Global it is not even a pure play index business because of its large credit ratings arm. It and Moody’s control about 40 per cent each of the global bond ratings market.YCG investments, a US-based fund manager, wrote this year about a “mispricing that we believe results from investors generally undervaluing the rare businesses, with both enduring pricing power and long-term volume growth opportunities”.Both S&P Global and MSCI require minimal capital investment to grow, have generated returns on invested capital far in excess of the average S&P 500 member and, in the case of the former, trade at only a 40 per cent valuation premium to the wider index.The debate over the merits of passive index investing over stock picking is unlikely to dissipate. In the meantime it is perfectly conceivable that index providers will continue to beat the indices that generate their profits.

Big index firms such as S&P Dow Jones and MSCI, it is alleged, stand in the way of this race because of their basis point and licensing fee structure.On paper, I wholeheartedly agree with this cynical view, mainly because these large outfits are classic examples of what economists call rent-seeking corporates, trading off their brand (and to be fair, hard work), forcing businesses to pay an entry fee for access to legally protected brands.I’d be happy, come the revolution, if we could find a way of open-sourcing indices, perhaps through blockchain. Back in the real world the alternatives don’t look quite so attractive.Self-indexing is a popular option with some, as is the idea of using a lesser-known index company to do the boring number-crunching and calculating but keeping the issuer’s brand name for marketing purposes. This makes sense but for one fly in the ointment — having someone to blame.There have been attempts to build the index version of generic drugs (S&P 500 indices in all but actual name) but most end-investors tend to like a familiar name on the box.So, for the really deep, liquid pools of equities and to a lesser degree bonds, the big brand names built around an exchange heritage are probably safe for now.This means that most of the innovation has erupted in what I call outcome-based indices, ie, where an issuer working with an index company is trying to filter the market to get the right outcome for investors.A deadlier variant could be a mutant combination, say, of blockchain, genetics and artificial intelligenceTwo examples jump to mind, one mild, the other potentially lethal. Many multi-factor strategies, combining different factor tilts look eminently sensible on paper but could end up producing what I call “mushy” results.By this I mean that the investor says: “This looks almost exactly like the returns from a broad market cap index but with higher fees.”As the investor begins to dig, they discover that what’s inside the black box of the multi-factor is in effect a pale shadow of the well-known broad market index. They will need someone to blame.My guess is at that point the issuer will say: “Ah, well, we did get an index firm in and they said this was the best strategy.”Such buck-passing may not rescue the situation but it will deflect some blame. At which point you need some well-funded, cash-rich indexing company to step in and defend the daft strategy behind the multi-index idea.A variation of the theme centres on low or minimum-volatility strategies — what happens in the next downturn when a badly designed index blows up and investors discover they have a mixture of overpriced, quality stocks that are now egregiously overpriced in a market sell-off?A deadlier variant could occur in thematic index investing where some crazy idea for a sexy fund — a mutant combination, say, of blockchain, genetics and artificial intelligence in the title — ends up with a portfolio of mid and small-cap basket cases.In sum, lots of listed businesses worth zilch. As the index and its ETF plunge in value, I can imagine the reasoning in class-action lawyers’ fee-obsessed minds: “How on earth did Business X make it past the screen?”In these circumstances, one needs the index equivalent of high street banks and payment protection insurance — that is, well-funded businesses with layers of management on hand to explain what went wrong.This also means that in the good times these index firms will also need to step up their education efforts and explain precisely how they build factor/ESG/thematic indices.Crucially these highly profitable monsters will need to get out more often and talk to retail investors — it is no good simply relying on relationships with a few choice institutional clients.The index firms need to earn their rent and engage more openly. If they don’t, the regulators should force them to do so.Don’t be too keen to see them go the way of the dinosaurs. When the next meltdown occurs, there will be plenty of ETF issuers in need of someone to blame for their ill-conceived products.David Stevenson is editor of www.etfstream.com and the Adventurous Investor columnist for FT Money
48;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-07-20T14:03:53Z;Rating agencies using green criteria suffer from ‘inherent biases’;Report argues bodies using environmental, social and governance metrics are inconsistent;Agencies that judge companies according to their environmental, social and governance metrics suffer from wildly diverging standards and “inherent biases”, according to a report by the American Council for Capital Formation.ESG is one of the biggest trends in the asset management industry, as demand for more socially-responsible investment options has soared in recent years. Approaches vary, but ESG funds tend to shun companies in industries like coal and private prisons, and favour companies that score well on diverse boards and management.The Global Sustainable Investment Alliance’s twice-yearly survey estimates that the broad ESG universe has expanded to $23tn in 2016, while JPMorgan estimates that about $2.5tn of funds now use “true” ESG metrics.“ESG investing is moving into the mainstream as investors are looking to minimise reputational and operational risk and are seeking ethical strategies without sacrificing potential returns,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a recent report. “An active and systematic adoption of ESG factors in the investment process is at its infancy rather than advanced stage.”That has spawned a number of agencies that score companies according to their ESG metrics, much like how rating agencies grade companies on their creditworthiness as borrowers. Among the biggest are MSCI, the indexing group, Sustainalytics and RepRisk.However, a report authored by Timothy Doyle at the ACCF, a pro-business think-tank, argues that these ESG rating agencies are inconsistent and suffer from a series of biases, such as a tendency to award higher ESG grades to the biggest companies or those based in countries with hefty reporting standards, even when this does not necessarily lead to better-quality disclosure.“It is paramount that investors and money managers have the necessary information to make sound investment decisions,” the report said. “Given that investments in this area are based on a company’s ESG rating, the rating agencies that assign these ratings have a vital impact on investment strategies. Currently there appears to be no uniform criteria used by the three largest and most influential rating agencies.”MSCI and Sustainalytics did not respond to requests for comment, but Philipp Aeby, the chief executive of RepRisk, conceded that the rating divergences were “a huge issue”.‘The industry is still maturing, and we expect a convergence over time,” he said. “The fundamental problem is that it is still unclear exactly what ESG should stand for.”While the credit ratings assigned by S&P and Moody’s for companies and other borrowers are closely aligned — with a correlation of 0.9 — CSRHub, a data provider for the sustainability industry, calculates that the correlations between MSCI and Sustainalytics for ESG ratings are much lower at 0.32.For example, the ACCF paper highlighted how Tesla has a lower ESG rating than all European carmakers — several have been accused of colluding to evade environmental and safety regulations — largely because Europe has more onerous ESG reporting standards.To illustrate the size bias, the report said that Bristol-Myers Squibb, a $92bn pharmaceuticals company, has a Sustainalytics score of 73 — 20 points better than the average for the healthcare industry, while Phibro Animal Health, which manufactures nutrients for animals, has a score of just 46.The ACCF recommended that ESG disclosures in regulatory filings should be standardised to help rating agencies make more consistent judgments, and that the agencies should be more transparent on their process, and better adjust for size, industry and legal jurisdiction.More uniform reporting standards would make it easier for ESG raters, but that requires industry-wide action, according to Mr Aeby. “One quick fix would be reporting simple metrics like diversity of boards, or the carbon intensity of a company,” he said.

The MSCI EM equity index remains more than 12 per cent below its peak in March.Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life said: “The biggest force remains the trade tariffs turning from rhetoric to action.”Within EM, Turkish assets suffered after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan predicted a fall in interest rates on Wednesday, heralding a new record low in the lira and pushing bond and equity prices lower.In contrast, emerging market bond funds recorded their first gains since the end of May, with $744m of new cash flowing in as bond yields have risen. The yield on a broad Bloomberg emerging market bond index has risen 1.2 per cent this year to 5.67 per cent, but moderated this week as prices rose.“I think this is a bit of a yield story,” said Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. “You have hit some thresholds that are getting people’s attention just because the nominal yields are so high.”US equity funds also fared better, adding $4.3bn, weathering concerns over trade ahead of a second-quarter earnings season expected to show strong company profit and revenue growth.“Right now sentiment is skewing more to the fear side but it’s not extreme,” said Mr Gokhman. “Tariffs are a concern for the US, however I think what markets are going to be looking at now are earnings over the next month.”European equity funds also saw continued withdrawals, with $4.2bn this week — the 18th straight week of outflows.Sign up to the FT Markets WhatsApp group to receive daily markets news and analysis alerts.

But MSCI’s recent shake-up of its emerging and frontier equity benchmarks led to calls of “oblivion,” “existential crisis” and the potential “twilight” of an index followed by about $20bn of investors’ money.The US index group said last week that Argentina will be promoted from its Frontier Markets index to its Emerging Markets equivalent next year, with Saudi Arabia, which was never in the frontier benchmark, leapfrogging straight to EM status. Kuwait, the largest market in the frontier firmament, was also put on review for potential upgrade to emerging status in 2020.While largely welcomed by emerging market investors, the changes threaten to severely denude the frontier index which, since 2014, has already seen the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Pakistan exit for the EM index and Ukraine and Bulgaria ejected to the ignominy of no man’s land.Worse still, Argentina and Kuwait currently account for 38.4 per cent of the frontier index, designed for markets typically too small or illiquid to be classed as emerging.Assuming, as many expect, Kuwait does depart in 2020, the largest of the remaining 21 countries, Vietnam, will have a weighting of 25 per cent, based on current prices, as the first chart shows. And many believe it too will be ripe for an upgrade in the not-too-distant future — an event which would leave just 45.5 per cent of the index’s current market capitalisation in place.“This probably makes the MSCI FM index ever more irrelevant, and passive strategies based on that index ever more incoherent [in] capturing an investment theme, particularly given Vietnam’s potential ultimate graduation to EM,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Exotix Capital, an emerging market-focused investment bank, who said the index changes pushed the FM index “closer to oblivion”.“I think we have a problem,” said Thomas Vester, chief investment officer of BMO LGM, a London-based fund group and manager of its $1.2bn frontier strategy. “It’s really hard to tell what the plan is from MSCI.”“Do they see frontier as a separate asset class in the long term? If so, they need some effort behind it. Dedicated frontier managers are scratching their heads.”Andrew Howell, frontier market strategist at Citi Research, who raised the possibility of it being the “twilight” of the index, added: “the review has laid bare the reality that markets are leaving the MSCI FM index far more quickly than they are being replaced. Where does this leave the frontier markets index? Without a whole lot of market cap or liquidity, alas.”One specific concern is that MSCI seems happy to view the frontier index as a nursery, meaning more countries are likely to exit upwards in the foreseeable future.Mr Howell said he “would not be surprised” to see Romania and Morocco reclassified as emerging markets in the medium term if they had a “decent-sized” IPO or two”.This problem is compounded by a lack of new “standalone” countries being lined up for potential promotion to frontier status, a move that would require them to demonstrate a “relative openness to and accessibility for foreign investors” and have at least two stocks that are suitably large and liquid.Mr Vester cites Costa Rica — his fourth largest geographic position at 5.9 per cent of his fund — as well as Ghana, as countries that would be suitable for frontier status.Mr Howell argued the continued exclusion of Georgia was “surprising and, in our view, problematic,” given it has “more market cap and liquidity than many frontier markets”. While these consist of London, rather than Georgian, listed stocks, the fact that Argentina’s index weighting consists entirely of depositary receipts “would suggest that local listings should not be strictly necessary”.Mr Malik cited Jamaica, Ukraine and Zimbabwe, as well as Ghana, as potential new recruits, but said these small markets would do little to make up for the loss of market cap and liquidity resulting from the departure of the UAE, Qatar, Pakistan and Argentina.Mr Vester was similarly vexed by the constant switching of countries between indices, with Argentina, Pakistan, Greece, Malaysia and Morocco all having moved twice in the past 20 years.“I don’t think it’s particularly helpful to upgrade, downgrade. There are just too many movements but MSCI is running a business, it’s their choice,” said Mr Vester who argued some people were more focused on forecasting what MSCI might do next, rather than on fundamental, long-term investing.“That is what I see from the sellside, that there is a lot of effort being put into second guessing [MSCI’s] movements,” he said. “When have we really struggled to keep up with the benchmark? It’s when Qatar, the UAE and Pakistan had massive outperformance up to the upgrade and then horrible [performance] after that.”Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management at MSCI, argued that the criticisms were unfair in that the make-up of the frontier index was an accurate reflection of the facts on the ground.“The frontier market investment opportunity set is naturally shrinking as markets that used to be included are evolving and developing,” said Mr Lieblich, who likened it to the loss of larger companies from small-cap stock indices.He added that MSCI has consulted with its clients about relaxing the stipulation that a country must have at least two sufficiently large and liquid stocks to be included in the frontier index, but that most investors preferred to keep the restriction.“Access to these markets is relatively difficult in terms of cost, time and resources [so] they want to have at least two stocks they can be invested in,” he said. “We would love to add [new countries] but unfortunately they do not meet the requirements that have been clearly expressed by our fund manager clients.”Mr Malik argued the impending narrowing of the frontier index would intensify the “search by active fund managers for a more workable industry-wide benchmark index”.One possibility is MSCI’s own Frontier Emerging Markets index, which includes all members of the frontier index as well those countries in the EM index that are both small enough (less than 0.1 per cent of the MSCI All Country World Index for three consecutive years) and poor enough (below the World Bank’s high-income category).At present this index includes MSCI EM members such as the Philippines, Colombia, Peru, Egypt and Pakistan. Argentina will probably remain in the FEM index after its promotion to EM status but Kuwait, if upgraded, will be removed, due to its high income levels.“We continue to see far more relevance in the Frontier Emerging Markets index, which retains many of the markets that FM loses to EM,” Mr Howell said. “The good news is that the outlook for the FEM index is quite a bit more stable than for the FM index.”Mr Vester suggested had he known how the FM index would be systematically stripped when he launched his fund in 2011 he might well have chosen the FEM index as the benchmark instead. While he could switch now, he was unlikely to.“I fundamentally don’t like fund managers that change their benchmark. Most of the time it’s because they are not too proud of their history, but we are very proud of what we have achieved,” he said, with the fund more than doubling the 53 per cent return of the FM index since inception.Nevertheless, like many frontier managers he is happy to go off-piste and invest a decent chunk of his fund in markets considered emerging. “I simply don’t think our clients’ capital is best served by rigidly following the index,” he said.Mr Vester argued a “more fundamental problem” still was MSCI’s treatment of frontier status as “the child in the family that nobody is particularly proud of”.“Sometimes it has been a little bit of a parking lot for failed nations,” he argued, pointing to the demotions of Argentina and Pakistan when their economic outlook was “extremely bleak”.Vietnam’s likely 25 per cent weighting in the frontier index, assuming Kuwait is promoted, also rankles, even if that is below China’s 32 per cent stake in the EM index and the 60 per cent weighting of the US in the MSCI World index.“Sometimes the concentration in the benchmarks is something that you should be very careful with,” Mr Vester said.“Is that really how the savings of hard-working pension savers should be invested? Would I really put a quarter of my money in one country? No, I wouldn’t. I think that starting point is wrong.”
51;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-06-21T19:40:06Z;Saudi Arabia eyes $40bn in foreign investment inflows after MSCI decision;;Saudi Arabia hopes to attract more than $40bn in foreign investment inflows after MSCI added the kingdom to its emerging markets index as the country prepares to publicly list its state oil company Saudi Aramco, a senior official said.“It’s effectively a seal of approval of the global investor community on Saudi Arabia,” Mohammed Elkuwaiz, chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority (CMA), told the Financial Times.The CMA is working with the Saudi stock market operator to ensure the necessary framework is in place for the Aramco IPO, he said, adding that the listing and the MSCI inclusion are related but not necessarily linked.Tadawul, as the bourse is known, is the Arab world’s largest stock market with a capitalisation of around $520 billion. The decision to add it to MSCI’s index comes three months after FTSE Russell, another index provider, also gave Saudi Arabia emerging market status.The market regulator and the bourse have over the past few years implemented a series of structural and operational reforms to improve the attractiveness of the market and adapt it to international standards.“All of these reforms were waiting for such decision to recognise these changes. It gives us the start of a new chapter of making sure that our offering in the future should address a new category of investors,” said Khalid al-Hussan, chief executive officer of Tadawul.The MSCI’s move will help improve liquidity and factor in feeding new IPOs, he added.Efforts to modernise the Saudi stock market are part of a major economic overhaul plan led by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to diversify the economy and move it away from its dependence on oil revenue by growing the private sector to create jobs for Saudi youth.“As more foreign funds flow in, we could see free float improving as the market becomes more institutionalised and retail ownership declines,” said Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital. “Post Aramco IPO, there would be further capacity to accommodate foreign fund inflows.”Other analysts are more sceptical, particularly over the implementation of the economic reform plans.“From a fundamental point of view, although we are still very early in the economic and political reform process and there are many execution challenges ahead, expectations of the benefits for structural growth are still too pessimistic,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at Exotix Capital.MSCI will give Saudi Arabia a 2.6 per cent weighting in its index, following a two-step inclusion process that will happen in May and August next year.
52;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-06-20T21:00:20Z;Argentina wins back emerging market status from MSCI;Index provider also adds Saudi Arabia to its EM benchmark;Index provider MSCI has promoted both Argentina and Saudi Arabia to its flagship emerging markets indices, which could presage a torrent of investor money into their local stock market that track the benchmarks.For Argentina, the upgrade from “frontier market” status represents a symbolic victory in reformist president Mauricio Macri’s efforts to turn one of Latin America’s perennial basket-cases into a more “normal” country once more. For Saudi Arabia it reflects the country’s gradual attempts to open itself up to foreign investors.Inclusion into a major benchmark can have a big impact on markets, as trillions of dollars are tied to the biggest indices controlled by MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell. JPMorgan estimates that there is about $384bn of money that passively tracks MSCI’s emerging markets indices, and another $1.1tn that is benchmarked against them.Argentina was downgraded from emerging market status by the index provider in 2009. MSCI said that investors had hailed the country’s political turnround, but cautioned that its decision could be altered if the government imposed any kind of capital controls in response to recent financial market turmoil.A sharp decline in the peso forced the Buenos Aires government to tap the International Monetary Fund for a $50bn bailout that was finally approved on Wednesday.MSCI said:International institutional investors expressed their confidence in the country’s ability to maintain current equity market accessibility conditions, which is a key factor in MSCI’s classification framework. However, in light of the most recent events impacting the country’s foreign exchange situation, MSCI also clarifies that it would review its reclassification decision were the Argentine authorities to introduce any sort of market accessibility restrictions, such as capital or foreign exchange controls.Saudi Arabia’s accession to the MSCI EM index also represents a fillip to the Gulf country’s attempts to gradually open itself up to international investment — an important plank in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reform drive.MSCI will give Saudi Arabia a 2.6 per cent weighting in its index, following a two-step inclusion process that will happen in May and August next year.The index provider added:This decision follows the implementation in the Saudi Arabia equity market of a number of regulatory and operational enhancements which effectively increased the opening of the market to international institutional investors. The proposal for inclusion received the support of the vast majority of international institutional investors that participated in the consultation.
53;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-06-15T11:09:30Z;China’s retreating A-shares raise trading suspension fears;Widespread practice is increasingly a concern for asset managers;The recent retreat in Shanghai share prices, coupled with evidence of a slowdown in China’s economic growth, are raising a pressing question for fund managers. How can international investors insulate themselves against the tendency of A-share companies to suspend their shares when the going gets tough?As the chart below shows, these companies have a longstanding proclivity to suspend trading when prices fall. Since the inclusion on June 1 of 226 A-shares into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, a benchmark followed by about $1.6tn in assets under management, Chinese suspensions have become an unavoidable issue for thousands of funds around the world.“Suspensions are obviously a big concern for investors,” said Olga Emelianova, head of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) research at MSCI, the index provider.Shanghai’s composite index, an A-share bellwether, hit its lowest level since September 2016 on Friday and is down 8.6 per cent this year. Meanwhile, several key indicators for the Chinese economy — including investment, consumer spending and exports — all showed slowing growth in May, according to official figures.The reason for the correlation between falling A-share prices and rising suspensions is that listed Chinese companies sometimes “play dead” to avoid lumbering their leading shareholders with margin calls, analysts said. Borrowing against holdings of stock is common in China, with companies holding a total of Rmb1.53tn ($240bn) in such loans in May, according to Moody’s Investors Service, the credit rating company.Before the MSCI A-share inclusion, such concerns affected funds that voluntarily sought exposure to China. But inclusion has forced passive index funds to take on China risk and obliged active fund managers who benchmark themselves against the MSCI EM index to at least consider buying.So when suspensions occur — preventing investors from liquidating their holdings in a falling market — blood pressures rise. Such risks put a premium for investors on assessing the governance standards of companies and in particular whether corporate bosses prioritise the interests of minority shareholders.“Everything springs from the real intention of the Chinese CEO,” said Tim Clissold, a financial analyst who did a study with Janus Henderson, an asset manager. “Does the governance structure imply that the CEO wants proper risk management and minority protection?” he asked.There are several red flags that may suggest a CEO’s interests may not lie primarily with minority shareholders. One is the inclusion on the board of the CEO’s personal relatives or of “vase directors” — allies of the CEO such as distinguished professors or foreigners who may lack business experience in China — Mr Clissold said.Another revealing area is dividends. An A-share company that pays large dividends to founders before and after its initial public offering but skimps on dividends to public shareholders may also raise concerns. Some 900 out of a total of 3,244 A-shares have never paid a dividend, according to Brandon Emmerich, principal at Granite Peak Advisory, a consultancy.Conversely, some state-owned enterprises such as the Bank of China or China Yangtse Power — both of which have changed their articles to require a minimum dividend pay out — appear to be taking the interests of minority investors more seriously, Mr Clissold said.Aside from governance, a slowing economy raises other A-share concerns, including corporate exposure to real estate. “There is a lot of worry right now about the real estate bubble bursting and the Chinese government trying to bring down real estate prices,” said Ms Emelianova.The chart above shows the leverage levels of the main A-share industry sectors. Real estate is a particularly important concern because some 12 per cent of companies among the 423 companies that make up the MSCI China A International index are either real estate firms or have heavy exposure to the sector, MSCI said in a report.Such companies on average have high leverage, with total liabilities equivalent to 77 per cent of total assets, according to MSCI research. Two companies, China Fortune Land and Future Land Holdings, not only have leverage ratios of above 80 per cent but also negative operating cash flows, MSCI said.On the other hand, industry sectors that are associated more with the “new economy” in China — such as consumer discretionary, information technology, consumer staples and healthcare — tend to be under-leveraged compared with their heavy industry peers and to an average of 40 per cent leverage in the Asia-Pacific, according to MSCI.
54;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-06-09T05:23:25Z;Investors clash over call to rejig Big Tech in MSCI indices;Index provider set to decide policy on contentious dual-class shares by June 21;The world’s biggest investors have clashed over whether Alphabet, Facebook and other companies with unequal shareholder voting rights should face tough restrictions in MSCI indices in a sign of growing debate over the idea of “one share, one vote”.Investors including Legal & General Investment Management, which oversees $1.2tn in assets, and Allianz Global Investors have backed proposals by MSCI to adjust the weightings of companies in its indices based on their free float and voting power.Rival investors, including BlackRock, the world’s largest fund house, and Norges Bank, which oversees Norway’s $1tn oil fund, have called on MSCI to leave regulators to sort out the issue.The focus on unequal voting rights comes after a host of technology companies listed in recent years with multi-class shares that offer some investors more power, prompting concern that a core principle of corporate governance was being eroded.The decision last year by Snap, the company behind disappearing-message app Snapchat, to sell $3.4bn of stock with no voting rights increased pressure on index providers to tackle the issue.Indices are widely used by investors to benchmark — or measure performance — of their funds. They are also replicated by passive funds such as index and exchange traded funds.The Investment Association, the trade body for UK asset managers, said its members backed MSCI’s proposals to weight securities based on their company-level listed voting power. It also backed plans by MSCI to delete securities with zero voting power from its equity indices.“We believe that it is important that the use of differential voting structures are discouraged, and that index users are appropriately protected against the governance risks posed by unequal voting structures,” it said.Steve Berexa, global chief investment officer for equities at AllianzGI, said he did not see the benefit of dual-class shares.“We see founders getting away with this because they can, while the exchanges’ focus on attracting IPOs and regulators’ lack of concerted effort has resulted in the absence of global standards alongside actions that look like a race to the bottom,” he said.He said: “Founders are often better at founding than managing companies that have grown rapidly and must contend with complex challenges and a new set of disciplines when coming to the public market. Dual-class set-ups unnecessarily delay proper governance and pressure for change and/or succession.”In an open letter sent in April, BlackRock said it believed policymakers not index providers should set corporate governance standards.Norway’s oil fund said it shared MSCI’s concern about “the impact of unequal voting structures on investors who want to exercise formal influence on the companies in which they invest”, but added that it believed that “indices should appropriately reflect the international investable opportunity set of equities”.It warned that the implementation of MSCI’s proposal “would have far-reaching and potentially unintended consequences for investors and the broader market”.LGIM, one of Europe’s largest asset managers, played down the concerns and backed MSCI’s proposals. It said: “We consider that the equal treatment of shareholders by allocating control of a company in proportion to economic interest is vital for a well-functioning market.”
55;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;MSCI/India: passive aggressive;Business causes a stir as it consults over capping exposure of indices;Who knew lists of shares could be so controversial? As arguments rage over China’s inclusion in MSCI’s suite of indices, the business is opening a second can of worms in India. It has launched a consultation to decide whether to cap the exposure of its indices to countries that try to restrict foreign trading of derivatives based on them.India’s aim is to encourage more domestic trading of assets. Right now, Singapore is the offshore trading centre for derivatives linked to India. In May, India’s main exchange sued Singapore Exchange (SGX) to stop it launching a new India-linked futures contract. This followed an earlier decision to cut access to data for India-linked products traded abroad. The moves threaten the role of SGX as an important Asian markets hub.MSCI has condemned the actions as “anti-competitive” and warned data restrictions may disrupt trading. The country’s weight in the $1.6tn emerging market index equates to nearly a month of average trading volume on the Mumbai stock exchange.A full exclusion could mean selling pressure on the country’s overheated stock market. It would also revoke the international stamp of approval that index inclusion bestows.The goal of MSCI is to be seen as an objective rulemaker. As a business, it must keep its benchmarks attractive to investors. The company rightly points out that the variety of instruments investors use for trading has broadened in recent years. They customarily include offshore exchange traded funds and derivatives. Investors want to trade cheaply and without too much hassle — they do not want protectionist governments to impose barriers.The local spat points to a broader moral. Passive investment does not depoliticise investment. Instead, it ups the ante by delegating decisions previously made piecemeal by many investors to a few index companies. Passive investing is forcing them to become activists. Their hefty revenues and margins come with a catch.
56;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-06-05T01:32:39Z;Chinese stock suspensions a ‘visceral’ issue for investors;MSCI seeks to assuage worries by imposing restrictions on inclusion in EM index;The president of MSCI has admitted that the ability of Chinese companies to suspend trading in their shares is a “visceral” concern for investors, whose exposure to China’s equity market expanded this month after the index provider added more than 200 stocks to its flagship emerging markets index.MSCI, which together with S&P Dow Jones Indices, FTSE Russell and Bloomberg, dominates the indexing industry, last week included about 230 A-shares, or those listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, in its Emerging Markets index. That move reversed previous decisions to exclude them because of concerns over market access and corporate governance.Chief among the worries of international fund managers is the ability of companies listed on the mainland to suspend trading in their shares, which could prevent investors withdrawing their money. The practice reached a peak during the Chinese stock market crash of 2015, after more than 1,400 companies — half the A-share market — suspended their shares.MSCI, which is listed in the US and has a market value of $15bn, sought to assuage worries with a rule whereby companies whose shares are suspended for 50 days or more are not eligible for inclusion in the index.“We have attempted to develop rules in our methodology to mitigate the problem, but in essence that’s all we can do,” said Baer Pettit, president of MSCI. “It would be much better if the problem did not exist.”The index provider dropped five of the companies that were set to be included before the benchmark index was rebalanced last Thursday, because their shares had been suspended.“It [share suspensions] will continue to be an area that is, I think, probably the most visceral one for international investors when they look at the China market,” Mr Pettit said. “I think that type of thing does create friction and to a degree some confusion with investors. So I think it is a very material issue.”In some cases, such as corporate restructurings, companies listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges can, under exchange rules, suspend their shares from trading for three months, and in other cases for up to five or six months.Howard Wang, head of greater China equities at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the rule by MSCI had helped because “leaving certain stocks off the final list of inclusions has incentivised companies in search of foreign buyers not to suspend as much or for as long as before”.While the frequency of suspensions had fallen, allaying the worries of foreign investors, the “length of suspensions can be excessive and is still an ongoing source of concern”, said Mr Wang.Global investors holding billions of dollars of passive funds that track the index have been forced to own these A-shares, while active managers, who reference their performance against the benchmark, will come under pressure to invest the market.A net Rmb2.2bn ($343m) was invested in A-shares through Stock Connect — the trading link between Hong Kong and mainland China — on Friday, the first full day of trading following the inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI EM index.Eugenie Shen, head of asset management at Hong Kong-based Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets, said that although Chinese regulators have shortened the amount of time that a company’s shares can be suspended following the sell-off in 2015, it is “still an issue” for investors.“The three-month suspension, which can be extended for another two to three months, for companies with major asset restructurings is way too long. It impacts on the liquidity of the investment which is of primary importance to foreign institutional investors.”Mr Petit said that on the question of share suspensions, China is “an outlier by an order of magnitude” and that it forms “the very essence of what is an investor’s concern, which is that you invest money in a company and you can’t get it out”.
57;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
58;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-31T04:00:38Z;Chinese shares to transform emerging market investing;Adding 233 companies to MSCI Emerging Markets index will connect China’s market to the world;"A government-controlled supplier of surveillance equipment is one of the most popular Chinese companies in the world right now, at least with institutional investors. Hangzhou Hikvision, one of China’s so-called A-shares, listed in renminbi on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, is among the stocks to have been selected for inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index from Friday, obliging asset managers all over the world to consider investing in them.If the attraction of Hikvision seems obvious — a Beijing-backed business in a booming sector in an authoritarian country — then the other two most favoured A-shares are also telling. One is a drinks company and the other a supplier of electrical appliances — both apparent bets on the rise of China’s middle-class consumer.Although only 233 A-shares will be added in the first tranche to the index — which is followed by investors controlling $1.6tn in assets — to many, this represents a pivotal moment. Subsequent planned additions are set to radically reshape the global equity landscape.“Investors can’t ignore China’s domestic market any more,” says Jinming Hu, chief executive officer of GF International Asset Management, the first wholly owned Chinese fund to launch in Europe. “Overseas investors now have no choice but to accept that mainland China’s equity markets are part of the world.”Many global investors have previously avoided Chinese stocks, partly due to concerns over corporate governance. Even renowned UK stockpicker Anthony Bolton, who arrived in Hong Kong in 2010 to exalted expectations that he would successfully transfer his Midas touch to China, fell foul of accounting scandals and fraud.He had discovered, as he put it, that corporate governance in China is a “euphemism for ‘are the figures real and is the management lying’”.The inclusion will force passive funds, which track indices and are held by some of the world’s largest pension funds, to invest in A-shares. Analysts say this has raised fears over corporate governance standards. Some question if this shift of passive, foreign money will force companies to clean up their standards, or whether investors holding these funds could get burnt.As more A-shares are added into benchmark equity indices, the flows of international capital into Shanghai and Shenzhen could rise sharply. “Based on the experiences of South Korea and Taiwan, after 100 per cent inclusion more than $600bn in foreign capital could flow into the A-share market in the next five to 10 years,” says Steven Sun, head of research at HSBC Qianhai, a Shenzhen-based securities company.MSCI did not give a timescale for “full inclusion”, but it acknowledges that when that day comes Chinese shares will make up the “heavyweight” portion of about 45 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. “When [the Chinese] want something, they do it,” says Sebastien Lieblich, managing director of research at MSCI. “I cannot say if [full inclusion] is going to be in 15, 10 years or five years. Any of these three time horizons are possible.”While such a prospect appeals to some, it fills others with dread. Active fund managers can select which companies to invest in and which potential landmines to avoid. Passive investors have no choice but to own these stocks.By objective measurable standards, A-shares are among the most highly-leveraged, volatile, worst governed and most heavily-diluted cohort of shares in any emerging market.A study by Brandon Emmerich, principal at Granite Peak Advisory, shows levels of indebtedness among A-shares is extremely high. The average gross debt held by a company is 7.8 times larger than that company’s annual ebitda — a broad measure of earnings — while net debt is 6.1 times larger. According to criteria applied by Standard & Poor’s, a credit-rating agency, any company with debt greater than five times ebitda falls into the highest category of corporate leverage.“Investors need to be very careful,” says Mr Emmerich, whose analysis was based on an original list of 222 A-shares scheduled for inclusion. “The debts of some companies, such as the big property developer Poly Real Estate Group which has debt to ebitda of 18.6 times, are extreme.”The number of surveillance cameras in operation is set to rise to 626m by 2020, up from 176m last year, according to IHS Markit, a research company. Hikvision, an industry leader, is a beneficiary of the national urge to monitor.At a time when Beijing is intent on deleveraging its economy, such debt levels represent a risk to investors. High corporate debt can also sharpen a company’s desire to issue more shares, thus diluting that company’s earnings per share — a key measure of value for those invested. Research by Schroders, an asset manager, shows the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets suffer by far the worst levels of dilution among 20 emerging and developed markets.In terms of governance, as Mr Bolton found, A-shares fare poorly. According to rankings of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards measured by MSCI, the 233 companies scheduled for inclusion rank far worse than their counterparts in other emerging markets, with 37 per cent scoring the lowest ESG rating available. Just three per cent placed in the top three out of seven ESG categories. “Almost every single international investor I’ve met recently has asked me about A-share corporate governance,” says Mr Sun.One impact of these poor governance standards is that investors are often blindsided when problems erupt. Leshi Internet Information and Technology, a former star of the A-share universe, fell to earth in April 2017 when it unexpectedly suspended its shares. It took nine months for the suspension to be lifted. During that time, the TV company that diversified into self-driving electric cars suffered a cash crunch and called off overseas acquisitions.The telling aspect of its demise, however, was that few investors saw it coming; weak transparency rules abetted by lax disclosure allowed the company to effectively disguise its frailties.Such disregard for minority shareholders is mirrored by the dominant position of majority shareholders. Nearly 70 per cent of A-shares have a major shareholder that owns more than 25 per cent of the company’s stock, compared with just 18 per cent of US firms in which the majority owner is similarly powerful, according to data from Granite Peak Advisory. This weakens the impetus to pay dividends; some 900 A-shares out of a total 3,244 have never paid one, according to Granite Peak.“Until [MSCI] took the selective approach to A-shares, we were critical about exposing international investors to so much governance risk in China,” says Jamie Allen, founding secretary-general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. “But even now, it still does increase risk . . . It puts pressure on passive investors to take governance very seriously, and ensure that they’re doing as much as they can. That’s a challenge for the passive industry as they invest in so many companies.”In spite of this, investors say A-shares represent one of the most compelling opportunities in global equities.“There are many good businesses listed in the A-share market that are not available [for investment] in Hong Kong, especially in the consumer, industrial and healthcare sectors,” says Bryan Yeo, chief investment officer of public equities at Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC, one of the largest in the world. “These are the sectors that will benefit the most from China’s focus on producing high quality companies and the growth of the middle income population.”As the bulls see it, the opportunity is defined by a chance to back the future winners from China’s rise to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in coming years, carried forward by a middle-class consumer boom, reforms to state-owned enterprises and technological advances in areas such as big data, automation and semiconductors.Midea’s €4.5bn purchase of the German group Kuka was unpopular in Berlin but made the Chinese appliances group attractive to global investors.Having been dubbed the “second great transformation”, by Investec, the asset management company says the opening up of the A-shares, “represents a profound shift in focus from volume to value and quantity to quality. The objective is to allow the ‘new economy’ . . . to sustain growth.”That thinking is reflected in a list of the top 20 A-shares that overseas funds have snapped up over the past 18 months. Of the 20, seven are high-tech firms according to research on 180 emerging market funds by Copley Fund Research, an advisory firm.The three darlings of these investors, according to the Copley research, are Kweichow Moutai, a premium maker of Chinese liquor, Midea Group, an appliance maker that acquired German robotics giant Kuka in 2017, and Hikvision. Other companies in the top 20 include those involved in the medical, leisure and consumer sectors.It is revealing, though, that only 57 of the stocks to be included among the 233 have been selected for investment by the 180 funds surveyed by Copley. “The fact that so many A-share companies have been avoided by active managers is a cause for concern for passive investors,” says Steven Holden, the founder of Copley Fund Research.Those who put money into exchange traded funds have to, in effect, buy all of the stocks that are included in an index and thus are likely to have a much broader exposure than active stock pickers who invest in only a few companies after close scrutiny of their prospects.The danger inherent in the passive approach to A-shares is that some of the many companies that make up an index may fail, undermining overall performance. This risk is heightened by a strong proclivity among A-share companies to suddenly suspend trading.One of the world’s most valuable liquor companies has become a popular investment opportunity in ChinaIn July 2015, when China experienced a sharp market sell-off, more than 1,400 companies, about half of the total listed, suspended trading. Even though the situation has improved, MSCI conceded in 2016 that the number of trading suspensions in the China A-shares market remained “by far the highest in the world”. The index provider has imposed a rule preventing companies that have been suspended for 50 consecutive days or more from being included in the MSCI EM index.“There were problems around governance and when things got shaky in 2015 many companies suspended their shares,” says Dale Nicholls, manager of Fidelity’s China Special Situations trust, the fund once run by Mr Bolton. “That was a problem but actions have been taken. There is still obviously room for overall market governance to improve but changes have been made and it’s now much more difficult for companies to suspend their shares and keep them suspended for so long.”Z-Ben Advisors, a data and analytics company, says there were 211 stocks suspended as of the end of May. “This issue is unique to China; most other countries don’t have significant trading suspensions,” says Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of equity research, Asia Pacific, at BNP Paribas. “It makes it a big challenge for passive funds to replicate the index.”Nevertheless, the size of China and the opportunities it affords mean that investors will ultimately have to get comfortable with the multiple risks.“One of the biggest changes we are going to see in the next 15 years is the integration of China’s financial markets into the world’s financial markets,” says Henry Fernandez, MSCI chairman and chief executive. “China has the second largest equity market in the world, and the third largest bond market, which is relatively closed to foreign investors. They are beginning to open up. As they open up further the weight is going to increase dramatically.”"
59;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-30T20:00:26Z;Five key points about MSCI’s China listings launch;Index provider is adding 233 mainland-listed companies to its flagship EM group;"Index provider MSCI has included more than 200 Chinese mainland-listed companies in its flagship Emerging Markets index for the first time. MSCI on Thursday brought 233 so-called A-shares into the benchmark, which is used to underpin about $1.6tn of assets globally.The inclusion represents a step towards opening up China’s equity market to international investors on an unprecedented scale. However, some investors have flagged concerns about the risks involved.Here are five key points about the index inclusion.MSCI has held four consultations with the market on the issue of A-share inclusion since 2013, and three times the notion was rejected — until last year. Investors had pushed back on the issue largely due to concerns over access, in the view that China’s market was still not sufficiently open to allow money to freely flow in and out, a crucial mechanism for investors.Arguably the biggest development in the past few years in opening up the market has been the advent of Stock Connect, a trading route allowing foreign investors to purchase shares in mainland China via Hong Kong, making access much easier. Until this point, only professional foreign investors could apply for a special licence and invest in a limited amount of shares on the mainland.“Capital mobility was a key concern,” said Chin Ping Chia, head of research for Asia Pacific at MSCI. “The breakthrough came when Stock Connect was announced. It showed a lot of promise in terms of creating that kind of accessible environment for investors to get in and out, with no discrimination, no quota system. That was the turning point.”Although the initial inclusion amount is incremental, it will force passive funds to buy these Chinese companies and will put a degree of pressure on some active fund managers — who benchmark their performance against the index — to follow suit.The largest exchange traded fund tracking the MSCI EM index is BlackRock’s iShares fund, which has about $39.8bn in assets in its US-listed product.MSCI estimates that about $22bn will flow into Chinese A-shares from both passive and active funds as a result of their inclusion in the flagship benchmark and other related MSCI indices.The addition of the stocks will happen in two stages, to account for the daily limit on the amount of money that can be channelled through Hong Kong via Stock Connect to ensure there is enough supply to meet demand. MSCI is including only large-cap A-shares that are traded through Stock Connect.The index provider said 2.5 per cent of the selected A-shares’ free-float market capitalisation would be put in the Emerging Markets index from the end of May, followed by another 2.5 per cent from the end of August, representing just 0.8 per cent of the total Emerging Markets benchmark.However, if 100 per cent of the A-shares market were to be included, it would increase A-shares’ weight to about 16 per cent of the index, pushing China to more than 40 per cent of the benchmark, according to MSCI.The weight of Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Asean will decline the most after the initial 5 per cent A-shares inclusion, according to analysts at BNP Paribas. If 100 per cent inclusion were to occur, then Korea’s weight would fall from 15 per cent to 12.7 per cent, Taiwan from 11.1 per cent to 9.4 per cent and India from 8.3 per cent to 7 per cent.“How quickly China A gets to its full weight will depend on the level of confidence investors gain through this initial exposure,” said Susan Darroch, head of global equity beta solutions, Asia-ex Japan, at State Street Global Advisors.Prominent investors have raised concerns about A-shares, ranging from trading suspensions to leverage. MSCI said in 2016 that China had, by far, the highest number of companies that suspend trading in their shares.Hugh Young, head of Asia Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Financial Times that he had long had governance concerns. “We’ve always been cautious; we don’t tend to go in gung-ho, because we’re not sure of the governance and finances,” he said.“Lots of investors have been burnt,” he added. “There were also all these forest investment companies, for example, that didn’t have actual forests in the first place.”Additional reporting by Chris Flood"
60;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-29T20:00:28Z;Investors target three China A-share diamonds before MSCI;Strong demand for handful of Chinese shares before MSCI index inclusion;A video surveillance company is among the top three stocks preferred by international asset managers piling into China’s domestic A-shares ahead of the first inclusion of these shares into the emerging markets’ benchmark index.The inclusion of 233 A-shares into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which is tracked by funds with $1.6tn assets, is set to take place on June 1. The move will effectively oblige fund managers who measure their performance against the index to buy at least some of the underlying A-shares.But by the end of April, asset managers had plumped for only 57 of the 233 stocks, according to Copley Fund Research, a consultancy which has monitored data from 180 global emerging market funds. Just over 42 per cent of these funds had invested in A-shares by the end of last month, up from 30 per cent in May last year — the month before the MSCI announcement on inclusion was made.Among the three most popular stocks so far are Hangzhou Hikvision, which is riding China’s boom for installing surveillance cameras. It has been bought by 16 per cent of the funds, according to Copley data. Kweichow Moutai, a liquor maker, was the top stock, and has been invested in by a fifth of the funds. The other member of the top three is Midea Group, an appliance maker, which has attracted interest from 18 per cent of monitored funds.The share prices of all three companies has surged along with the inflows from overseas funds.Read more: China market opens to overseas investors
61;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-27T09:00:27Z;Google, Facebook and Snap challenge governance standards;Tech groups dual class structures threaten principle of ‘one share, one vote’;Snap, the disappearing messaging app, caused uproar among investors last year after it sold $3.4bn of stock with no voting rights during its initial public offering.It was the latest sign for many investors that the long-held principle of “one share, one vote” was being eroded by companies, which readily accept fund managers and pension funds’ money but were, the investors believed, increasingly unwilling to give them sufficient say on how those businesses were run.In the months since, a growing number of investors have stepped up their lobbying efforts against what they see as the watering down of governance standards globally, warning that shareholders need to be able to hold companies to account.Deborah Gilshan, environmental, social and governance investment director at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of Europe’s largest-listed fund houses, says: “One share, one vote is the bedrock of corporate governance. It has always been the case that you should have a vote for every share you own.”The focus on unequal voting rights comes as asset managers are under growing pressure to hold companies to account. Many pension funds and other clients are increasingly asking their fund managers to ensure companies behave responsibly.Mary Leung, head of advocacy for Asia Pacific at the CFA Institute, the global body for investment professionals, says: “We are seeing increasing engagement between investors and companies and it would be sad to see that decline because investors have fewer rights.”Three decades ago, dual share classes were uncommon and typically found in family-controlled companies, such as South Korea’s Samsung, which has non-voting preferred shares, Switzerland-based healthcare company Roche and Sweden’s H&M, the retailer. But that changed when Google decided to list in 2004. Rather than follow the long-held practice of offering every shareholder a vote for each share they held, the technology group’s initial public offering featured dual-class shares — giving some shareholders more say than others.As other west coast companies followed in the footsteps of Google, whose parent company later became known as Alphabet, and the valuation of technology groups grew rapidly, companies with dual-class shares began to account for a bigger proportion of indices, the benchmarks investors used to measure performance. Businesses with unequal voting rights accounted for just 4 per cent of the MSCI World Index by weight in 2004, but the figure now stands at 10 per cent.Rob Dowling, a fund manager at Legal and General Investment Management, which oversees $1tn in assets, says there is growing concern among investors about this shift towards unequal voting rights. “When it was a smaller proportion of companies, it wasn’t ideal but it wasn’t a major concern. But as the proportion of companies [with unequal voting rights] has grown, it has become a bigger issue.”Ms Leung says the decision by Google, led by Sundar Pichai, and later Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, to list with unequal voting rights led to rapid changes in governance. “Because [Google and Facebook] were so successful a lot of companies want to emulate them. Rightly or wrongly, [some management] see having a dual share class structure as being part of that success,” she says.In a sign that big investors are losing their battle against dual-class share, Dropbox, the internet storage group, listed this year with unequal voting rights. Its B shares carry 10 votes for every class-A vote.Entrepreneurs have argued that by keeping control of the company, they are able to make decisions for the long-term rather than react to the short-term whims of shareholders. But Ms Leung says that argument holds little sway with the CFA. While she acknowledges that, sometimes, it might make sense at the time of listing to have dual-class shares, she argues they should be phased out over time. “We believe one share, one vote is the golden principle.”The US, Sweden, Germany, South Korea and Brazil are all home to companies with two share classes. Now other countries are looking to follow suit.Hong Kong changed its rules this year to allow companies to list with dual-class shares. The move came after it missed out on the listing of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group led by Jack Ma, which opted for New York. Singapore is expected to make a decision about changing its rules in the next few weeks, while other exchanges are also understood to be considering revisiting the issue.“With Hong Kong changing its rules and Singapore close to follow, it will kick-start a chain reaction. I don’t know who will be next. For us, it is very worrying,” says Ms Leung.Andrew Ninian, director of stewardship and corporate governance at the Investment Association, the UK trade body, describes the trend of stock exchanges globally lowering listing standards to attract new companies as a “race to the bottom”. He adds that it is “essential the UK continues to uphold these robust principles to protect investors”.Investors have already had some success with their lobbying over unequal voting rights. After Snap’s move last year, the largest index providers — which are the benchmarks that fund managers are typically measured against — decided to exclude Snap from their indices. FTSE Russell also said it would exclude from its benchmarks stocks that did not give shareholders at least 5 per cent of the voting power, and is planning a further consultation this year.S&P Dow Jones Indices no longer allows companies with multiple share classes to join various indices including the S&P 500, the index of large US companies. Existing constituents, such as Berkshire Hathaway and Facebook, can remain.In January, MSCI, the index provider, launched a consultation to examine how it should deal with other types of unequal voting structures. It has proposed that it will continue to include stocks with unequal voting rights in its indices but will adjust the weights of these stocks to reflect both their free floats and their company level listed voting power. MSCI is expected to make a decision next month.Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at LGIM, says he backs the moves by index providers, arguing it is vital that all parts of the investment chain work to stop any watering down of governance standards.Others have been less supportive. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, said in April that index providers should leave corporate governance standard-setting to regulators rather than try to engineer improvements through benchmark exclusions.Vanguard, the second-largest investor, says its underlying stance is in support of “one share, one vote”. “However, when it comes to inclusion in an index, we believe companies with limited voting rights cannot be excluded from the indices at this time. If an index intends to be representative of the market, companies that meet these stated standards should be included and properly weighted to reflect their market cap.”Others argue that it is vital that companies are not incentivised to list with unequal voting rights. They point to Facebook, where the issue of unequal voting rights has left many shareholders with less say — something they argue could have influenced the recent scandals at the social media company.Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager, corporate governance, at Calstrs, the US pension fund, said this month that it was time for Facebook’s voting structure to evolve. “It is time to end the dual class,” she said.Ms Gilshan adds: “If you are engaging with a company with unequal voting rights, your voice means less.”
62;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-27T09:00:25Z;The soaring ranks of groups with multi-class capital structures;Tenth of stocks by weight in MSCI World Index now boast unequal voting rights;The idea of “one vote, one share” has been a core principle of corporate governance for decades.Just 30 years ago, less than 2 per cent of stocks that made up the MSCI World Index by weight had unequal voting rights.But that changed in 2004, after Google came to the market with a dual share class structure that gave some investors more say than others.At the time, about 4 per cent of the MSCI World index had unequal rights. But this increased fivefold to about 10 per cent by 2017 as many rival tech companies followed Google’s lead.Now many of the world’s most famous companies, including Alphabet, Google’s parent company, Facebook and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, have unequal voting rights.Often favoured by family-controlled companies or those set up by entrepreneurs, dual share classes typically allow founders more control over the business — something they say is vital for driving growth. But many investors complain that all shareholders should be treated the same, arguing unequal voting rights is bad for governance.The rapid rise in dual share classes has caused concern among investors. Snap, the tech company behind the vanishing messaging app, caused huge upset last year after shareholders buying shares in its initial public offering were denied voting rights.Investors are now putting pressure on index providers and regulators to address the issue.But at the same time, stock exchanges in countries such as Hong Kong are introducing new rules to allow for the introduction of unequal voting rights, as they vie to win public offerings from big tech companies.The structures are already common in countries such as the US, Canada, Sweden, Germany and South Korea, but largely absent from places such as the UK.
63;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-20T09:00:25Z;Sizzling China A-share become hot area for innovation;MSCI cautions that poor corporate standards and market volatility remain big challenges;Chinese A-shares will begin to take their place next month in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, a landmark moment that is expected to lead to significant inflows into the world’s second-largest equity market from international investors.Exchange traded funds that track the A-shares market have been a hot area for innovation with 212 ETFs (funds and products) now available, up from just 83 at the end of 2012, according to ETFGI, a London consultancy.The pace of launches for other ETFs tracking Chinese indices has been more modest, with 93 products now available, compared with 63 at the end of 2012.Interest in buying China A-shares ETFs stepped up ahead of MSCI’s decision. Investor inflows had remained muted between 2012 and the end of 2016 before rising to $3bn over the course of last year. New business growth has accelerated this year with net inflows reaching $3bn by the end of April.This contrasts with non A-shares China ETFs, where buying interest has been negligible in 2017 and so far this year.Some observers expected to see “front-running” in anticipation of MSCI’s decision, with nimble traders bidding up Chinese stocks in anticipation of buying interest from other investors. The liquidity provided by ETFs would appear to offer a convenient vehicle for such trades but evidence of any front-running is scant. A-shares have underperformed MSCI’s existing China index, which is based on Hong Kong-quoted H shares, since September.Asset managers have stepped up their efforts to enthuse investors about the inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI benchmark, arguing that it should provide diversification as well as opportunities to earn higher returns.MSCI, however, has cautioned that poor Chinese corporate standards and market volatility will remain big challenges for investors.

65;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-17T23:56:55Z;Loan funds attract new money as interest rates rise;Asset class enjoyed its strongest inflows in more than a year in the past week;Investors put more money into bank loan funds in the past week than at any time in more than a year, as rising interest rates increased the attraction of floating-rate assets over traditional bonds.Loan funds had net inflows of $925m in the week to Wednesday, the largest intake in 55 weeks, according to EPFR Global.The flows came in the same week that the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury hit a seven-year high above 3 per cent, and after shorter-term rates rose sharply this year in line with expectations of Federal Reserve rate hikes.Loans typically pay a floating rate, which increases along with underlying rates. By contrast, rising rates erode the value of fixed-rate securities.Funds that invest in high-yield bonds, which pay a fixed rate, suffered outflows of $1.3bn in the past week, EPFR said.“We have definitely seen a lot of interest,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, citing “the rising rate environment especially on the short end of the curve where the [Federal Reserve] does have a lot of influence”.The US central bank has been raising short-term rates since December 2015, but the pace has accelerated in the past year and a half, pushing short-term rates higher. US three-month Libor has risen to 2.33 per cent from 1.45 per cent at this time last year. Interest on bank loans is typically tied to Libor.Bank loans tend to be senior to other forms of borrowing, putting them high in the pecking order of payments if a company defaults. But these investments are not without risk, especially in times of strong demand.“We have been bullish, but we are starting to get more cautious,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “There has been a lot of new issuance in the first quarter. The problem when borrowers take on more floating rate debt as a percentage of their total liabilities is that it hastens their inability to pay that floating rate coupon.”The value of the US leveraged loan market passed the $1tn mark for the first time in recent weeks, sparking concern in some quarters. Lending standards can deteriorate when demand is strong, and so-called covenant lite loans, which have fewer investor protections, accounted for 80 per cent of the total issued in April, according to S&P Global.Elsewhere in the EPFR data, which covers the week ended on Wednesday, funds investing in Chinese equities attracted $545m of new cash, making for eight consecutive weeks of net inflows. That is the longest streak since the first quarter of 2013.Funds that buy shares of the Greater China area, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as the mainland, drew more than $300m, the most since June 2015.Investors said enthusiasm for the Chinese economy and the inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks, known as A-shares, in the benchmark MSCI emerging market index next month were offsetting concerns about trade tensions with the US.US stock funds also had a good week, with net inflows of $8.8bn, a nine-week high, while emerging market bond funds remained under pressure. Net redemptions for the latter totalled $1.27bn.
66;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-17T14:42:44Z;Chinese stocks/MSCI: passive unaggressive;China presents active investors with a time-limited opportunity, albeit with risk;Great news for stock pickers who know Chinese. Many investors cannot wait to put their money into China via passive funds. MSCI will soon add more than 200 mainland-listed A-shares to three of its indices. This will spur less than $4bn in passive inflows through to September, according to Morgan Stanley. Small beer by the standards of international fund flows. The slightest hint that active managers can make money will lure hot money.Mixed returns since the beginning of the year show much can be made — or lost. One pharma group gained 71 per cent. Insurer New China Life fell more than a third. As a whole, stocks fell roughly 1 per cent, if returns are capitalisation weighted.There is a wall of money waiting to flow into China. Theory suggests that the average investor should allocate as much to China as to Europe and the US. The country’s stock market is the world’s second-largest by market value. China’s share of global output, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is on par with that of Europe and the US.There are obvious problems. The risk of fraud among Chinese businesses is so high it became the subject of a recent movie. Analysts writing negative reports face legal action. Well-known brokers do not yet cover A-shares in sufficient depth. State meddling is an ever-present threat. A “national team” stepped in to “save” the market in 2015. Capital account restrictions make it difficult to take money home.MSCI has lobbied for years to get the government to address its concerns. Its selection criteria aim to exclude the most risky stocks by focusing on large-caps with limited history of suspensions.There are bound to be other attractive opportunities. Research group Gavekal highlights that nine-tenths of the 700 new listings since March 2016 have only limited levels of government ownership. Many of them operate in innovative sectors such as IT and healthcare.Active investors are on the back foot in the west. China presents them with a time-limited opportunity, albeit one fraught with risk. As long as index funds are tentative, they should exploit it.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

67;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-17T10:39:21Z;MSCI warns of investors facing challenges over China A-shares;Market volatility and poor environmental, social and corporate governance pose risks;The company spearheading the inclusion of domestic Chinese shares into a global equity benchmark says investors face big challenges ranging from market volatility to poor corporate governance.MSCI, the world’s leading equity index provider, will add 234 Chinese mainland-listed stocks to its flagship emerging markets index on June 1, obliging international fund managers who follow the benchmark to add domestic Chinese stocks to their portfolios.The move represents a landmark moment in the integration of the world’s second-largest equity market into the global financial system.But investors face challenges ranging from market volatility to poor environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), a measure that helps asset managers mitigate risk.On average, the 234 Chinese companies rank poorly on ESG criteria when compared with other stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, MSCI said.Thirty-seven per cent of the 234 domestic Chinese companies scored the lowest ESG rating of CCC, compared with 8 per cent of companies already in the MSCI EM index, according to MSCI research.At the other end of the scale, only 3 per cent of the Chinese companies were placed in the top three out of seven ESG categories, compared with 22 per cent of the stocks that already comprise the MSCI EM index.“There is a skew in the distribution, so we have more laggards compared to leaders,” said Sebastien Lieblich, managing director, research at MSCI. “Although the Chinese government is pushing a lot of green policies, nevertheless at a company level the ESG consideration has not yet been really embraced.”With this in mind, MSCI is planning to launch China ESG indices sometime this year so that investors can help filter out the more risky companies. MSCI sells ESG ratings and research to its largely institutional investor clients.Low ESG ratings are by no means the only complexity facing investors in A-shares. Another is the volatility in a market still dominated by the seesawing sentiment of Chinese retail investors.Henry Fernandez, chairman and chief executive at MSCI, said: “You have to look at companies, understand that there will be a significant amount of volatility caused by the structure of the market but understand what are the long-term prospects of those companies and stick with them for longer periods.”Stockpickers often see the A-share market as a real opportunity as long as rigour is applied in finding the right companies. “Proprietary in-depth research, frequent company visits, patience and discipline are all essential ingredients to succeed when investing in that market,” said Francois Perrin, Hong Kong-based manager at East Capital.MSCI used quantitative criteria including companies’ market capitalisation, proportion of freely traded shares and recent record on trading suspensions for choosing which stocks to include in its EM index.A second tranche of stocks is set to be added to the index late this year, after which 0.8 per cent of the MSCI EM index will comprise A-shares.The index provider sees this as a first step, with “full inclusion” being achieved when A-shares account for 16 per cent of the MSCI EM benchmark.Already, some 30 per cent of the MSCI EM index consists of Chinese companies but these are listed offshore in Hong Kong and elsewhere and therefore abide by different market rules from A-shares. Nevertheless, after the “full inclusion” of A-shares, Mr Lieblich said, the total cohort of Chinese companies in the EM benchmark index will be close to 45 per cent.Such a weighting, Mr Lieblich said, was more consistent with China’s real economic “heavyweight” position within the emerging world.
68;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-17T04:00:53Z;China A-shares offer conflicting bets over time;Stocks provide little short-term value but are an obvious buy over the long run;The moment to buy Chinese A-shares is almost at hand. The world’s investors have deputed this decision to MSCI, the indexing company that compiles the most widely used emerging markets benchmark, and next month A-shares will begin to take their place.We now have the final details on how the process of including A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets index will unfold. It starts with the inclusion of 234 large-cap A-shares, carefully vetted for their liquidity, next month. Stocks that have had an undue number of trading suspensions, a key reason behind MSCI’s delays in including A-shares, will have to wait further.China’s stocks will be included at a far lighter weight than their market value. To start with, they count for only 5 per cent of market cap, and will be only 0.78 per cent of the index. But while this is not as yet a huge macroeconomic deal, it is the start of a hugely important process — and it is now that institutional investors must decide on their strategies for building exposures to China.It is deeply disquieting that an issue like this should be left to a relatively small for-profit company in Manhattan. Deciding the ground rules for how institutions invest in domestic Chinese stocks should naturally be an issue for democratically accountable regulators or transnational organisations. But as is stands, MSCI’s role remains crucial.Some complain that they are moving too slowly, but without good reason. If fund managers want to invest a large chunk of their funds straight away in A-shares, MSCI has no power to stop them. It is only managers’ aversion to the risks that come with deviating from their benchmark, or just doing something differently from their competitors, that is holding them back.MSCI has moved with commendable caution, and has certainly taken the process far more slowly than Chinese regulators wanted. It is now up to big investors to decide how to respond. Two questions are paramount. First, are there opportunities to find value among the A-shares that have been included in the benchmark? And second, are they a “buy” for the long-term?On the issue of value, it does look as though the MSCI announcement has not prompted the front-running that often accompanies index changes. Since last September, when MSCI started its “inclusion” index of the A-shares that would be included in the benchmark, the favoured A-shares have underperformed MSCI’s existing China index, which is based on Hong Kong-quoted H-shares. The A-shares have gained 4.8 per cent in that time while the H-shares are up 13.6 per cent.The A-shares to be included in the MSCI index are overweight in consumer staples, by far the most successful sector in recent years, which could make the benchmark easier to beat.There is also every reason to assume that the market is inefficient, at least by comparison with developed markets. The limits on ownership and trading are complicated and inconsistently applied, so the existence of some anomalies is inevitable.Even if China’s authorities clean up the rules more quickly than is expected — and MSCI leaves open the chance that it could admit A-shares more quickly if they do — there is the issue that Chinese markets are for now dominated by retail investors, not by institutions. The transition to an institutional market will change them. And, of course, there is the issue of China’s dreadful corporate governance, which introduces levels of risk.Collectively, these A-shares do not offer good value. According to a Liontrust analysis of stocks that are both A-shares and H-shares, the A-shares trade at a premium of almost 30 per cent to H-shares and have done so persistently for the last three years.In the long run, however, A-shares are an obvious buy. Société Générale’s Alain Bokobza says: “With the growing discrepancy between China equities’ minimal weight in indices and their huge size measured by market capitalisation, as well as their fast-growing tradability, China equities might just replace small-caps in global equity portfolios as a source of structural outperformance.” In other words, they start from a lower base and seem an obvious candidate to do better than a benchmark in the longer term.He adds that A-shares offer a mix of “leverage to the country’s domestic economy (something we want to buy for the next decade)” and “de-correlation as they should be largely insensitive to the next US crisis when it occurs”.Big investors have also worked this out. But they know the risks of buying A-shares now. Much rides on how they resolve this conflict between the short- and the long-term.
69;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-05-15T03:36:59Z;MSCI to add 234 Chinese A-shares to flagship index;List of companies spans banking, real estate and consumer sectors;Index provider MSCI has unveiled a list of 234 Chinese mainland-listed stocks to be added to its flagship emerging markets index, an inclusion that represents a key development in the opening of the country’s markets to overseas investors.After months of tweaks, MSCI on Tuesday published the final list of Chinese companies for inclusion in the index at the end of May. The index is used as a benchmark for some $1.6tn of assets globally.The stocks to be added span sectors ranging from banking, such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China, to real estate, including developer China Vanke, and consumer brands such as Qingdao Haier.Although the initial number of stocks is just a sliver of China’s 3,000 renminbi-denominated A-shares, analysts expect it to rise as the country’s markets become increasingly accessible with fewer capital controls.MSCI inclusion will mean that investors in passive funds, such as index trackers and exchange traded funds, will be forced to hold these A-shares.The list had fluctuated because MSCI said any stock that was suspended from trading for more than 50 consecutive days would not be eligible for inclusion. That stipulation came after trading in more than 1,000 Chinese A-shares was suspended in 2015 during the market sell-off in an attempt by companies to stop their share prices from tumbling.The inclusion of the 234 stocks will be done over two stages, at the end of May and end of August. They will represent a 0.78 per cent weighting in the emerging markets index. However, analysts say that could rise to about 16 per cent over time.MSCI had proposed adding A-shares to the Emerging Markets index three times since 2013, but was rebuffed by stakeholders — primarily large asset managers — concerned about their ability to move money more freely in and out of the country.The turning point came with the growth of the stock connect programme, which was created in 2014 but has expanded rapidly over the past few years. The dual trading links between Hong Kong and the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets enable overseas investors to access the China A-share market through their accounts in Hong Kong.MSCI said the reason for the two-stage inclusion process was the fact that there are daily limits on the amounts that can be traded through the stock connects.The stock connect trading limits were increased last month, with the amount of money that can be channelled from Hong Kong into A-shares quadrupling.Analysts at BNP Paribas expect that $20bn could flow into Chinese shares at the end of the initial inclusion process in August, from both passive and actively managed funds.

Stocks that were at all time highs in mid January have dropped a quarter in dollar terms. President Mauricio Macri and his Cambiemos (Let’s Change) party did well in last autumn’s midterm elections. This year, he faces tough questions on the credibility of his economic policies. Optimists hope earnings growth later this year will rescue him. Meanwhile, risk sensitivity is rising as US rates head upward.One wonders why the bond markets eagerly took up Argentina’s 100-year dollar bond last summer. Its price has dropped from over par late last year to 85 cents this past week. Uncertainty about the policy direction of the central bank is partly to blame. Early this year it cut rates by 1.5 percentage points. Last week it reversed course, jerking interest up by nearly 13 points to 40 per cent. Promises to get inflation back towards single digits, from 25 per cent, were shelved in favour of more modest aims. The peso then collapsed.To be fair, Mr Macri had promised to get investment going and there are signs of this. The economy is growing again. Gross fixed capital formation as a slice of GDP should rise from 17 per cent when he took over to almost 20 per cent next year. Construction has shown particular improvement. Earnings for MSCI Argentina index members — in dollar terms — should rise a quarter this year.Unfortunately, a lot was priced in already. Though the stock market may look reasonably valued at 11 times estimated profits, that is well above the average of nine times over the past decade. Some will have anticipated the promotion of Argentina from MSCI’s Frontier index, of which it represents a fifth, to the larger Emerging Markets benchmark later this year.Argentina has a century to scrape together principal to repay its recent bond issue. To guarantee future financings Mr Macri must address the country’s economic woes with far greater urgency.Sign up to Lex’s new midweek newsletter from writers in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong at ft.com/newsletters.
71;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-04-19T21:55:12Z;BlackRock wades into corporate governance conundrum;;BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management company, has said that index providers should leave corporate governance standard-setting to regulators rather than try to engineer improvements through benchmark exclusions.An increasing number of companies — especially in the technology industry — have gone public through selling shares with unequal voting rights, to ensure that the founders keep control of their companies.For example, Dropbox, the cloud storage company, recently listed with a dual-class share structure that mimics those of Facebook and Snap, which corporate governance campaigners argue erodes the control that shareholders can exert over companies.However, that has raised the question of whether the major index providers — primarily S&P Global, MSCI and FTSE Russell — should allow the companies into their flagship products, which would automatically force index-tracking funds that mirror the benchmarks to buy the shares.MSCI earlier this year asked for comments on how it should treat “unequal voting structures”, suggesting that it would still include these companies in its indices but adjust their weightings to “reflect both their free float and their company level listed voting power”.BlackRock on Thursday said that while it was a “strong advocate for sound corporate governance practices” and appreciated MSCI consultation, the biggest provider of exchange traded funds in the world argued that “policymakers, not index providers, should set corporate governance standards,” according to a public letter from Barbara Novick, BlackRock’s vice-chairman, to MSCI’s president Baer Pettit.“While the objectives of MSCI’s proposal are aligned with our view that ‘one vote for one share’ is the preferable structure for publicly traded companies, we believe that an alternative approach would be more effective in achieving this objective while avoiding the significant changes to existing MSCI broad market indexes that would be required to effectuate MSCI’s proposed solution,” Ms Novick added.BlackRock argued that indices should as much as possible reflect the market that they attempt to capture, whether an industry or a country, and worried that limiting the indices would be costly to investors in passive index-tracking funds like ETFs — warning that billions of dollars worth of trades would be needed to adjust to new weightings.Instead, index providers should construct alternative sub-indices based on corporate governance, akin to how many major indices already have versions that screen out tobacco companies or weapons manufacturers.While dual class shares “call into question a fundamental tenet of good corporate governance and undermine the efforts to improve the quality of investor stewardship”, BlackRock argued that in some cases they could have some benefits, even if they should be limited in time, perhaps ending after a preset period.“We believe that regulators in conjunction with listing exchanges should be the arbiters of corporate governance standards for publicly listed companies,” Ms Novick wrote, suggesting that a global body like the International Organisation for Securities Commission could play such a role.“While we recognize that individual countries are not required to implement global standards, the introduction of global principles has worked well in the past to establish a benchmark that creates a level playing field for regulation that is in the best interests of end investors,” she said.
72;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-04-17T12:48:04Z;Big UK companies singled out over poor gender balance;Some 14 companies have all-male executive committees, including BP and Smurfit Kappa;BP, Smurfit Kappa Group and Persimmon have been accused of being “pale, male and stale” as investors called on UK companies to tackle the lack of women in executive and top management roles.The Investment Association, the trade body for asset managers whose members collectively own one-third of the FTSE, and the government-backed Hampton-Alexander Review have written to 35 of the UK’s largest listed companies with low female representation at leadership level, calling for change.Some 14 companies in the FTSE 100 were singled out, including BP, the oil group, and Smurfit Kappa, the packaging company, for having all-male executive committees. The companies did not respond to a request for comment.Letters were also sent to companies that had low representation of women in top management and among their direct reports, including Persimmon, the housebuilder, British American Tobacco, CRH, the building materials company, and Tui, the travel group.Chris Cummings, chief executive of the IA, said investors want boards and leadership teams to urgently address a lack of gender diversity at the UK’s biggest companies, calling it a “business critical issue”.“The body of research is clear: firms with a diverse management team and pipeline make better decisions and drive innovation,” he said.The Hampton-Alexander Review, an independent government commissioned review, has recommended that women account for 33 per cent of senior positions at the UK’s biggest companies by 2020.Mr Cummings added: “The Hampton-Alexander recommendations have now been in place since November 2016. Investors are becoming restless and want companies to take action.”Several big investors have publicly demanded companies step up their efforts on gender diversity. Legal & General Investment Management, one of the biggest investors in the UK stock market, this week warned that it would vote against companies at annual meetings where women did not make up at least 25 per cent of the board.Sir Philip Hampton, chair of the Hampton-Alexander Review, said that while many FTSE companies are improving when it comes to diversity, there was a “significant minority” that were making limited or no progress.“The gap between those working hard to improve gender balance and those doing very little has never been more obvious,” he added.According to the Hampton-Alexander review, companies including the AA, Melrose Industries, the buyout group, and pub chain Wetherspoons did not respond to its request for data on gender diversity in 2017. Those companies were also sent a letter from the IA and the Hampton-Alexander review this month.Andrew Griffiths, business minister, said diversity at the top of businesses “has proven time and again to make for more effective leadership”.“While some of the UK’s largest companies have made great strides in recent years to improve diversity in the boardroom, we need all FTSE 350 firms to pull their weight if we’re to become a world leader on gender diversity,” he added.Several studies have found that companies with diverse management teams and boards perform better. Research in 2015 by index provider MSCI found that companies with more women on their boards delivered a 36 per cent better return on equity.
73;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-04-12T04:01:07Z;UK passive fund investors catch Russian chill;Stocks hit by US sanctions as diplomatic tension rises;British investors in emerging market funds are feeling the effects of rising diplomatic tension between Russia and the West and could be more exposed than they realise through the presence of Russian stocks in mainstream funds.Stocks from the country feature prominently in market benchmarks used as investment templates by billions of pounds of passive funds, meaning investors do not need to have purchased Russian funds to be exposed to the country’s risks.James McManus, analyst at online wealth manager Nutmeg, said Russia formed about 3.5 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Market index widely used by passive emerging markets funds and a larger chunk of the FTSE Emerging Index. “The impact is clearly not as severe as if you were to invest directly in Russia, but it is certainly moving the price.”Mr McManus added: “There are a large number of active fund managers investing in emerging markets who have chosen to go overweight Russia, who will be impacted.”Russia constitutes 67 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Eastern Europe Index and makes up just under 5 per cent of the FTSE Emerging Index, which is followed by the mainstream passive emerging market funds.Investors who hold popular emerging markets funds such as the $6bn iShares Emerging Markets exchange traded fund (ETF) will have between 3 and 4 per cent of their portfolios in Russian stocks.About £8bn of investors’ money is also invested in Russia via the FTSE Emerging Index, used as a template by about £200bn of mainstream emerging markets funds, including the Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF.Just under 100 active open-ended funds in the UK have more than 5 per cent exposure to Russia and 30 have more than 10 per cent, including emerging market funds such as Legg Mason Emerging Markets Equity and global funds such as Neptune Emerging Markets.The latter has a 13.21 per cent weighting towards Russia and has lost almost 6 per cent over one month. Eastern European and Russian funds have been hardest hit. Since April 1, JPM Russia is down 11.3 per cent, Baring Russia is down 12.2 per cent and European funds, including Invesco Perpetual Emerging European, are down more than 10 per cent.“The question for investors is whether things could worsen from here,” said Mr McManus. “Certainly the US sanctions are a strong signal of intent and are not something that will be unwound quickly. I doubt many investors think this is just a spell of price volatility and that there will be a rebound shortly.”Last week’s US sanctions have taken their toll on Russian stocks, which experienced their worst day of trading in four years on Monday.Index providers have introduced ways for investors to avoid Russian stocks. MSCI said this week it would block any US-sanctioned Russian company from its indices.None of the 14 companies sanctioned feature in MSCI’s equity benchmarks, but in a notice to the market on April 10, MSCI said it would “not add securities of any of these companies to the MSCI Equity Indexes until further notice”.The benchmark provider said it would also delete any companies or securities owned by a person or company on the sanctions list from its benchmarks, in line with the US rules.It is not the first time MSCI has stepped in to protect investors from sanctions. In 2014, MSCI imposed penalties on Rosneft, Transneft, Sberbank and VTB following sanctions imposed against those companies by the EU and US in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea.The EU and US sanctions banned investors from helping Russian companies raise money by buying their shares or buying Russian bonds.As a result, MSCI said it would allow Rosneft, Transneft, Sberbank and VTB to remain in its indices but would limit their presence in its indices and potentially scrap them altogether if they attempted to raise money from investors by issuing new shares.Pavlo Taranenko, index research executive director, said: “Our indices have to be accessible and investible and applicable. If a big chunk of international investors are not able to trade the stocks in our index then they would not be replicable.”In 2014 FTSE also introduced a series of ex-Russia indices in response to EU and US sanctions on Russia in 2014, to enable investors to eliminate Russia from their portfolios.Investors can shun Russia by selecting funds that track one of the seven indices, including the FTSE Emerging ex Russia index and the FTSE All-World ex Russia index.FTSE said this week it would delete two Russian companies affected by sanctions from eight of its benchmarks, including the popular FTSE All-World index.The index, whose benchmarks are tracked by $15tn dollars worldwide, will delete aluminium producer Rusal, led by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, and his London-listed holding company EN+ Group from its benchmarks on Friday April 13 in a bid to protect investors from sanctions.Rusal will be removed from six indices, including the FTSE All-World index and FTSE Developed index, and EN+ will be cut from two benchmarks, resulting in the loss of foreign investment.The companies did not respond to requests for comment by the Financial Times.This article has been amended since original publication to reflect FTSE’s decision to delete Rusal and EN+ Group from benchmark indices
74;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-03-15T15:19:57Z;Value investors set to reap benefits of steady EM growth;Tentative signs of a style rotation, with key MSCI index up 7.2% since late November;Last year was a very successful one for emerging market equities, with earnings growth of 22 per cent helping to propel a 35 per cent leap in the flagship MSCI index, its strongest showing since 2009.Perhaps unsurprisingly, most analysts expect something of a pause for breath in 2018: a more modest consensus earnings growth forecast of 14 per cent is suggestive of a more becalmed backdrop.Life, though, can change fast in emerging markets. UBS, whose forecasts were previously a little below consensus, has sharply revised up its estimate for earnings growth this year to 18.8 per cent, based on aggregating the bottom-up forecasts of its army of EM analysts. This would represent a minimal slowdown from 2017.And if UBS is correct, among the biggest winners could be downtrodden value investors.Value stocks, typically defined as those with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings multiple, have underperformed the broader emerging market index for each of the past six years, being trounced by flashy growth stocks by 19 percentage points in 2017 alone.Yet, while it is far too soon to call a definitive changing of the guard, there are tentative signs of a style rotation. Since late November, the MSCI Emerging Markets Value index has risen 7.2 per cent, outstripping the 4.8 per cent return of its Growth equivalent.This is in stark contrast to the situation in the US, where the S&P 500 Pure Growth index has continued to outshine its Value sibling, beating it by more than 3 percentage points.The UBS numbers, though, hold out hope for value investors that the recent pick-up in their fortunes may be a sign of things to come.One of its biggest calls is that the EM bank sector, which eked out modest earnings growth of 6.1 per cent last year, after two straight years of declining earnings, will see growth jump to 19 per cent in 2018.Financial stocks have not always been seen as a classic value play but, as a result of their woeful showing in recent years, no less than five — China Construction Bank, ICBC, Ping An Insurance, Bank of China and Banco Bradesco — are among the 10 largest stocks in the MSCI EM Value Index.Geoff Dennis, head of global emerging markets equity strategy at UBS, believes we are approaching a sweet spot for financials, an important sector that accounts for 24.3 per cent of the EM index, after a disappointing 2017.Some countries, particularly those in the Gulf that run dollar currency pegs, will have to raise interest rates this year as the US tightens, allowing banks to improve their net interest margins, Mr Dennis says.Moreover, credit cycles are beginning or are about to begin in Brazil, Russia, central Europe, India and parts of south-east Asia, he asserts, with the improving global economy providing a further tailwind.Daniel Salter, head of emerging market equity strategy at Renaissance Capital, an EM-focused investment bank, also expects “quite a decent rebound” in banks’ earnings this year, arguing that bad debt levels should fall as a result of the synchronised global economic recovery, even as margins are no longer “crushed”.Moreover, more widespread emerging market growth could encourage investors to favour broad exposure to these economies, potentially via banks, rather than having to seek out isolated, and expensive, fast-growing areas, such as technology or Russian retailers.With 2017’s all-conquering IT sector unlikely to repeat last year’s heroics (UBS forecasts earnings growth will slow from 48.1 per cent to 19.3 per cent), some other value plays can come to the fore. UBS’s most bullish forecast for this year is for the beaten-up utilities sector, where forecast earnings growth of 32.5 per cent is a far cry from the 5.7 per cent contraction witnessed in 2017.A style rotation is more than overdue. In December, the valuation gap between growth and value stocks, whether measured in terms of the gulf in price/book or price/earnings ratios, hit the highest level since comparable data began in 2006, although it has since narrowed a fraction.The past 12 months also threw up another anomaly. During the four previous bouts of dollar weakness since 2002, EM value stocks comfortably outperformed growth ones, but that relationship broke down in 2017.With many expecting the greenback to fall again this year, the previous pattern could reassert itself.Valuation-wise, modestly higher interest rates would be expected to favour value stocks. As Mr Salter points out, fast-growing companies are largely prized for their anticipated future earnings streams, which are subjected to a steeper discount rate in a higher rate environment.Mr Dennis believes that if financial stocks are in better shape, we will get rotation from growth to value “almost by definition”.“There is something of a rotation in terms of where the earnings growth is going to come from and value has beaten growth since late November, when it became clear that the US tax reform was going to pass,” says Mr Dennis. “We are in a sweet spot of value beating growth.”steve.johnson@ft.com
75;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MSCI launches 12 new China equities indices;;Global index provider MSCI has launched 12 A-share indices ahead of the inclusion of mainland Chinese stocks in its flagship emerging markets benchmark, which will fully open up the market to international investors for the first time.MSCI said on Wednesday that the new indices provide a greater range of ways to access specific parts of the A-shares market, which are stocks listed on the exchanges in mainland China. The range includes the MSCI China A index, the MSCI A Large Cap index, and the MSCI China A Mid Cap index, among others. The launch comes ahead of the inclusion of A-shares within MSCI’s flagship Emerging Markets index in June, as well as its MSCI ACWI index. Bringing A-Shares into the EM index will compel global investors, ranging from large pension funds to asset managers that track the benchmark to invest in these Chinese mainland stocks. The move fully opens up access to the mainland Chinese stock market for global investors, who have traditionally invested in Hong Kong listed Chinese companies, or through Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s trading programme, called Stock Connect, which allows overseas investors to buy A-shares via Hong Kong.
76;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-03-12T03:00:24Z;Gender-diverse companies are more productive;MSCI finds more women in the workplace has material impact on investor returns;Gender diversity on a company’s management board has a significant impact on productivity growth and on returns to investors, according to research published to mark International Women’s day by MSCI.The indices and analytics provider examined the composition of boards at 617 of the world’s largest companies. It found that average employee productivity growth was higher for companies that employed three or more women at board level between 2012 and 2016 than those that had just a single or no female directors.Companies that employed a gender-diverse board and which also followed best practice standards in human capital management were able to deliver even higher productivity growth over the same time period.MSCI found that the stronger productivity growth at these leading companies translated into higher profits, measured by returns on equity, than at those which did not have gender diverse boards.Dividend payouts to investors were higher too for these diversity-friendly companies than at those where boards are dominated by men and which failed to disclose any evidence of their plans to foster the development of female talent.MSCI said its findings provided support for the argument that meaningful gender diversity at the board level was also a reflection of the importance paid by companies to the recruitment and development of both male and female talent.Women remain remarkably under-represented in senior corporate roles globally and account for fewer than one in five board directors of the world’s leading publicly traded companies.Just 17.3 per cent of board seats were held by women at the 2,494 companies spread across 47 countries that comprise the MSCI All Country World index.MSCI’s findings that gender diversity can boost returns may spur change.
77;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-02-22T12:14:42Z;Asia to account for 75% of EM index in proposed shake-up;MSCI proposes cutting weight of stocks with unequal voting rights;Latin America’s dwindling weight in the closely followed MSCI Emerging Markets equity index is set to plunge still further under proposals from the US index group.MSCI has proposed adjusting the weighting of companies in its global index family to reflect the proportion of voting power held by freely floating stock.The move would cut the weighting of companies whose founders maintain control by issuing publicly listed stock with low, or even non-existent, voting rights — a powerful punishment in an investment world increasingly driven by index weightings.It comes against a backdrop of Asian technology companies, in particular, looking to ape their US peers and list with dual-class share structures, allowing the founders to retain the majority of the voting rights while monetising the bulk of their ownership rights.Last month the Singapore exchange said it would allow such dual-class structures for the first time, while Hong Kong has laid out plans to follow suit in the second half of the year as both venues seek to compete with the New York Stock Exchange, which has accommodated dual-listed shares since the late 1980s and has attracted the likes of Alibaba, China’s dominant e-commerce group, as a result.However, as things stand, MSCI’s proposals would have most impact on Latin American markets, where preference shares, which do not carry voting rights, have long been commonplace — and propel Asia beyond three-quarters of the global emerging market benchmark for the first time.If enacted, Brazil’s weight in the MSCI EM index — tracked by an estimated $1.6tn of assets — would fall by 21.8 per cent, with two companies, Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Brazil’s biggest retailer, and Suzano Papel e Celulose, ejected altogether because their listed stock carries no voting rights. Others, such as Itaú Unibanco, Banco Bradesco and Petrobras, would be cut back heavily.Colombia and Mexico would also have their weights cut by 20 per cent, with the latter seeing Coca-Cola Femsa ejected from the index entirely and the weight of telecoms group América Móvil slashed by 95 per cent.Overall, Latin America’s representation in the flagship EM index would slide from 13 per cent to 10.7 per cent, a far cry from the 25-30 per cent weighting it enjoyed in the early 2000s.Elsewhere, the United Arab Emirates would see its weighting fall 23 per cent and South Africa 19 per cent, with the former’s Emirates Telecom (also known as Etisalat) discarded from the benchmark and the latter’s Naspers, a media group whose prime asset is a 34 per cent stake in Chinese internet powerhouse Tencent, cut back by 62 per cent.As a result, the weight of the broader emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa region would slip from 15 per cent to 14.2 per cent, again less than half of its 30 per cent level in the early 2000s.Despite a cut in weightings for the likes of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and Chinese duo Baidu and JD.com, Asia’s dominance would increase, with its weight rising from 72 per cent to an unprecedented 75.1 per cent, compared to 40 per cent in 2000, as shown in the tables.In the developed world, Alphabet, the parent of Google, and Facebook would be among the companies that would see their market weighting fall sharply. The overall impact is likely to be greater in emerging markets however, given that MSCI is a more dominant index provider in EMs, and that companies accounting for 20 per cent of the weight of its EM index have share classes with disparate voting rights, twice the figure for the MSCI World Index.MSCI proposes that the changes would apply to new index constituents from November this year or May 2019, but not to existing index constituents for a further three years.Despite the increased geographical concentration that would spring from MSCI’s proposed changes, it has its supporters.“The increasing prevalence of companies issuing dual, or even multiple, classes of shares is a significant concern,” says David Smith, head of Asian corporate governance at Aberdeen Standard Investments.“Many of these structures are designed to give a founder, or founders, absolute and unaccountable control over a company, effectively for the rest of their life. As an investment proposition that is unappealing.“We have a responsibility to our clients to act as an active steward and to hold management and boards to account,” Mr Smith adds. “Voting rights are a crucial tool through which to do this. [MSCI’s proposals] should provide an additional incentive for companies to change”.Jonathan Lowe, investment director, emerging markets Asia Pacific equities, at JPMorgan Asset Management, says the proposals “probably make sense”.“From a corporate governance perspective we were against [Hong Kong’s decision to allow dual share class listings for the first time since the 1980s] but we lost the battle. We feel it’s a retrograde step.”Hermes Investment Management, noted for its strong focus on corporate governance, is also supportive, arguing that “anything that enhances shareholder democracy makes sense to us”.Alongside a rise in the number of companies seeking to list equities with weak or non-existent voting rights, MSCI’s move has been driven by the growth of passive investing.An active manager “can either sell [their] shares or vote against the management” if they disagree with a board’s decisions, says Daniel Salter, head of emerging market equity strategy at Renaissance Capital, an EM-focused investment bank.“If you run a passive fund all you can do is vote. If that vote is taken away from you or diminished you just become like a pawn, there isn’t much you can do.”The proposed rule change, which is the subject of a consultation, would not apply to the MSCI Frontier Index, which covers markets that are too small or illiquid to be included in the EM Index, however.Lionel Ebener, vice-president for equity research at MSCI, said this was to avoid reducing “the investable opportunity set” of these markets still further, although it will seek feedback from investors on this exemption.Some have reservations about MSCI’s broader proposals, though. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and provider of passive funds, said in a statement it was “a strong advocate for equal voting rights for all shareholders”, particularly in deciding matters such as executive pay and related-party transactions.However, BlackRock went on to say that “policymakers, not index providers, should set equity investing and corporate governance standards” and that benchmark indices “should be as expansive and diverse as the underlying industries and economies whose performance they seek to capture”.Mr Salter, and indeed BlackRock, suggest one solution would be for index groups to provide a range of indices, allowing investors to choose whether they want to follow the existing MSCI EM index or a new version with lower weights for stocks with unequal voting rights.In emerging markets, in particular, Mr Salter argues that even one share, one vote often does not mean much.“The overwhelming number of EM companies are either controlled by a founder, a family, an oligarch or the state, so even if the shares are equal weighted most people understand that their vote has limited value in many cases,” he argues.For his part, Mr Lowe expresses “surprise” that preference shares have been caught up in the campaign against unequal voting rights, given that investors do at least receive something in return for not having a vote, with their stock being ranked above ordinary shares in companies’ capital structures and typically having priority in terms of dividends.“I have got no problem with that, you get something in return for not having a vote. It makes sense to include [preference shares] in the index,” says Mr Lowe, who adds that he would be “very surprised” if MSCI’s proposals were not “watered down” before coming into effect.
78;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-02-18T07:00:27Z;Big investors champion the battle for more women on boards;Asset owners and managers are pushing for greater gender equality;Days before the 100-year anniversary of some women in the UK achieving the vote, Victoria Atkins, the recently appointed women’s minister, called for more women to hold top roles in corporate Britain.Speaking at an event at the London Stock Exchange organised by the 30% Club, an organisation that lobbies for greater female representation at the top of business, the minister said that by the end of 2020, women should account for a third of board directors in the UK’s largest listed companies, according to recommendations put forward in 2015.“We are still at around 25 per cent of women occupying board seats in the FTSE 350,” she said. “We have only two years to go.”She added that while progress had been made over the past century in the push for gender equality, both in business and politics, there was “still more to do”.Ms Atkins said: “[It is] important asset managers nudge companies in the right direction.”In the past, some asset managers have been reluctant to back explicit targets of numbers of women on boards, with one senior figure in the investment industry saying he wanted the best people on the board, regardless of gender.But other investors have in recent years stepped up their efforts to demand companies hire more female board directors. Some 27 investors managing £10.5tn, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Japan’s GPIF, the biggest pension fund globally, have signed up to the 30% Club’s investor group to push for more women on boards in the UK, while investors have also backed similar efforts in Canada and Australia.More than 40 per cent of big asset owners, which hold $8tn in assets, are engaging with the companies in which they invest over board diversity, according to research last year by New Financial, the consultancy.Brenda Trenowden, global chair of the 30% Club, says investors are paying more attention to the issue because of growing awareness about the benefits of diverse boards. “Momentum has really picked up,” she says.Numerous studies have found that companies with diverse management teams and boards perform more strongly. Research in 2015 by index provider MSCI found that companies with more women on their boards delivered a 36 per cent better return on equity.We have had more buy-in than ever before. Companies are not going to be on the wrong side of thatAnother study of more than 21,000 public companies in 91 countries by the Peterson Institute, a US think-tank, and EY, the professional services firm, found that bringing more women into higher management boosted profitability.“The world is changing fast and businesses need to stay one step ahead to succeed,” says Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency and its pension fund’s investment committee. “Increasing diversity is essential for the survival of businesses in 2018, let alone in the coming years.”On the back of investor pressure and government initiatives, many countries have reported a rise in the number of women on boards. Women account for about a quarter of board directors in the FTSE 100, compared with just 12.5 per cent in 2011. In Norway — which was the first country in the world to introduce board diversity quotas — and in France, that number was about 40 per cent in 2016, according to a report by Egon Zehnder, the recruitment firm.But not all companies are making swift progress. In the UK, businesses such as Sports Direct, the retailer, Metro Bank, the high-street lender, and Mitchells & Butlers, which operates the popular Toby Carvery and All Bar One pub chains, have either no women or just one woman on their boards.Metro Bank said it took “diversity extremely seriously and are actively looking to strengthen our board”.Sports Direct said: “We are mindful of the value of female representation on the board, and we intend to address this in due course.”According to BoardEx, the research company, women account for less than a third of board members on 192 of the FTSE 250 companies, while a further 68 FTSE 100 companies have yet to make the 33 per cent target.Ms Trenowden admits it will not be easy to hit the 33 per cent target if the FTSE 250 is included, because it includes smaller companies in obscure sectors. “It is going to be challenging but I think we will make a good go of it,” she says.Some investors have already signalled they plan to take tougher action to force companies to address the under-representation of women. This month, the Church Investors Group, a coalition of 61 members, including the pension funds for the Church of England and the Methodist Church, warned they would vote against the chair of the board nomination committee at listed UK companies where women account for less than 33 per cent of board members.Join the the author of the Everyday Sexism project in a live discussion with the FT’s Isabel Berwick on February 28 in LondonJessica Ground, global head of stewardship at Schroders, says the company planned to pay closer attention to “laggards” around the world in the year ahead.Schroders itself is not a member of the 30% Club, but has signed up to other initiatives to promote gender equality. The FTSE 100 company has pledged that one-third of its board will be women by 2020, in line with the Davies review recommendations. Women currently account for a quarter of its board members.Outside of the UK, countries such as Ireland, where women account for just 10 per cent of directors at Irish-listed companies, and Japan, where that number stood at 5 per cent in 2016, also face an uphill battle to increase the number of female board members.Limited progress has been made in the US, with the number of female board directors remaining at around 20 per cent for the four years to the end of 2016, according to Egon Zehnder.But Ms Trenowden says that companies globally that fail to recruit female directors face reputational risks, as well as putting their business in jeopardy of not understanding their client base properly.“We have had more buy-in than ever before. Companies are not going to be on the wrong side of that. They are going to realise there is more risk in doing nothing than doing something.”

IPO bankers point to possible multibillion IPOs of Xiaomi, Lufax and Alibaba subsidiaries as examples of issuers eyeing dual-class shares.“If HKEX is able to provide this platform [dual-class] it will help a lot of tech companies in China consider coming to Hong Kong for listing,” says Benson Wong, partner at PwC.Dual-class shares have a lot of promise in Asia, which hosts a large number of technology start-ups — which favour equity funding — and family-run companies, where founders want to preserve control to pass on to their sons and daughters.Mr Wong says technology groups account for almost a third of Hong Kong IPO fundraising, compared to just 3 per cent two years ago.In the past couple of months, HKEX has laid out plans for enabling “ innovative ” companies to list with dual-class shares in the second half of this year, while Singapore’s exchange revealed on Friday that it has also given the green light.But a backlash is brewing, and not just in Asia. The New York Stock Exchange has accommodated dual-class shares since the late 1980s, and is now the go-to venue for tech companies. However, when digital social media company Snap listed last year, it offered investors no voting rights, prompting FTSE Russell to exclude it from indices.Index provider MSCI is consulting with the market on whether to exclude certain companies with dual-share classes, citing governance concerns. A spokesperson for the index provider says “a discussion paper on the topic will be released in the near future”. The action risks stripping from index funds scores of companies and billions of dollars in shares.Fidelity Investment’s Jenn-Hui Tan, head of capital markets and corporate governance for Asia Pacific, says that independent oversight of a company “is undermined if management is able to appoint their own boards through superior voting rights”.Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton Investments, says that “all shareholders, regardless of share class, should be treated fairly”.However, while many fund managers are decrying the development, few, if any, are abstaining from investing, out of fear of missing out on lucrative returns.Google is among the earliest tech giants to have listed with a dual-class structure on the Nasdaq at $85 a share in 2004. It is now trading at $1,164. Facebook, which listed in 2012 at $38 a share, is trading at $185. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group which floated on NYSE at $68 a share in 2014, is now at $184.Notably, while Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and Aberdeen are wary of dual-class shares, none boycott dual-class securities.Exchanges argue that investor protection is high on the agenda. “We actually have a large number of companies that are family or state controlled,” Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, tells the FT. “So the entire protection measures of our regime is about protecting the little guy against the abuse of the big guy.”The Hong Kong exchange has proposed that weighted voting rights disappear if shares are passed on or if the owner dies, among other protection measures.Asian exchanges also argue that, if they cannot do it, others will. Mr Li is particularly concerned about losing listings to New York — last year, 17 Chinese companies opted to list on the New York Stock Exchange.For HKEX, the pain from Chinese technology company Alibaba’s decision to do its $25bn listing on NYSE in 2014 — because Hong Kong would not let it use a listing structure similar to dual-class shares — still smarts.Mr Li said that Alibaba’s decision to float on NYSE forced him to rethink the exchange’s policy. Hong Kong’s market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, has signalled its support of the proposal, after it rejected similar plans a couple of years ago.Singapore’s stock exchange said last week it will allow companies to list with dual-class shares this year. Loh Boon Chye, chief executive of SGX, says Singapore is “making huge efforts to transition into the ‘new economy’”. But the exchange will not be as “prescriptive” as the HKEX in the type of company that can list with no-voting securities, he adds.Investors seem resigned to the reality of dual-class shares, but many are still wary of giving Asian groups another means to abuse minority investors.“We don’t feel the safeguards are going to work very effectively and we don’t think the [Hong Kong] exchange will be able to enforce them effectively, if at all, because the exchange has limited powers, it is a private company,” says Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association. “All it can do is reprimand, suspend or de-list.”
80;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2018-01-04T12:08:30Z;Emerging market currencies head for six-year highs;;Emerging market currencies have recovered to their pre-taper tantrum peak and were making further gains on Thursday morning, lifting a key index close to its highest level in more than six years.The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index ended trading on Wednesday at 1687.07, its highest level since early May 2013 – shortly before the then Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke sparked the so-called “taper tantrum” by unexpectedly suggesting the Fed could start rolling back its quantitative easing policy.The index – which is based on a basket of emerging market currencies – lost more than five per cent of its value over the following two months and struggled to build a sustained recovery over the next few years as commodity prices slumped.However, EM assets have recovered since early 2016, and a particularly strong end to 2017 and bumper first week of 2018 has pushed the index within sight of its highest level since August 2011 – when the extent of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis sparked widespread selling across markets.Most EM currencies were making further gains across the board on Thursday morning. The Turkish lira climbed 0.6 per cent against the dollar, while the rand climbed 0.5 per cent and the Mexican peso gained 0.4 per cent. (The wobbly dollar is of course helping here.)MSCI’s index is heavily weighted toward emerging markets in Asia, meaning it has also benefited from China’s unexpected economic resilience over recent months. Other popular indices such as JP Morgan’s EM currency measure, in contrast, have not recovered as quickly.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch this week noted that overall fundamentals across emerging markets remained “solid”, despite vulnerabilities in some individual countries such as South Africa and Turkey.The optimism has fed through into equity markets, with MSCI’s main emerging market stock index already at its highest level since 2011, and picking up further gains this week. At the national level, Turkey’s Bist 100 and Brazil’s Bovespa both hit all-time highs earlier this week.Ross Teverson, manager of Jupiter Asset Management’s Global Emerging Markets Fund, predicted at the end of last year that the recent rally still has some space to run, noting that “with the backdrop of continued earnings growth for emerging markets as a whole, and a number of tailwinds powering the sector forward, we believe a strong case can still be made for emerging and frontier market equities”.
81;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
82;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-11-27T05:29:30Z;Child labour fuels fear of reputational risk;MSCI compiled list of 62 companies facing allegations of employing underage workers;Controversy surrounding school-age interns working illegal overtime at Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple, the US iPhone maker, is fuelling concerns that many more companies could be exposed to reputational damage and legal challenges for using child labour.Companies worldwide are under pressure to act following a commitment by world leaders at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July to take “immediate and effective measures” to eliminate child labour by 2025.Asset managers are also under pressure to address the issue of child labour as corporate governance stewards and long-term investors in listed companies.Almost one in 10 children worldwide, an estimated 152m aged between five and 17, are employed as child labour, with more than half involved in hazardous work that threatens their health or safety, according to the International Labor Organisation, the Geneva-based UN agency.“The issue of child labour in supply chains extends to most [corporate] sectors and most regions of the world,” the ILO said.Apple is one of a list of 62 companies compiled by MSCI, the data provider, that face allegations of either directly employing underage workers or engaging suppliers that use child labour.MSCI’s list is not intended as an exposé of companies that are guilty of malpractice. It offers no evidence of actual use of child labour beyond reference to allegations by unspecified NGOs and media outlets which it has communicated to the companies in question and invited them to respond to.MSCI is concerned that child labour allegations could point to other unresolved corporate governance issues that would be of concern to long-term institutional investors.Leslie Swynghedauw, a senior associate at MSCI who carried out the research, said: “Poor management of child-labour related risks may be linked to a general lack of risk oversight,” saidShe added that the systematic use of child labour by a company could cast doubt on the long-term sustainability of its business model.Japan Tobacco, one of the companies on the MSCI list, said it was committed to eliminating the issue of child labour in the communities where it conducted business.Japan Tobacco created a programme known as Arise in partnership with the ILO in 2011, aimed at ensuring that children do not become involved in tobacco farming by providing educational materials, after-school tutoring and vocational training for older children. It also provides support scholarships to replace lost income from child workers to help parents send their children to school.“We will not walk away from our commitment to help eliminate child labour and improve the lives of our farmers, their families and the communities in which we work,” it said.Imperial Brands, another tobacco manufacturer on the list, said that the monitoring of child labour was part of its engagement with its suppliers.“Our projects seek to mitigate child labour risk by supporting farmer incomes, improving agricultural techniques, food security and access to finance and education,” a spokesman said.British American Tobacco, the company that faces the most allegations, said it was aware that around 130,000 school-age children were living on farms that supplied BAT.“We recognise that these children are particularly vulnerable to child labour and that we need to continually work to ensure our child labour policy is effectively and consistently applied across our supply chain.” It added that there was “absolutely no evidence” to support allegations that BAT had employed child workers in Bangladesh and that it was working with the government in Indonesia to address the issue.The way to deal with these issues is not to sell or divest but for investors to engage with companies. That is where the real job startsFoxconn stopped school-age interns from working illegal overtime at its Zhengzhou plant in central China after a report last week in the FT.The company turned to cheap student labour in September to catch up with orders, after a shortage of workers caused delays in production of Apple’s anniversary iPhone X.Christine Chow, an associate director at Hermes, the £30bn London-based asset manager, visited one of the Chinese factories in Chengdu last year and has held several conversations with Foxconn and Apple about student labour.“Foxconn has acknowledged that the oversight of student workers should have been more stringent. We have also questioned how Apple intends to improve its monitoring process outside of regular audits. Hermes has made it clear that both companies need to demonstrate that they understand the importance that global investors attach to labour standards. We feel more work needs to be done by both companies to improve their disclosure and communication practices around these issues,” says Ms Chow.The London Metal Exchange last week launched an investigation into whether cobalt may have come from mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo accused of employing children.Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable finance at Nordea Wealth Management, part of the Nordic bank, has visited the DRC several times to evaluate mining operations. He said “no action” has been taken in the DRC to ensure a sustainable supply of cobalt, which is in high demand from makers of mobile phones and electric vehicles.Nordea, however, has decided against selling its holdings of companies that use cobalt.“The way to deal with these issues is not to sell or divest but for investors to engage with companies. That is where the real job starts. It may be better for some kids to do some work or they end up living on the streets, but it is also essential to ensure that these children go to school and receive a good education,” said Mr Beslik.Problems with the use of child labour occur widely across countries in Asia in the second or third tier of suppliers working for multinationals.“It is necessary to engage all the way along the supply chain if we are to deal with the issue of child labour,” said Ms Chow.
83;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-11-27T05:00:31Z;ESG investing and smart beta combination grows in popularity;A responsible tilt for a niche strategy;A “niche of a niche” is one description of the combination of socially responsible investment with smart beta factors. The practice of marrying the two approaches is far from mainstream, but both strategies are growing in popularity, particularly among institutional investors.The recent launch of indices and funds offering smart beta incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations indicates there is investor appetite out there.MSCI brought out its New Factor ESG Target Indexes in September, for example. These allow investors to integrate a responsible investment approach alongside smart beta factors that hunt good-value and low-volatility assets.Candriam Investors Group introduced a range of specialised ETFs in June. In the US, providers Oppenheimer, NuShares and Columbia Threadneedle run socially responsible smart beta ETFs.A survey by FTSE Russell shows nearly half (46 per cent) of global asset owners have an allocation to smart beta, and 41 per cent of those using it or considering its use anticipate applying ESG considerations.The trend for big pension funds and similar investors to incorporate ESG screening in investment strategies is well established. “In the Nordics and Australia, in particular, it is the price of institutional admission [as an asset manager],” says Heidi Ridley, global chief executive of Rosenberg Equities, the quantitative arm of Axa Investment Managers.Adding an ESG screen to smart beta strategies generally entails applying a filter for ESG factors before adding the traditional smart beta factor tilts such as momentum or value. Approaches on screening vary but are likely to both exclude stocks based on measures of controversy such as tobacco or arms, and to make a positive selection of stocks with good ESG ratings, such as green energy.Rosenberg has been running a combined strategy for three years, and by the end of this year will have added ESG screening to all its strategies. The approach adds value and “fits well with our long-term philosophy, as even in our smart beta strategies, we are not looking for short term factors”, says Ms Ridley.The investment manager evaluates companies on the basis of volatility, quality, tail risk and ESG.Ossiam, an affiliate manager of Natixis Global Asset Management, is a quantitative investment specialist. In June, the provider merged its main minimum variance fund with an ESG filtered version. Bruno Monnier, portfolio manager at Ossiam, says there are further smart beta factors that offer synergies with ESG, and the group plans to switch at least half of its fund range to an ESG-filtered methodology.The main challenge in running ESG-filtered smart beta strategies, according to Ms Ridley, lies in having a sufficiently broad universe of stocks to allow for screening.State Street Global Advisors, which is preparing to launch a fund combining ESG screening and smart beta early next year, has identified similar difficulties. Stocks rated highly for ESG may not have the required smart beta characteristics — SSGA focuses on factors including value, low-volatility and momentum — and vice versa.I don’t believe we should have general ESG ratings published . . . as a universal truthHighly rated ESG stocks do not score well for momentum and are typically larger cap. This makes it difficult to apply a rules-based approach, says Jennifer Bender, director of research for the global equity beta solutions team at SSGA. “Fortunately, modern portfolio construction techniques offer a way to solve the problem,” she adds.Data issues are another hurdle. Companies are not typically required to disclose on ESG matters, as they are on financial ones. “We hired people to do research company-by-company,” says Ms Bender, but a lot of the information remains subjective. There is also significant variation across data providers.The lack of standardisation is not necessarily viewed as a problem. “I don’t believe we should have general ESG ratings published on Bloomberg as a universal truth,” says Koen Van de Maele, global head of investment solutions at Candriam.“It is better to have your own screening process and approach to ESG integration and not to over-simplify.”Those yet to enter this niche market question whether there is sufficient demand. “The difficulty is ensuring that what we build meets the demand of enough investors to be worth building,” says Chris Mellor, head of equity and commodity product management, Emea, at Invesco’s PowerShares.“There are almost as many approaches to ESG as there are investors”, he says.ESG is not a factor in the same way as momentum or value. It is, rather, a risk-and-return characteristic, but it has yet to be established that it offers a reliable long-term premium, argues Ms Bender.Still, for some investors, it is increasingly a starting point in their investment decisions.
84;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-11-24T04:00:37Z;Mushrooming stock indices reveal market revolution;Passive investing created very profitable, if unsexy, industry but a price war is here;If “Rocket Man” and “The Donald” ever trigger a nuclear apocalypse between North Korea and the US, the only survivors will probably be cockroaches and financial indices.The latter have certainly demonstrated a roach-like ability to proliferate. As a recent Bernstein report noted, there are now more than 1m indices but just 43,000 stocks — and that number is on the wane. While there are many more bonds, in reality the number of tradeable securities is much lower. “We can only watch with amusement and despair as people find new ways to arrange the same list of stocks,” Bernstein analyst Inigo Fraser-Jenkins sighs in the report.Of course this isn’t as utterly mad as it first seems. There are also more colours than there are primary colours, or more books than there are words or letters. Many of these indices are simply different flavours of the same thing, such as different currency-denominated versions of popular gauges, or overlaid with an environmental screen. As Bernstein points out, the mathematical upper limit is stratospheric and there is in reality nothing inherently wrong in reorganising financial securities in a zillion different ways.But a mushrooming number of indices is a symptom of one of the greatest revolutions to sweep over financial markets in recent decades: the rise of passive investing, which requires an underlying index to track. They range from simple size-weighted ones such as the S&P 500 or the Barclays Aggregate bond gauge, more complicated ones such as the MSCI low-volatility index of Steady-Eddie stocks, or niche ones such as the Catholic Values benchmark.Analysts expect the exchange traded fund world will grow in size and diversity in the coming years. EY, the consultancy, this week forecast that the ETF industry will expand from about $4tn today to $7.6tn of assets by the end of 2020, and predicts that a majority of asset managers will enter the space in some form or fashion by then.As a result, indexing has become a very profitable, if unsexy, industry. A bit like with software, once the initial product is designed by an index provider they scale with negligible costs, and that is licensed at fat margins. Moreover, they are natural monopolies with the biggest only growing bigger.The swelling importance of indexing is amply illustrated by the share price of MSCI, the sole listed representative of the industry and up more than 400 per cent since going public almost a decade ago. MSCI’s average annual return of 17.6 per cent beats the S&P 500’s 5.8 per cent average yearly gain for the same period.Indices also form a growing segment of revenues for exchange groups at a time when traditional trading income is under intense pressure. Burton-Taylor, a consultancy, estimates that market data and index revenues across the industry rose 5.6 per cent in the first half of the year to $2.8bn, accounting for nearly a fifth of all exchange revenues in the period.If self-indexing catches on, it will just boost the number of gauges floating around even further and likely trigger more hand-wringing over their proliferationSelling data feeds is a big part of that but benchmarks are certainly doing their bit. Last year, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ revenues rose 7 per cent to $639m, MSCI’s index revenues 9.8 per cent to $613.6m and FTSE Russell’s revenues 17 per cent to £409m.Underscoring the appetite for steady index-licensing income streams, several exchange groups have been buying any benchmark providers for sale, especially in fixed income, where most of the major benchmarks were traditionally controlled by big banks.Bloomberg has bought Barclays’ fixed income indices, the LSE has acquired Citi’s index family and Intercontinental Exchange snapped up Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s bond benchmarks.However, a passive investment price war is bleeding into a nascent index war. Big asset managers that sell ETFs are growing increasingly frustrated with the costs of licensing the underlying indices at a time when many are slashing their own prices, leading many to shift towards “self-indexing”.For example, State Street this month slashed the fees on 15 ETFs in response to stiffer competition from BlackRock and Vanguard but to save money it decided to create its own indices for three ETFs rather than use those licensed by FTSE Russell. Industry insiders expect this trend to accelerate, with some so upset by the costs of indices that they have floated some kind of industry co-operative to take on the behemoths of the benchmarking industry.Of course, if self-indexing catches on, it will just boost the number of gauges floating around even further and likely trigger more hand-wringing over their proliferation.robin.wigglesworth@ft.com
85;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-11-15T23:06:44Z;S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI to debut communications sector;;After a debate over whether telecoms should have their own sector, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI have made a final call.The indices operators said on Wednesday that they plan to shuffle how they categorise certain communications, entertainment and content companies in order to better align them with the changing reality of those industries.S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said that they would broaden and rename the current telecommunications services sector to, simply, communications services.The communications sector will encompass companies “that facilitate communications and offer related content and information through various mediums”, the announcement said. It will contain two sub-sectors — the first, telecommunications services, will include companies that provide telecoms, Internet and wireless services.The media group will decamp from its current home in the consumer discretionary sector to make up the new media & entertainment sub-sector, comprising companies including advertisers, broadcasters, cable and satellite providers, publishers, movie and entertainment companies and interactive home entertainment services.The move comes after the S&P 500 telcoms sector — which shrank to just three companies, including AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink, following a wave of consolidation — had been criticised as being held hostage to sharp moves in the shares of any one of those companies.Another impending change to the industry sectors will impact companies that operate digital marketplaces. Previously classified under information technology, those companies will now be classified under the internet retail group in the consumer discretionary sector, to better reflect their primary status as retailers, not tech companies.The changes are set to take effect after markets close on September 28, 2018. The large-cap companies impacted by the re-shuffle will be named in January.
86;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-11-05T05:00:52Z;In smart beta universe, risk-focused strategies are ascendant;Low-cost vehicles that offer passive management with a twist forecast to hit $1tn soon;The rise of smart beta seems unstoppable. Also known as strategic beta or factor investing, the hybrid between active and passive investment management takes a passive strategy but modifies it according to one or more factors.Assets are on track to hit $1tn by the end of the year, up from $765bn at the end of 2016.One trend within this large number is the speed at which risk-orientated strategic beta, an approach that typically screens stocks according to how volatile they make a portfolio, has gained popularity.While it represents only a small chunk of the overall pile, in year-on-year percentage terms it has been the fastest-growing part of the smart beta universe over the past two years. Risk-orientated smart beta assets grew 48 per cent year on year between 2015 and 2016, compared with growth of 22 per cent for return-focused smart beta.Those increases partly reflect the fact that it is rising from a relatively low base. Risk-focused smart beta factors were developed after return-orientated strategies, such as the classic dividend-screening approach, became established.But there are other reasons. After a febrile few years in markets, risk-focused smart beta has gained in popularity for “providing a smoother ride” for investors, says Dimitar Boyadzhiev, an analyst at Morningstar, the data provider. The introduction of smart beta indices focused on risk by MSCI, the index provider, five years ago has also helped shape the choices of investors.The appeal of smart beta is easy to understand: it is cheaper than traditional actively managed funds, but as these strategies invest along an organising principle rather than just tracking an index like a classic passive fund, they appear to offer value for money.Smart beta strategies have come under fire of late, with some critics questioning whether they are so smart after all. Of particular concern to many analysts is the rigour with which smart beta factors are assessed via so-called back tests, and the prevalence of data mining, in which performance data are tested until the desired result is achieved. Rob Arnott, chief executive of Research Affiliates, a company that developed some of the world’s first smart beta indices, raised eyebrows when he warned last year that some products could go “horribly wrong”.

That explains why some emerging market fund managers dislike their label. Equity funds investing in nations as disparate as Thailand and Tanzania are often seen as a homogenous asset class. This has helped low-cost exchange traded funds snatch growing inflows. The shift will be permanent, pushing down the fees of costlier active funds no matter what they call themselves.One trend fuelling the boom in ETFs is the poor performance of the value style in emerging markets. The latest rally here has coincided with an enthusiasm for technology groups, increasingly the largest companies in the world. The growth segment of MSCI’s emerging markets index has outrun the value segment by 30 per cent over the past five years. The constituent companies are pricey, but their earnings are growing fast. Buying ETFs offers easy exposure to these via a momentum strategy.Passive ETFs also suit investors who cannot be bothered to assess active manager performance across a slew of exotic markets. Cumulative flows — as measured from 2006 — into actively managed, long-only funds turned negative in the middle of 2015, says UBS. Those for ETFs only rose higher. Indeed, ETF inflows have outpaced those for long-only funds by two to one, recently hitting a record. Long-only inflows have hardly changed over the past year.Active managers with good performance will continue to win mandates. Buying into their success will remain tricky, thinks fund picker Seven Investment Management.Those with mediocre numbers will be out of a job, regardless of how many funny stories they know about Honkers in the old days. The fees of those that cling on will have to fall. At around 100 basis points, they still cost double most ETFs. There is evidence specialist managers such as Genesis and Templeton have been discounting London-listed EM investment trusts.ETFs are already a benchmark for fund pricing in some developed markets. Expect the same to happen in emerging markets.Will the rise of ETFs in the Emerging Markets cause fund fees to fall? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
88;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-10-13T12:08:02Z;UBS predicts further pain for emerging market currencies;;So about that emerging market currency “rally”…EM currencies have had a rough ride in recent weeks in the face of growing hawkishness from the US Federal Reserve, and UBS says any investors hoping for an imminent reprieve are likely to be disappointed – because there was never a real rally in the first place.September was only the second month of declines this year for the MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index, and the index is still up more than 8 per cent for the year to date. That’s better than a lot of people were expecting at the end of last year, when Donald Trump’s election victory briefly caused a sharp rally in the dollar.However, as UBS strategist Bhanu Baweja points out, “EM currencies have done precious little this year in trade-weighted terms”, despite the fact “on paper, all the ingredients for strong EM FX appreciation have been on the table”.Although the currencies have gained somewhat against the dollar, they’re looking a lot less healthy when compared with the euro, as the chart below shows:Mr Baweja blamed factors including a shift in the “epicentre of global growth” away from China and toward developed markets like the eurozone. That has flattened the differentials between emerging and developed market growth rates, which UBS says “are typically closely tied to capital inflows into EM”.Mr Baweja added that export volumes from emerging markets are cooling, while inward foreign investment is not showing much improvement, leading him to warn:If they are unable to appreciate in trade-weighted terms in a strong upcycle … one should expect EM currencies to lose ground when the cycle slows.However, it’s not all bad news for EM bulls. Although currencies are seen as “the weak link”, UBS is still fairly confident about the outlook for other assets including stocks and debt.The bank notes:A modest repricing of the fed is not likely to end the EM bull run – that would require a clear slowdown in China…Data has been more mixed here, but not weak enough to cut exposure to EM.Chart via UBS
89;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-10-05T22:24:44Z;Chinese share boom obscures governance flaws;Equity investing in country is governance minefield for the uninitiated;"Chinese shares have been big outperformers this year, but this should not dazzle investors into assuming that the corporate governance of Chinese companies is similarly stellar.In the year to September 29, the MSCI China Index posted gross returns of 43.41 per cent, better than any other country covered by MSCI’s suite of indices and markedly superior to the 17.8 per cent return on MSCI’s benchmark All Country World Index (ACWI). The MSCI China index includes 149 shares listed in Hong Kong, the US and elsewhere.However, breaking down the China index into laggards and leaders reveals not only a vast divergence in performance between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state Chinese companies. It also shows that even some of the most turbocharged performers are subject to serious governance risks.“The Chinese state-owned enterprises have underperformed the MSCI China index by a significant margin,” said Alan Brett, head of corporate governance ratings research.On average, total shareholder returns for non-SOEs included in the MSCI China index over the past five years have been 227 per cent, nearly three times higher than the 85.4 per cent returned by SOEs in the same index (see chart).The reasons for the lacklustre SOE showing in China, which is mirrored in SOE underperformance worldwide, are familiar to Beijing policymakers who have wrestled with low effciency, overstaffing and misallocation of resources in the state sector for decades.At July’s National Financial Work Conference, a meeting that convenes once every five years, Xi Jinping, the president, took aim at “zombie” SoEs that build up debts and need to be kept alive by infusions of cheap state credit.A broader effort to boost efficiency in the SOE sector is likely to be a focus of policy following the 19th Party Congress, which convenes later this month.According to an MSCI report, the “possibility of misalignment between the strategic interests of the state and those of minority shareholders remains a key governance risk”.Risks that SOEs will invest to please the government rather than generate returns are exacerbated when the state’s ownership stake is overwhelming and when the remuneration of directors, as well as company profit targets, are set by state bodies such as Sasac, which owns 102 of the largest SOEs.Of the 90 SOEs included in the MSCI China Index, 66.2 per cent have state ownership stakes of more than half the company’s share capital, giving state interests an overwhelming level of influence over board decisions. Only 14.6 per cent of such companies have a state-owned stake of less than 30 per cent (see chart).The ability of SOEs to pay dividends to minority shareholders is also impacted by the proportion of their profits they are required to hand over to the state.In 2014, the ministry of finance raised the ratio of profits to be handed over by SOEs, with 120 SOEs having to increase their payments by 5 percentage points of profits.The biggest payer is the China National Tobacco Corporation, which must hand over 25 per cent of its profits, followed by 14 companies, including petrochemical and telecoms giants, that must hand over 20 per cent; and 70 companies, including railway operators, that are required to transfer 15 per cent, according to MSCI research. The remaining 30 companies are required to pay only 10 per cent of profits.But while the underperformance of SOEs can be attributed at least in part to governance shortcomings, there is little evidence that obvious governance flaws in non-SOEs has had any impact on share prices this year.Indeed, several of the MSCI China index’s top performers, including Alibaba and Baidu, have signficant governance issues, according to to MSCI’s research report.For instance, Alibaba, one of the world’s most popular stocks this year, has the lowest possible MSCI governance score of zero out of 10.This is partly because Alibaba, along with 15 other companies listed on the China index, maintains a so-called variable interest entity (VIE) ownership structure that often disadvantages minority shareholders.The key characteristic of the VIE system is that minority shareholders do not directly own assets in the Chinese operating company, but instead have claims through a complex web of contractual arrangements.In addition, several VIEs use a dual-share class structure that awards the owners superior voting rights and allows them to reduce their capital investment while maintaining control of the company.Cayman Islands-incorporated companies also often use an “exempt company” provision that liberates them from having to hold annual general meetings (AGMs) while setting the threshold for calling an extraordinary shareholder meeting (EGM) so high as to make it virtually impossible if the board objects.For example, in the case of Baidu, the threshold for calling an EGM is 50 per cent of voting rights, but the total minority shareholder voting rights comes to just 30.8 per cent.For JD.com the EGM threshold is 33 per cent, while total nminority voting rights come to 20 per cent. For Alibaba, some 75 per cent of minority shareholders would have to collaborate to call an EGM, a “near impossible task”, according to the MSCI report.For now, investors seem to care little for such governance shortcomings as the technology stocks in the MSCI China index enjoy a rally based on the potential of Chinese e-commerce companies to disrupt several industries simultaneously.In the future, though, such flaws may again start to prey on investors’ minds, Mr Brett said."

South Korea’s Kospi was flat.On Monday, the S&P 500 equity index edged up 0.2 per cent to a second successive record close of 2,503, having earlier touched an all-time intraday peak of 2,508.32.The Nasdaq Composite also closed at a record high, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.3 per cent to its best finish in more than a month.

The Wall Street benchmark rose 1.1 per cent to 2,488.11The Euro Stoxx 600 is up 0.4 per cent, with London’s FTSE 100 rising 0.1 per cent and the Xetra Dax 30 adding 0.5 per cent.AS Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING saysRisk assets continue to perform well and have been helped by the UN Security Council’s decision to approve fresh sanctions on Korea. The fact that China and particularly Russia signed up to the new sanctions suggests fresh impetus for a diplomatic solution to the Korean crisis.Insurers led the gains in the US as the value of expected damages for the insurance industry from Hurricane Irma was revised from $100bn to $20bn after the storm weakened and changed direction.Sentiment toward the sector remains strong in Europe, with the Euro Stoxx insurance index up 0.3 per cent, having risen 2.2 per cent on Monday.The MSCI World Index is up 0.9 per cent at 1,981.97 — a new record for the global benchmark, surpassing its last peak reached in early August.Haven assets are weaker amid the return to risk. Gold is down 0.1 per cent at $1,325.71 an ounce, while the yield on 10-year US Treasuries is up 2 basis points at 2.143 per cent as investors sell the debt.Japan’s yen is 0.1 per cent weaker at ¥109.53 per dollar.Tokyo’s Topix is up 0.9 per cent while Seoul’s Kospi is 0.3 per cent stronger. China’s indices are bucking the trend after monetary authorities there appear to address the renminbi’s recent strength. The Shanghai Composite is down 0.2 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is flat, coming off an earlier advance.The renminbi slipped to Rmb6.5434 per dollar after China’s central bank weakened the daily fix by the most since January. The People’s Bank of China set the midpoint around which the renminbi can trade 2 per cent in either direction against the dollar at Rmb6.5277 — 0.4 per cent softer from the previous day.The Chinese currency hit a 21-month high against the dollar on Friday, but its advance halted after the PBoC on Friday dropped a requirement that had increased the cost of betting against the currency. That handed the renminbi its worst day in three months on Monday.As Geoff Yu, head of UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management Office, explains:The renminbi’s movements will prompt more scrutiny. While the weakness in the currency overnight marked a change, it is premature to think that the People’s Bank of China is now advocating outright weakness.There is a wider trend for a lacklustre dollar. The index tracking the world’s reserve currency is flat at 91.834, while the euro is up 0.1 per cent at $1.1967 and the pound is 0.2 per cent higher at $1.3185.Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, is down 0.1 per cent to $53.80 a barrel after touching its highest since May late last week. West Texas Intermediate, the main US contract, is flat at $48.06.
92;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-09-07T14:46:27Z;Genstar Capital to buy proxy advisory firm ISS for $720m;;Ironically, no shareholder vote will be required.Private equity firm Genstar Capital said on Thursday it would acquire the influential proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services from another financial sponsor, Vestar Capital for $720m.Vestar is in line for a healthy return on its investment having acquired ISS from financial data provider MSCI in 2014 for $364m.ISS along with Glass Lewis form the two primary proxy advisors that institutional money managers take their cues on for shareholder votes. While historically management and activist investors have courted ISS and Glass Lewis, their influence has receded somewhat in recent years.Active fund managers have deviated from ISS recommendations on high profile proxy fights and merger votes. The rise of the massive index fund such as Vanguard and BlackRock who have built their own corporate governance research teams has also dampened their influence in voting outcomes.Said one prominent corporate advisor, ” ISS continues to be an important research provider to investors and that their recommendations and policies have a significant impact on voting issues such as say-on-pay and shareholder proposals. On activism, they have some influence, but large institutional investors make up their mind independently.”ISS has more than 1,000 employees and counts more than 3,000 clients. Its management team, including CEO Gary Retelny will participate in the buyout.Genstar Managing Director Tony Salewski saidWhile maintaining its status as the premier governance provider, ISS has expanded significantly over the past three years, exhibiting a deep commitment to its clients by building a robust infrastructure and continuing to develop a world-class suite of ESG solutions,” said Salewski. “We are excited to back Gary and his team in building on this progress through both organic and acquisition growth initiatives globally.
93;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-09-06T16:16:46Z;Emerging market funds: fee fatigue;ETFs look more of a commodity these days and groups stand to make less profit;In fund management, specialisation can be a boon. Exotic or illiquid markets often require extra skills and administration. That pushes up the management fees for the fund groups supplying them, and helps them dodge some of the competition from cheaper ETFs. Emerging market equity products used to benefit in this way, but their premium pricing has begun to evaporate just as these markets start to rally.Emerging market stock prices have gone up recently, faster than elsewhere. Even so, they have some catching up to do. Racier emerging equities have trailed developed ones by 39 percentage points since 2007.During that bearish period, passive investment via exchange traded funds and index trackers became much more popular. That includes ETFs in the emerging markets. Better trading liquidity on the various exchanges has helped lower trading costs. That in turn led to competition between ETF providers. Vanguard, Amundi and iShares offer fees just a fifth those charged by an actively managed fund.While the best active managers will always command a premium price, some discounting has already occurred among actively managed emerging investment trusts. This is a surprise given that the assets under management here are fixed and hence not under the threat of redemptions. Listed investment trusts from some leading names such as Genesis, Templeton and Aberdeen (now part of Standard Life Aberdeen) have all cut their management fees by up to a quarter in recent years, notes broker Stifel.Also, asset allocators increasingly use cheaper ETFs in conjunction with a core of active funds to make quick tactical portfolio adjustments easier. Active managers frown on their clients shifting money in and out of their funds, which are intended to be long-term investments. But in this core-satellite model, less money is likely to go to the active managers.Emerging market funds look less special and more of a commodity these days. Assuming that continues, fund groups such as Standard Life Aberdeen stand to make less profit from them in future.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

94;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-08-03T23:24:27Z;Low rates, softer dollar bolster inflows to emerging market funds;;Investors ploughed more cash into emerging market funds in the week since the asset class’ stock benchmark touched its highest level since 2014.Emerging market equity funds counted $2.2bn of inflows in the week to August 2, while EM bond funds recorded $1.9bn of fresh capital commitments, according to flows tracked by EPFR. The additions lift inflows since the year began to nearly $90bn for the two fund categories.Enthusiasm for emerging markets has been bolstered by low interest rates across the globe and a renewed drop in the US dollar. The MSCI emerging market stock index has climbed more than 23 per cent this year.“Economic growth is generally stable, narrowing current account balances — a sign of improving fiscal health — and emerging market currency volatility is low,” said Bill Merz, a strategist with US Bancorp Wealth Management. “While valuations remain elevated, the fundamentals appear somewhat compelling for investors with a higher risk tolerance.”In the developed world, investors showed a continued preference for European stock funds over their US counterparts. European equity funds notched their fourth consecutive week of inflows, although additions decelerated from a week prior. US stock funds suffered their seventh straight week of redemptions, with outflows since mid-June topping $22bn.
95;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors in companies that do good do better;MSCI index of responsible emerging market companies outperforms;Here is a good news story: what is good for people and the planet appears also to be unambiguously good for emerging market investors.On average, investors who put money into smoke-belching, state-owned companies that ignore labour rights and shun transparency do worse than counterparts who are more observant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Equity indices comprised of ESG-compliant companies outperform benchmark emerging market indices, according to data from MSCI. In fact, the MSCI EM ESG Leaders Index has been outstripping the MSCI EM benchmark consistently since the 2008/09 financial crisis. In June, the outperformance gap reached a record of 51.84 points, double its span in early 2013.That leaders index consists of 417 companies that score highly in ESG scores awarded by MSCI. It excludes groups involved in alcohol, gambling, tobacco, nuclear power and weapons and tends to award lower ESG scores to companies with heavy state ownership and those in polluting industries or with a poor record of labour relations.Alan Brett, an MSCI vice-president, says some correlations between governance and share price performance are unequivocal. “We see endemic underperformance among the SoEs (state-owned enterprises),” he said. “There is a very significant difference between them and other ownership types, and this difference in performance is also evident in China.” That is because SoEs tend to work on behalf of the state rather than for their minority shareholders, awarding skimpy dividends and keeping their decision-making processes hidden from public scrutiny.In China, where state-ownership levels are high, there is an added problem of transparency. A company’s board of directors does not make key decisions. “Chinese state companies (have) a dual-track structure,” Mr Brett said. “Actually who is pulling the strings? It is not the board . . . it all comes down to the (Communist) party.”More generally, fund managers said, companies that take to heart environmental and social issues tend to be closer to the prevailing zeitgeist. “What do Chinese people want?” asked Karine Hirn, partner at East Capital in Hong Kong. “They dream of blue sky and blue water.”james.kynge@ft.com
96;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-07-14T06:10:17Z;Ashmore reports another quarter of inflows;;Ashmore has reported a second consecutive quarter of net inflows, indicating investor interest in emerging markets is back on track.The London-based asset manager, which specialises in emerging market debt, posted net inflows of $1.2bn in the three months to the end of June.This, plus positive investment performance, lifted Ashmore’s assets under management 5 per cent quarter-on-quarter to $58.7bn, ahead of analysts’ expectations.Earlier this year Ashmore reported a return to net inflows for the first time since 2014, with net inflows of $1.4bn in the three months to the end of March.Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election last November andattendant fears of protectionist measures on trade, in addition to concerns over the strength of Chinese economic growth and persistently low oil prices have all weighed on emerging markets.There are now indications that investors are feeling brighter about their prospects, and the MSCI emerging markets index has risen by 17 per cent since the beginning of the year. Ashmore’s share price has risen 25 per cent.Nevertheless there were renewed signs of caution this week after several data providers showed a slowing or reversal of flows.Mark Coombs, chief executive of the FTSE 250-listed asset manager, said:Ashmore has performed well over the past 12 months, delivering a 12% increase in AuM through strong investment performance and net inflows in the past two quarters.Emerging Markets asset prices have started to reflect the resilient fundamentals of the underlying economies and investor activity levels are responding. Looking ahead, there is substantial absolute and relative value still available in Emerging Markets and investor allocations have much further to run from their significantly underweight levels.
97;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-07-06T04:04:11Z;Swiss Re shifts entire $130bn portfolio to ethical indices;Platforms reward socially responsible performance with higher weightings;Swiss Re, one of Europe’s biggest insurers, is to move its entire $130bn investment portfolio to new, ethically-based benchmark indices.The company has already started the process of moving away from more traditional benchmarks, and expects to complete it later this year. Its move comes amid renewed interest from the insurance industry in ethical investing. Last year, Axa said it would sell its tobacco investments, and this year others including Aviva and Scor have followed.Swiss Re says it is the first insurer to base its whole portfolio on ethical principles. Guido Fürer, the chief investment officer, says that in future both internal and external managers of its money will be told to use MSCI’s environmental, governance and social indices, rather than more traditional benchmarks.The company says its portfolio managers will only have limited scope to deviate from the ESG benchmarks.MSCI scores each company based on a series of ethical criteria. Those scores are then combined with market capitalisation weights and used to create the index, so companies with a better ethical performance have a higher weight in the index.“You give incentives for companies to change, to take the ESG criteria into account,” says Mr Fürer.He says that Swiss Re looked at the issue for 18 months before deciding to make the move, and that the financial consequences were a big part of the decision.“It is more than doing good — it makes economic sense,” adds Mr Fürer.Swiss Re’s research shows that the total returns offered by the ESG indices are very slightly lower than for more conventional benchmarks, but that they are less volatile. That, says Mr Fürer, creates better risk-adjusted returns.“Data suggest that taking a long-term view on responsible investing is at least as much about limiting downside risks as benefiting from upside potential,” says a report compiled by the insurer.Unlike Axa, Aviva and Scor, however, Swiss Re will not be divesting from any particular industry or company.“It is better to give companies time to adapt,” says Mr Fürer. “There is a social cost to putting a company outside the investment spectrum. There are people who work there and if a company can’t fund itself, it can’t employ so many people.”Axa has argued that, while it supports the idea of engagement with most industries, tobacco is different because its entire business model is based on a harmful product.
98;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-29T04:02:09Z;MSCI: ‘Passive investing will be good for society’;Chief executive of data provider defends inclusion of Chinese A-shares in EM index;"Henry Fernandez found China “an extremely primitive country” during his first visit in 1979 as a university student after a Time magazine article sparked his interest.Almost four decades later, the Mexican-born chief executive of MSCI, the indices and data provider, remains fascinated by a country that has grown into the world’s second-largest economy. He is also clear-eyed about the goals of China’s leaders.“The number-one goal of the Chinese leadership is the preservation of the Communist party and the stability of China. Everything revolves around that,” says Mr Fernandez.Under his leadership, MSCI has grown into one of the world’s largest providers of indices that have around $11tn in assets benchmarked against them globally.Last week, after a long-running debate, MSCI decided to include mainland Chinese A-shares into its flagship emerging markets index for the first time, a decision Mr Fernandez says has received “an overwhelming level of support” from global investors.MSCI rejected the inclusion of A-shares in 2015 and 2016 but agreed to admit a limited pool of 222 companies later this year following an extensive consultation process with its clients.This landmark decision promises to have an enormous impact on capital flows into China, as many asset managers that use the MSCI emerging markets index as a benchmark will be compelled to buy more Chinese stocks.Born

$8.2m ($950,000 base salary)A former diplomat in the Nicaraguan embassy in Washington who prides himself on speaking directly, Mr Fernandez has met many senior Chinese officials on numerous trips to Beijing since his first visit.“Members of the politburo and State Council have very long-term goals. They want to liberalise the renminbi and open up their capital markets. They also know that allowing investors to get out freely as well as buying in is very important. But they are also very focused on stability: political, economic and financial market stability. China will not take risks,” he says.MSCI has been careful to specify that Beijing will need to undertake substantial further reforms to bring its stock markets closer to international standards before permitting any increase in the 0.7 per cent weighting for China A-shares in its emerging markets benchmark.“We are hopeful that China will continue to open up over time so that this small inclusion of A-shares can grow into a larger allocation,” says Mr Fernandez.Critics argue that MSCI’s decision will ensnare international investors in a corporate governance minefield of corruption scandals, murky ownership structures and company policies influenced by opaque state actors.“There is no doubt that corporate governance standards need to be improved, but China is still an emerging market in the early stage of its development. We saw similar objections when Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico were included in MSCI’s emerging markets index. These governance concerns do not mean that it is impossible to find good companies to invest in,” says the father of three.MSCI also said last week that it will consult over whether to include Saudi Arabia in its emerging markets index, another potentially controversial change.Mr Fernandez says Saudi Arabia has been “off investors’ radar” but his meetings with the kingdom’s leadership, and a series of foreign-investor friendly reforms have convinced him that the country is undergoing a radical transformation.“The senior leadership in Saudi Arabia is in a real hurry to diversify the economy away from fossil fuels and they need global capital markets to raise money to fund their reform programme.”He believes that the mispricing of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks is a problem across capital markets worldwide, not just in emerging markets such as China and Saudi Arabia.“We are only just beginning to understand the impact of ESG risks on the long-term sustainability of an investment. Not a week goes by without companies in every part of the world being affected by ESG issues. There is no hiding place now because of social media and there will be a backlash over the next 10 or 20 years from employees, investors and regulators that will lead to a much greater divergence in the valuations of good ESG companies and bad ESG companies,” he says.This interest in ESG has prompted friends of Mr Fernandez to criticise him for “turning socialist”, a charge he denies.“Not every problem in the world requires a government solution. But we in the investment industry have a huge responsibility in lubricating the efficient allocation of capital to good companies,” he says.Born in Mexico, Mr Fernandez now lives in New York, where MSCI is headquartered.“That might not endear me to President Trump, as I must be taking a job from somebody in the US. But I am a very free-market immigrant,” he jokes.Mr Fernandez has served as MSCI’s chief executive since 1998, during which time index-tracking investments have grown hugely in popularity at the expense of traditional active management, which seeks to buy assets that will outperform the market.Founded

Listed on the New York Stock ExchangeThe shift into passive investments has helped to boost MSCI’s annual revenues from $370m in 2007, when it first became a publicly listed company, to $1.2bn. Annual net profits have increased from $81m to $261m over the same period.Active management is “clearly in a long downcycle” in equity markets, says Mr Fernandez, but he willingly acknowledges the importance of its wider role in allocating capital.“What planet are we on with this talk of the death of active investment? We are still far from creating efficient allocations across capital markets globally,” he says.Among his many interests outside of MSCI, Mr Fernandez serves on the board of trustees of Stanford University and the board of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. These roles have fuelled a deep interest in technology and the potential for advances in computing to bring benefits to modern societies.“Passive investing is another technological advance. It will free up resources to focus on less-efficient markets such as real estate, infrastructure and private debt. This will be good for society,” he says."
99;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-24T04:01:53Z;Morgan Stanley’s role in Noble’s unhappy story;US companies should apply developed economies’ standards everywhere, says John Dizard;"OUR CORE VALUES. Since our founding in 1935, Morgan Stanley has pledged to do first-class business in a first class way.Morgan Stanley letter to shareholders, James P Gorman, April 7 2017We are being told that this past week is a defining moment for Chinese equity markets, since 222 large-cap equities will be included in the MSCI emerging markets index from next year. From now on, the narrative suggests, Chinese companies will be under much the same scrutiny and held to the same standards of probity as those in advanced market economies.MSCI, remember, stands for Morgan Stanley Capital International. So let us consider the case of a Singapore-listed Hong Kong company, Noble Group, and the role Morgan Stanley, the US bank, has played in the commodity trader’s unhappy story over the past couple of years. Given the Anglo-Saxon roots of Hong Kong and Singaporean corporate governance and securities market regulation, this should be a much easier test of the ability of the Western system to nudge Asian companies into the sunlight of accountability to investors.Christopher Dale Pratt, a senior adviser to Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Investment Banking, is an independent non-executive director on Noble Group’s board. That should have given the bank extra insight into the company’s solidity and the accuracy of Noble’s disclosure.That solidity and disclosure would seem to be open to question, since within three months of its last public bond issue, Noble Group last week announced it was deferring a $12m coupon payment on a $400m perpetual issue, and that its banks would extend its revolving credit facility by just 120 more days. Other energy and metals trading companies have already cut their lines to Noble.The price of the perpetual notes has fallen to about 10-11 cents on the dollar and Noble’s other bonds are trading in the mid-30s. The company has been told by its bank group that it must find a strategic buyer. The potential for such a buyer had been floated by the company in February, when the stock price hit S$2.75 ($1.98). Now it is below 50c.Last June, Morgan Stanley was one of the underwriters of a (deeply discounted) $500m rights issue, which was necessary to deal with what the bank called a “liquidity crunch” that came after creditors and banks reduced their lines to the company.Then, in September, Morgan Stanley Asia issued a research report forecasting “Inflection Ahead; Resuming at Overweight”.At the time, the stock was at S$1.30; Morgan Stanley had a target price of S$2.30. As the report said: “We believe Noble’s 2016 liquidity crunch is beginning to inflect. Confidence in the [net fair value] of its offtake contracts should return and support a market value closer to its reported book value.”To be fair, the report included in smaller type the following statement: “Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.“As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research.”And, indeed, Morgan Stanley, along with HSBC, went on to advise Noble on the sale of its North Americas Energy Solutions business to Calpine, a US power company, for $850m. It also worked on a $750m bond issue sold to the public in March of this year, just before Noble Group announced a serious loss in the first quarter.Now Morgan Stanley, along with Moelis, the investment bank, is working with Noble Group on a review of the company’s strategic options.Morgan Stanley’s underwriting of last year’s rights issue, and its role as a bookrunner for March’s bond issue, was done after there had been a great deal of public criticism of Noble’s accounting and business practices.Here one has to mention Iceberg Research, a research firm that back in February 2015 issued an initial report that stated: “Noble exploits the accounting treatment of its associates to avoid large impairments and fabricate profits.” Noble Group has defended its accounting and taken legal action against Iceberg.I have particular scorn for the bank research teams. It was very clear to me that Morgan Stanley’s [team] did not careIn May 2015 Michael Dee, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker and senior managing director of Temasek, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, published an “open letter” to Noble Group’s staff, criticising the group for a lack of transparency and a failure to answer the questions raised by Iceberg.He received a blistering, though vague, reply from Yusuf Alireza, the group’s chief executive at the time. (Mr Alireza resigned last year, and is now suing against a company associated with Richard Elman, Noble’s chairman emeritus, for shares valued at $58m).Mr Dee’s opinion of his former bank’s research has soured: “I have particular scorn for the bank research teams. It was very clear to me that Morgan Stanley’s [team] did not care,” he says.Wall Streeters are frequently critical of the standards of Asian regulators and corporate governance. US companies could help by applying some of the same standards they espouse in their home market."
100;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-23T14:56:20Z;Dystopian fears stalk emerging market investors;The debate over China debt shows that passive investing does not exist;Do you hold an exchange traded or tracker fund that follows the MSCI Emerging Markets Index? If you’ve been listening to the instructions issued by the investment industry on keeping costs low and diversifying internationally over the past decade, odds are you do. I wonder if you know what’s in it. Most non-professional investors would, I suspect, assume that anything with “emerging markets” in the title is heavily weighted to China. They would be right: the index is 26 per cent China. But I think they would also assume that some of the stocks in that weighting would be listed on the mainland. That would be wrong: the index does not include any A-shares (those traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen in renminbi) at all.The good news is that this is about to change. MSCI, after four years of listening to lobbyists, has finally chosen 222 A-shares that it thinks make the index grade. Buy a product tracking the MSCI Emerging Market Index any time after next May and you’ll get a sliver of mainland China in the deal. This isn’t going to mean much immediate action: 222 is a tiny proportion of the available shares, which number something in the region of 3,000. They will make up well under 1 per cent of the index. Still, this tiny move has caused a disproportionate amount of comment.China is pleased. The country with both the second-largest economy and the second-largest stock market — if you combine listings in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong — now has its onshore markets considered to be emerging. China bulls are pleased. This might be no more than MSCI dipping a baby toe in China’s domestic waters, but if you are keen on something, its nice to think that a well thought of agency agrees.But China’s bears are horrified. If you are of a “dystopian bent” as Jonathan Allum of SMBC Nikko puts it, this has to be the “classic top of the market contrarian indicator”. As another investor put it to me, it is surely the final sign that global investors have gone “collectively mad”. After all, say the dystopians, given that the Chinese economy is quite clearly a vast Ponzi scheme represented by more of a trading jungle than a proper stock market — 80 per cent of trading is done by retail investors — why would anyone anywhere cheer the further easing of its dodgy companies into the global financial system?It is perfectly easy to take either side of this discussion. China does have an appalling debt problem: private sector, non-financial debt is not far off the levels seen in Japan just before its nasty 1989 bust. But debt is just the start of its problems: corruption, horrible air pollution, a worrying gender imbalance and of particular concern to investors, endless government interference and awful corporate governance. Many A-share company managers “have yet to fully grasp the duties imposed by a listing”, says Hermes Investment Management. Anyone worried about the way the state might affect their investments in China need only look at this week’s news: shares in several big listed Chinese companies fell nastily as the banking regulator asked lenders to check the “systemic risk” in loans.But there is an up-side, too. The regulator’s demands tell us that the state is taking debt seriously. And you can make an excellent case that, for all the carping from the sidelines, China is making a normalish transition, as did Korea, Taiwan and Japan, from being a fast-growth economy driven by exports, low wages and fast infrastructure spend to a lower growth economy based on high-end manufacturing, capital market liberalisation, rising wages and consumption. MSCI’s endorsement of China’s domestic markets tells us that good progress is being made on market access and governance. Everything might be just fine.This is a fascinating debate. But it is not so much the search for the correct answer that should be exercising passive investors at the moment. They should worry that the debate exists at all. Why? Because it is a neat reminder that the style of investing they think they have embraced does not actually exist. There is no such thing as passive. Someone has to decide what is an emerging market, someone has to decide which emerging markets are the most important and someone then has to decide which stocks define each emerging market.So thanks to clear decisions made by MSCI you will soon be holding a reasonable amount of China’s domestic financial sector and a little of its discretionary consumer sector. And if you hang on to your investment for a decade you will probably find that your China weighting moves from 26 per cent to 40 per cent (if all A-shares were included).That would be a substantial shift, which might be good and might be bad. The one thing it is not is neutral. If you choose an MSCI index to follow, you should remember creating that index involves both regular stock picking and regular asset allocation decisions. Look at it like that and index investing does not make you a passive investor. As MSCI’s latest decision makes clear, it just means that you have effectively chosen MSCI to be your active manager.The writer is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek.

101;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-23T14:14:57Z;China aims to follow MSCI victory with Bond Connect launch;Looming start of bond trading link will rival in significance the equities index inclusion;As China’s blue-chip stocks raced to an 18-month high after they were included in a global benchmark for the first time this week, a quiet announcement from the country’s central bank slipped past most people.In truth, the news from the People’s Bank of China was hardly momentous. But the release of temporary rules covering the proposed Bond Connect linking Hong Kong and mainland Chinese debt markets for the first time was a timely reminder that China’s efforts to tie up with international markets are proceeding on multiple fronts at the same time.The news this week that MSCI will include 222 domestic Chinese, or A-share stocks, in its global emerging markets benchmark index from next year was met by cheers among many Asia-based investors and analysts, happy that it had finally happened after three previous proposals by the index provider were knocked back by its stakeholders — namely big investors.There were, however, also jeers from those sceptical of the quality of Chinese company that index trackers will soon be forced to buy.Views on the value of Chinese equity aside, there was a very clear central theme — that China’s markets, long considered by cognoscenti as too big to ignore for much longer in spite of capital controls, are now passing that point for all investors.The key to this happening has been the Connects. First came the Stock Connects linking Hong Kong with Shanghai in 2014 and, last year, Shenzhen. Soon they will be joined by Bond Connect. Both systems represent the first opportunity international investors have had to trade local equities and bonds without needing approval to operate and invest on the mainland.“It’s not realistic to look for totally free [capital] flows in and out of China — that’s not happening any time soon,” said Robert Chen, head of asset allocation and passive investments at Harvest Global Investments. “But with Stock Connect, people can access almost half of all listed stocks in China and that is significant.”A survey from Standard Chartered this week revealed that more than 60 per cent of investors polled regarded China as one of their top three priorities for the coming year — almost half as many again as thought that last year.For all that interest, foreigners currently hold less than 2 per cent of China’s $7tn A-share market — the world’s second largest pool of equity capital behind the US with some $19tn. International money counts for about as much of China’s $9tn bond markets, which rank third globally behind the US and Japan.Recent developments — including the announcement from the PBoC — have raised hopes that Bond Connect could launch as soon as next month, potentially just after the 20th anniversary of the British handover to China of Hong Kong, which falls on July 1.Unlike its stock market sister, which allows for Chinese trading southwards into Hong Kong as well as international fund flows heading north, the bond version will at first only allow international money into China.Officials in Hong Kong and the mainland have been meeting regularly with market participants and new information about trading hours, rules and who can join is now trickling out almost daily.Key to the scheme is the fact that only new funds can use it — meaning investors who already have mainland access will have to launch new funds to take advantage and not divert existing investments — and that any money invested will be held offshore.“A lot of people are asking if we need a Bond Connect given the access there is through other channels,” said Jini Lee, a partner at Ashurst. “But if people can take extra comfort from the fact their money is still offshore, that really could bring new investors in.“The important thing with all these steps is that, with every innovation, access to the mainland gets a little looser and a little more investor-friendly.”However successful Bond Connect ultimately becomes, just like this week’s MSCI news the money involved is expected to increase only gradually.Analysts estimate that less than $20bn will be needed next year for funds tracking the MSCI indices to cover their new A-share requirements. Few have dared to estimate early Bond Connect flows as yet.Longer-term forecasts, however, are another matter. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that China could represent 34 per cent of MSCI’s emerging markets stock index in five years’ time if the index provider gradually increases the weighting it gives to mainland stocks.That would be worth some $210bn in inflows. Bonds, meanwhile, could be even bigger. If, as is expected, mainland bonds are soon added to international indices — as with the MSCI move thereby pushing tracking funds to buy them — then Goldman believes five years of bond investments could total $250bn.Chinese stocks were in the limelight this week but the looming launch of Bond Connect might soon shift that balance.
102;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-23T14:00:39Z;Why governance will soon trump all for emerging market investors;The division with developed markets is fraying as quality of oversight takes precedence;"As regular readers will know, the markets’ biggest event of the week was, on first appearance, something of a non-event. MSCI, a New York-based indexing group, announced that in a year’s time it will make a slight amendment to its emerging markets index; domestic Chinese A-shares will be added, at a sliver of their value. They will make up less than one per cent of the index. China is already the heaviest weighted country in the index, through shares quoted in New York and Hong Kong.So why did this apparently technical move create a ferment of excitement? First, MSCI’s index is by far the most influential index for investors covering emerging markets. Passive funds tied to the index will have to buy A-shares for the first time; and active funds are judged against the benchmark and will now feel great pressure to buy A-shares too. Secondly, the A-shares market matters. It is the world’s second-biggest market by capitalisation, surpassing even Japan and second only to the US. Every step in its international opening has effects the world over.The importance of the move can be overstated. BNP Paribas showed that when MSCI went through a similar process for South Korea and Taiwan, both small-scale economic models for what is happening in China, the steady increase in their index weighting was accompanied by wild variations in their share prices, including sharp falls.This is positive for China, and has been rightly welcomed by those who invest there, after several years when MSCI has decided against opening the gates to A-shares. But the response in Shanghai markets was not huge, and that makes sense; there are still other factors that matter more.More importantly, MSCI’s move should prompt everyone to look at China and the broader emerging markets universe a little more closely. One of the problems with indices is that they offer an escape from freedom of thought. Looking at the overall EM indices, which are rising nicely at present, obscures some important trends.First, within A-shares, large-caps rule decisively, with FTSE’s A-50 index of the biggest A-shares far outpacing the rest. The smallest have done worst. This appears to be in large part because of earnings expectations. BNP Paribas shows that earnings forecasts for the 50 biggest A-shares have risen greatly so far this year, while expectations for the index as a whole have fallen. Generally, this is not a healthy sign, but it mimics the strength of ‘Big Tech’ stocks in the west.In this, at least, China seems to be part of an international trend. Profit growth is only perceived in the biggest companies (particularly in technology), and investors are paying up for any company that can show it. Meanwhile value stocks, which look cheap compared to their fundamentals, are languishing. This is true for emerging markets as a whole, as the MSCI EM growth index has strongly outperformed value.Normally, strong emerging markets stocks are a sign of optimism about global growth. This latest rally looks very much more defensive, within China and across emerging markets as a whole.Another issue, central to MSCI’s cautiousness in opening to China, is corporate governance. It is precisely because investors cannot be sure of the necessary protections that they might wish to avoid some otherwise exciting emerging markets.JP Smith of Ecstrat in London shows that if Chinese stocks are classified according to their control, the whole market begins to look different. In May 2015, just before a brief Shanghai bubble would burst, privately held non-financial stocks were trading at 5.2 times their book value, while state-controlled companies traded at a multiple of only 2.3.Again, this is true across emerging markets. State-controlled entities drastically underperform. This might explain why value stocks stay so cheap; investors think they should be cheap for a reason, which is their governance.This raises the question of whether the “emerging vs developed” divide is really so important, or whether it makes more sense to view the whole world through the level of governance. Research by Ecstrat with Copley on how active emerging markets funds were weighted compared to the MSCI benchmark suggests that governance indeed weighs more on investors’ decisions than geography or industrial sector. They are very underweight state-controlled companies, and overweight stocks with dispersed ownership. This is a far greater effect than the difference between sectors or even countries.The good news is that active managers have collectively made the right calls, avoiding state-controlled entities. But the exercise does suggest that the anxiety over emerging markets indices as a whole is misplaced. The whole concept of “emerging markets” will probably change in any case when China is included at its full weighting, because at that point China will be more than half the index. We can expect a raft of “EM excluding China” funds to arise as that moment approaches.But the most important points are that emerging markets are already very similar to the rest of the world — they are enjoying a rally that suggests lack of conviction, with growth pounding value. The biggest differentiator is not what country a company is in, but its mode of corporate governance. That is where the index debate will need to go next."
103;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-23T02:07:45Z;High share prices and hawkish Fed put brakes on equity flows;Funds see inflows of less than $1bn due to wariness over bull run and central bank plans;Flows into equity funds fizzled over the past week amid concern by investors about high prices for shares and a hawkish US central bank.Inflows into equity funds failed to break the $1bn mark in the week ended Wednesday, according to EPFR Global, after taking in a 31-week high of $24.5bn in the second week of June. In the US, funds recorded their sixth week of outflows in the past eight.The downward move in flows follow last week’s Federal Reserve meeting when the central bank raised rates and unveiled detailed plans to pare back its balance sheet later this year.“The Fed’s move to increase rates and shrink their balance sheet is analogous to someone trying to take off their pants without first removing their shoes,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. “I’m not sure why there is a such a hurry to raise rates and shrink the balance sheet in light of how accommodative they have been and the fact that we have a fragile economic recovery.”Investors have also been growing wary of the bull run in equities that has taken the US market to successive highs.“Valuations are high, arguably supported by low interest rates and the record pace of central bank monetary expansion. However, this may change in the near future,” Marko Kolanovic, a widely-followed strategist at JPMorgan, said in a note to clients on Thursday. “In the US rates are rising and monetary accommodation from the ECB and BoJ will recede. Medium term, this is likely to lead to market turmoil, and a rise in volatility and tail risks.”Elsewhere, Asia ex-Japan equity funds had the biggest inflows since early in the third quarter of 2015, but it was not the high-profile decision by MSCI, the index provider, to include China A-shares in its indexes that drove investment. Instead, EPFR cited the outlook for semiconductor prices and reform in Korea and India.While China equity funds posted outflows for the fifth straight week, Taiwan equity funds took in $186m after last week posting the largest inflows since the second quarter of 2015. India equity funds extended their longest inflows streak in two years and Korea equity funds recorded the second biggest weekly inflow so far this year. Greater China funds saw the highest level of inflows in two years.Emerging markets equity drew interest generally, with the overall category moving closer to the $38bn market, with investors pouring money into the group for the 14th straight week.Lower interest rates, declining inflation expectations and a falling dollar are supportive of emerging markets, especially at a time when investors are still searching for assets with higher returns.“Emerging markets investors are driven by rates,” said Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. “And then there is just a continued insatiable demand for yield.”Equity funds dedicated to frontier markets had the most inflows since early 2015. Investors put the most money into Argentina equity funds in nearly three years, but the direction of money flows to the country could reverse after MSCI’s decision not to restore Argentina’s emerging market status, which weighed on shares this week.And in Europe, French equity funds recorded the second highest weekly inflows in the year to date, while funds that buy Italian shares saw net redemptions climb to a 16-week high.
104;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-22T12:54:56Z;Corporate governance minefield awaits China A-share buyers;As MSCI opens a key index to Chinese shares, investors will need to tread with care;A corporate governance minefield awaits fund managers who will be obliged to pour billions of US dollars into Chinese equities after MSCI, the most influential indexer of emerging market equities, decided to include domestic Chinese A-shares in its main global indices.Murky or undisclosed ownership structures, regular corruption scandals, exposure to unregulated shadow finance and a predominance of behind-the-scenes state influence over corporate decisions are just some of the governance challenges that global investors in the Chinese A-shares are set to encounter, analysts say.A crucial feature of stock market governance is that investors exert influence over the board of directors, who in turn run the company to serve the interests of investors. But for state-owned companies in China, almost the opposite applies. Directors are appointed by the state to run the company for the benefit of state stakeholders who often shy away from engagement with portfolio investors.Although the 222 A-shares slated for inclusion a year from now will represent only 0.73 per cent of MSCI’s flagship emerging markets index, the cohort is far from insignificant. UBS, an investment bank, estimates that passive and active investors who track the index will be obliged to invest about $15bn in the Chinese shares.Notably even MSCI’s own executives are blunt about some of the pitfalls. Alan Brett, head of corporate governance research at MSCI, says listed state-owned enterprises underperformed in terms of returns to shareholders partly because of what he calls a “dual track governance structure”.“They have a board of directors . . . but actually who is pulling the strings?” Mr Brett asked at a forum on Tuesday in London before the MSCI announcement on including A-shares was made.“It is not the board. They key decisions are not being made by the board. It all comes down to the (Communist) party, the party through Sasac [State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission] they determine who the executives are,” he adds.Mr Brett says that the pervasive influence of Sasac, which owns most of the largest companies in China, can also be seen when they decide to shuffle top executives from one state company to another, particularly in the telecoms industry.Some 69 per cent of the 222 shares are owned by the Chinese state either at central or local level, according to calculations by JP Smith, a partner at Ecstrat, an investment consultancy.“It is a potential minefield,” says Mr Smith. “These state companies are operating in an environment in which there are no hard budget constraints and which is replete with moral hazard.”One feature of the moral hazard lies in state companies’ appetite for credit. Because state-owned banks answer to central or local Communist party officials, they can be pressured to lend to state-owned companies or to hold off claiming collateral when loans turn bad.Such an indulgent environment is partly why China’s corporate sector has become the world’s most indebted, owing debts equivalent to over 170 per cent of GDP. This propensity also shows up among the cohort of 222 stocks being included in the MSCI indices.“These companies are so indebted on average that many would struggle to service their debts should the economy slow from here,” says Brandon Emmerich, principal at Granite Peak Advisory. Mr Emmerich calculates that the average annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to interest-bearing debt for the 222 companies is only 13.5 per cent.Some individual companies stand out. Five state-owned city commercial banks included among the 222 shares are either unrated or rated as “junk” by international credit rating agencies because their balance sheets are so weak.Chris Ruffle, fund manager at China Open Door Capital Group, has been managing A-share portfolios for 20 years. “Regarding state-owned enterprises, I can say I have learned to avoid them,” he says. “They can have decent assets but will always, under duress, act in the best interests of the government — national service.”Mr Ruffle adds that although private companies have their risks, there was at least a sense of shared direction with investors if the managers of the company owned equity.Another governance complication comes from the close connections between some companies and some financial institutions to a vast but largely unregulated netherworld of shadow finance. This twilight realm has tripled in size over the past five years to be worth $9.4tn, or about 87 per cent of GDP, according to Moody’s estimates.The murky nature of this form of financing makes it difficult for investors to judge which companies may be next to fall victim to an intensifying government crackdown. Huishan Dairy, a company listed in Hong Kong, has suffered a collapse in its share price after defaulting on a loan earlier this year. Bond defaults are also running at high levels this year.Sudden stock market ruptures, either in Hong Kong or mainland China, are fairly common. The shares of Hanergy, a solar panel equipment maker, have been suspended since May 2015 after inexplicably plunging almost 50 per cent in less than half an hour, wiping off $19bn in capitalisation. A scandal over contaminated infant milk formula ensnared several listed companies in 2008.Some investors, such as Antoine Lesne at State Street Global Advisors, see opportunities among the 222 companies. That was echoed by Yannan Chenye, portfolio manager at Harvest Global Investments, who said the company would increase the proportion of A-shares in their active portfolios.“We focus on good-quality growth stocks which are trading at reasonable valuations in A-shares and exhibit good GARP [“growth at reasonable price”] characteristics,” she said.Investors will need to work to find them.
105;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-22T03:30:32Z;China stocks hit 18-month high on MSCI inclusion;Decision on benchmark a milestone in Beijing’s efforts to attract foreign funds;Chinese stocks hit an 18-month high following MSCI’s decision to include them in its global benchmark equity index for the first time, marking a milestone in Beijing’s efforts to draw international funds into the world’s second-largest market.MSCI’s move means mainland equities, known as A-shares, will next year be included in its flagship emerging markets index, obliging the estimated $1.6tn of investment funds that track the index to buy the stocks.On Thursday, the CSI300, an index comprising the top 300 stocks on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, closed was up 0.5 per cent, its highest level since December 2015.MSCI’s decision opens a new front in investors’ long-running debate over whether, and how, to introduce domestic Chinese securities into international portfolios.China’s equity and bond markets are the second and third-largest in the world, respectively, yet foreigners hold less than 2 per cent of each. Three previous proposals by MSCI to include mainland stocks were rebuffed by the index provider’s stakeholders — primarily large asset managers.Helen Wong, head of HSBC’s Greater China operations, called MSCI’s decision a “pivotal moment”.She added: “This is the start of a process through which Chinese equities will achieve a prominence in global investors’ portfolios that reflects the size and significance of China’s domestic stock market and its economy.”MSCI said its decision had “broad support” from institutional investors. The change in sentiment was mostly due to fund managers’ improved access to A-shares via the Stock Connect programme, which links Hong Kong with Shanghai and Shenzhen without subjecting investors to the same capital restrictions they would face buying shares on the mainland using renminbi.Chinese exchanges also in the past year have eased their requirements to pre-approve index-linked products — previously a key sticking point for fund managers.MSCI said it would add 222 A-share large-cap stocks that will account for 0.73 per cent of its flagship index. China-related stocks already make up 27 per cent of MSCI’s emerging markets index but this consists of shares listed offshore in Hong Kong and the US such as Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba.Mike Shiao, Invesco’s chief investment officer for Asia excluding Japan, described the decision as “a wake-up call for global investors”.He added: “We believe it is important for them to rethink their strategic allocation to China and realise that offshore Chinese equities alone do not represent the entire Chinese economy.”Fund managers’ previous wariness had centred on China’s weak corporate governance, concerns over how it polices its stock markets, and the difficulties money managers face when repatriating funds on demand. Anxiety about the latter was amplified by Beijing’s heavy-handed response to the 2015 market crash, where at one point more than half of all stocks were suspended from trading and officials forced local institutions to contribute to a bailout fund.But even as it gave the go-ahead, MSCI warned that greater inclusion would require further reforms.“Future inclusion will be subject to a greater alignment of China with international accessibility and trading standards,” said Sebastien Lieblich, MSCI’s global head of index management research.Global index providers have long danced around the issue of including domestic Chinese securities in their flagship products. Until MSCI’s decision, the farthest any had gone was providing a so-called “parallel universe” system — introduced by FTSE and Bloomberg — where followers had the choice of a benchmark that added mainland assets or one that maintained the status quo and excluded them.
106;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T17:37:13Z;China’s stock market is given a test, not a pass;MSCI is right to be very cautious about putting A-shares in its indices;"To listen to the stockbrokers, it is a “pivotal moment”, a “major step forward” that will “bring Chinese equities into mainstream investment”. MSCI, the index provider, has decided to include mainland Chinese shares in its main global and emerging market benchmarks. The talk of a watershed is misguided, however. This is a test for Chinese stock markets, not a certification that they have met global standards or that future integration is assured, or even likely.Consider the extreme caution with which MSCI has decided to represent mainland stocks in its indices. The Shanghai and Shenzhen markets together make up the second-largest equity market in the world by capitalisation, at some $7tn. Yet the shares in just 222 large-cap companies will be included by MSCI. All of them are already part of the so-called stock connect scheme, which allows global investors to buy and sell A-shares in freely tradable Hong Kong dollars. This solves (for now) the problem of China’s tight currency and capital controls.When the indices are updated in about a year’s time, the mainland companies will be included in the index at only 5 per cent of the weight of their full market values. The shares will therefore represent less than 1 per cent of the MSCI’s emerging markets index, and 0.1 per cent of its world index. The 1.2 per cent rise in the mainland indices after the MSCI announcement reflected both the fact that the change was expected and its ultimately modest size.Yes, there is already representation of the Chinese economy elsewhere in the emerging market index; Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong or the US represent more than a quarter of it. These companies, however, meet certain standards of disclosure, governance, and ownership structure. This is not to say that the US or Hong Kong markets are perfect. The multiple share classes favoured by Silicon Valley companies — which has culminated in the complete disenfranchisement of outside investors at recently listed Snap — appals investors who believe equity ownership ultimately derives its value from control. But the demands of mature capital markets give index makers like MSCI a bit of cover. The product the indexers ultimately sell has been certified by other established market entities.There is no such cover in China, and this should worry MSCI for several reasons, starting with state control. Nearly two-thirds of the stocks MSCI has included are controlled by local or central government. Boards, to say nothing of investors, are not in the drivers’ seat. In the big market correction of 2015, half of mainland stocks were suspended from trading. Sellers were shut out, while state-funded buyers entered the market to prop up the shares that were still allowed to trade.In a free market worthy of the name, shares are suspended very rarely and only for short “circuit breaker” periods. Short selling is allowed. Companies are responsive to all of their owners; minorities are not excluded. Hopefully China is ready to move, however incrementally, towards these and other forms of openness.Chinese shares are volatile. Only a portion of their shares tend to trade freely, so liquidity evaporates at times of stress. Debt levels are extraordinarily high. There will be another big correction, sooner or later.How will global investors be treated when the correction comes? MSCI would be wise to wait and see before increasing the representation of A-shares in its indices — bringing the portfolios of global investors along with them."

Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
108;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T15:17:55Z;Argentina misses out on MSCI upgrade to emerging market status;Peso sinks to record lows while stocks dive more than 5% in wake of index decision;Argentina failed to win back its status as an emerging market in the influential MSCI benchmark equity index, triggering a sell-off in Argentine equities.Argentina’s Merval stock index dived by more than 5 per cent in early trading on Wednesday, after more than doubling since President Mauricio Macri took office 18 months ago, largely in anticipation of an upgrade from its current status as a frontier market.The peso also plumbed record lows, falling around 2 per cent, although businesses complaining that the currency is too strong due to heavy capital inflows over the past year cheered gains in competitiveness.Index provider MSCI late on Tuesday judged it too soon to promote Argentina, despite widespread investor expectations that it would be upgraded because of a host of market-friendly policies that Mr Macri has implemented with the aim of opening up Argentina’s economy.Argentina will now remain relegated to the ranks of frontier markets for at least another year. MSCI’s decision contrasted with the success of Argentina’s issuance on Monday of a $2.75bn 100-year bond.More than three times subscribed, the issue came little more than a year after the country’s triumphant return to the international capital markets after more than a decade of isolation. “Although the Argentine equity market meets most of the accessibility criteria for Emerging Markets, the irreversibility of the relatively recent changes still remains to be assessed,” MSCI said in a statement.MSCI was referring to the removal in December 2015 of foreign exchange restrictions, whose implementation in 2009 by the previous populist government was the original cause for Argentina’s downgrade to frontier market status.It noted that this removal had already had positive effects, such as the floating of the country’s currency, but implied that further assurance was needed that these changes would remain. An MSCI upgrade would have immediately created a far bigger pool of assets that could potentially invest in Argentina.As much as 100 times more money tracks emerging markets than frontier markets, which tend to be less highly valued owing to greater political instability, elevated currency risk and lower liquidity.The list of frontier markets includes Romania, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Kenya, Kuwait, Bangladesh and Vietnam.Officials had hoped that an upgrade would benefit Argentine companies by lowering the cost of raising capital, as well as supporting economic growth, which is slowly rebounding after five years of stagnation.The government is expecting growth of around 3 per cent this year, after a contraction of more than 2 per cent last year, while inflation has almost halved from a high of around 40 per cent last year.Many investors are waiting to see the results of important midterm legislative elections in October.A strong show of support for the ruling coalition will enable the government to press on with its economic reform programme, including tax reform aimed at improving competitiveness.
109;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T14:48:39Z;Argentine peso drops to record low;;After equities, investors are taking out their disappointment with Argentina’s failure to win back its status as an emerging market on the country’s currency.The Argentine peso slumped as much as 2.1 per cent on Wednesday to hit a record low of 16.47 per dollar after MSCI confounded expectations last night and left Argentina as a frontier market.That takes the peso’s loss since the start of 2017 to 3.5 per cent, enough to relegate it to the position of this year’s worst-performing emerging market currency.Since Mauricio Macri, Argentina’s president, lifted currency controls and floated the peso 18 months ago, it has endured choppy periods of trading. It had been up as as much 4.5 per cent against the dollar on the year to date as recently as April. But it pared those gains as crude oil prices came under pressure again.An MSCI upgrade would have immediately created a far bigger pool of assets that could potentially invest in Argentina, as well as stronger demand for the peso.As analysts at Nomura noted:The refusal of MSCI to upgrade Argentina from frontier to emerging markets status may pose a risk of reversal of the recent portfolio inflows and likely reflects a cautious approach.
110;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T13:51:44Z;US-listed Argentine stocks slump after MSCI disappointment;;Argentina’s stock market is not due to start trading for another hour. But Argentine companies listed in the US are already coming under intense selling pressure on Wednesday, in an early indication of the potential losses the country’s benchmark Merval stock index could face following MSCI’s decision last night to leave Argentina as a frontier market.MercadoLibre, which is often described as Latin America’s answer to eBay, is down 2.1 per cent in early trading. The online retailer, which boasts a market cap of $11.85bn, is one of Argentina’s most successful tech companies. Its rise was underscored last week when it replaced Yahoo in the Nasdaq-100 index.Elsewhere, New York-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) for Argentine lender Banco Macro are down 7.2 per cent while those for rival Grupo Financiero Galicia declined 7.5 per cent.ADRs for Telecom Argentina dived nearly 11 per cent and YPF, the state-owned oil major, saw its ADRs shed 7.5 per cent of their value.Analysts have warned that Argentine stocks could face an intense sell-off after MSCI confounded expectations yesterday by not upgrading the country to emerging market status.An MSCI upgrade would have immediately created a far bigger pool of assets that could potentially invest in Argentina. As much as 100 times more money tracks emerging markets than frontier markets, which tend to be less highly valued owing to greater political instability, elevated currency risk and lower liquidity.The country’s benchmark Merval stock market has risen more than 74 per cent since Mauricio Macri became president over 18 months ago following a host of market-friendly policies he has implemented with the aim of opening up Argentina’s economy.
111;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Saudi stocks at 18-month high after MSCI update;;Saudi Arabia’s main stock index on Wednesday hit its highest level since oil prices crashed in late 2015, boosted by an encouraging update from index provider MSCI and changes to the kingdom’s succession plans.The Tadawul All-Share Index ended open trading with a 5.5 per cent gain for the day, taking it to its highest level for 18 months.In MSCI’s annual market classification review announced last night, the index provider said it will launch a consultation on potentially adding Saudi stocks to its influential emerging markets index next year.MSCI said Tadawul and the Saudi Arabian Capital Market Authority had introduced a series of “major enhancements to the accessibility of the Saudi Arabian equity market” over the last year, making it easier for qualified foreign investors to access the market.The index provider said it will gather feedback from institutional investors on the effectiveness of the measures before its next review.MSCI’s flagship emerging markets index is tracked by an estimated $1.6tn of investment funds, and inclusion in the index would provoke a sharp increase in demand for Saudi equities.Analysts at emerging-markets specialists Renaissance Capital estimated that, if successful, Saudi Arabia would become the ninth-largest country in the EM index, with a weight of 2.5 per cent.Foreign ownership of Saudi stocks currently stands at only 4 per cent, but RenCap said inclusion in MSCI’s index would trigger at least $2.3bn of inflows from passive funds, with a potential further $9.3bn from active funds if they had a neutral recommendation. (See its chart below.)Separately, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman today promoted his favoured son Mohammed bin Salman to the position of crown prince, making the 31-year-old heir to the throne.Prince Mohammed has increasingly become the public face of the Saudi leadership at home and abroad, courting foreign leaders including Donald Trump and acting as the driving force behind the oil-dependent state’s plans to diversify its economy.Read more:
112;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T08:23:24Z;China large-cap stocks hit highest level in 18 months after MSCI move;;MSCI’s decision to include a batch of Chinese stocks in its global benchmark equity index for the first time proved the cherry on top for a rally that pushed large-cap stocks listed on the mainland to their highest level in 18 months.The CSI 300, an index including the 300 biggest stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, added 1.2 per cent on Wednesday to close at 3,588, its highest close since December 31, 2015.MSCI said on Tuesday it would add 222 A-share large-cap stocks to its flagship emerging markets index, a move that obliges investment funds tracking the gauge to buy those names.The previous time the CSI 300 was at this level was just before a (relatively) sharp depreciation in the renminbi at the start of 2016 that triggered huge volatility in the Chinese sharemarket and handed global equities benchmarks their worst start to a calendar year in decades.On Wednesday, the Shanghai Composite gained 0.5 per cent and is hovering a whisker short of a two-month high, while the tech-focused Shenzhen Composite added 0.4 per cent to its highest since early May.Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong had a tougher time. The Hang Seng China enterprises index, which tracks such names, was down 0.7 per cent in late trade, while Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng was down 0.6 per cent.
113;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T06:55:01Z;China stocks set for $500bn inflows after MSCI move;Index starts small but mainland’s $7tn market will soon require heavy weighting;"Catherine Yeung was awake by 4.35am in Shanghai on Wednesday to get MSCI’s decision to include domestic Chinese stocks in real time. At 4.44am Ms Yeung, one of Fidelity’s investment directors for Asian equities, received a message from a colleague: “Hurrah!”Released just after 4.30am in China and Hong Kong, the news that the index provider will bring the world’s second-largest equity market into its international indices was widely expected. It was also very much hoped for, at least by Asian market watchers.But those expectations do not diminish the significance of the news, which is that for the first time, mainland China and its $7tn of stocks will no longer be an opt-in choice for global fund managers.For the $1.6tn in global funds estimated to follow MSCI’s emerging markets index, it means that, as of next year, part of their performance will rest on how they approach the 222 domestic Chinese stocks, known as A-shares, that will be included.“Mainland China is now on the map of every investor and it will definitely trigger inflows,” said Adrian Zuercher, head of Asia Pacific asset allocation for UBS Wealth Management. “First passive then active, and they will start to dig deeper into the market.”Given general international wariness towards China since its spectacular stock market collapse two years ago, that is no easy task. Concerns cited by investors include the speed of China’s economic slowdown, its ability to manage a rapidly rising debt pile and just how smoothly it can cope with the painful shift from a manufacturing to a services-led economy.Indeed, recent research showed international investment in China was hovering around its lowest in a decade relative to benchmarks.“Investors who are zero-weighted towards the mainland are now going to have to answer the question: why are you zero-weighted when A-shares make up 0.73 per cent of your benchmark?” asked Rakesh Patel, head of Asia Pacific equities for HSBC.China’s markets have given wary investors little cause for cheer recently. The Shanghai Composite, weighted towards state-owned large-cap stocks, is up 1.3 per cent this year while its tech-heavy Shenzhen counterpart has dropped 4.5 per cent. Over the border, meanwhile, Hong Kong’s blue-chip Hang Seng index has gained 16.8 per cent.Analysts are sanguine about that divergence. The Hang Seng, they point out, is dominated by Chinese companies, suggesting investors have tested the waters there and could now venture northwards. There, some stocks touted for inclusion such as Kweichow Moutai, have soared this year. Up 41 per cent, the baijiu maker has overtaken Diageo to become the world’s biggest drinks group by capitalisation.“When you look at the overall market in China this year, it hasn’t performed well, but if you look at certain individual stocks they’ve done very well,” said Kinger Lau, chief China strategist at Goldman Sachs. “The aggregate performance may not change immediately but there is a lot in there for fund managers to roll up their sleeves and look at closely.”One big issue for investors will be simply getting to grips with an unfamiliar market. Research quality varies among local brokerages and is even harder to come by in English.While international banks have been aggressively expanding their teams to cover a growing proportion of the market by capitalisation, even the largest by coverage — Morgan Stanley — opines on just 228 of the 3,000-plus stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. UBS is second, covering some 208; Citi follows 163 companies and Credit Suisse, 150. Rounding out the top five is HSBC with 129.1. Rate cut by PBoC triggers market rally
2. Another rate cut fuels further gains

4. Market begins to tumble amid crackdown on leveraged trading

——————-Investing styles will also become a topic for discussion among investors for whom emerging markets are often viewed as a straightforward growth play.“I speak to clients all over the world, especially in the US, and there’s this message that China is opaque and there are too many unknowns. There is often surprise when I start talking about the dividend story because China is still thought of as just a growth market,” said Ms Yeung.The one thing that investors and analysts agree on is that MSCI’s decision will not immediately open the floodgates or move markets. Less than $20bn of net inflows are needed to match the 0.73 per cent weighting, equating to about one-quarter of a single day’s turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen.The real significance then lies in what comes next — namely an expected gradual increase in domestic China’s weighting assuming its market liberalisation continues. Goldman analysts estimate that if China’s inclusion tracks that of South Korea — now the EM index’s second-biggest component — it will account for 9 per cent of the index in five years, translating to $230bn of inflows into China.HSBC, meanwhile, projects that if MSCI and its rival FTSE move to fully include A-shares, the two combined could produce $500bn of net inflows over the next five to 10 years.Globally, the bank’s analysts estimate that just 3 per cent of equity funds’ total holdings are Chinese.Said Mr Patel: “Given that we’re dealing with the world’s second-largest market by capitalisation, there is clearly a mismatch — and a long way to go. This news is a big step.”"

China was also in focus after MSCI decided to add some of the country’s shares to its global benchmark equity index.Mainland Chinese stocks, known as A-shares, were slightly higher in the wake of MSCI’s decision to add 222 of them to the index provider’s flagship emerging markets index.This obligates the estimated $1.6tn of investment funds that track the index to buy those names and is a step toward the internationalisation of the Chinese securities market.The Shanghai Composite was up 0.2 per cent, while the tech-focused Shenzhen Composite gained 0.2 per cent. The CSI 300, which tracks the 300 biggest stocks from both mainland benchmarks, was up 0.7 per cent.The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, was down 0.1 per cent, however. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 0.2 per cent, led by China-focused names.Japan’s broad Topix benchmark was down 0.1 per cent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 1.2 per cent drop was led by energy and materials stocks.South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.5 per cent while Taiwan’s Taiex was flat.

115;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T02:28:09Z;MSCI holds the whip hand over Chinese A-shares rollout;Indexer is trying its utmost to prod China in the right direction;"So. There is at last white smoke above MSCI. The most influential indexer of emerging market equities has decided that it will include domestic Chinese A-shares in its main global indices, starting in 12 months.This is a big deal. MSCI is by far the most followed indexer by emerging markets investors, both passive and active, so this will guide more investment dollars towards China. The A-shares market is now the world’s second-largest by capitalisation, behind only the US, so its gradual opening to the rest of the world is a big deal.But this is perhaps not what matters most about the decision. The Chinese A-share market will make up less than 1 per cent of the MSCI emerging markets index once it is included 12 months from now, as the indexer decided — as it had trailed in advance — to start by including A-shares at only 5 per cent of their market cap weighting. As this move has been much anticipated, it is unlikely to have a huge positive impact on Chinese shares.What matters most is what MSCI has not done. The index group has assiduously polled the fund management groups that are its main clients, and produced regular updates over the years about its thinking on this issue. At one point, the start of A-shares inclusion was meant to be the first step in a planned rollout, phasing in A-shares over a predictable period of time.But now that the rollout has started, MSCI is making no promises that it will increase this quota from 5 per cent in future. There is not even any projected timetable for how it expects to proceed. And while MSCI gave its reasons for caution, it has not put any clear and quantitative goals on the progress it needs to see from China before A-shares’ weighting can be increased.It also welcomed the decrease in the number of suspended China A-shares, but continues to view the number of suspensions as an outlier compared with other international markets. Investors encouraged the Chinese authorities and exchanges to consider additional measures to address the issue of suspensions. The proposal to include large-cap shares that are not in trading suspensions was approved by the vast majority of institutional investors.This is MSCI’s precise official wording on the future for A-shares: “A subsequent inclusion of China A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index could potentially include an increase of the currently announced 5 per cent inclusion factor as well as the addition of China A Mid Cap shares. MSCI will continue to monitor the situation and launch a public consultation to solicit feedback from investors once warranted.”To drive this home: MSCI is not even promising to look for more feedback until it is “warranted”, that feedback appears to be necessary before there is any increase from 5 per cent, and there is no clarity on the conditions that would need to be met to trigger the next consultation.In other words, MSCI continues to hold the whip hand. It has made a hugely important symbolic gesture, but for the time being it is little more than a gesture. It is doing its utmost to use its power as leverage to prod China in the right direction.Some pundits have pointed out that this is in line with Chinese reformists’ frequent policy of enlisting outside authorities to help them. Certainly MSCI is led very much by the big investing institutions, and it is trying its hardest to capture and channel their concerns.Specifically, the nitty gritty shows that the shares that will now be in the index are all either in the Stock Connect programme or dually quoted in Hong Kong. Stock Connect remains limited, but MSCI’s approach may well prompt far more Chinese companies in need of capital to use it. MSCI is also continuing to push China’s authorities to relax trading limits, to loosen still further restrictions on investment vehicles that are linked to indices, and on trading suspensions. It has been far too easy for Chinese companies to suspend trading in their own stock, allowing them to stop investors from getting out at just the point when they might want to.So MSCI’s key message, channelling that of its clients, is that if China wants money to flow in, it has to be prepared to let it flow out again. And to push China in that direction, MSCI has retained immense discretion. Its leverage remains almost total.There is irony in this. Proponents of index investing like the idea that they can limit fund managers’ discretion. But this is an example of an index provider usefully maintaining a very great deal of discretion. Indices are not impartial or abstract constructs; they are an expression of someone’s opinion, and this should not be forgotten.And perhaps most importantly, there is something ungainly in the way such power has been outsourced to MSCI, a relatively small for-profit organisation based in New York. Such a momentous matter as the terms of trade in which capital flows between China and the rest of the world might seem more naturally to belong to democratic or governmental institutions. Either that, or this should be an issue for the market to decide, without intervention by governments, or heavy guidance from MSCI.As it is, the big multilateral organisations do not seem to be providing the leadership provided. We should be grateful that MSCI is doing its best to mimic a market judgment by channelling the views of its clients. And it is hard to disagree with the approach that MSCI is taking. Its handling of the situation has been often masterful, and it is managing to maximise its pressure on China.But something is not right with the way capital markets have come to operate when a small company like MSCI can tell the world’s most populous country what to do."

117;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-21T00:28:14Z;Analysts react to MSCI’s China equities inclusion;;With investors across the Asia Pacific region waking up to a world in which (some) shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen have for the first time gained entry to MSCI’s flagship emerging markets equity index, analysts are already on the scene with commentary on the milestone decision.Raymond Ma, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, said investors would be expected to monitor China markets more closely:[The] inclusion will definitely boost market sentiment as well as market liquidity, and more additional capital inflows will go into the A-share markets in the medium to long term. Eventually, the valuation gaps between A-shares and their H-share counterparts are expected to narrow. In general, blue chips and large cap stocks in the A-share markets with stable dividend policies are expected to outperform.Rakesh Patel, Asia-Pacific head of equities at HSBC, said the move will have far-reaching implications for investors – albeit “in the long term”:[Investors will] need to develop a more thorough understanding of the A-share market and in particular, the 222 stocks that will be included in the index. For global investors, the decision to be zero weighted in China, which has typically been the default position, is no longer an easy one to make. We expect initial inflows will gather momentum and grow to be substantial over time.Nick Beecroft, Asian equity portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price, was likewise focused on the longer term:The initial impact on the composition of regional and global indices will be extremely modest. However, over the long term, assuming further liberalisation and regulatory reform of the mainland stock markets, the depth of China’s A-share market could mean China gains substantial weight within those broader indices.Writing ahead of the MSCI decision, John Higgins and Oliver Jones at Capital Economics said that while China’s weighting in the Emerging Markets Index could ultimately rise to 40 per cent, this was contingent on larger and probably unfettered access to A-shares:[A] steady increase in the inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index will probably only happen if China continues to liberalise her financial markets, including granting greater access to foreign investors and addressing fears over capital controls. Policymakers’ recent attempts to strengthen their grip on the renminbi suggest that is not a priority at present.

That is a larger number of stocks and a higher percentage than the index provider had proposed.On Wall Street the S&P 500 — which closed at a record 2,453.46 in the previous session — retreated 0.7 per cent to 2,437 on Tuesday.

119;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Argentina misses out on MSCI upgrade;;Argentina failed to recover its status as an emerging market on Tuesday, as widely expected by investors, after MSCI maintained its ranking as a frontier market in its benchmark equity index.Despite the host of market-friendly policies implemented since President Mauricio Macri took power 18 months ago, Argentina must now wait another year before it can be reviewed for a potential upgrade.It was downgraded in 2009 because of foreign exchange controls applied by the previous government.Although investors were wowed by the country’s latest move on the bond markets yesterday with the issuance of a $2.75bn 100-year bond, a sell-off may now ensue as the MSCI upgrade was largely priced in.While Argentine companies would have benefited from a fall in the cost of raising capital, the inflow of funds from abroad would also have helped to maintain the strength of the peso, which has harmed the competitiveness of some businesses.In delaying an upgrade for Argentina, MSCI wrote:“Since December 2015, the Argentinian Central Bank has abolished foreign exchange restrictions and the capital controls that had been in place for a number of years. These changes have resulted in, among other things: (1) a floating currency, (2) the elimination of cash reserves and monthly repatriation limits affecting the equity market and (3) the abolishment of the capital lock-up period for investments.Although the Argentinian equity market meets most of the accessibility criteria for Emerging Markets, the irreversibility of the relatively recent changes still remains to be assessed.”
120;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-20T20:41:28Z;China gains entry to MSCI’s $1.6tn emerging markets benchmark;;Chinese stocks have gained direct entry to MSCI’s global benchmark equity index for the first time, marking a milestone in Beijing’s efforts to draw international funds into the world’s second-largest market.The move means mainland stocks, known as A-shares, will next year be included in MSCI’s flagship emerging markets index, obliging the estimated $1.6tn of investment funds that track the index to buy mainland equities.The index provider’s decision opens a new front in investors’ long-running debate over whether, and how, to introduce domestic Chinese securities into international portfolios.China’s domestic equity and bond markets are the second- and third-largest in the world, respectively, yet foreigners hold just roughly 2 per cent of each. Three previous proposals by MSCI to include mainland stocks were rebuffed by the index provider’s stakeholders — mostly large asset managers.Investors’ wariness has centred on China’s weak corporate governance, concerns over how it polices its stock markets and the difficulties money managers face when repatriating funds on demand. Anxiety about the latter was amplified by Beijing’s heavy-handed response to the 2015 market crash, where at one point, more than half of all stocks were suspended from trading and officials forced local institutions to contribute to a bailout fund.This year’s successful proposal sidestepped most of those concerns by including only A-shares that are already traded through the Stock Connect that links Hong Kong with Shanghai and Shenzhen. The Stock Connect operates as a closed system where international investors buy A-shares in Hong Kong dollars and also cash out in that currency, meaning they are subject to fewer capital restrictions than if they bought the shares in the mainland using renminbi.
121;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-18T16:31:40Z;Argentina ‘ripe’ to reclaim emerging market status;Return to MSCI index set to unleash greater inflow of global funds;Argentina is optimistic of reclaiming emerging market status for global investment portfolios on Tuesday when MSCI the index provider announces its latest rankings for a number of countries.Investors and Argentina’s treasury minister, Nicolás Dujovne, believe the time has come for upgrading the country from its current ranking as a frontier market for inclusion in the world’s dominant EM equity index.A host of market-friendly policies have been implemented since the administration led by Mauricio Macri was elected 18 months ago, with a record breaking $16bn sovereign bond sale ending a decade of isolation from international credit.“The conditions are ripe for an upgrade,” argues Mr Dujovne. “We should never have stopped being an emerging market,” he adds, criticising the previous government for its populist policies.Argentina was downgraded to a frontier market in 2009 by MSCI after the previous government applied foreign exchange controls.An upgrade by MSCI would prompt investment funds from all over the world to buy Argentine equities. So far this year the Merval index of 27 companies has gained about 25 per cent in both peso and US dollar terms.Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X who manages an MSCI exchange-traded fund dedicated to Argentine equities said the fund’s assets have grown from less than $10m before the election of Mr Macri to almost $180m now.“That [growth] is a microcosm of what we could see,” said Mr Jacobs, pointing out that with as many as 100 times more wealth tracking emerging markets than frontier markets, an upgrade would immediately create a far bigger pool of funds that could potentially invest in Argentina.The potential inflow of funds into Argentina could boost the foreign ownership of Argentine equities from 2 per cent of gross domestic product in 2016 towards the emerging markets average of around 10 per cent, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.However Fernando Sedano, an economist at the bank warns capital inflows will strengthen the exchange rate, which has already been under pressure from unprecedented inflows into local debt markets over the past year. The strength of the peso has triggered complaints from local businesses about losses in competitiveness.Mr Dujovne argues the benefits for Argentine companies — and by extension the broader economy — would be significant, since the cost of raising capital would fall with the growth in liquidity.An MSCI upgrade would follow another milestone for Argentine companies on Monday, when Mercado Libre, an ecommerce website often described as Latin America’s answer to eBay, will be included in the Nasdaq-100 index.Mercado Libre, which is valued at around $12.4bn, will replace Yahoo, which is being removed from the index because of its conversion to a closed-end fund.
122;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-18T05:00:13Z;MSCI set to rule on China A-shares and Brexit talks begin;Markets primed for big week as investors rotate after central bank meetings;Here’s what we are watching at FT markets as a new trading week looms for traders and investors.Will MSCI include China A-shares in its globally tracked EM index?Tuesday is showtime for MSCI, which has delayed for each of the past three years including China’s domestic A-shares in its global indices.Having in the past cited regulation worries and accessibility for global investors, there are signs that MSCI is ready to say yes this time. Such a decision has big repercussions for global investors as it will oblige investment funds to pump billions into China’s stocks.And MSCI has markedly altered its inclusion proposal to make it more palatable to its clients. The list of A-share companies to be included in the benchmark index will be just 169, down from 448 previously. So if A-shares are included, they will account for just 0.5 per cent of the MSCI EM Index and not a hefty 5 per cent under MSCI’s previous proposal.Notably, BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, has for the first time publicly backed the inclusion of onshore stocks in MSCI’s indices.For China, acceptance by MSCI would mark a key step for Beijing as it seeks to open up its financial markets and attract foreign capital.So perhaps it will be fourth time lucky for China A-Shares?Michael MackenzieWatching the pound as Brexit negotiations formally startIt finally begins. Britain will open its talks to leave the EU on Monday. So far sterling has been the main conduit for neuralgia about political uncertainty as investors contemplate the market implications, while gilts have held up well, outperforming Treasuries and eurozone debt.Both sides in the negotiations — which will take place in Brussels — will be closely watched for early indications of the shape of the eventual deal, with the rights of EU citizens living in the UK likely to prove the first big challenge.As the economic outlook clouds over and the Bank of England contemplates the question of when to raise rates, the Conservative party faces “a difficult juggling act” if its Eurosceptic and pro-EU factions are “unable to agree between themselves what Brexit should look like”, according to George Buckley, an economist at Nomura.While the pound ended last week above recent lows versus the dollar and euro the outlook remains cloudy.“The financial markets [are] now expecting the final deal to be softer than what the prime minister had been initially planning”, which has supported sterling, he says. Continued political uncertainty could however weigh on the currency, he warns.Kate AllenWhat next for markets after a big week for central banks?The long-awaited shift towards rates normalisation beyond the Federal Reserve has begun.Last week’s surprises, in the form of the Bank of Canada’s strong hawkish tone and the Bank of England’s split vote, will have investors surveying the policymaking landscape to see who else might catch them off guard.Kit Juckes of Société Générale suggests investors look to Australia, New Zealand and Sweden and watch their currencies closely. “Surprise shifts in the direction of travel for monetary policy have greater scope than almost anything else to move currencies at the moment,” he says.New Zealand and Norway central banks meet this week. Both are likely to find good reasons to stay on hold, with weaker inflation offsetting the pace of economic growth.The bigger fish for markets are the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, and while the BoJ last week reinforced its monetary easing position, investors think the ECB is slowly positioning itself for a change in tone.As for the Fed, chair Janet Yellen sees no reason to rein in its rates policy but markets are sceptical. Even so, says John Hardy at Saxo Bank, the Fed’s hawkishness, combined with the ECB’s policy outlook and the unexpected shifts in the BoC and BoE “all add up to a theme of global central banks withdrawing policy accommodation”.Roger BlitzHow many more steps are required for Greek debt sustainability?The next loan for Greece was rubber stamped this week, when the European authorities approved an €8.5bn payment which should allow the country to repay about €7bn imminently owed to private creditors over the next three months. The deal largely replicates one agreed in May, and has tentative backing from the German government and International Monetary Fund. However, the debt relief measures are the same as those proposed last year, with a central aspect pushing out repayment and deferring interest on €131bn of loans made under the official EFSF programme, out of €327bn of the unrepayable total for government debt.The European Central Bank called the deal a “first step” towards debt sustainability, but the question remains how many more of these small steps will be required. The bailout programme is supposed to leave Greece funding itself from capital markets in a year, and the possibility of a different form of support — ECB purchases of Greek debt — remains uncertain. According to economists at Citi: “The chances of a fourth bailout for Greece being needed over the next couple of years remain high, in our view, as we see it as quite unlikely that Greece could return to full market funding by the time the current programme ends in 12 months.” Meanwhile, long-suffering Greek voters have few concessions from their creditors to cheer, as they contemplate the next decade of enforced austerity.Dan McCrum
123;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-15T20:22:06Z;Defining moment for investors looms as MSCI rules on China;Index provider set to make call on including mainland A-shares in its EM benchmark;China’s growing acceptance into international capital markets faces a watershed moment next week with a decision on whether a first batch of stocks listed on its $7tn domestic equity markets will be included into the world’s dominant emerging markets stock index.If MSCI, an index provider, approves the inclusion of a cohort of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed A-shares into its main emerging markets index, it will confer an unprecedented recognition upon China’s domestic capital markets and oblige funds all over the world to pour billions into the country’s stocks.Although mainland-listed Chinese stocks and bonds have already been included in several investment sub-indices, they have yet to ascend into an international benchmark index. The distinction is crucial because fund managers judge their performance against benchmarks, so inclusion obliges them to buy the underlying securities.“To sum this up in one word, I would say it is monumental,” says Caroline Owen, chief executive of RMB Global Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm. “We are on the verge of one of the greatest rebalancings of global portfolios that we have seen in recent years.”Currently, China’s A-share markets and its $9.3tn domestic bond market — which rank as the world’s second and third largest respectively — remain largely sequestered from international capital flows because governance problems dissuade index providers from including them in their benchmarks.Opinion is divided, however, on whether MSCI will next week grant inclusion to A-shares. In each of the past three years, the company has debated inclusion among its clients only to reject it, citing market access obstacles and governance issues.This year, though, MSCI sharply pared back its inclusion proposal to make it more palatable to its clients. It cut the list of stocks to be included in the benchmark index to 169 from 448 previously, meaning that if A-shares win entry they will account for just 0.5 per cent of the MSCI EM Index, down from 5 per cent under the previous proposal.The index provider also effectively dropped a market access objection that related to the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme. This channel allows approved foreign funds access to A-shares but under conditions that limit their ability to repatriate their money — an issue flagged by MSCI last year when it rejected the inclusion of A-shares.Earlier this year, MSCI focused on Stock Connect, a parallel system between Hong Kong and mainland equity markets that provides access to domestic shares with fewer repatriation limits.To some, such accommodation smacks of expedience.“The US firm [MSCI] has resolutely rejected inclusion . . . citing prevailing concerns over the inability to access, trade and cash in stocks freely,” says Nick Yeo, head of Chinese and Hong Kong equities at Aberdeen Asset Management.“But we detect a marked change in MSCI’s accommodation this year,” Mr Yeo adds. “Far from endorsing Beijing’s efforts to address previous impediments surrounding ownership rights, capital repatriation limits and trading suspensions, the index creator has instead modified its own admission criteria to such a degree that China’s entry now appears a formality.”BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said in April for the first time that it backed the inclusion of domestic Chinese shares in the MSCI’s global indices.Fidelity, another large investor, also strikes an upbeat tone. In a statement provided to the Financial Times, Tim Orchard, chief investment officer in the Asia Pacific (ex-Japan), says: “As access to China’s onshore equity market widens, it is natural for these stocks to be gradually included in equity market indices.”Such alacrity to embrace China’s domestic stocks comes amid stiff competition from MSCI’s rivals. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, offers a successful emerging markets exchange-traded fund which follows a China A-share sub-index provided by FTSE, a competitor to MSCI.“The fact that Vanguard decided to track our index shows that they know A-share inclusion into the FTSE benchmark index is going to happen,” says a spokesperson for FTSE. The index provider is set to review its indices in September.In further signs of MSCI’s efforts, it whittled down the stocks it is proposing for inclusion by barring companies that have been suspended from trading for more than 50 days, as well as those that do not have sufficiently large capitalisations. They also adjusted the weightings to reflect investor preferences for consumer stocks over financials (See chart).The bottom line for MSCI, says Mr Yeo, is that if their clients do not vote for inclusion, they risk missing out on the good returns that A-shares can offer. “If they are late to the point of losing relevance to investors, then inclusion could become more urgent,” he says.MSCI declined to comment on questions surrounding A-share inclusion. Currently, investors who track the MSCI EM Index do already get considerable exposure to Chinese companies that are listed beyond mainland China, mainly in Hong Kong. These type of listings account for 28.1 per cent of the MSCI EM Index and 3.1 per cent of the MSCI All-Country World Index.In other key decisions from MSCI next week, Argentina may move from being a big fish in the frontier index to a small sprat in the emerging market ocean. It has 14 stocks in MSCI’s FM100 index, more than any other country, and an index weight of 19.5 per cent, second only to Kuwait. Nine of those stocks would make it into the EM index, leaving Argentina with a weight of just 0.4 per cent.That would come when there is a lot more money available for investing in Argentina. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report this week that “the aggregate pocket of investors eligible to trade Argentine equities” could increase by about five times. All else being equal, they estimate that promotion to EM status would boost Argentine share prices by between 8 and 15 per cent.Nigeria, meanwhile, is waiting to see if it will be dropped out of the frontier index, with some analysts saying that recent moves by the government to free up foreign exchange markets for investors may convince MSCI to stay its hand.
124;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-06-05T20:07:40Z;Betting on a green China and MSCI stamp of approval;Country’s A-share market contains many environmentally friendly companies;"Two events — one that has just happened and one that may be imminent — are swelling the ranks of investors willing to bet that a great environmental rehabilitation in smog-choked China could become a stock market megatrend.The first was last week’s decision by Donald Trump to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, ceding leadership over the global green agenda to China and Europe. The second is the prospect that MSCI, an influential index provider, could decide for the first time later this month to include some Chinese A-shares in one of its benchmark indices.“What the Chinese dream is about is blue sky and blue water,” says Karine Hirn, partner at EastCapital, an emerging market asset manager. “Investment into the global leaders in environmental protection is very exciting.”The scale of environmental degradation in China — the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases — has created an unstoppable “green” momentum galvanised by social pressure and reinforced by Beijing’s regulatory will, several analysts say.This means that there is no chance that Beijing could follow the US and back out of the 2015 Paris agreement to combat climate change, Wang Yao, director-general of Beijing’s International Institute of Green Finance, says in an interview.“The US is pulling out of the Paris accord . . . and this makes China into a leader, but really we are just doing what we must do for our own domestic reasons,” Ms Wang says. “We face a very serious environmental challenge so we must continue with green development.”This imperative has accelerated an avalanche of investment into Chinese clean technologies, green transportation and renewable energy over the past few years. China today has more than a third of the world’s windpower capacity; a quarter of its solar power; six of the top 10 solar-panel makers; four of the top 10 wind turbine makers and more battery-only electric car sales last year than the rest of the world combined.Ms Hirn estimates that a sum roughly equivalent to the GDP of Denmark is invested in Chinese clean tech each year, while the total market capitalisation of about 350 listed “green” Chinese companies stands at about $600bn. But although these are big numbers, she says, China will need far greater investment if it really hopes to rehabilitate its contaminated air, land and water.John Lin, portfolio manager for China equities at asset manager AllianceBernstein, is also animated by the green theme. Opportunities have come in industries where small polluting factories have been shut down en masse, boosting profit margins for their larger environmentally-friendly counterparts, Mr Lin says.In paper production, for instance, the share price performance of Nine Dragons Paper and Shandong Chenming Paper has impressed this year. There have also been beneficiaries of capacity rationalisation in the steel, non-ferrous metals and chemical industries, Mr Lin says. Wanhua Chemical and ENN Ecological have been strong performers.Ms Hirn favours the clean transportation theme, particularly those companies involved in new energy vehicle (NEV) technology. Waste management and air pollution control technologies were other segments in which opportunities exist as local governments answer exhortations from Beijing to clean up their cities, Ms Hirn adds.However, many companies that are potential beneficiaries from the green agenda are listed on China’s $7tn domestic A-share markets, which remain exotic for many overseas funds. However, this could start to change if, on June 20, MSCI announces it will include a number of A-shares into its emerging markets benchmark index.Opinion is divided on whether or not MSCI will announce A-share inclusion. However, an affirmative decision would have a profound influence, with passive managers obliged to take on A-share exposure for the first time, while active managers seek out the best Chinese stocks, says Caroline Owen, chief executive of RMB Global Advisors, a New York-based advisory firm.“We are on the verge of one of the greatest rebalancings in global portfolios that we have seen in recent years,” Ms Owen adds.MSCI delayed A-share inclusion for a third straight year last June, citing regulation worries and accessibility for global investors. This year it has reduced the number of A-shares slated for inclusion to 169, down from a previous 448, in a move that was intended to make inclusion more palatable to global asset managers.However, it is possible that yet again this year the decision will be negative. “I heard there were some technical issues that may make it tough to include A-shares this year,” says a fund manager, who declined to be identified.james.kynge@ft.com"
125;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-05-31T08:35:20Z;The argument for owning European equities;Investors should hold their noses and revisit Spanish and Italian bank shares;"In this column last month, I covered non-US stocks’ historical leadership in US presidents’ inaugural years. History shows us that the party really gets going in the second half, making this your buying window. But what to own? For answers, look at sector and country winners from the first quarter of this year.Since 1970 — when good sector data begin — non-US sectors that led in the first quarter of inaugural years led for the rest of the year. The first quarter’s top three non-US sectors led the MSCI EAFE Index (Europe, Australasia, Far East) 61 per cent of the time, by a median 3.4 per cent. Meanwhile, the three worst sectors trailed the rest of the year 76 per cent of the time by -4.8 per cent.Country leadership also persists. Similarly, the first quarter’s top country or region led the rest of the year 80 per cent of the time, by a median 5.6 per cent. The second best kept leading 60 per cent of the time, with a 2.2 per cent spread. The worst kept lagging 60 per cent of the time, and by 6.2 per cent.“No correlation without causation” is one of my pet rules. “No heat chasing” is another. But I see fundamental reasons why many first quarter trends continue. The drivers don’t suddenly shift when the calendar flips from March to April. With America’s new administration in place, falling political uncertainty had already given its bullish impact on US stocks, hence first-quarter growth has favoured non-US stocks. And when non-US stocks lead early in inaugural years, the outperformance usually grows with time.Outside America, many nations are very sector heavy. So if you expect non-US stocks to lead, that impacts sectors too.On a regional basis, the first quarter’s best were Australia and continental Europe, while Canada lagged behind badly. Of the 10 eurozone nations in the MSCI World Index, seven outperformed. So buy Europe — not just core stalwarts like Germany, the Netherlands and France, but also the periphery.Spain was the single best-performing country in the first quarter, and midway through May, its lead has widened. Australia, however, has sagged, and I see it as part of the 20 per cent that reverses first quarter success historically. Aussie stocks are a heavy bet on materials, whose early-year bounce petered out as folks fathomed metals’ enduring supply glut.As for sectors, in the first quarter, non-US’s best sectors were technology, healthcare, industrials, consumer staples and utilities. The worst were energy — hence commodity-heavy Canada’s lag — plus telecoms and discretionary consumer stocks.—————More from Ken FisherStocks aren’t overvalued — so keep buying

Trump will struggle — but global stocks will boom
All I want for Christmas is a Fed rate rise
Take a global view to stock buying as political fears subside—————I’ve long liked healthcare and tech and expect greatness from here. Global demand for drugs, gadgets and software likely stays sky-high through this cycle’s close. Buy industrials, but avoid those dependent on commodity prices — aerospace, diversified conglomerates and consumer-goods manufacturers have better potential. As for staples and utilities, own some but don’t go crazy. Both tend to lag during strong expansions. Maybe they’ll be part of the 39 per cent that flip-flops.Financials are a special case. Globally, financials lagged behind in the first quarter and kept trailing. But eurozone financials led in the first quarter, and have sped up since. Buy them.US loan growth is slowing, but eurozone lending is ramping up, and banks there are loosening. Based on senior loan officer opinion surveys from the Federal Reserve and ECB, eurozone credit availability has improved since early 2016, while US loan supply has tightened.In the US, more banks tightened than loosened in three of the last four quarters. In Europe, banks net loosened in three of four quarters. In the one quarter that more banks tightened (the fourth quarter of 2016) the difference was only 0.2 per cent — so basically even. Lending trends tend to follow changes in credit standards, so Europe’s looser stance argues for ever-faster loan growth.Historically, relative credit availability has correlated with outperformance. For most of the 2002-07 bull market, eurozone banks lent more eagerly than US banks, and eurozone stocks outperformed US — by 182 per cent to 61 per cent over the whole bull run.For this bull market’s first few years, we had the opposite — looser lending in America and US outperformance. Yet for the past year, there has been a fairly big disconnect between relative credit access and relative returns.Even as eurozone credit improved, US markets outperformed — until just recently. Investors were too distracted by politics to fathom faster loan growth’s implications. The French election’s conclusion should help folks refocus.Eurozone leadership is only just starting. Europe’s credit cycle is young. Banks have ample room to expand balance sheets and improve non-performing loan ratios.America’s cycle is older. US banks have been expanding balance sheets for five years, and non-performing loan ratios are about as good as can be. US banks are healthy, stocks already reflect that. Yet investors still broadly hate eurozone banks. Their relatively brighter future isn’t priced yet. That goes double for Spanish and Italian banks— hated currently for no good reason, just bitter memories. Hold your nose and buy now.Ken Fisher is the founder and Chairman of Fisher Investments"
126;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-05-26T12:13:22Z;Best of Lex: your weekly round-up;Dad dancing towards a more diverse equities market;"To understand the position of Wall Street in relation to this year’s most anticipated listings, it helps to listen to Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” on Spotify. During this 1984 diversion into the (for him) blind alley of commercial pop, we find the blue-collared troubadour singing: “You can’t start a fire, you can’t start a fire without a spark, this gun’s for hire, even if we’re just dancing in the dark.”Spotify, which runs the eponymous Sweden-based music streaming service, may join the market through a “direct listing”. Here, the stock starts to trade without any offering of shares by the company or big private investors.The mechanism is little used. One reason is that most businesses believe they need the spark of an initial public offering to fire up demand for stock. The other is that well-remunerated bankers (guns for hire, in case you hadn’t guessed) are good at convincing CEOs they will otherwise find themselves dad dancing in the shadows like The Boss.Lex reckons Spotify is well-enough known to avoid that fate. What the shares do on the day of the listing will feel like an irrelevance within a few weeks. A more profound question is how the soi-disant “Netflix of Music” might be valued. With more than 100m users, Spotify is in a good position to wring a cheaper deal from the record labels to which it pays royalties. Lifting operating margin from 15 per cent to 25 per cent in this way could make the difference between joining the market at a valuation of just over $10bn or more than $20bn.Thanks for reading Best of Lex on Fridays. Plenty of FT readers do. Would you welcome a Lex newsletter picking apart financial and corporate issues midweek? Please let us know in an email to lex@ft.comIPOs were much in Lex’s thoughts this week. We love a new proposition and there frankly aren’t enough of them to counter the decline of equities, whose stock is eroding in developed economies.Delivery Hero could bring new flavour to the Frankfurt market. Like Spotify, the meal delivery business does not need cash itself, but wants to make it easier for backers to sell out. The group, worth an estimated €3.2bn, belongs to the stable of Rocket Internet, the German new technology group snippily accused in Silicon Valley of copying its ideas. Silicon Valleyites are perfectly capable of doing that for themselves, judging from legal case history.We thought Delivery Hero should not be in a hurry to float. It would command a better valuation when/if emerging markets operation Food Panda makes a profit.IPO timing is an issue for Carrefour too. The French supermarket operator plans to float Brazilian subsidiary Atacadão. We argued the group could merit a premium to a rival, Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição, because its profits have held up better during the “corruptocracy” scandal. CBD’s forward enterprise value is around eight times earnings before nasties.Carrefour’s own multiple is 6.7 times, reflecting the morosité of French consumers. But that’s another story.More relevantly, Alfa Financial Software joined the UK market via an IPO on Friday. The pricing only made it a unicorn (implying a capitalisation over one billion) in dollar terms. A 30 per cent jump in the shares when they started traded ensured it has that status in sterling too.UK investors may struggle finding comparators for the asset finance software group, given a local paucity of tech companies. It does not much resemble accounting software group Sage or Misys, the banking software group whose poor performance in the noughties precluded a return to the market last year.Larger companies usually hope for inclusion in stock indices when they list. Index funds are then required to invest and shares enjoy a premium as a result. Lex believes that could be a good thing in the burgeoning market for “green” bonds. The difficulty here is the legitimacy with which that term is used. When big institutions have responsible investment quotas to meet, issuers may be tempted to greenwash bonds and thereby reduce funding costs.A body called the Climate Bonds Initiative has refused to include €500m of green bonds issued by Spanish oil company Repsol in its own index. Leaving aside the rights and wrongs of that case, we judged tough calls on index inclusion would aid price differentiation.Conversely, we urged MSCI to think carefully before including Chinese shares with mainland listing in its emerging market indices. Reporting standards are low and the price increases that would come with inclusion could merely give short sellers — who are having some notable successes in the Hong Kong market — fatter targets to shoot at.Have a pleasant weekend,Jonathan GuthrieHead of LexEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.comBest of Lex articlesIPOs: Spotify the difference

127;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-05-24T16:08:05Z;ETF providers float idea of setting up their own market indices;Discussions remain internal but reflect frustration about fees paid to S&P and MSCI;Executives at some of the big providers of exchange traded funds have floated the idea of forming an industry “co-operative” to create stock market indices rivalling those from S&P, FTSE and MSCI as pressure to cut costs in the passive asset management industry intensifies.The concept has been mooted privately inside some large asset managers, which are increasingly frustrated at the costs of licensing indices such as the S&P 500 that ETFs track, say people with knowledge of the matter.A ferocious price war has driven down the fees that asset managers can charge for ETFs, meaning index licensing costs eat up more of their profit margin. The historic leaders in the industry, State Street’s SPDR range of ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares and Invesco’s PowerShares, face competition that includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Vanguard, among others.The fees index companies charge can vary significantly, but for the biggest asset managers it can add up to tens of millions of dollars a year. In 2016, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ revenues rose 7 per cent to $639m, MSCI’s index revenues climbed 9.8 per cent to $613.6m and FTSE Russell’s revenues increased 17 per cent to £409m.“If it’s a better outcome for investors, then everything is on the table,” said Lynn Blake, chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors’ passive equities business. “There’s more pressure now than ever to consider something like self-indexing or other alternatives to keep costs lower while providing the same services to our clients . . . I do feel we are at a crossroads. The [investment management] business is not what it will look like in five years’ time. It’s all in flux.”State Street declined to say whether it was considering setting up an index provider, either by itself or with other players in the ETF industry.GSAM uses its own bespoke indices for its more complicated “smart beta” ETFs, a practice known as self-indexing. Steve Sachs, head of ETF capital markets at GSAM, says an independent, jointly-owned index provider “makes sense”.“The more competition there is in that area the better,” said Mr Sachs. “There’s always been grumbling in the asset management world about fees you have to pay. But the drumbeat has become a little louder.”BlackRock declined to comment on the idea. It said: “Index providers are important partners for us, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and grow with them.” Vanguard said that index costs “generally have increased” and that it “continually looks for ways to reduce costs for shareholders”, but added: “At the current time, we are satisfied with the construction methodologies, objectivity and credibility offered by independent index providers.”A co-operative, perhaps modelled on CDSIndexCo, which was set up by the big banks to create indices of credit default swaps and is now part of Markit, would be costly and face considerable obstacles, not least questions about whether asset managers acting in concert were breaching antitrust rules. Discussions have remained in-house.However, it would bring new competition to an industry where a bout of consolidation has resulted in just a handful of influential index providers controlling benchmarks tracked by trillions of dollars.

Its banking regulator has launched a “regulatory windstorm” while the central bank has made the first move to ease capital controls, providing much needed liquidity to the offshore renminbi market.Meanwhile, BlackRock has for the first time publicly backed the inclusion of onshore stocks in MSCI’s indices and Chinese officials have even criticised dividend-dodging companies, dubbed “iron cockerels”, and promised extra scrutiny.So will fourth time be the charm?

129;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-05-17T15:42:14Z;Hong Kong selfie-app group Meitu given lesson in index membership;Shares rally then tumble after MSCI reverses judgment on inclusion;A selfie-app company learned the value of index membership on Wednesday, when shares in Meitu Inc dropped 9 per cent after MSCI said the Hong Kong listed stock would not, as previously announced, enter its China index in June.MSCI had included Meitu in a list of planned index changes published Monday evening, and the sudden reversal highlights the power of index providers to direct money and attention towards little known companies.Meitu has a mostly young and female following of over 450m active monthly users. The company makes most of its revenue from smartphone sales, but has no profits to date — and does not expect to make any this year or the next.No explanation was given for the change until after markets closed, when MSCI released a statement suggesting the initial planned inclusion of Meitu was an error.The company said “following additional analysis”, Meitu did not meet the index’s minimum free-float requirements, determined by the proportion of a company’s stock available to be bought and sold.MSCI said this free-float did not include shares bought by investors before Meitu’s recent initial public offering, which cannot be sold in the first six months of trading.So-called “lock-up” arrangements are common in Hong Kong, both for early investors and “cornerstone” investors willing to take a large position in an IPO, meaning newly issued shares can struggle to attract attention because of thin trading volumes.“Applications for indexes are meticulously researched, so something very strange must have gone on,” said Will McFadden, head of equity sales at NSBO, a China-focused investment bank.Meitu was valued at over $5.3bn after its December IPO, when it raised $639m from the sale of 12 per cent of its total shares. Of the shares offered, a quarter went to cornerstone investors.As the six-month lock-up period for Meitu’s investors ends on June 13, it is possible MSCI will have to make a second U-turn at its next review of the China Index, a high profile collection of mainland Chinese businesses listed overseas and so available to international investors.A common trading strategy is to anticipate changes to the composition of popular indices, knowing that funds that track an index or measure their performance against it may be forced to buy stocks scheduled for membership.“It damages MSCI’s reputation — will people have to wait to see if they change their minds the next time they include something in the index?” said Mr McFadden. MSCI declined to comment further.The index provider believes that the company’s actual free float is less than its minimum requirement of 15 per cent — due to shares being held by major pre-IPO investors, who cannot sell shares until next month.The company’s shares are heavily concentrated in the hands of its top five shareholders, who collectively own 56 per cent of the company.

The stock had closed 4.1 per cent higher in Hong Kong on Tuesday.By March, Meitu’s share price peaked 171 per cent above the initial public offering price of HK$8.50 before tumbling on news Hong Kong’s securities regulator had requested trading records for the company three times since its December 15 IPO.Shares are up 18.8 per cent from their listing price.
131;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-05-11T15:17:48Z;Saudi Arabia prepared to ease foreign caps in MSCI index push;Chief executive of Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, will listen to investors’ feedback;Saudi Arabia is prepared to ease regulations limiting foreign investment in the country’s stock market ahead of the much-anticipated Saudi Aramco initial public offering next year.Khalid al-Hussan, chief executive of Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, says he expects it to be selected for potential inclusion into the influential MSCI emerging markets stock index in June, with formal entry to follow a year later.To ensure foreign flows into Saudi stocks increase during this consultation period, the kingdom would consider further changes to its regulatory regime governing foreign investments.“I am positive that we have made all the changes needed to be in line with international investors’ requirements,” Mr Hussan told the FT.“Of course, this is demand driven,” he added. “If we see appropriate changes on the current framework, in terms of operations or regulations, during the consultation period, we will be closely listening to these changes.”Opening up to foreign capital is one part of the kingdom’s ambitious Vision 2030 reform programme that is aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil revenues.Tadawul and regulatory officials are in the US this week meeting foreign investors to gather feedback regarding its latest technical reforms, which included setting settlement procedures in line with international norms.The MSCI’s decision on whether to include Saudi Arabia in its index could hinge on traders’ feedback.Large inflows are expected if Tadawul joins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted in a recent report. It said the MSCI could grant the kingdom weighting of 2-3 per cent, and even higher if the planned listing of Saudi Aramco is included.Mr Hussan says the market has “a strong capacity” to be able to absorb Aramco’s planned IPO. The authorities are also working on “multiple angles” to increase liquidity further, such as trying to be included in the MSCI emerging markets index and attracting major institutions to invest.The region’s largest and deepest capital market first opened up to foreign investors in 2015 via the “qualified financial investors” programme, with requirements eased last year.But global investors say the market would receive greater foreign interest if these limits were relaxed further.“Why are they still faffing around with QFI hurdles on assets under management — they are a pain to navigate,” said one asset manager investing in the kingdom. “Demand is there, but regulations need to catch up.”Foreign capital makes up 4 per cent of the Tadawul market, of which 1 per cent has come from new overseas institutions, says Mohammed Elkuwaiz, vice-chairman of the Capital Markets Authority.That 1 per cent is growing rapidly, he says, as the regulator looks to diversify the product range and attract a broader array of companies to the exchange.As the dominant market in the oil-rich Gulf, the CMA is for the first time targeting other companies to choose Tadawul as a listing location, seeking to lure firms away from other markets, such as the London Stock Exchange.Tadawul, which launched the parallel growth market for smaller companies in February, has already seen significant demand from around 20 regional firms to join the initial seven firms listing on the “Numu” platform.“In capital markets, the name of the game is scale,” said Mr Elkuwaiz. If you have size and liquidity and investor participation, that’s where investors will want to go.”

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
133;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-05-04T07:41:26Z;China A-share entry into benchmark index to reshape investing;Modest inclusion would be step to bringing country fully into global capital markets;"There are clear signs that China A-shares could shortly be included in a key international benchmark for the first time — in a way that highlights smarter efforts by the west to help China integrate into global markets.Each year since 2014, index provider MSCI has consulted with equity market practitioners on whether the time has been right to admit China A-shares, which are traded on onshore markets, into the MSCI Emerging Market Index. To date, the answer has been “no” — but there are clear signs that this year the answer will be “yes”. A decision is expected in June.beyondbrics is a forum on emerging markets for contributors from the worlds of business, finance, politics, academia and the third sector. All views expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be taken as reflecting the views of the Financial Times.The reason for the change is this: MSCI has dropped its usual rigorously applied standard terms of entry in favour of a more gradualist and pragmatic approach. The move will involve fewer stocks initially, sourced under simpler institutional arrangements than those offered in previous proposals.This is an exciting development, for two reasons. First, even a modest initial inclusion in the index will be a significant step forward in bringing China — which has an equity-market capitalisation of $7.5tn — fully into global capital markets.Second, it suggests that western companies have taken a leaf out of China’s own book on how to approach the huge challenge of modernising the country’s capital markets.There are three ways for foreign investors to participate in China A-shares. Two are licensing regimes while the third consists of arm’s length trading arrangements on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.The Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme and the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) scheme, introduced in 2002 and 2011 respectively, allow direct access to China’s capital markets. Investors are subject to conditions including licensing requirements, quotas and redemption limitations.Since 2014 and last December respectively, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have participated in Stock Connect. This programme links them to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and enables foreign investors to buy A-shares with fewer restrictions than under the QFII schemes.Until this year, MSCI’s proposals to include A-shares in its index were based on the QFII/RQFII framework and 448 stocks. The terms and conditions of the QFII licensing regime, however, were among the obstacles to the market’s acceptance of the proposals.A fresh approach
MSCI appears to have adapted. Just as China did when pausing for nine years between the launch of QFII and RQFII, and two years between adding the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to Stock Connect, MSCI is taking a “softly, softly” approach.This year, MSCI is proposing to include in the index only A-shares sourced under the Stock Connect regime. This narrows the universe of investible stocks but, as Stock Connect is not subject to the same restrictions governing QFII, the proposal, in our view, has a real chance of being accepted.Initially, the 169 stocks envisaged under this proposal would increase China’s presence in the Emerging Market Index by just 50 basis points, to 28.6 per cent. But that’s the thin end of the wedge.When the 169 stocks go into the index (which we expect will happen in June 2018), they will do so at a low initial inclusion factor. The next step will be for MSCI to increase the weightings.This will immediately take the A-shares’ portion of the index from 50 basis points to 8.6 per cent, in our view. But it doesn’t stop there. Currently, the total number of shares included in the Stock Connect scheme is 1,479 compared with more than 2,900 available under the QFII system.As Stock Connect grows over time and A-shares become fully included in the index, China’s overall weighting is likely to grow to nearly 40 per cent.Its share of the MSCI All Country World Index would increase from 3 per cent to 4 per cent, raising it from joint sixth place currently to fourth place behind the US, Japan and the UK (and ahead of France, Canada and Germany).Impact on global allocations
For some investors, China’s policy risks and economic challenges over the past few years have cast a shadow over the country’s huge potential.We think that the entry of China A-shares into the Emerging Market Index sooner rather than later will remind investors that the Chinese giant, when it wakes, will have a meaningful impact on their global equity allocations.The best way to prepare for this, in our view, is to follow China and MSCI and take the long view. That means looking beyond China’s present uncertainties and preparing steadily and purposefully for its rise to even greater prominence in world markets.John Lin is a senior research analyst and portfolio manager in China equities at AllianceBernstein"
134;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-04-20T05:46:48Z;BlackRock backs mainland China shares for MSCI benchmarks;Support offers significant boost to index provider’s latest proposal;BlackRock has for the first time backed the inclusion of mainland Chinese shares in MSCI’s global indices, bolstering the index provider’s fourth attempt to have A-shares included in its benchmarks.China hosts the world’s second-largest stock market and the third-largest bond market, but fund managers have argued over whether, and how, to include mainland assets in global indices — a move that would force index-tracking funds to invest onshore.An estimated $1.5tn follows MSCI’s flagship emerging markets stock index. Last month the index provider put forward a proposal for including A-shares that focused only on large-cap stocks available through the Stock Connect system, which allows international investors to trade stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen through Hong Kong without having to register onshore.The proposal was MSCI’s fourth in as many years.BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, avoided specifically backing the current proposal but said: “BlackRock is supportive of China A-share inclusion in global indices.”BlackRock’s support, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, marks a potential shift in industry sentiment because the fund has been widely thought by industry insiders to have resisted MSCI’s suggestions up to this point.BlackRock said: “We have over a decade’s experience managing A-share investments for our clients and multiple ways to provide these exposures, including onshore Chinese investment quota and the capacity to use the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock connect programmes.”Chinese stocks listed outside the mainland make up 27 per cent of the MSCI’s EM benchmark, but international investment in onshore stocks and bonds still amount to less than 2 per cent of either asset class.How best to begin the long process of including the Chinese mainland in global indices has been hotly debated for years. FTSE Russell, MSCI’s biggest equity index rival, pioneered a “parallel universe” approach where it created a series of its benchmarks that included mainland shares alongside its existing China-free flagships.Bloomberg, the first of the big bond index providers to include China, adopted a similar approach earlier this year.Last year’s proposal by MSCI was shot down by fund managers’ concerns about China’s capital controls — which have since been tightened — regulatory extraterritoriality and some unique local market practices.Analysts have said that the index group’s latest proposal, which is a dramatic slimming down from last year, has a greater than 50 per cent probability of getting through since using shares available via Stock Connect allows fund managers to skirt issues about China’s tight capital controls — a major reason cited by stakeholders in the index provider’s decision to hold off.The Stock Connect works as a closed loop, meaning that international fund managers would buy mainland shares through the Hong Kong Exchange using Hong Kong dollars, and would cash out in the same currency.If A-shares make it through in June, the shares included would account for just under 0.5 per cent of the total index and would require about $10bn of investment. The initial flows are thought unlikely to move the market, particularly since inclusion by MSCI — to be decided in June — will only begin a year later.

BlackRock is laying off several stock pickers to increase its tilt towards index funds. These tend to outperform the active competition, partly because they are cheaper. But the case for a qualitative overlay on indices built with quantitative inputs received a boost from Hong Kong this week when the governance shortcomings of Huishan Dairy were revealed. Active managers, take note.On Tuesday the Chinese company, whose shares inexplicably plummeted 90 per cent (in just an hour) a few days before, confirmed it was in financial difficulty. The milk group also said most of its largest investor’s shares had been pledged for loans. Trading was halted days before the news came out.End investors will unwittingly hold the stock through tracker funds. Huishan is a constituent of the MSCI Asia Pacific index. Holders include BlackRock, Vanguard and Invesco, according to Bloomberg data. Worse, Huishan is also in the MSCI Emerging Markets ESG (environmental, social and governance) index. That looks odd, given the rumours circulating about executives. A March 2015 report from MSCI ESG Research highlighted aggressive accounting practices.MSCI is not the only index provider to have fallen foul of strange dealing. Hanergy Thin Film Power, whose stratospheric share price rise briefly made major shareholder Li Hejun China’s richest man, is a constituent of FTSE indices. Suspension since May 2015, after the stock halved in half an hour, means a similar clutch of tracker providers still hold untradeable shares. On Friday, Mr Li pledged 1.37bn of Hanergy shares to the company itself to guarantee $410m of receivables.Funds worth about $56bn, out of the $10tn tracking MSCI indices, disclose that they follow MSCI’s ESG indices — some of which appear to be flawed. Simply filtering for bad governance is clearly a way that active investors can add value in Hong Kong and elsewhere.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Index providers do the spade work in passive investing, which is growing in popularity worldwide. But index provision is a high-margin oligopoly where further consolidation would certainly attract regulatory scrutiny.Rumours of a combination between MSCI and S&P Global were swiftly quashed this week. Indices compiled by the two groups are used by two-fifths of the $3.4tn exchange traded funds globally at the end of 2016. S&P is heavily weighted towards developed markets — its S&P 500 index alone is the benchmark for $7.8tn of assets — while MSCI has heft in emerging markets. A combination would increase pricing power as it would leave only one major competitor, the FTSE/Russell indices owned by the London Stock Exchange.In order to advertise the performance of an ETF or fund as linked to one of their indices, asset managers must pay the providers a licence fee. This is often based on assets under management, so as assets grow so does the index provider’s revenue. Competition has so far limited the rent; revenues at MSCI have grown on average 5 per cent per year in the past half-decade, while ETF assets grew by 15 per cent annually in the same period. Managers do occasionally switch benchmarks. In 2012 Vanguard started using FTSE indices instead of MSCI’s in a cost reduction move. MSCI’s shares fell 27 per cent. But they are not the only customers. In 2013, S&P Global raised the fees the Chicago Board Options Exchange pays for exclusivity over listed S&P 500 options.S&P Global generated 4.7 times MSCI’s revenues in the past quarter, although its index business is only 12 per cent of sales; market intelligence and ratings account for the rest. Even so, it is unlikely that any combination would escape antitrust scrutiny — good news for passive investors.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
138;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-03-15T15:22:40Z;MSCI says report of offer from S&P ‘incorrect’;;MSCI said on Wednesday that a report that it had received a takeover offer from S&P Global that would have combined the two biggest global asset benchmark providers was “incorrect” and that it is currently “not in discussions with any third party”.The group’s statement came after the Evening Standard reported that MSCI had rejected an $11bn bid from rival S&P Global.“…we believe such reports are incorrect,” MSCI said. “We are not in discussions with any third party, and we have not received any offer or indication of interest.”A pact would have brought together the two biggest providers of global financial market indicators. Benchmarks have taken on increased significance in recent years amid the rapid rise in exchange-traded funds that passively track indices.S&P Global is perhaps best known for managing both the Dow Jones Industrial Average — among the oldest US equities gauges, and the S&P 500 index, a broader index that is closely followed by professional investors and is tracked by the largest ETFs.MSCI manages a suite of all-world indices that capture 99 per cent of investable global equities, among a slew of other barometers.
139;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2017-02-17T05:00:27Z;Emerging market ETFs and the jaws of death;Huge inflows have gone into the largest companies — but they are not good companies;It may seem a strange position for an active fund manager to adopt, but I am in favour of passive or index investment.The advantages of index investing are clear. Investors can invest in a widely diversified portfolio at minimal cost as management charges are low, as are the costs of dealing.The obvious drawback to index funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) is that they deprive investors of the opportunity to focus their investment only in good companies and/or shares which offer reasonable value or better. However, it seems that most active fund managers do not even attempt to invest only in good companies, or if they do they are not very good at identifying them. They seem to have similar problems in determining what is reasonable value.Many hold so many shares in their portfolio that it is bound to track the index. When combined with active management fees and dealing costs this means that they are certain to underperform the index. Hence my view that most investors would be better served by an index fund.But the growth in index funds and ETFs has significant side effects. In an index fund or ETF, the weighting of stocks is based on whatever criterion is used to compile the index, typically the market capitalisation of the companies. This means that as more money is invested via index funds or ETFs it is automatically routed via the fund into the companies in the relevant index based solely upon their market value.This can cause some major distortions, one of which we have almost certainly seen recently in emerging markets. Fund flows into emerging markets have increased significantly in the past couple of years as investors have sought to capitalise on a recovery. However, all of this inflow and more has gone into emerging markets ETFs, while money has actually been withdrawn from emerging markets active funds as this chart shows:It looks rather like the “jaws of death”, a term taken from shark attack movies and military encounters, such as the Charge of the Light Brigade.Increasing amounts of money are being allocated via this inflow into the largest companies in the emerging markets index, and they are not good companies. Last year, the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the top 10 constituent stocks of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index averaged just 12 per cent.What the ‘Nifty Fifty’ can tell us about bond proxiesInvestors should not write off ‘bond proxies’What I have learnt at Fundsmith in the past five yearsOf course, this is a single year and you might wonder whether it is representative. Looking back at the returns of the largest companies in the Index for the past 10 years or so shows a more or less continuous decline — particularly among the Chinese companies which seem to be investing on the basis that debt capital in particular for them is close to free. This is always a dangerous assumption, as the dotcom era and Japan in the late 1980s illustrated.Or maybe the shares which dominate the index are lowly rated, which more than compensates for their low returns? This does not seem to be the case given the current price/earnings ratio of 28 times for the top 10 largest constituents, versus 23 times for the MSCI Index, unless their earnings are about to undergo a sharp recovery. However, this seems unlikely for a mixture of internet and e-commerce stocks, electronics manufacturers, Chinese banks and mobile telecoms companies.Many active managers bemoan the rise of index funds and ETFs as they say it makes their job more difficult. In the short term, this is undoubtedly true. If money pours into markets via ETFs it will cause the shares of the largest companies in the index to perform well irrespective of their quality or value — or lack of it — even though active managers seeking quality and/or value will not want to own them. The weight of money flows will make it a self-fulfilling prophecy that the index will outperform the active managers who behave in this rational manner.This can be very frustrating, but an active fund manager should regard this as an opportunity to own more of the shares which are better than the index average and will eventually produce superior returns — providing the manager and the investors have the patience necessary to wait for this to occur. The irony is that active management has value for investors as a means of exploiting market inefficiencies, such as those caused by the rise of ETFs in emerging markets, but those events make it harder for managers and investors to follow the active path.Terry Smith is chief executive of Fundsmith LLP
140;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;China onshore bonds included in new fixed income benchmark;;Bloomberg has gone where MSCI feared to tread, becoming only the second major index provider to include China’s onshore markets in widely-followed benchmark indices in a move that could lead rivals to follow suit.China is home to the second-largest stock market and the third-largest bond markets in the world, but its tight control of onshore activity has made including it in flagship indices contentious, with many investors arguing it must relax its grip before they can comfortably invest, writes Jennifer Hughes in Hong Kong.On Wednesday Bloomberg said its Bloomberg Barclays bond indices would create a parallel index that incorporated onshore Chinese government bonds and some bank debt into its flagship global aggregate index, while also maintaining its current, renminbi-free global benchmark.The move will allow investors a choice of which to follow without forcing them to allocate funds onshore in China.“This is a hugely positive step in our view,” said Becky Liu, macro China strategist at Standard Chartered. “This move will likely invite an increase of foreign participation in China’s onshore bond market in 2017, especially with the Chinese government already hinting to resolve a number of key issues this year.”Bloomberg is the first index provider to include bonds in its global offerings but its move mirrors a similar decision by FTSE almost two years ago to include onshore equities in its flagship emerging markets index. Like Bloomberg, FTSE runs that index in parallel to its existing benchmark as part of what it termed “transition indices.”
141;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-12-11T05:17:47Z;China craves place at top table of emerging markets index;Inclusion in index would boost country’s ability to attract foreign investment;"Days before the world’s largest index provider, MSCI, blocked China from joining its emerging market index for the third year in a row, a senior official at the country’s regulatory commission asserted that inclusion in the important benchmark was a “historical certainty”.“It will happen eventually,” Qi Bin told a conference in Shanghai’s financial district. “You don’t want to wait too long.”The rejection by MSCI a few days later was an embarrassing blow to Beijing, which has attempted to win a place on the index by reforming its capital markets.Much is at stake: inclusion would boost China’s ability to attract foreign investment as it struggles with slowing growth. $1.5tn of assets track MSCI’s emerging markets index and membership of it boosts a country’s legitimacy to investors around the world. Repeated denial by some of the largest index providers — China has also been locked out of the main emerging markets indices by S&P and FTSE Russell — has restricted the amount of foreign investment flowing into the country of 1.4bn people.The question now for Mr Qi and reformers in Beijing is when — if ever — will the world’s second-largest economy win a place on such benchmarks, helping propel it to its next stage of liberalisation.“It is a certainty that China will be added,” says Danny Dolan, managing director at China Post Global, the international asset management arm of the domestic investment house China Post Fund.The group is betting that international investment into China will rise after inclusion. It is planning to launch two smart beta exchange traded funds early next year. “[Inclusion] is likely to happen in 2017,” says Mr Dolan. “There is a huge incentive for MSCI to add China to their indices. From a performance point of view these indices are suffering due to the exclusion of China. It’s a huge growth engine.”China accounts for 13 per cent of the world’s GDP and its local A-shares equity market represents a tenth of global market capitalisation, according to Credit Suisse. The Swiss financial services company has launched an onshore brokerage business in China in anticipation of the new capital flows.However, three features of the Chinese market worry index providers: restrictions on the amount of capital that foreign investors can take out of the country; requirements that any new products linked to A-shares are approved by Beijing; and the potential for share suspensions similar to those that roiled the country’s stock market last summer. Restrictions on outflows are the most problematic of the three, according to index providers. “If a fund manager has to meet redemptions and there’s hard limits on the amount of currency that can be repatriated then that poses a problem,” says Michael Orzano, director of global equity indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of the FTSE Russell, adds that quotas for inflows awarded under programmes that open Chinese markets up to foreign investors favour larger asset managers. “Only if you’re a big fund can you get a quota and then you can buy quite easily but you still can’t sell as easily,” he says.“We’re looking for those restrictions to be removed. We can estimate [when that will happen] but we don’t know until those restrictions are removed. That’s the major hurdle.”Active investors are more optimistic. They argue that Shenzhen Connect, a programme launched this month to link the country’s large technology-focused Shenzhen Stock Exchange with Hong Kong, will drive the case for inclusion by encouraging more foreign investment.“MSCI is sending mixed signals [by not including China in its index], however it is worth noting the improvements made since [MSCI’s] last review,” says Karine Hirn, partner at East Capital, an emerging market-focused asset manager.Ms Hirn believes that Shenzhen Connect will build on other reforms, including an increase in overall foreign investment quotas, the relaxing of quota rules for both Shenzhen Connect and Shanghai Connect — which also links with Hong Kong — and greater restrictions on share suspensions. This will make the situation in China more favourable, she argues. “This is going in the right direction, the question is not whether it will be included, it is only when it will be included.”Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, says that the Shenzhen stock market tie-up will introduce foreign investors to the high returns available in China’s market. “The Connect means that people can buy and sell more easily and as they slowly open up they’ll see relative performance [improve],” he says.Mr Crabb points to the gradual inclusion of South Korea and Taiwan in global equity benchmarks as an example of how initial inflows generate investor confidence.Index providers, however, point out that Shenzhen Connect still does not cover the entire A-shares market. “The Shenzhen-Hong Kong link will improve things but there is a limited amount of stocks that it includes,” Mr Makepeace says.MSCI declined to comment."
142;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-12-11T05:17:44Z;Market leaders face pressure from smaller indexers;Smaller indexers are challenging the biggest players on cost;The rapidly growing exchange traded fund market has caused significant upheaval among traditional asset managers, but now the biggest index providers are facing disruptive forces of their own.Global ETF assets have risen more than fourfold since the end of 2008 to reach $3.4tn, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. This has generated unprecedented profits for index providers, particularly the four leading players: S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI, FTSE Russell and Bloomberg.“A handful of providers control the vast majority of the indexing market and they are using their power to dramatically increase fees,” says Joe Mansueto, chief executive of data provider Morningstar.Profit margins for MSCI’s indexing business this year are forecast to reach 70 per cent, generating underlying earnings of $428m, a rise of 8.8 per cent on 2015, according to Morgan Stanley.Almost two-thirds of the ETF industry’s assets track benchmarks provided by the four largest index providers. However, smaller rivals are intensifying their efforts to win a larger share of this highly profitable market.Morningstar last month announced that it would offer more than 100 global equity indices to users for free. The initiative has tempted 25 investment managers including Eaton Vance, Dodge and Cox, and Guggenheim Investments.“Many of our clients have voiced their concern that index licensing costs have risen in recent years. They feel these increases are difficult to justify and are questioning what improvement in value they receive,” says Sanjay Arya, head of Morningstar Indexes.He adds that traditional benchmarks weighted by market capitalisation are not based on any proprietary methodology and can be easily and cheaply replicated.However, the leading index providers have largely avoided becoming involved in aggressive price competition, even though ETF managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard are fighting a cut-throat price war to attract investors.Fund managers are generally reluctant to change benchmarks as it can be viewed as a red flag to investorsSolactive, a Frankfurt-based company set up in 2007, is also attempting to disrupt the indexing market. It charges a flat fee for its indices, in contrast to the larger players that base their charges on assets under management tied to their benchmarks.Steffen Scheuble, Solactive’s chief executive, says there is “a disconnect” in pricing between fund managers and mainstream index providers. “There are perhaps only 20 global benchmarks where the brand name can add value. So we are starting to see more fund managers [changing] benchmarks,” he says.The most notable example to date is Vanguard’s decision in 2012 to drop MSCI in favour of CRSP indices as the benchmarks for some of its domestic index funds. But Toni Kaplan, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says Vanguard’s switch was “an exception”.“Fund managers are generally reluctant to change benchmarks as this raises questions about whether they are trying to flatter their performance and so it can be viewed as a red flag by investors,” she says.Mr Arya says inertia among fund managers remains a problem but there is “perceptible change” under way. “We are moving to a new reality as to what index licensing costs should be,” he says.Manooj Mistry, head of passive asset management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Deutsche Asset Management, says that the importance of index branding varies between asset classes and different markets. Although well known equity market indices such as the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 are widely used, the choice in fixed income tends to be more of an open field.Fund managers using fixed income indices tend to focus more on the quality of pricing data, as the majority of bond trading is done through over-the-counter private bilateral trades, says Mr Mistry.“The timing of when bond prices are captured is vitally important as this matters for determining a fund’s net asset value, its tracking error and also for pricing in the creation and redemption of ETF units. These pricing differences are less pronounced in equity markets where the majority of trading is done on an exchange,” he says.Bloomberg, which last year agreed to buy Barclays’ indexing business, plans to offer clients the ability to create and back-test their own custom-built indexing strategies.Some asset managers, such as WisdomTree, already use proprietary built indices to construct ETFs. Nizam Hamid, head of ETF strategy at WisdomTree in Europe, says this is not done solely to save costs.“Using our own indices allows us to create unique products and helps us to differentiate our strategies from other ETF providers,” he says.In two of the industry’s best selling ETFs last year, WisdomTree used in-house indices that provide exposure to dividend-paying European and Japanese exporting companies while also protecting against currency fluctuations.Mr Scheuble says he expects to see many more niche ETFs launched as the cost of building new products will continue to fall.“But there are no established branded indices for these niche strategies. So we will see fund managers moving to index providers that offer a lower fee model,” he says.
143;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-11-18T01:07:37Z;Hopes dim for China A-shares entering global markets;MSCI says ‘major obstacles’ stand in way of inclusion in benchmark EM index;China’s domestic stock markets look set to be denied entry into international benchmarks for the fourth year in a row next year unless Chinese regulators remove “major obstacles” before June.Dimitris Melas, head of equity research at MSCI, provider of the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets index, gave a downbeat assessment on Thursday of the prospects for China’s A-shares to be included in the index next year in spite of the imminent opening of the Shenzhen stock market to international investors.“Clients have recognised that a lot of the obstacles [to A-share inclusion] are being removed, so there is progress,” said Mr Melas. “Having said that, clients also recognise that there are still some major obstacles.”The inclusion of an initial proposed 5 per cent of A-shares into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index would be seen as a pivotal moment in China’s gradual opening to flows of global capital. Accession to the benchmark, which includes 833 stocks from 23 emerging markets, would oblige fund managers who track the index to invest in Chinese A-shares, triggering huge inflows of capital to China.Optimism over the potential inclusion of A-shares has grown in recent weeks as China prepares for the launch of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect, which may open as early as next week. The stock connect, together with an existing trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai, will be the only direct route available for foreign investors to trade mainland stocks without prior approval from Beijing.The scheme eases accessibility for foreign investors to China’s domestic markets — one of the key sticking points that has prevented MSCI from granting A-share inclusion. “This is quite important because it gives, through stock connect, the possibility for foreign investors to access the opportunities on the two main exchanges,” Mr Melas said.However, he also gave a list of impediments that combine to create the “major obstacles” to A-share accession to MSCI next year. One problem is that foreign investors who sell domestic Chinese shares can repatriate only 20 per cent of their holdings a month, meaning it would take them a full five months to trade out of China’s domestic markets.20%Maximum proportion of Chinese holdings a foreign investor can sell in a month — one of the obstacles to MSCI inclusionA further issue is a “preapproval” requirement that the Chinese exchanges impose on the launch of financial products, meaning that if, for example, a foreign financial institution wanted to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF), it would have to win prior regulatory approval.“This is unusual, it is unique in emerging markets and in developed markets in fact,” Mr Melas said.In addition, moves by the Chinese authorities last year to rescue plummeting stock prices by suspending hundreds of shares created real problems for foreign fund managers. Many of these stocks remain suspended, Mr Melas said.“Investors gave us feedback that they need to see suspensions coming down even more,” he said.
144;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-11-13T05:04:54Z;MSCI takes aim at corporate tax avoidance;Use of aggressive tax planning will reduce companies’ ratings in ESG index;The world’s most widely used sustainable investment benchmarks will begin penalising companies that use aggressive tax avoidance policies after MSCI, the index provider, said it will change its governance ratings from the start of 2017.The US-based company, which produces environmental, social and governance indices against which $67bn of assets are benchmarked, told FTfm it has heightened its focus on companies’ tax arrangements because the public mood has shifted against businesses that seek to minimise their tax bills.From January, MSCI will significantly reduce the ESG ratings of companies that are embroiled in legal battles over tax issues, pay effective rates of tax that are much lower than their predicted rates based on revenues, or those with opaque tax structures.This would affect the companies’ weighting in the index provider’s sustainable investment benchmarks, lowering the amount of money they can raise from shareholders that use the indices.Linda-Eling Lee, head of ESG research at MSCI, said investors are already asking to preview the scores before they are officially rolled out. “[Tax] is a growing concern in terms of one of the intangible risks investors are facing.“There will be pressure as well as policy moves against companies taking advantage of tax management, and investors don’t want to be taken by surprise,” she said.She said the average “tax gap” — the difference between the estimated tax paid by a company and the estimated tax they should pay according to corporate tax rates in the countries where they generate revenues — is 8 per cent for the world’s 10 largest companies.Companies in the technology and healthcare sectors are most likely to be hurt by the new ratings system, according to MSCI.Asset managers that use the ratings said the change would be helpful for their investment process. Meryam Omi, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Legal & General Investment Management, the UK’s largest fund house, said: “The current level of [tax] disclosure for most companies is simply too poor, putting a few leading companies at an unfair advantage.“Investors face unforeseen risks from companies that do not disclose adequate tax policy and practices, which may disguise the value of genuine economic activity versus short-term tax planning.”Royal London Asset Management added it was “very pleased” with the development, as it would encourage investors to focus on effective tax rates before making investment decisions.This summer an unprecedented ruling from the European Commission that the Irish government should claw back €13bn in taxes from Apple, the technology comapny, intensified concerns among investors about the reputational risks associated with aggressive tax management.Four investment companies representing almost £1tn of assets wrote to the board of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to raise concerns about its tax arrangements.The letter from LGIM, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, which represents 71 public pension funds, Royal London Asset Management and Sarasin Partners, the investment boutique, prompted other investors to follow suit.Nordea Asset Management, the €300bn Nordic fund house, also wrote to companies including Apple and Alphabet, asking them to lay out their tax risks by January or risk shareholder protests.The PRI, the responsible investment group backed by the UN, said the scores from MSCI could help counter the under-reporting of reputational risks by companies that move profits to minimise tax.“Investors would appreciate more scrutiny by ESG research service providers,” said Valeria Piani, the group’s head of ESG engagements.

146;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-09-01T13:43:22Z;Unreliable data hinder carbon divestment;Investors have to rely on misleading models when they try to reduce their portfolios’ fossil fuel exposure;Investors’ efforts to fight climate change by reducing their exposure to carbon emissions are being undermined by the widespread use of unreliable data about fossil fuel pollution.Institutional investors are under pressure to protect their portfolios from the risks of climate change after a deal struck in Paris last December committed governments around the world to reducing global warming.Only a limited number of companies disclose carbon emissions data at the moment. As a result, investors have to rely on estimated data to assess which companies pollute the most with fossil fuels and which have low carbon emissions. But these estimates are often inaccurate and misleading, according to MSCI.The analytics and indices provider looked at data from 277 companies that reported carbon emissions for the first time in 2015. MSCI compared these figures with previous estimates from the same companies, which were calculated using models.It found that three-quarters of the modelled estimates “significantly overstated” carbon emissions by 50 per cent or more when compared with the more recent data reported by the companies.The discrepancy is partly explained by technological advancements that have helped companies to reduce emissions and which have not been captured by current carbon estimation models.“Institutional investors may actually be overstating the carbon output of their portfolios. Estimated values based on the outdated data are more likely to inflate the carbon footprint of a portfolio,” said Manish Shakdwipee, an analyst with MSCI.Unreliable or outdated models could “lead investors astray” if used to inform decisions on which companies to avoid in an attempt to reduce carbon emission exposures, he said.Louise Dudley, a global equities portfolio manager at Hermes, the investment manager, in London, said the absence of a standard methodology for calculating carbon emissions was problematic.“It seems as if it should be straightforward, but calculating carbon footprints is complex. Some of the existing models do not take into account where specific operations are located and whether governments in those countries already have carbon-pricing programmes in place,” she said.She added that emissions reporting by companies was “still at an early stage”.Investors are likely to remain reliant on carbon emissions models for the foreseeable future. Only a fifth of the 8,271 companies in MSCI’s benchmark global equity index reported carbon emissions data over the past two years.Asha Mehta, head of environmental, social and governance issues at Acadian, the $70bn Boston-based asset manager, said data limitations were a fundamental issue for investors that wanted to manage carbon risks.“A company with high emissions today could look very different in a year’s time if it has an aggressive reduction strategy. The opposite can also be true if an oil exploration company starts to ramp up production. Identifying current emissions is just the first step in dealing with carbon risks in a portfolio,” she said.
147;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Real estate gets its own sector — a cheat sheet;;Happy almost birthday!Real estate is finally being emancipated from the financial sector as MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices are reclassifying real-estate investment trusts (Reits) —which, deliver any additional income to shareholders within a tax-efficient structure — and real estate management and development companies as a standalone sector.Here’s how this is going to play out and why it is important.What is the reclassification and when is it taking place?Index providers, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices, teamed up in 1999 to create what is now known as the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) a 4-tiered system comprised of 10 sectors, 24 industry groups, 67 industries and 156 sub-industries. But as real estate has grown in importance in global equity markets both decided it was time to create an eleventh sector for real estate — the first change at the sector level for GICS since its inception.GICS direct, a joint classification system of MSCI and S&P, will reclassify REITs on Wednesday. Effective September 1, funds that track GICS direct will see 11 sectors. Indexes like the MSCI US Reit index and the MSCI Core real estate index, which already exclude mortgage Reits will not be impacted by the change.The biggest index to be impacted by this change is the MSCI ACWI financials index which will have 426 constituents after the update, compared with 574 before.Meanwhile, S&P Dow Jones Indices will implement the change next month. S&P makes major index changes on the third Friday of the last month of the quarter, in this case September 16, because this is the date when index futures and options expire.Victor Lin at Credit Suisse has previously estimated that there could be $4bn in selling in real estate groups combined — with $1bn leaving on Wednesday and $3bn leaving in September — as a result of the reclassification.What companies will be involved?The new sector will contain Reits and real estate management and development companies. Mortgage Reits will however remain in the financials sector reflecting their status as a financial security rather than a real estate security.“The creation of 11th sector will carve Reits out of the current financial sector with the exception of mortgage Reits,” Craig Feldman, head of Americas index management research, said. “That’s because of a higher correlation to financial industry and because they are less in line with what the new sector is creating and the constituency of it.”Why should investors care?The launch of an eleventh sector elevates Reits to their own distinct asset class instead of being perceived as an alternative. And in a low interest rate environment real estate shares, with their consistent cash flows and high dividend yields have proven very attractive.“It looks like a bond that has a growth component to it and that is valuable in a low rate, low growth environment,” Mike Magiera, managing director of equity income at Manning & Napier, said. “Income is very difficult to come by and Reits still look attractive.”Funds that track these sectors may need to rejig their exposure as the reclassification could see a drop in the yields offered by the financial sector. Moreover, the new sector will have the additional benefit increased stability once it is removed from the more volatile financial sector.What will impact the performance of this new sector?While the financial sector was often approached as an interest rate play, investors will realise that monetary policy is a much smaller factor for the new real estate sector. Instead, Mr Magiera said the sector will be more susceptible to the real estate cycle and things like rental rates, occupancy, and inventory.Will the sector see new money?The standalone sector is expected to attract new money, especially among small and mid-cap equity funds, according to Mr Magiera.
148;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-08-24T10:20:02Z;Emerging market rally takes a breather;;The emerging market rally is finally taking a breather, with equities set for their first drop in seven weeks, currencies slipping and bond yields edging up.Concerns that the Federal Reserve may take a more hawkish stance at the Jackson Hole symposium this week have helped put the brakes on this year’s prolific emerging market rally, writes Joel Lewin.Renewed political risk in South Africa, which has whacked the rand, as well as S&P’s revision of the outlook for Mexico have also knocked sentiment. A 4.2 per cent drop in oil since Friday’s high has not helped much either.The MSCI emerging market equity index has dropped 1.1 per cent since Thursday. It’s still up a hefty 14 per cent year to date, but is on track for its first decline in seven weeks.“We suspect that, after a prolonged period of unusual calm during the summer, EM equities will become more volatile in the weeks ahead,” says David Rees at Capital Economics.He adds:Tighter US monetary policy looks set to be a drag on EM equities. We still expect the Fed to raise rates by much more than investors generally anticipate in the next couple of years, and for the yield of 10-year US Treasury bonds to rise by about 150bp. The latter would be similar to the spike in Treasury yields that sent EM markets into a tailspin in 1994.Gulp.JPMorgan’s emerging market currencies index is down 1.4 per cent since Wednesday and is set for its first drop in five weeks.In the last five days, against the dollar the rand is off 4.8 per cent, the Mexican peso has slipped 1.9 per cent, the rouble is down 1.6 per cent while the lira has skidded 1 per cent.Citi strategists note:Although the weakness in EM currencies was exaggerated by a surge in political concerns in South Africa and an unexpected S&P outlook revision for Mexico, the move also reflects investors’ readiness to trim their now-overweight exposure to EM ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium later this week.We believe that fears that the Fed may signal a more hawkish stance at Jackson Hole will prove unfounded, which should in turn allow EM duration and currencies room to renew modest rallies. However, the extent of positioning shifts in favour of EM in recent weeks makes a period of consolidation likely, and keeps us reluctant to add exposure to EM at this time.The shift in sentiment has also been reflected in a rise in emerging market bond yields. Sovereign yields have edged up 4 basis points to 4.41 per cent since hitting a record low last week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices.But nonetheless, they are still down more than 40bps year to date, and many analysts are convinced the recent weakness in emerging market bonds, equities and currencies is nothing more than a brief blip.“Over the past few years, emerging markets (EM) have been quietly undergoing positive, fundamental change that we think will likely increase value in the asset class,” says Joachim Fels, a global economic advisor at Pimco.He says the rally “has legs to run”, explaining:EM looks increasingly attractive, especially compared to many advanced economies and marketsThere is an encouraging trend toward more structural reforms and less populist policies in a number of EM countries at a time when populism is on the rise in many advanced economies. Argentina and Brazil have recently seen changes in government that promise more market-oriented reforms. And India made a big step towards a landmark tax reform in early August. Better policies and governance are an important precondition for lowering the risk premium on EM assets. Progress on structural reform is highly significant.And in terms of the monetary policy outlook and valuations, he says emerging markets trump their developed market peers:While the worry in developed markets (DM) is monetary policy exhaustion, most EM central banks have ample room to ease if needed as inflation is either below target or, where it is not, has peaked and is on its way down.Most risky DM assets are expensive, and investors have to come to grips with “lower-for-longer” DM rates. This, together with better EM fundamentals underway, suggests to me that the EM rally that started earlier this year has legs to run.Mr Rees at Capital Economics is also convinced that “most EMs are now less vulnerable to external shocks.”He says “any sign of stress in global markets would probably cause the Fed to pause again” while:Other major central banks look set to remain in loosening mode. Further increases in commodity prices should offer support to equities in those countries that produce them, and valuations of EM equities do at least remain much lower than those in developed markets.(Chart: Bloomberg.)Related:If you followed the herd, you likely missed the EM rallyBlackRock turns bullish on EM stocks
149;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-08-23T13:04:50Z;If you followed the herd, you likely missed the EM rally;;Emerging market equities have roared higher this year, far outperforming their developed market peers – something investors would have missed if they heeded the consensus of investment bank analysts and fund managers.Analyst recommendations on EM stocks are “still relatively bearish and far from the bullish levels seen in 2011″, according to research from HSBC that analysed sell-side calls on the more than 800 members of the MSCI emerging markets index.Similarly, funds that have a mandate to invest in stocks globally remain underweight EM. Of 127 funds with $181bn under management surveyed by HSBC, only a quarter are currently overweight EM.“In fact, most of the larger funds [by assets under management] are still underweight,” HSBC notes.The lack of excitement over EM stocks contrasts with the strong performance this year. The MSCI emerging markets index has rallied 13.9 per cent, far outpacing the 4.2 per cent advance notched up by the MSCI world index, which tracks developed-market stocks.Large asset managers have certainly taken notice, with BlackRock, which oversees some $4.6tn, on Monday upgrading its rating on EM stocks to “overweight” from “neutral”.HSBC, for its part, also reckons the rally has “further to run”. Both groups cited what they see as inexpensive valuations, especially compared with developed markets where some analysts have warned that prices have run far ahead of companies’ earnings potential.
150;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BlackRock turns bullish on emerging market stocks;;Dimmer expectations for Federal Reserve rate rises has eased the risk of a sharp increase in the US dollar, making emerging market assets “relatively attractive”, BlackRock said on Monday as it upgraded its view on EM stocks to “overweight” from “neutral”.EM stocks have made a powerful rebound after a steep sell-off that began late last year and stretched to late January, with the MSCI emerging markets index having surged by almost a third since then.A far more subdued outlook on Fed rate increases that in turn has pressured the dollar, along with a rise in the price of crude oil, has helped to boost the appeal of the asset class. The “lower-for-longer” rate outlook also “expands the scope” for EM interest rate cuts, according to Richard Turnill, the asset manager’s global chief investment strategist.The rise has come as global developed market sovereign bond yields have plumbed new lows, enticing investors embark on a riskier hunt for yield.“Investors have been warming up to emerging markets since February, and their risk appetite appears to be broadening,” said Mr Turnill. “Even offshore Chinese equities — a performance laggard this year — have started to catch up despite weaker economic data from China in July.”In fact, EM exchange traded and mutual funds have garnered $26bn in inflows since February, according to BlackRock’s analysis of EPFR data. And the world’s biggest asset manager sees “room for further inflows”.EM stocks are also inexpensive on a valuation basis, trading at a 24 per cent discount to their developed-market peers. And “fundamentals could further improve, we believe,” Mr Turnill said, “as EM companies focus on controlling expenses and targeting profits over market share gains”.

The largest ETF inflows were also into emerging market funds, with the BlackRock iShares MSCI emerging markets ETF taking in $1.28bn, the most of any.Emerging market equities have climbed to their highest level since July 2015, with the MSCI EM index up 15.4 per cent so far this year. EM bonds and currencies are also performing strongly, as investors seek higher returns against the backdrop of some $13.4tn of developed world global bonds yielding less than zero.Flow data also show that both European and US government bond funds experienced outflows this week.Overall, global-tracked equity funds extended their recent intake of new money, absorbing $5.4bn, while bond funds raised $8.7bn of new cash, according to data from EPFR.“As the weeks have gone by it seems like people are settling in to the fact that we are in a very accommodative market from a monetary policy perspective and rates are not going to rise too fast,” said KC Nelson, a portfolio manager at Driehaus Capital Management.Expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on the policy sidelines have weighed on the US dollar and bolstered oil prices. Brent crude, the international benchmark, and its US counterpart WTI moved into bull market territory on Thursday, having risen more than 20 per cent from their recent low on talk of a possible production freeze.Junk bonds should benefit from the rise in oil prices, and US high-yield funds recorded an inflow of $888.9m, according to data from Lipper, down from $1.65bn last week. ETFs accounted for 41 per cent of the total compared with 76 per cent of last week’s inflow.Mr Nelson said higher risk appetite could also be coming from hedge funds seeking to make up ground after a poor start to the year.Hedge Fund Research’s asset-weighted index of equity-focused hedge funds has declined 1.1 per cent this year through the end of July, while an index of credit relative-value strategies has returned 1.5 per cent.I continue to think that the volatility story for now and probably through to the end of the year is going to be containedThat looks all the worse against a backdrop of a 7 per cent return for the S&P 500.“The lag in performance this year could cause a bit of extra volatility going into year end as some folks try to catch up,” said Mr Nelson. “I do not think it is the most prudent thing to do.”European equity and bond funds continue to buck the trend, suffering from uncertainty after the UK’s Brexit vote, widespread negative interest rates and Italy’s upcoming constitutional referendum.

This week, regulators gave the go-ahead for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect. The scheme, which mirrors one set up for Shanghai in late 2014, will allow overseas investors to buy A shares listed on China’s Shenzhen exchange. Both systems also permit mainland-based investors to buy shares listed in Hong Kong. After the announcement the indices remained flat, but the scheme is still significant.Shenzhen Connect will add 880 stocks to the list of nearly 600 available in Shanghai, giving access to three-quarters of the mainland-listed universe. The quality is even more noteworthy. Shanghai’s exchange has a far higher presence of stodgy state-owned enterprises; less than one-third of the index consists of privately established companies. Three-quarters of Shenzhen’s index, by contrast, comprises non-SOEs. Many of these are in higher growth “new economy” sectors, such as healthcare and technology, giving overseas investors more ways to express their views on China’s economy.Foreign investors will also become more familiar with China’s retail investors. Goldman Sachs notes that nearly two-thirds of the index by market capitalisation is owned by individuals, compared with one-third of Shanghai. The high retail participation shows in lofty valuations, as well as high turnover relative to the market’s size.Market strategists believe that the broader access to China A shares granted by Shenzhen Connect makes their inclusion in MSCI regional indices more likely. Perhaps, but work still needs to be done. Foreign investor concerns about voluntary stock suspensions by Chinese companies, as well as the exchanges’ self-appointed right to veto index products that reference A shares — irrespective of where they are listed — are yet to be assuaged.The likelihood is they will be. With the scrapping of limits on the amount of funds allowed to invest both ways, the scheme sends a more important message. China’s commitment to opening its markets even trumps concerns about a flood of money heading south.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

154;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-08-15T15:48:58Z;Emerging market rally gathers pace;;"The emerging market rally ploughs on and on and on. And on.Emerging market stocks and currencies have soared to 12-month highs, while bond yields have dived even deeper, breaking fresh record lows as bouncing oil prices offer yet another reason for investor optimism.Emerging market assets had shaken off weakness in oil over the last few months, rising even as crude slipped into a bear market. Now that Brent has bounced, the rally has intensified, writes Joel Lewin.The JPMorgan emerging market currencies index has surged 10.5 per cent from its January low to a 12-month high.Today the emerging market currency rally is powering on apace, with the Thai baht jumping 0.5 per cent against the dollar to a 13-month high, while the South African rand climbs 1.6 per cent, the Malaysian ringgit gains 0.5 per cent and the rouble is up 1.2 per cent.Over the past six weeks a record $18bn has flooded into emerging market debt funds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch and EPFR.BAML describes this as the “big inflection point in EM debt flows”, a run that marks a decisive turning point from the three year period from early 2013 to early 2016 during which more than $100bn poured out of the asset class, halving its holdings.Crucially, BAML says this is “now mutating into an EM equity flow inflection point”. EM equity funds lured $1.3bn last week, the sixth straight weekly inflow.The MSCI emerging markets equity index has leapt 32.2 per cent from its January low to a 13-month high.“Positions are clearly building, but after five years of poor performance, we think it will take longer for the market to become significantly [overweight]. We remain happily and significantly overweight the broad EM asset class,” say JPMorgan strategists.A whole slew of factors have come together to throw fuel on the emerging market rally.The US economy has been strong enough to prompt optimism, but weak enough to stave off a Federal Reserve rate rise, dampening the dollar, lifting emerging market currencies, keeping a lid on rates and buoying sentiment towards the asset class.JPMorgan notes:Forecasts for firmer EM currencies reflect the ongoing support that low US interest rates lend to the high-yielders and countries with large current account surplusesAnd Wike Groenenberg at BNP Paribas adds:Even if the US does hike rates, US 10y yields are likely to stay low as the Fed signals that the upward trajectory in rates will be modest, and the term premium will also stay low; we remain positive on high-yieldersMeanwhile a wave of rate cuts and bond buying in developed markets has hammered developed market yields, driving cash towards higher-yielding emerging market debt.JPMorgan strategists again:The EM world, whether in bonds, currencies, or high dividend stocks, is still offering around 6% and can thus not be ignored if you need income.Emerging market government bond yields have plunged 45 basis points so far this year to a new record low of 4.38 per cent, according to BAML indices.JPMorgan says there’s more good times to come:We see the constructive environment for EM bonds continuing, as the EM PMI has moved up to 50 for the first time since Feb 2015, with Latam and EMEA EM likely driving a rise in EM GDP growth over 2H16. In addition, we expect additional central bank stimulus, primarily from EM Asian countries, to be supportive for local market. We also see the ultra-low DM yield environment encouraging investors to move to higher yielding EM bonds"
155;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-07-18T09:28:18Z;Sweden’s AP4 pension fund avoids fossil fuels in landmark move;Swedish pension fund AP4 makes biggest low carbon commitment of any institution to date;One of Sweden’s largest pension funds has made the biggest single commitment to low carbon investing by an institutional investor, to help fight global warming.The Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund, known as AP4, will invest $3.2bn in passive investment funds designed by MSCI, which will track low carbon benchmarks. The SKr299bn ($35bn) pension scheme intends to “decarbonise” its $14.7bn global equity portfolio by 2020. That means it will drastically cut exposure to companies that pollute with fossil fuels and increase allocations to those with low carbon emissions.The move comes on the back of growing pressure on institutional investors to protect their portfolios from the risks of global warming and climate change. It also comes just months after a landmark agreement was struck in Paris on climate change, in which governments around the world committed to tackling global warming.Mats Andersson, the chief executive of AP4, who has just stepped down from the fund after 10 years, said: “We hope this initiative will help take low carbon investing further into the mainstream.”Last month the University of Cambridge blacklisted investments in coal and tar sands companies after pressure from students and academics to shun highly polluting fossil fuels. The UK’s richest educational institution, which has an endowment of £5.9bn, followed the lead of rivals Oxford and Yale to exclude coal and tar sands investments.Jillian Reid, a principal in the responsible investment team at Mercer, the pension fund consultancy, said that although only a minority of investors were incorporating climate risks assessments into their investment processes, AP4’s push laid down a significant marker. “This initiative by AP4 is indicative of the transition that is taking place,” she said.The expectation is that efforts to reduce global temperatures will result in some fossil fuel companies becoming “stranded”, where large writedowns or devaluations make assets worthless.Pia Axelsson, a spokesperson for AP4, said greenhouse gases thatcause global warming would be priced differently in the future. “Companies with lower emissions than their competitors will enjoy a financial advantage and deliver better performance,” she said.Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, last year warned that investors faced “potentially huge” losses from stranded coal, oil and gas assets.All five of Sweden’s public pension funds have measured and reported the carbon footprint of their investments since 2014. The five schemes are pressing for the establishment of standardised global measures of climate risk within asset portfolios.Last month, PKA, Denmark’s fourth-largest pension fund, with €35.5bn in assets, asked 53 companies that generate between 25 and 50 per cent of their revenues from coal to provide plans on how they will reduce their exposure to the fossil fuel.Pelle Pedersen, responsible investment analyst at PKA, told FTfm that the pension fund will pull money from businesses that lack plans or provide inadequate proposals “for the shift to a low-carbon future”.PKA divested itself of 31 coal-only companies last year, including Whitehaven Coal in Australia, Indonesia’s Bumi Resources and Peabody Energy, the US coal miner that filed for bankruptcy protection in April.Exchange traded funds that track MSCI low carbon indices have accumulated assets of around $500m from investors including the UK Environment Agency pension fund, the UN Joint Staff pension fund and the University of Maryland.Deborah Yang, a managing director with MSCI, said: “We have seen much more interest in low carbon investing following on from the climate change conference in Paris in December. Investors are now drilling into their portfolios to better understand how a company’s revenues derive from fossil fuels and whether some of their earnings are linked to activities designed to mitigate climate change.”The Asset Owners Disclosure Project, a non-profit organisation, has found almost half of the world’s largest investors are ignoring climate risks in their investment decisions.Ben Caldecott, director of the sustainable finance programme at the University of Oxford, said: “The vast majority of asset owners do not take account of long-term risks, such as climate change, despite having liabilities many decades into the future.”
156;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-30T01:03:30Z;Wider access to China’s markets ‘not a matter of if but when’;Decision by MSCI not to list A-shares is a minor setback;Index provider MSCI’s decision this month not to include mainland Chinese A-shares in its global indices was widely unexpected by analysts. Yet investors largely consider greater access to China merely a matter of time given the country’s growing economic clout and the size of its market.“It’s not a matter of if but when,” says Mark Valadao, head of portfolio strategists for Asia ex-Japan at State Street Global Advisors. “Despite MSCI’s decision, China A-shares should still be on the table as an opportunity set as global investors prepare for its inevitable inclusion into MSCI.”MSCI said the reasons behind its decision were chiefly technical, including a wariness over Chinese capital controls.Foreigners hold less than 2 per cent of China’s onshore stock markets and roughly the same percentage of its giant interbank bond markets. In recent years, tracking the opening up of China’s capital markets has become as turbulent as investing in its sentiment-driven stocks.Investors have benefited from launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, linking the two stock exchanges, and the widening this year of access to mainland bond markets — already collectively the third largest in the world.Yet watchers have also contended with a brutal market crash last year, which informed MSCI’s third decision in as many years to hold off including mainland stocks in its indices.“The decision by MSCI to delay . . . is, naturally, mildly disappointing for us and for other investors in the Chinese stock market,” says Anthony Cragg, senior portfolio manager of Wells Fargo’s China Equity Fund.The key theme of MSCI’s diplomatically phrased reservations nonetheless sent a clear message to Beijing: prove you will do what you say you will.This applied not only to reforms, announced in May, to limit companies’ ability to suspend their shares at will, but also to investors’ reports that a smoother approvals process to get money into China, announced in February, was not yet working.“It is one thing to implement a new policy, but it takes a bit of time for the policy to run smoothly,” said Remy Briand, global head of research for MSCI, after the decision not to include A-shares.The decision by MSCI to delay . . . is, naturally, mildly disappointing for us and for other investors in the Chinese stock marketAbuse of the previous system left more than half the mainland equities market suspended during last summer’s rout, resulting in fund managers being unable to meet redemptions or even value their holdings.Yet in the same week MSCI decided against including Chinese mainland shares in its indices, HSBC announced it had set up the first access for an international investor to China’s interbank bond markets.Crucially for those following the wider opening of China’s markets, Beijing has delegated approval of would-be bond investors to a select group of banks that, essentially, vouch for their clients. This is a far cry from the cumbersome approval needed to invest in stocks under the QFII (qualified foreign institutional investor) programmes, where fund houses need to be approved individually.“The scheme being followed by the bond market is almost better than the one for equities,” said Mr Briand following the MSCI decision. “[But] we can only highlight what we hear to regulators and watch for them to make their decisions.”As with any move by MSCI to include A-shares, international inflows to the bond markets are likely to happen gradually in spite of the smoother approvals process.The Chinese currency is now filling more pockets, portfolios and bank accounts across the world, yet it is prone to market turmoil. This multimedia report, including a video explainer, examines the renminbi’s prospects and recent historyBanks are still building teams to cover A-shares and credit analysis is at an early stage. Analysts at Standard Chartered estimate that international money will count for only 4-7 per cent of the $7.4tn market by 2020.Another issue is the suspicion of China among investors, particularly those outside the region. Hong Kong-based analysts admitted they underestimated the scale of international scepticism when most predicted MSCI would decide to include A-shares this year.“The key problem for China equities isn’t because it has not been included in international indices. The real issues include rising leverage, the renminbi and credit-fuelled growth,” says Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Société Générale.While Beijing considers the reforms it will need to enact to win MSCI approval — which it does want — it will also have to consider how to change that sentiment.
157;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Meanwhile, defensives that are favoured for their dividends and tend to perform well during times of uncertainty, fared the worst, with utilities and consumer staples lagging behind.The British pound, seen as a proxy for sentiment about the referendum, recently climbed 1.1 per cent to $1.487. The dollar traded down by 0.2 per cent against a basket of six global currencies.Traders also bid-up other risky assets: US crude oil prices rose 1.9 per cent to $50.07 a barrel, while Brent crude, the international marker, climbed by the same margin to $50.87 a barrel. Emerging markets currencies and stocks also continued their advice, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index closing 1.1 per cent higher and the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Currency Index climbing 0.6 per cent to hit its highest level in seven weeks.Havens faced selling pressure, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rising 5.4 basis points to 1.739 per cent, and gold declining by 0.3 per cent to $1,261.9 a troy ounce.Market strategists noted that the gains for US equities on Thursday could have been accelerated by investors unwinding hedges that they put in place to protect themselves against potential ructions caused by a ‘leave’ vote.Indeed, the Vix index, a measure of expected volatility on the S&P 500 over the next month, plunged 17.2 per cent to 17.52 after notching its highest closing level in four months on Wednesday.Follow the FT’s referendum live blog for the latest updates from around the UK here.

160;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T20:03:17Z;Dollar retreats as dovish Fed holds rates;Late sell-off leaves S&P 500 nursing loss;Wednesday 21:00 BST. The dollar fell and Treasury prices rose following the release of a relatively dovish policy statement from the Federal Reserve, while a late sell-off on Wall Street left the S&P 500 nursing its longest run of daily losses since February.The US central bank, as expected, left interest rates unchanged as it acknowledged a slowdown in the pace of improvement in the labour market.It signalled that it still planned to raise borrowing costs twice this year — although it pared back its rate forecasts for 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, it lowered its growth expectations for this year and next.“The latest Federal Open Market Committee statement was dovish, citing softer labour market conditions and the recent decline in market-based inflation expectations,” said Nick Stamenkovic, macro strategist at RIA Capital Markets.“Indeed US rate expectations were revised down over the medium term with six members expecting only one rate hike in 2016. All in all a July rate hike looks less and less likely, with the next tightening coming in September at the earliest.”Fed fund futures now price in a probability of just 40 per cent that rates will be raised by the end of next FebruaryOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 equity index was initially well-supported after the release of the Fed’s statement, but a late downturn left the index with a loss of 0.2 per cent at 2,071 — its fifth successive fall.The CBOE Vix volatility index pared an early fall to stand 2.3 per cent lower in late trade at just above its long-term average of 20.But emerging market equities looked a lot happier, with the MSCI EM index up 0.9 per cent.Shorter-term US Treasury yields — which move inversely to the price of the security and are very sensitive to shifts in Fed policy — extended earlier falls.The two-year yield was 4 basis points lower at 0.68 per cent and heading for its lowest close since February, while that on the 10-year note was down 3bp at 1.58 per cent.The dollar index was down 0.3 per cent — it was 0.2 per cent weaker before the FOMC announcement. The euro was up 0.4 per cent against the US currency at $$1.1253 and dollar/yen was 0.2 per cent lower at ¥105.93.Gold was up $7 at a one-month high of $1,292 an ounce.The moves in the US came after a relatively calm session in Europe as participants appeared to put “Brexit” concerns on the back burner — for now at least.Nevertheless, the mood of extreme caution regarding the possibility of a UK vote to quit the EU next week kept “core” European government bonds in demand, while oil prices retreated for a fifth successive session.There was also some focus on MSCI’s decision to once again delay including Chinese A shares in its benchmark emerging markets equity index.The pan-European Stoxx 600 share index rebounded 1 per cent following a five-session, 7.4 per cent decline to a four-month low. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.4 per cent.Financial stocks recouped some of their recent losses, even as the markets priced in a zero per cent chance of the Fed raising rates this time around, and as highly-rated government bond yields stayed near all-time lows.Indeed, that on the 10-year UK gilt touched a fresh record trough of 1.113 per cent before closing at 1.12 per cent, down 3 basis points on the day.The 10-year German Bund ended at minus 0.01 per cent, down 1bp, while the equivalent maturity Japanese Government Bond fell 3bp to a record minus 0.19 per cent.So-called “peripheral” eurozone sovereign bonds had a steadier session after big price falls earlier this week. Spanish and Italian 10-year yields each fell 1bp to 1.56 per cent and 1.43 per cent respectively.Meanwhile, sterling finally enjoyed some respite from Brexit concerns, bouncing 0.5 per cent against the dollar to $1.4183 and edging up 0.1 per cent versus the euro at €1.2602.“With opinions seemingly clear cut what a Brexit vote might mean for sterling, we have received many questions as to what it might imply for gilt and Bund yields,” said Peter Schaffrik, chief European macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“We remain convinced that both markets would rally, but for different reasons. Gilts should rally due to expectations of [UK] Bank Rate cuts ‘towards zero’ and another round of quantitative easing, coupled with a drop in inflation expectations.“Bunds are likely to be driven by a different force, namely a renewed flight to safety. We would expect a Brexit vote to reignite fears in the peripheral markets and trigger flows into Bunds.”In the emerging market currency universe, the dollar was down 0.3 per cent against the Brazilian real, 0.2 per cent against the Mexican peso and 0.8 per cent versus the Russian rouble, even as the price of Brent oil fell further away from the $50 a barrel mark.The international crude benchmark fell 1.7 per cent to settle at $48.97, its fifth straight decline, despite news of a fourth successive weekly drop in US oil inventories.In China, the Shanghai Composite index joined in the bullish equity market party — rising 1.6 per cent — even after the MSCI decision, fuelling speculation that the authorities had intervened to support stock prices.The index provider held out the possibility of an “off-cycle” decision should further positive developments in China take place before June 2017 when it is next scheduled to review A-shares.For market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
161;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T19:38:56Z;MSCI was right to hold firm on China;Index provider’s decision is justifiable even if it will put pressure on markets;If China wants the west’s money to flow into its domestic A-shares market, it has to be prepared to let that money flow out again. That is the brutal but necessary and correct message that MSCI has delivered by delaying once more A-shares’ inclusion in its benchmark emerging markets index.The decision is perhaps more of a surprise than it was a year ago, when a similar announcement of a delay helped catalyse the end of a brief bubble in A-shares, and a subsequent fall. As the A-shares market is now the world’s second largest by market capitalisation, outstripping even Japan, the case for their inclusion in a broad global benchmark is obvious.The likely impact, at least for the short term, will be negative. China has worked desperately to earn inclusion, showing that it matters to the Chinese authorities, and the decision is hence an embarrassing reverse, and a knock to confidence.Knowing the gravity of its decision, MSCI spelt out its reasons in unusually clear and strong language. The biggest problem is capital mobility. International investors still need to access the market through the qualified investor or “QFII” scheme.A number of international investors, MSCI reported, “said that they were still awaiting their QFII quota allocation for applications submitted months before”. There have been changes to improve mobility but other investors “said that they were not yet able to benefit from daily capital repatriation despite the fact that policy changes went into effect in early February of this year”.Further, QFII investors are still not allowed to repatriate more than 20 per cent of their A-shares’ net asset value per month, a limit which they complain could thwart their need to honour redemptions from clients. So MSCI says it must be “removed or substantially increased with a shorter repatriation horizon”.“Seamless execution” of daily capital repatriation will now be a “critical consideration”. In other words, what goes in must be allowed to come out again, or MSCI will not guide passive investors towards China.A further issue, of course, is that international investors have been shocked by the degree of intervention that they witnessed last summer, as the authorities tried to stop the A-shares market from crashing. Companies can announce their own voluntary trading suspensions, and MSCI reports that investors were “extremely vocal” about the liquidity risk this caused for them. MSCI rammed home the point by stating explicitly that this market price is “unique, not only for emerging markets but for all markets covered by MSCI”.Reforms have been announced to deal with the issue, but MSCI needs time to see that the number of stocks suspended in Shanghai and Shenzhen has been significantly reduced before it believes in those reforms.A final control that China must be prepared to give up if it wants inclusion concerns the need for preapproval of financial products on foreign stock exchanges that are linked to A-share indices. At present, the restrictions apply to all existing and new financial products. “The breadth of the restrictions is unique in emerging markets, as is the possibility that existing financial products based on the MSCI emerging markets index would be in danger of having their trading disrupted if China A shares were included,” MSCI pointed out. Thus, a “vast majority” of investors said they needed China to align with international norms before they were prepared to be judged against a benchmark that included A-shares.Thus did MSCI, a New York-based for-profit company with a market cap of $7bn, tell the world’s second-largest country what to do. Bravo to MSCI.The institutional politics at work were mind-boggling. China badly wanted inclusion, and went to remarkable lengths to win MSCI over, even setting up a special working group of its securities commission to work with the indexers on enacting the necessary reforms.Plenty of those touting investments in China wanted to see inclusion for the good reason that it would mean a sharp rise in prices as soon as it was announced. Within minutes of the decision, China bulls were already giving the inevitability of A-shares’ eventual future inclusion as a reason to buy them now.Against this, the weight of the big investing institutions, which are MSCI’s biggest clients, plainly did not want to be forced to buy into A-shares. Their opposition appears undimmed even by the correction of the past year, which means that they would no longer be obliged to enter the market at bubble prices.Regulatory capture is a common problem in markets. It is good to see that MSCI held firm and made a justifiable decision which will, in the short term, plainly put pressure on markets to fall rather than rise.Standing back, though, the episode casts further light on the problems and distortions that have accompanied the rise of passive and benchmarked investing. MSCI has acquitted its responsibilities well, but it is absurd that so much power has effectively been delegated to a small private organisation.For now, a quoted US indexing company seems to be doing a job that might more naturally belong to multilateral governmental bodies, or regulators. But the fact that its decision matters so much suggests there is something in the way international markets have come to work that has gone badly awry.john.authers@ft.com
162;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T15:37:20Z;MSCI A-shares denial sends Beijing clear message;Global investors want proof China will deliver on promised reforms;"Capital controls, regulatory extraterritoriality and unique local market practices. Listed that way, the reasons mainland Chinese shares failed to win MSCI inclusion make the decision look less close-run than many had thought it would be.Underlying it was a message from the index provider and international investors to Chinese authorities: we want proof you will do what you say you will.MSCI’s decision to hold off adding the world’s second-largest market to its globally followed indices also highlights a split between investors based in or near China who were expecting inclusion, and the global managers whose reservations swayed the index provider’s thinking.“We underestimated the resistance from the global investment community,” says Steven Sun, head of Hong Kong and China equity research at HSBC.Kinger Lau, strategist at Goldman, also says it was unexpected: “Our recent conversations with investors, especially those with onshore investors, suggested that their expectations leading up to the event were high.”Money flows showed investors were betting on inclusion and a consequent bump in A-share prices. Some $920m flowed into A-share focused exchange traded funds listed in New York and Hong Kong in the past three weeks, according to Mr Lau. In the same period there was net buying of A-shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect — the one direct line between A-shares and the outside world.Others suggested the decision was as much about China’s tepid markets as the technical factors MSCI cited. Shanghai and Shenzhen are both more than 40 per cent below their peaks of June last year and trading volumes are a fraction of previous levels.“If China’s economy was really booming and Chinese stock market performance was good, we would have had a much bigger chance of inclusion,” says Wenjie Lu, China equity strategist at UBS Securities. “Global investors have relatively lower appetite for Chinese markets just now. That’s the underlying reason for this decision.”China’s capital controls are seen as the most pressing issue raised by MSCI. It had highlighted investor concerns over the cap on repatriating funds, which is limited to 20 per cent of net asset value in any month.More of a surprise was fund managers’ apparent frustration over approval for inbound funds, too. In April, a “road map” from MSCI suggested that problem had been solved by a new streamlined process announced in February.“Investors are supposed to have their quota but they are still waiting months [for approval],” said Remy Briand, global head of research for MSCI. “It is one thing to implement a new policy but it takes a bit of time for the policy to run smoothly.”The same wait-and-see approach was applied to China’s new rules on stock suspensions. In theory, these limit companies’ ability to self-suspend to a few days and should help avoid the widespread halts of last summer when more than half the market stopped trading in a bid to avoid the rout.However, MSCI says investors wanted to see how the rules, formalised last month, are applied in practice. Suspensions elsewhere usually require regulatory or exchange approval, but not in China, and the index provider described the mayhem of last year as unique in its experience.“A lot of investors participated in A-shares [last year] and had experience in dealing with that — people were vocal on that point,” says Chin-Ping Chia, MSCI’s head of research for Asia-Pacific. “A big part of people’s portfolio was suspended; they couldn’t get any liquidity. It created a lot of issues.”The other outstanding issue is even more technical, but critical: China’s exchanges have the right to preapprove any financial product referencing A-shares. That means they could refuse permission to any fund manager planning an exchange-traded fund referencing MSCI indices that included A-shares, whether or not China was the focal point. It could also affect existing products.“You would not want to put all these products at risk. This is not theory, this is a very practical point,” said Mr Briand.Other investors, meanwhile, lamented MSCI’s missed opportunity to include A-shares and encourage western standards — described by Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, as the “World Trade Organisation effect”.“That is, global standards improving functioning of domestic markets,” he said in a tweet.China’s markets are overwhelmingly dominated by retail investors who tend to pay more attention to market momentum than to fundamental analysis of stocks. Authorities have long been aware that more institutional investors could help balance the volatile instincts of mom-and-pop traders.“What matters more for us is governance, transparency and care of minority shareholders,” says Nicholas Yeo, head of China and Hong Kong equities at Aberdeen Asset Management and a long-time investor in A-shares.He added: “It would take time, but more long-term investors, either domestic or foreign, would definitely help to improve standards and encourage reforms.”"
163;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T09:40:51Z;Pakistan: unsung winner in MSCI’s EM decision;;While much has already been made of MSCI’s decision not to add China to its emerging markets index, the gatekeepers did end up adding one country to the benchmark index tracked by $1.5tn of global funds: Pakistan.Alongside its high-profile China deferral, the index provider also announced a decision to reclassify its country-specific MSCI Pakistan Index from frontier markets to emerging markets status, scheduling the official transition to coincide with a semi-annual index review in May 2017.French bank Natixis described Pakistan as the “biggest winner of the 2016 MSCI Market Classification Review,” adding that “by acquiring the EM designation, its firms and index in general may get the capital inflows it wouldn’t otherwise get as a FM. In other words, Pakistan has entered a bigger league.”That is welcome news for Pakistan, which is currently dealing with a current account deficit and faces a shortfall of capital needed to help facilitate steady development. MSCI has also published a pro forma list of constituents for its MSCI Provisional Pakistan Indexes, replete with information on each firm’s number of shares and sector:China wasn’t the only country dealt a losing hand by MSCI’s latest round of reclassifications: Vietnam’s market failed to make the jump from frontier to emerging status. The firm also added Peru – which currently enjoys a position on the emerging markets index – to its watch list for potential demotion to frontier markets.Yet Nataxis points out that while countries like Vietnam (perhaps including Asia’s other major Communist party-run economy) have their work cut out for them attaining full emerging markets status, “the Pakistan experience shows that nothing is ever permanent and change occurs very rapidly.”
164;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T06:20:37Z;MSCI’s China snub: what analysts think;;"There’s been more mention of China today than a Donald Trump meme after MSCI again decided to refrain from adding A-shares to its emerging markets index, as well as the renminbi reference rate being set at its lowest level in nearly five-and-a-half years.Far from meaning the end of the world for Chinese shares, today, they seem to have taken the decision in their stride. The Shanghai Composite is up 1.7 per cent, and the technology-focused up by twice as much – although both benchmarks slumped around 1 per cent at the open.This is the third year in a row that MSCI has refrained from adding A-shares to its benchmark index, which is tracked by $1.5tn of global funds, and Goldman Sachs had estimated there was a 50 per cent to 70 per cent chance inclusion would be approved this time.MSCI’s announcement still remained constructive and also held out the possibility of an off-cycle decision should further positive developments in China take place before June 2017.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch assess the chance of off-cycle inclusion as low, saying it seems unlikely the Chinese government would relent on a 20 per cent monthly repatriation limit for qualified investors and anti-competitive clauses on index products – which MSCI has raised as issues – any time soon. The bank adds:The announcement should put some short-term pressure on A-shares, particularly in light of the unsettled global market environment. That said, we don’t expect any negative impact to be significant or lasting – other than on a few selected days, the pending MSCI decision had not been a noticeable driver of the A-share market in recent months, by our assessment.Kinger Lau at Goldman Sachs thinks the combination of a disappointing outcome and rising expectations and flows leading up the MSCI decision suggests “investors may focus their attention on the very active global event calendar in the coming weeks,” which includes central bank meetings this week and the Brexit referendum on June 23.Short-term selling pressures may also rise given the absence of the MSCI catalyst, although he added that “we don’t see the decision triggering similar corrective magnitude as was seen in the summer of 2015 given we believe, a more reasonable equity valuation profile”.Guillaume Derville, head of Asia equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas said of the impact on Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets:The initial impact to Hong Kong market will not likely be significant; over the long run, the offshore channel will become less significant as China’s capital market is opening. Investors should realise that China’s capital market opening is on track; the Pandora’s box has been opened and, if any, the risk is on an upside as [an] MSCI decision gives China incentive to push reforms through further.Steven Sun, head of HK/China equity research at HSBC said they had underestimated the resistance from the global investment community on the A-share inclusion issue.We agree there is room for improvement in the regulatory environment and in corporate governance in the A-share market; however, we believe it is moving in the right direction. We still think inclusion is probable (possibly by year-end), and cite historical precedent for support. We note that 20% of Korea’s equity market was initially included in the EM index more than 24 years ago, and 50% of Taiwan’s equity market was included more than 20 years ago. MSCI did not rule out a potential off-cycle announcement should further significant positive developments occur ahead of June 2017."
165;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T05:32:33Z;MSCI delays including China A-shares in its indices;Capital controls and trading halts dash China index hopes;China’s domestic markets were denied entry to international stock benchmarks for the third year in a row, delivering a blow to Beijing and frustrating those investors keen to see the world’s second-largest market included in MSCI’s globally followed indices.Inclusion would have boosted confidence in Chinese equities, which remain subdued in the wake of last summer’s stock market crash and botched rescue attempt — both of which roiled bourses across the globe.MSCI, the index provider, had raised expectations it would accept mainland A-shares when it unexpectedly laid out a road map for inclusion earlier this year, citing its close work with Chinese regulators and pointing to reforms that addressed several long-running issues.On Tuesday, however, MSCI said investors had urged a wait-and-see approach by the index provider. An estimated $1.5tn is benchmarked to its flagship emerging markets index, to which the addition of A-shares would have made the most difference.“International institutional investors clearly indicated that they would like to see further improvements in the accessibility of the China A-shares market before its inclusion,” said Remy Briand, MSCI’s global head of research.This week Chinese officials had argued that size alone would justify the inclusion of mainland stocks.“Theoretically, if an international index is without this big market, it is incomplete,” said Qi Bin, director-general of international affairs for the China Securities Regulatory Commission.MSCI said China had made “significant steps” and demonstrated a clear commitment to reaching international standards. Outstanding issues raised by MSCI included investors’ ability to move funds in and out of China and a desire to see whether new stock suspension rules are enforced.Investors were badly scarred by the trading halts of last summer, which left many A-share fund managers trapped in suspended stocks even as their own investors demanded withdrawals. While other markets allow trading halts, its widespread use and the ability of Chinese companies to do so without even requesting exchange approval, was “unique”, according to Mr Briand.US exchange traded funds tracking mainland stocks declined following MSCI’s announcement on Tuesday evening in New York. The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-shares ETF was down 2.3 per cent after hours, having closed 1.3 per cent higher ahead of the decision.China’s markets opened lower on Wednesday but subsequently rallied, with the Shanghai Composite up 1.5 per cent and its tech-heavy Shenzhen equivalent up 3 per cent by early afternoon.Analysts suspected the “national team” of state-owned financial institutions might have acted to prevent a sharp fall. The national team has pulled back from regular intervention since last year’s dramatic rescue efforts but in recent months has stepped in occasionally when volatility has threatened to re-emerge.Analysts still consider inclusion of Chinese stocks in MSCI indices at some point to be inevitable.“MSCI is being prudent, but it is pretty clear what the direction of travel is here,” said Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC. “The liberalisation of the market will continue regardless of what MSCI does.”Based on existing and continuing reform, MSCI said it would review China A-shares again next year, but did not rule out a potential inclusion before then should changes be made.Additional reporting by Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai
166;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T04:48:30Z;MSCI A-shares: weightless;Decision is a blow to China bulls;Sheer weight of money has both good and bad effects. Late on Tuesday MSCI, the benchmark setter, said it will not yet include China’s onshore A-shares in its emerging markets benchmark. On Wednesday A-shares shrugged, opening down 1 per cent and rallying into positive territory.That is a healthy response to a liquidity non-event. The inflow to buy A-shares up to the proposed first phase weighting would have been as little as $15bn, according to Goldman Sachs. At less than a day’s volume this would not have moved the market. Of course, the decision is a blow to China bulls, but the avoidance of a rally based solely on sentiment is ultimately a good thing.True, rising share prices might have given China options — the ability to convert debt to equity, raise funds from government stake sales and restructure the balance sheet. Yet such strategies circumvent harder decisions. In this instance, no weight of money will produce the best outcomes of all.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
167;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T01:46:35Z;Chinese shares mixed after MSCI non-event;;Chinese shares are looking rather non-plussed – thus far – about MSCI’s decision to not include A-shares in its emerging markets indices.10 minutes into Wednesday trading, the Shanghai Composite is down one-quarter of one per cent, while the technology-focused Shenzhen Composite is up 0.3 per cent. The CSI 300, a benchmark tracking the top 300 stocks across both exchanges, was down 0.3 per cent.At the open, the Shanghai benchmark dropped as much as 1.1 per cent, and the Shenzhen benchmark fell as much as 1.2 per cent, before both rebounded.Still, plenty of hours left in the day, so watch this space.
168;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-15T00:18:12Z;Offshore renminbi, China ETFs weaker after China’s MSCI snub;;There’s still some time to go before the fallout – if any – from MSCI’s decision to delay including China in its emerging market indices will be seen in mainland shares. But for the moment, it has prompted a sell-off in the renminbi and China-linked exchange traded funds.The offshore renminbi (CNH), which is traded outside the mainland and not subject to a trading band, weakened as much as 0.1 per cent to Rmb6.6155 in early Asian trading on Wednesday, following the MSCI decision. That puts the currency at its weakest level since the start of March and follows a another 0.1 per cent decline on Tuesday, writes Peter Wells.Its counterpart, the onshore renminbi (CNY) is allowed to trade 2 per cent either side of a daily reference rate, which is fixed by the People’s Bank of China. The central bank, since August last year, has endeavoured to give markets a greater voice in setting the midpoint rate, and since December has also said it was measuring the renminbi against a basket of global currencies, not just the greenback. CNY was 0.2 per cent weaker at Rmb6.5970 by its close in London on Tuesday.A handful of ETFs tracking Chinese shares were weaker in after-hours trading in the US.The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-shares ETF was down 2.3 per cent after-hours, but had closed 1.3 per cent higher in the US following a six-session sell-off. (The CSI 300 is a benchmark comprising the top 300 stocks on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks exchanges.)The iShares China large-cap ETF was off by 0.7 per cent in after hours trading, having closed 0.3 per cent higher on Tuesday, and the SPDR S&P China ETF was 1.2 per cent lower after hours, having gained 0.3 per cent during normal trading hours in the US.On Monday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges returned from a long weekend and tumbled more than 3 per cent, their biggest one-day sell-offs since late February. That marked a year since the Chinese market’s summer peak on June 12, which MSCI unwittingly called when it snubbed China for inclusion in the emerging markets indices around this time last year.
169;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-14T23:34:45Z;Fast Asia Open: MSCI delays China decision, Fed;;It’s shaping up as another messy day, with global markets caught in a tide of major events and debates.For investors in Asia, the big news is MSCI’s decision after market close in the US to not include Chinese A-shares in its emerging market indices. For some, that may be more disappointing than it is surprising, but could cause investors who were betting on inclusion to reverse bets today. At this time last year, when MSCI also denied China entry to those indices, mainland stocks had just commenced their descent into what became a savage bear market.In the US and Europe, last night’s sell-off was the familiar theme of rushing to the relative safety of government debt, pushing down yields of bonds in the US and Germany, while yields on Japanese government bonds also hit record lows. Yields on UK gilts continued to tumble as polls suggest voters are leaning toward the UK leaving the European Union, a move that could delay interest rate rises by the Bank of England.Investors are now hunkering down for an upcoming 24 hours of central bank meetings, starting with the Federal Reserve today, where it is expected to remain on hold, and followed by the Bank of Japan and then Bank of England later on Thursday.Overnight, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent, while European stocks sank another 2 per cent.Futures tip Japan’s Nikkei 225 to open 0.8 per cent lower and for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 to decline 0.7 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was last tipped to open 0.7 per cent weaker.Here are some of the highlights on today’s very light economic calendar (Hong Kong times):
170;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-14T23:18:37Z;Peru stocks remain in MSCI EM indices;;Peruvian economic and bourse officials can finally lean back and relax. On Tuesday, MSCI ratified the Andean country’s stock exchange status as an emerging market for equities.Since August last year the country has been on the verge of being demoted from the flagship EM index to a frontier market, writes Andres Schipani in Bogotá.The index provider’s concern was that only three stocks in its Peru equity universe -Buenaventura, Credicorp, Southern Copper- met its liquidity and free float requirements, the minimum number to be eligible for its EM index. MSCI’s EM is tracked by an estimated $1.5tn.Officials where concerned this could have spurred an outpouring of capital outflows, and started to implement reforms to avoid the downgrade, such as a capital gains tax exemption. Peru’s finance ministry said in statement that Lima’s capital market is working on increasing its liquidity levels and attracting more companies.Good call, because as MSCI warned in its own statement:The MSCI Peru Index will remain in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. However, MSCI highlighted that it will proceed with the reclassification of Peru to Frontier Markets status in the event that the MSCI Peru Index falls short of the minimum requirement for Emerging Markets that the index contains at least three constituents.The decision comes days after Peru elected a former Wall Street banker as its next president.
171;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Risk aversion grows as Brexit fears build;Stocks and oil fall as bonds extend rally;Tuesday 21:00 BST. Intensifying concerns over the possibility of the UK voting to quit the European Union continued to dominate market sentiment, overshadowing the start of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting and some reassuring US economic data.As opinion polls showing the Leave campaign gathering momentum fuelled a fresh wave of risk aversion, “core” government bond yields in Europe and Japan hit fresh record lows, with that on the 10-year German Bund entering negative territory for the first time.Global equity and commodity prices came under sustained pressure while the yen strengthened towards levels that could prompt intervention from the Bank of Japan, analysts said.Among UK assets, sterling fell to its lowest against the dollar for two months, as the implied volatility of the currency pair over a one-month period rose to its highest level since October 2008. The FTSE 100 share index tumbled below 6,000 for the first time since February.“Risk is off, but Brexit is very much on the table,” said Kit Juckes, strategist at Société Générale. “The latest opinion polls in the UK continue to show a swing towards leaving the EU.”He noted: “Bookmakers imply that the probability of staying has now fallen to around 64 per cent — still well above what opinion polls imply, and of course still well above 50 per cent, but the gap is narrowing quickly.”And many in the markets felt that there was unlikely to be any let-up anytime soon in the markets’ fixation with the possibility of Brexit.“We do not expect any reversal of the state of mind that dominates financial markets at this point unless an unexpected change in the results of the near daily polls shows an abrupt shift in favour of the Remain camp in the coming days,” said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.“We consider it as self-evident that markets have the potential to move into more unstable territory over the coming weeks in the event that the UK votes to exit the EU.”The continued rally in highly-rated government bond prices attracted the lions’ share of the market headlines. The yield on the 10-year German Bund, which moves inversely to its price, fell as low as minus 0.034 per cent before closing at zero, down 3 basis points on the day.The UK 10-year gilt yield touched a record 1.115 per cent before it, too, pulled back to 1.15 per cent, down 6bp on the day. The equivalent maturity Japanese government bond yield hit minus 0.168 per cent.However, so-called “peripheral” eurozone sovereign yields rose, with Portugal’s 10-year implied borrowing cost jumping 18bp to 3.39 per cent and Spain’s up 7bp to 1.57 per cent.In the US, the 10-year Treasury yield reversed an early fall to trade 1bp higher at 1.62 per cent late in the New York afternoon, having earlier dipped to 1.567 per cent, the lowest intraday point for more than four months.The two-year yield was also up 1bp at 0.73 per cent, after hitting 0.682 per cent. The yield spread between the two maturities touched the lowest since November 2007.The rebound in US yields followed the release of broadly encouraging retail sales data. Headline sales rose 0.5 per cent in May, while April’s healthy 1.3 per cent increase was left unrevised.So-called control group sales, which strip out cars, petrol and building materials, rose by 0.4 per cent in May after an upwardly revised 1 per cent gain in April, pointing to solid consumer spending in the second quarter.“Together with strong consumer confidence readings, [the data] indicate that the household sector is in decent shape and not unduly concerned about the weakness in the labour market indicated by the weak payrolls figures from earlier in the month,” said James Knightley, an economist at ING.“This won’t be enough to convince the Fed to hike rates [on Wednesday] or in July, but we still feel there is a strong chance of a September hike.”The prospect of the Fed keeping interest rates “lower for longer” offered little support for US equities.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,075, its fourth successive decline, although it managed to pull away from an early low of 2,064.10. The latest drop left the index down 2.1 per cent from its 2016 intraday high, hit less than a week ago.The CBOE Vix index of implied equity volatility was down 2.4 per cent at 20.47 in late trade, off an earlier peak of 22.16, the highest since February, but still above its long-term average of 20.In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index fell 1.9 per cent to a near four-month low, while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo shed 1 per cent.Energy stocks fell sharply on both sides of the Atlantic as Brent oil fell 1 per cent to settle at $49.83 a barrel, not helped by a 0.6 per cent gain for the dollar against a basket of currencies.Sterling was down 1.2 per cent against the dollar at $1.4099 and 0.3 per cent weaker versus the euro at €1.2585.Dollar/yen was down 0.2 per cent at ¥106.05 after earlier hitting ¥105.60.Despite the rise in the dollar index, gold was up $2 at $1,286 an ounce.For market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
172;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-14T21:07:27Z;MSCI delays including China A shares in key index;;International investors’ concerns about the quality of mainland China’s markets have once more put paid to hopes that MSCI would finally include the world’s second largest markets in its globally-followed indices.The index provider had raised expectations that it would accept mainland A-shares when it laid out a “roadmap” for inclusion in March. But on Tuesday it said “international institutional investors clearly indicated that they would like to see further improvements in the accessibility of the China A shares market before its inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index”, write Nicole Bullock in New York and Jennifer Hughes in Hong Kong.Including mainland shares would have been seen as a vote of confidence in China’s market development after Beijing introduced several market reforms following last summer’s rout, when its heavy-handed approach and companies’ ability to suspend their shares at will unnerved international onlookers.MSCI is the world’s largest index provider and its benchmark emerging markets index — in which A-shares would have made the most impact — are followed by an estimated $1.5tn of funds. Including A-shares would have added another link between China and the global financial system by forcing international fund managers to invest onshore.Inclusion of Chinese stocks at some point is still considered by analysts to be inevitable. Shanghai and Shenzhen markets are both more than 40 per cent below their June 2015 peaks but combined, still represent the world’s second largest market by capitalisation — behind New York but ahead of Tokyo.
173;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-14T01:50:39Z;MSCI and China: A-shares decision day;Index provider to decide whether to add A-shares to its EM indices;MSCI, the index provider, will announce on Tuesday evening in New York whether it has decided to include China in its emerging markets indices. Coming almost a year to the day since mainland markets peaked, inclusion would mark something of an international rehabilitation for mainland stocks. A decision to delay again would probably be greeted with a shrug since China still has a lot of work to do to align its market practices with international norms.Why all the fuss?The potential of big numbers. China’s current market capitalisation of almost $8tn trails only that of the S&P 500’s $19tn, while Japan’s Topix is pegged at $4.7tn. MSCI is arguably the world’s most-followed index provider and an estimated $1.5tn is benchmarked to its Emerging Markets index — the one in the spotlight here.China already accounts for 26.8 per cent of the MSCI EM index via shares of Chinese companies listed elsewhere, mostly in Hong Kong and New York — included since last November.If all A-shares were included at their full weight in the MSCI EM, China’s weighting would suddenly jump to 39 per cent, implying more than $180bn of A-share buying from investors who track the index.Full inclusion, however, is the one thing certain not to happen this time. But any move in that direction would mark the beginning of the process and would draw China’s markets into the international financial system.“The timing of the inclusion isn’t that important,” says Kinger Lau, strategist at Goldman Sachs. “What we find important is the road map ahead and how global investors’ equity benchmarks may change as the process of including the second-largest equity market globally develops.”How likely is it to happen?The fact that MSCI put China back on the table at all this year significantly raises the odds of some form of inclusion, analysts think. Last year the index provider removed China from its annual review, but in March this year it announced an inclusion road map, sent to clients for their comments, detailing progress by the Chinese authorities and laying out what it was still looking for.Odds vary among watchers. Goldman Sachs last month raised its probability to 70 per cent from 50 per cent. HSBC puts it at “better than 50” while Citigroup is more specific at 51 per cent — which it explains as “yes, but with high uncertainty”.Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, suggests an “in-between” option: “[This] could be either a delay of the decision subject to China meeting all (or most) of the remaining criteria, or an off-cycle decision that brings A-shares into the index before the next annual review.”A word of caution: many analysts were confident it would happen last year, too.How much money are we talking?Don’t all rush at once. MSCI’s presumed proposal is to start with a 5 per cent weighting — that is, including a weighting of just 5 per cent of the available onshore free-floating market capitalisation. Back-of-the-envelope sums translate that to accounting for about 1.5 per cent of MSCI’s EM index. With $1.5tn following that, roughly $20bn would need to shift onshore — and most likely only by June 2017.At less than the average turnover of A-shares in a single day, that isn’t going to cause waves. As with so many of China’s market reforms, this one begins with being heavy on the symbolism and light on financial effect. But as MSCI increases China’s weighting over time, the flows will become more significant.But don’t rule out a higher inclusion rate, either — MSCI asked clients in March whether 5 per cent was still the right starting point. The assumption of 5 per cent dates from discussions in 2014 — before investors got direct access through the Hong Kong Shanghai Stock Connect and before China expanded its quota programmes for foreign investors.Why might it not happen?After last year’s market meltdown, investors were left with far more questions than answers regarding China’s markets. Chief among these were issues around share suspensions. More than half the companies on the mainland market halted trading seemingly simply to avoid the sell-off. There was also the question of the role of the so-called “national team” — state-backed banks and brokers press-ganged into buying shares to support the market.Share suspension has been largely dealt with. New rules introduced last month now limit trading halts to five days excepting restructurings and share placements.Fund manager concerns around beneficial ownership — their right to be recognised as the actual owner within China when they buy through Stock Connect — have also largely been addressed.These issues have been dealt with since MSCI published its road map in March, suggesting a drive in China for inclusion. What remains is a biggie, however — namely accessibility, or investors’ ability to get their money in and out.One strand of this is the Stock Connect, where flows north and south are still subject to quotas. Another is the ability of QFII holders — investors approved by China to invest onshore — to repatriate funds. Mandated lock-ups have been reduced but outflows are still limited to 20 per cent of net asset value a month.
174;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-13T20:02:13Z;Stocks retreat as risk aversion builds;Pound volatile while gold and yen advance;Monday 21:00 BST. A nervous start to the week for global markets left equities trading with a cautious tone as oil prices turned choppy and “core” government bond yields held close to record lows.Sterling had a particularly volatile session as uncertainty about the outcome of next week’s referendum on European Union membership remained at the forefront of investor concerns.Fresh worries about the prospects for growth in China — and hence the global economy — added to the cautious mood.At the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 equity index was down 0.8 per cent at 2,079 — just a few days after reaching its intraday high for the year of 2,120.55.Not even Microsoft’s $26.2bn cash purchase of LinkedIn — which sent the latter’s shares soaring 46 per cent — could lift the mood. Microsoft fell 2.6 per cent.The sense of unease on Wall Street was reflected by a 22 per cent jump for the CBOE Vix volatility index to above its long-term average of 20 — the highest since early March, but still some way below its 2016 peak above 32, hit in January.In Europe, the pan-regional Stoxx 600 ended 1.8 per cent lower while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo tumbled 3.5 per cent to a five-week low as the risk-averse mood helped drive the yen to its highest against the dollar for six weeks.Energy stocks outperformed on both sides of the Atlantic as oil prices swung from sharp losses to modest gains, and back again. Brent crude fell as low as $49.61 a barrel before rallying back to $50.79 and settling at $50.35, down 0.4 per cent on the day.The pound had a similarly choppy time as the cost of insuring against volatility in sterling/dollar neared its financial crisis peak — and the 10-year gilt yield touched a fresh record low beneath 1.2 per cent — as the markets continued to largely take their cue from referendum opinion polls.Alex Holmes at Capital Economics said a UK decision to leave the EU would still come as a major shock.“Although the latest polls suggest that public opinion in the UK has swung in favour of voting to leave the EU, the weight of money being wagered on the outcome still implies that a Brexit would come as a big surprise and therefore cause waves in the financial markets.”Sterling/dollar hit an eight-week low of $1.4116 before rebounding all the way back to $1.4306 — only to slip to $1.4226 as New York trading drew to a close, down 0.2 per cent on the session.The pound was down 0.6 per cent versus the euro at €1.2599 while the yield on the 10-year gilt pulled back to 1.22 per cent, down 2 basis points on the day.Concerns about the potential impact from a UK decision to quit the EU have gathered momentum recently — but analysts noted that the heightened anxiety came against a backdrop of worries elsewhere.“The uncertainty over the approaching ‘Brexit’ vote is widely viewed as having instigated a heightened risk-off mode in the last few days,” said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.“While it is always tempting to explain the behaviour of financial markets under the prism of a single underlying driving force, we believe that, while the long reach of the UK referendum is unquestionably present in a number of market developments, such a presence is inconsistent and at times even perplexing.“This suggests that other, non-transparent, market cross-currents may also be at work, creating a somewhat more complex picture that will ultimately need to be sorted out in a more intuitive manner.”One factor driving government bond markets of late has been the introduction of negative interest rates in Japan and the eurozone.The yield on the 10-year German Bund touched 0.01 per cent on Friday, although it ended on Monday at 0.024 per cent, flat on the day.Ahead of the conclusion of a meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee on Wednesday — at which interest rates are almost universally expected to be left unchanged — the 10-year Treasury yield was 3bp lower at 1.61 per cent, the lowest intraday level since February.The 10-year Japanese government bond yield held steady at a record minus 0.16 per cent.The dollar was down 0.2 per cent against a weighted basket of currencies as the euro edged up 0.3 per cent to $1.1287 and dollar/yen fell 0.7 per cent to ¥106.21. The soft dollar and lower US yields helped gold climb $9 to $1,283 an ounce, its highest for a month.The dip in Treasury yields also reflected global economic worries after data showed that growth in Chinese fixed asset investment, a proxy for businesses’ longer-term investment, slowed to 9.6 per cent in May from 10.5 per cent.The Shanghai Composite stock index tumbled 3.2 per cent.For market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
175;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-13T14:45:03Z;China A-shares: finally ready?;One year since peak, investors still unsure mainland markets are ready for global showtime;This time last year investors were debating whether China’s equity markets were a bubble about to burst or a rally that still had room to run.In the event, MSCI, the index provider, pricked the bubble when it decided not to include Chinese stocks in its emerging markets indices. This year, with a decision due this week, MSCI does not have to worry about frothy markets: the CSI300, which peaked the day before the decision was made last year, is still 40 per cent below those levels. Trading volumes are about a sixth of their level this time last year.This year, those asking “would you” are focusing on technical yet crucial aspects of the market: are mainland markets ready for showtime on the international stage? And more pertinently still, could investors get their money out?Chinese officials argue that size alone justifies inclusion.“Theoretically, if an international index is without this big market, it is incomplete,” said Qi Bin, director-general of international affairs for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at the Lujiazui financial forum in Shanghai over the weekend.Yet international investors are focused on more than just size. In the sell-off that began a year ago Monday, international investors watched in horror as companies suspended themselves at will, seemingly just to avoid the rout, and Beijing press-ganged a “national team” of state-backed banks and brokers into buying to support the market.Two months later, China spooked world markets with a devaluation of the renminbi, the effects of which are still being felt. And in January China’s regulators suffered the ignominy of a circuit breaker so unfit for purpose it lasted just three days.Strategists — and MSCI — say changes have been made since.“On paper China has made a lot of progress,” says Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Société Générale. “But a lot of these new rules have just been put in place. We need to see how they are applied in practice.”MSCI signalled it was once again considering China when it published a “road map” in late March. There it laid out five issues and said three had been satisfactorily addressed, leaving two outstanding.The list of those cleared up centred on getting money into China via the web of investment quotas that apply variously to foreign fund managers as well as an overall limit on stock buying through the Connect scheme that directly links Hong Kong to the Shanghai market. The issue for MSCI is that if it includes A-shares, index-following investors must be able to actually invest.In February, Beijing loosened restrictions on quotas per fund manager and promised the process would be more transparent.Last month, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges limited share-trading halts to no more than five days save for exceptional circumstances. While that will still seem lax to those used to New York and London habits, suspensions pending news are common in many Asian markets, including Hong Kong, where they regularly continue for weeks.MSCI’s outstanding issues focus on getting money out as well as in, notably the limits on how much quota funds qualified foreign institutional investors may repatriate in any one month.“It’s a valid concern, especially thinking about the macro backdrop. It’s clear China wants to create more channels to bring capital in and constrain outflows,” says Kinger Lau, chief China strategist at Goldman Sachs. “For foreign investors that is a problem and it’s one of the reasons we see relatively low utilisation of QFII and RQFII [renminbi-denominated quota] including for equities.”Although it is not officially part of MSCI’s criteria, the volatility in the A-share market will also weigh on the minds of asset managers. Wild swings are more common in China than in other big markets. In the past 10 years, the CSI300 has moved more than 5 per cent in either direction on 64 occasions, most recently in February. The S&P 500 has done so on 22 occasions, the latest one in August 2011.Another outstanding issue is the “national team”, which although no longer intervening daily, still owned shares worth about 5.9 per cent of tradeable market capitalisation at the end of the first quarter, according to China Merchants Securities.While the blunt nature of the instrument — estimates range between Rmb1tn ($152bn) and almost Rmb2tn of buying — shocked investors, analysts point to other examples of government intervention around the world.These include Hong Kong’s direct buying during the Asian crisis and the short selling ban imposed on markets including London and New York in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, not to mention the hundreds of billions spent bailing out banks around the developed world.In China, few analysts expect the overhang created by the national team to dissipate any time soon. Apart from the likely hit to the market from any wave of selling, the team is also sitting on unrealised losses of 23 per cent — worth between $35bn and $70bn.Regardless of the clouds, hopes of inclusion have been cited as a support to Shanghai and Shenzhen over the past fortnight even if actual gains have been limited.“As for the long-term impact, it goes without saying,” says Zhu Bin, equity strategist at Southwest Securities in Shanghai. “Even if A-shares are included in the index, it won’t immediately attract a wave of liquidity to rush into the market. Foreign funds’ increasing their A-share allocations will be a very long process.”Additional reporting by Peter Wells
176;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-13T07:19:47Z;Risk off grips markets ahead of Brexit, Fed;;Equities are sliding, while investors seek “safety” in government bonds, the yen and gold, as worries about Brexit build and traders await the Federal Reserve’s policy decision amid further signs of a cooling Chinese economy.In Europe the Stoxx 600 share index is opening 0.8 per cent lower, weighed down by banks and the commodity sector as the price of Brent crude falls 1.3 per cent to $49.88 a barrel, writes Jamie Chisholm.US index futures indicate the S&P 500 will start its session with an six point decline to 2,090, having once again balked at running through the May 2015 closing high of 2,131.Asian bourses have had a particularly rotten start to the week. With Australia closed for a holiday the Shanghai Composite fell 2 per cent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 2.7 per cent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 3.5 per cent.A surging yen — which tends to strengthen at times of investors stress — did for the exporter-sensitive Tokyo bourse. The US dollar is down 0.9 per cent to ¥106.04, flirting with its lowest level since October 2014, as traders seek perceived haven assets amid a batch of concerns.Global growth worries are to the fore after fresh data from China on balance showed signs of weakness in May. Growth in industrial production was unchanged at 6 per cent year-on-year, while retail sales were roughly steady at a 10 per cent annual pace of expansion. Fixed asset investment, a proxy for businesses’ longer-term investment, was the bigger surprise, with growth slowing to 9.6 per cent from 10.5 per cent in April.“Given today’s data, there is a higher risk for China to miss the growth target of 6.5 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter,” said Raymond Yeung at ANZ Banking Group.Investors are awaiting a decision this week from MSCI on whether to include Chinese stocks in its emerging markets benchmarks — a move that could influence how global asset managers allocate trillions of dollars of funds.Last year, MSCI refrained from adding A-shares to its indices.Another issue making investors risk averse is the worry that record low bond yields — the result of central banks’ negative interest rate policies (NIRP) and asset purchase programmes — are distorting the financial system.The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have both introduced NIRP and are buying fixed income products in attempts to bolster economic growth. This has pushed their respective benchmark 10-year government bond yields to record lows of 0.02 per cent, flat on the day, and minus 0.16 per cent, also barely changed.US 10-year Treasuries are down 1 basis point in the session to 1.63 per cent, in line for their lowest close since May 2013, as investors await the Fed’s latest policy decision on Wednesday.The central bank is not expected to change rates, but as ever traders will be very keen to receive any guidance about policy trajectory.At the moment futures markets show that not until the December meeting does the chance of a 25 basis point rate rise move above 50 per cent.The dollar index is easing 0.1 per cent to 94.52, and the softer buck alongside meagre implied borrowing costs is boosting gold, the bullion gaining $8 to $1,282 an ounce.Adding to the yellow metal’s allure is uncertainty over whether the UK may vote to leave the European Union. Polls showing the chances of “Brexit” growing have rattled the currency markets.The pound is down 0.5 per cent to $1.4183, an eight-week low, while the cost of insuring against sterling/dollar volatility has jumped to 28 per cent, just shy of the financial crisis peak.
177;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-13T03:40:52Z;Global sell-off weighs on Asian markets;;Japanese stocks were down sharply and leading Asian markets lower on Monday as a broad global pullback from riskier assets continued in the lead up to the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Wednesday.That has seen investors head for the relative safety of government debt, pushing yields on benchmark bonds in many countries to record lows, alongside a recovery in the US dollar.Japan’s broad Topix was down 2.7 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 fell 2.6 per cent, but both gauges had been down as much as 3 per cent earlier in the session.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 2.6 per cent, while mainland markets traded for the first time since Wednesday after a long weekend. China’s Shanghai Composite was off 0.6 per cent and the technology-focused Shenzhen Composite was down 0.8 per cent. Australia’s stock market was closed for a public holiday.Markets had been trading cautiously through much of last week, but the risk averse tone was evident on Friday as yields on the benchmark 10-year bonds (which move inversely to price) of countries such as Japan, Germany and the UK touched record lows.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.9 per cent lower and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.3 per cent, while in Europe, stocks were down about 2.6 per cent.Investors were still in a glum mood today, with the yield on 10-year JGBs falling to a record low minus 0.158 per cent.The key event for markets this week is the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday. The chances of the central bank raising short-term interest rates this week had grown during May as hawkish policy meeting minutes and commentary from policymakers prompted investors to reassess their bearish bets. But those odds have since been cut to zero after data showed the US created fewer jobs last month than forecast.The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of global peers, was up 0.1 per cent at 94.661 on Monday and on track for its first three-day winning streak since May 20. Gold, which is sensitive to US interest rate expectations, was flat at $1,273.95 an ounce in Asian trade.The yen was 0.7 per cent stronger at ¥106.20 per dollar, its best level since May 3, in spite of the stronger dollar.Chinese data released today showed signs of softness in May. The figures were mostly flat on the previous month, which may shed some light on the muted moves in the Australian dollar, up 0.1 per cent to $0.7382, which is seen as a popular proxy of Chinese growth.“Given today’s data, there is a higher risk for China to miss the growth target of 6.5 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter,” said Raymond Yeung at ANZ Banking Group.China is likely to remain on investors’ radars this week, with a decision expected from MSCI on Tuesday as to whether the index firm will include Chinese stocks in its benchmarks, a move that could influence how global asset managers allocate trillions of dollars of funds. Last year, MSCI refrained from adding A-shares to its indices.Oil markets were weaker, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, down 0.9 per cent at $50.08 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was off 1.2 per cent at $48.48.
178;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-13T01:40:25Z;China’s stock market: an elephant among rabbits;MSCI inclusion or not, China is too big to treat as another emerging market;About 12 months ago, when MSCI last considered including mainland Chinese equities in its emerging markets indices, 90 stocks in the blue-chip CSI300 had more than doubled in value since the start of the year. MSCI decided against it then. But this week, the index provider faces the same decision. Second time around, the debate is no less heated but at least the market is far more tepid: just 20 blue-chips have made any headway at all this year.However, whether or not MSCI gives China the nod is really beside the point — which is that it is already time to consider China as a standalone market in itself.As the world’s second-largest stock market by capitalisation, China is too big to treat as another emerging market. According to Richard Tang, head of international operations at ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management: “Putting China with the other EMs is like looking at an elephant dancing with a bunch of deer and rabbits.” That Chinese elephant already makes up more than a quarter of MSCI’s flagship EM index via stocks listed mostly in Hong Kong and New York. Bunnies include Brazil and Mexico at 6.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent of the index respectively.Were A-shares to be given their full weight, China would account for 39 per cent on the EM index, which is tracked by an estimated $1.5tn worth of funds. Such a heavy China weighting would risk putting it in a similar position to MSCI’s all-country world index, where the US accounts for 53 per cent. In theory, both are good benchmarks for global managers, but in reality few track the ACWI because it is so heavily weighted to one country.Investors need to devote more effort to understanding China. One Asia head of investment reports that colleagues elsewhere are still routinely shocked when they see how poor disclosures are from mainland companies and how little English-language information exists. This will only improve if more people demand it.Similarly, it is unlikely that many fund managers could name those 20 gainers in the CSI 300 this year compared with, say, the S&P 500 leaderboard. But with China’s gradual opening up representing one of the few identifiable long-term market trends, getting ahead of it means getting to know those companies now.jennifer.hughes@ft.com
179;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-12T23:56:44Z;Fast Asia Open: China front and centre;;Before markets focus their attention on the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week, China will be in the spotlight.Firstly, for those playing at home, it was one year ago on June 12 that the Chinese stock market peaked (specifically, a seven-and-a-half year high for the Shanghai Composite and a record high for the Shenzhen Composite) and then entered a bear market.Secondly, a decision is expected on Tuesday from MSCI as to whether the index firm will add Chinese stocks to its benchmarks, a move that could influence how asset managers allocate their funds.But before all that – and in the wake of the IMF warning at the weekend on China’s corporate debt pile – there’s a raft of Chinese economic data to wade through today – retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment – as the country’s market opens for the first time since Wednesday after a long weekend.That also means it might be worth keeping an eye on the renminbi fix this morning. Wednesday was the last time the Chinese central bank fixed the reference rate, and since then the US dollar has strengthened by more than 1 per cent, a move that could see the renminbi weaken relatively sharply this morning.Other Asian markets look set to drop today after a negative lead from Wall Street on Friday, when the S&P 500 closed 0.9 per cent lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent amid a broad pull-back from riskier assets. Investors instead flocked to bonds, pushing yields for benchmark 10-year government debt in the UK, Germany and Japan to record lows.The other key event for markets this week is the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, where the central bank is expected on Wednesday to refrain from raising interest rates after the US economy shed more jobs than expected in May.Futures tip Japan’s Nikkei 225 to fall 1.7 per cent this morning while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is expected to be down 0.7 per cent. The Australian market is shut for a public holiday.Here’s today’s economic calendar (Hong Kong times):
180;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-12T11:32:02Z;How low will yields go: big questions for markets this week;Investors seek yield and safety while expecting no change from central bankers;"These are the key questions we at FT Markets are asking as a new week beckons.What message will central banks deliver?
News that the US economy created 38,000 new jobs in May — the lowest since 2010 — seems to have put the brakes on a US Federal Reserve interest rate rise in June, and possibly July. Expect the Fed to explore in detail whether that jobs number was an outlier and how rising energy costs are impacting inflation. Chair Janet Yellen may also seek to repeat the message of last week’s Philadelphia speech in which she voiced an optimistic outlook on the US economy.In the UK, the Bank of England will probably stress once again the impact of Brexit on the domestic economy, while the Bank of Japan may well use Brexit as an explanation for inaction — unless Governor Kuroda feels like springing a surprise — while laying the ground for easing next time around.How low can government bond yields go?
Bond yields tumbled last week, with Japanese, British and German sovereign benchmarks setting record lows.Investors are seeking the shelter of haven assets as disappointing economic data raises concerns over global growth in markets already dealing with the impact of negative interest rates in Japan and eurozone. Last Wednesday, the European Central Bank began buying corporate bonds — further lowering yields.Next week, three of the world’s major central banks meet, and even without a surprise policy change investors will be studying their messages to glean ideas about where interest rates may go next.How low can European investment grade credit go?
On the eve of the European Central Bank’s corporate bond buying programme last week the average yield on investment grade credit fell below one per cent to a year low.The last time they reached these levels was just before the ECB started buying government bonds, after which the market underwent a sharp sell-off.Investors are wondering whether they will see a repeat of this performance, with yields reverting to a more normal level as the bond buying begins.According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s latest survey of credit investors, 90 per cent put the ECB’s corporate bond buying programme as their main concern, with many paring back bets on highly rated credit. Worries encompass everything from a corporate bond ‘tantrum’ in the near term to the prospect of a credit ‘bubble’ brought on by the central bank.Will MSCI take the plunge on China?
Another year, same question: will MSCI grant China’s A-shares a place in their index universe? China is already the world’s second-largest market by capitalisation and the argument for inclusion looks at the work China has done to open up its markets by widening the quotas it grants foreign investors.The case against notes how China has done rather less to make it easier to get that money back out at will, and the actions taken by authorities last year to halt trading in more than half of A-share companies following a market rout.Foreigners account for less than 2 per cent of the market, analysts estimate, but if the decision is positive, fund managers around the world which track the MSCI EM index will be compelled the buy A-shares included in it.The decision is due at 5am Hong Kong time on Wednesday."
181;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
182;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-08T06:39:21Z;China A shares: ni hao;MSCI is poised to decide on its emerging market universe;"Brush up on your Mandarin, you will be needing it soon. On June 15, index provider MSCI will announce whether Chinese A shares are to be added to its emerging market universe. Currently, only Chinese companies whose shares trade outside China — mostly in Hong Kong and New York — are admissible.This is the second time the decision has come around, but notably different from the first. In late 2014, anticipation that A shares would be included, along with the creation of Stock Connect (a system that allows foreigners to buy Shanghai-listed shares directly from Hong Kong), sent Shanghai A shares up 150 per cent. Since then, the euphoria has evaporated and more than two-thirds of that gain has been given back. There has been little enthusiasm to buy ahead of the ruling this year.Yet it looks more likely than before. China has been working hard to ensure inclusion. MSCI concerns over beneficial ownership, companies’ voluntary suspensions of their stock and quota restrictions have largely been resolved. And on the basis of size, China looks too big to omit. A-shares are the second largest global stock market, accounting for about one-tenth of the world’s capitalisation and, as of the end of March, according to Goldman Sachs, nearly one-quarter of world’s cash equities turnover. Onshore shares will join the emerging markets index eventually.When they do, China’s companies will swamp those of other countries, occupying two-fifths of the index. A shares will be half of that. Investors are not prepared. For now, they may not feel the need. If MSCI admits China next week, there will be a gradual phase in. From June 2017, A shares will be added at just 5 per cent of their market capitalisation; the initial index weighting will be a mere 1 per cent.So, a sigh of relief: no need to learn Mandarin after all. Yet even partial inclusion will add more than 400 China-listed shares to the EM index. With companies’ English-language information scarce, overseas investors will find making informed investment decisions difficult. Even internationally minded Wanda Cinema Lines does not keep its English language website up to date. A recent deal prospectus ran to 356 pages, only in Chinese. Few globally recognised brokerages have the coverage to help. Whether it is this year or next, understanding that EM index is going to get much harder.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
183;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-07T18:56:19Z;EMs regain swagger as Fed rate fears recede;;"Emerging markets assets are regaining some of their swagger.EM currencies and stocks rallied for a third straight day on Tuesday as speculation that the US policymakers will keep interest rates lower for longer reignited investors’ appetite for higher-yielding assets.After a bruising correction in May, EM assets have bounced back in spectacular fashion this month after an unexpectedly weak May US jobs report last week prompted a sharp reversal in expectations on when the next Federal Reserve interest rate increase would take place.The MSCI Emerging Market Index rose 1.8 per cent on Tuesday, its biggest one day gain since March. The rise takes the index’s advance since Friday’s jobs report to 3.5 per cent, enough to almost completely erase the monthly loss recorded in May.EM currencies also got a second wind – with gains further supported by a rebound in global commodity prices, particularly in oil.The JPMorgan Emerging Markets Currency index is up over 2 per cent over the past three sessions and is trading at a near one month high.But can the good times last?David Rees, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said while a June rate rise now looks to be off the table, he still expects US policymakers to increase rates over the next 12 months.…while that alone would be bad for EM equities, they could still receive some support from low valuations, rising commodity prices and improving global conditions – all of which would probably be required for the Fed to tighten by so much.Mr Rees said he expects EM equities to gain by another 15 per cent by the end of 2017 – ahead of the returns it is predicting from equities in Europe and the US.The view was echoed by Paul McNamara and Michael Bigg at GAM, the Swiss investment group, who argued that signs of a pick up in EM growth could provide the fuel for the next leg of the rally.Investors were heavily underweight EM assets at the beginning of the year and, despite the rally, the positioning statistics remain supportive. The rebound in EM growth over the next year is likely to trigger the next leg of the rally for EM assets. The risk of not being involved now is that the growth-related rebound could start even earlier than we anticipate.For every bull though, there is a bear. Indeed, short sellers are already betting that the latest EM rally won’t last. Bearish bets on the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF,

184;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-06-02T18:10:59Z;LSE/Deutsche Börse: stock in trade;Indices show another potentially fruitful area for growth;Clearing, derivatives and cash equity trading have been the themes that have preoccupied investors ahead of the merger of Deutsche Börse and London Stock Exchange. Documents relating to that deal, released on Wednesday, show another potentially fruitful area for growth: indices.MSCI, the nearest thing to a pure-play listed index provider, shows why. Since 2008, its shares have outperformed those of general financials, and it enjoys high margins (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of 70 per cent. Much of that growth is down to the rising popularity of index-tracking investment products. In the past five years, exchange traded fund assets under management have more than doubled, according to consultancy ETFGI. Growth has been particularly strong in the US, where AUM have risen by 18 per cent annually (compared to 12 per cent in Europe) as investors increasingly questioned whether active management delivered on its promises. Index provision is thus good business.In fairness, both LSE and Deutsche Börse had come to this conclusion independently. LSE acquired the remainder of FTSE International in 2011, and added Russell Investments in 2014. Deutsche Börse bought out the other shareholders in Stoxx last year. If the exchange merger proceeds, the combined entity will be the second largest — in terms of ETF assets linked to its indices, and so paying licence fees — after S&P Dow Jones, which dominates owing to its S&P 500.Stoxx’s largest index families mostly cover the European market. LSE’s Russell indices are household names in North America. The two companies think they can add €63m of new revenue annually (10 per cent of the current combined total) after five years by attracting more index-linked assets in Europe and Asia, where Deutsche Börse already operates subsidiaries and a joint venture. ETF AUM in Europe are still well below US levels.Cost savings will still underpin the broader merger economics, but index provision may be a rare instance of “revenue synergies” adding up to some healthy outperformance.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The MSCI World Index is up 14% from its mid-February low, as stocks have shaken off fears of a global recession, an oil-price collapse and a Chinese currency devaluation.Stock valuations are also threatened by a number of “short-term risks” including a premature tightening from the Fed, the chances of a UK exit from the EU, and a further deterioration in Europe’s migration crisis, said Mr Turnhill, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist.He adds:Higher US inflation and hawkish Fed comments have now put a summer rate increase back on the table, increasing investor anxiety and the likelihood of near-term volatility.
186;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-31T10:50:29Z;Bears in charge as MSCI’s decision on China shares looms;Index provider MSCI will decide whether to include China’s A shares against a different backdrop;"It was a year ago that index provider MSCI considered whether to include Chinese domestic-listed A shares in its emerging market indices. The Chinese market was charging ahead, with the Shanghai Composite Index peaking on June 12, two days after MSCI opted not to include the shares.Officials in Beijing sat on the sidelines encouraging the rise, much of it based on borrowed money, while the local media took the euphoria as further confirmation of the ascent of China itself.The mood would quickly shift. After last summer’s crash when over half of all A shares were suspended at one point — and big listed brokerages spent money supporting the market at the request of regulators — the market sits 40 per cent below its peak of last June.Buying with borrowed money is of course like building a house on sand: it is inherently unstable. Meanwhile, official buying to cushion the plunge in the market means that a larger part of the shareholder register is made up of the ever heavier hand of the state, through the China Securities Finance Crop which lent money for the price support operation.The “A share market is walking in the long shadow of the rescue campaign toward normalisation”, Credit Suisse notes in a recent report.Now as the Shanghai market sits 15 per cent lower for 2016, the question over whether the MSCI will include A shares has returned, with a decision expected on June 14.The subdued nature of the debate this year reflects how much has changed. The centre of gravity has swung in favour of pessimists, partly because of the way authorities in Beijing responded to the plunge in the stock market and pressure on the renminbi. Sentiment continues to deteriorate, despite some recent tinkering with market rules.Last year, MSCI’s decision took place against a backdrop of lobbying pressures. On the one hand, major international investment houses such as BlackRock that had laughably small quotas ($1.5bn in BlackRock’s case) were pushing against inclusion. On the other, those who were exposed to China (in part precisely because they anticipated that inclusion would lead to a wave of buying) were strong advocates.Credit Suisse put the chance of rejection at 60 per cent; Morgan Stanley is telling clients the likelihood is 50 per cent, while Goldman is the most bullish with a 70 per cent likelihood of inclusion. Credit Suisse’s view did not stop it coming up with five stock picks that could be beneficiaries in the case of inclusion. Most of them offer exposures to sectors not available in Hong Kong, such as Kweichow Moutai, the maker of that strong alcoholic brew.Even if MSCI does open up its indices, the move will not necessarily lead to a wave of forced buying by those who benchmark against these indices. Indeed, international brokerages estimate the buying will add up to no more than $16.5bn, or a mere 0.2 per cent of total market capitalisation of the A shares.Another development next month could be the extension of the stock connect scheme — a mechanism introduced in 2014 that gives all international investors access to A shares. It is currently limited to Shanghai and Hong Kong but may be extended to Shenzhen. That too, though, is likely to prove incremental.Today, few strategists would make the argument that share prices in China are a great buying opportunity. There are big question marks over huge swaths of the economy, led by banks whose problem loan figures are questionable and unlikely to improve even if the central bank lowers interest rates. The structural reform that could cut capacity dramatically and bring real profitability to state-owned enterprises seems to have been postponed. A weak currency also limits the attraction of the market to foreigners.In the past, the economy and the market seemed disconnected. Now they are moving together — with both emitting signals of gloom, if not outright distress. Whatever MSCI decides won’t change that."
187;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-31T07:12:25Z;China stocks jump over 3% on MSCI speculation;;Chinese stocks carved out their biggest gain in two months amid speculation that A-shares could be included in MSCI’s global benchmarks.The Shanghai Composite ended 3.4 per cent higher, while the technology-focused Shenzhen Composite gained 4.1 per cent, the biggest one-day advance for both indices since March 2, writes Peter Wells.The CSI 300, an index comprising the top 300 stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, ended 3.3 per cent higher, also the biggest rise since March 2.It was the second-best session this year for Shanghai stocks and the CSI 300, and the third-best session for Shenzhen.There was even some excitement earlier in the day for futures tracking the CSI 300. At 10.41am Hong Kong time, the futures market plunged as much as 10 per cent – the daily limit – before recovering almost immediately in what appears to be a “fat finger” trade.Chinese markets have in general, been quiet of late, with the Shanghai Composite trading in roughly a 300 point range over the past two months. But there’s some speculation that Chinese shares may be included in MSCI’s emerging markets indices, which is prompting some opportunistic buying ahead of that potential decision.Today, Goldman Sachs upgraded the odds of A-shares being included in the MSCI indices to 70 per cent, from the 50 per cent chance it had given it on April 25. The bank said two recent developments boosted the probability.On May 6, the CSRC clarified its stance on beneficial ownership of securities through nominee holder, officially recognizing that “A QFII may apply to the securities registration and settlement institution for opening a securities account, in the name of actual holders or nominee holder.”On May 27, the CSRC, together with the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges published detailed guidelines to regulate and curb voluntary stock suspension in the A-share market.The MSCI decision is due on June 15. Last year, the index provider chose not to include A-shares in its global benchmarks, only a few days before the Chinese stock market peaked and then capitulated over the summer.
188;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-25T16:14:47Z;South Korea equities: we won more;The country’s companies should pay higher dividends;"South Korean companies make a lot of great products. One thing they do not make is happy shareholders. Never mind that MSCI’s Korea index has put in a decent performance relative to the broader emerging market index over the past five years, outpacing it by about 6 per cent. EM portfolio managers still prefer other Asian markets. One likely reason: Korean companies’ parsimony when it comes to returning excess capital.An average EM portfolio holds only about two-thirds of the 15 per cent Korea weighting of the MSCI emerging markets index, according to Credit Suisse. That figure has diminished over the years. Foreign investors in particular have moaned about corporate governance at the big industrial conglomerates. A battle between Samsung’s Cheil Industries and Elliot Associates last summer was one such flare up.More to the point, almost all the companies could pay out more. Extra cash flow has built up in Korean companies since 2008. One measure of this, free cash yield (free cash flow as a proportion of market value) should hit 8 per cent for companies in the Korean index this year, the highest in over a decade. Why not put the spare income into shareholders’ pockets? Korean companies tend not to pay out much of their earnings — about a fifth. That is the lowest in the emerging markets and worse than average for Asia. Dividend yields on Korean shares have not risen much above 2 per cent this millennium.Korean shares could face pressure on another front as well. The make-up of the EM index could change in the year ahead. MSCI, still the key benchmark, has debated whether to add China A shares (from Shanghai and Shenzhen) to its EM index; it will decide on 14 June. While inclusion would not happen all at once, China’s weighting would rise over time, sinking those of the largest Asia markets such as South Korea and Taiwan. All this when Korean forward earnings growth has slowed to low single digits for the first time in seven years, according to UBS.Korean companies can afford to take better care of shareholders. Payouts should rise.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
189;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-25T10:43:27Z;MSCI’s China A-share decision hangs in the balance;;By Ken Wong, Eastspring InvestmentsThere is an even chance that, this summer, China’s A-shares will be included for the first time in a key emerging market investment index operated by MSCI, the index provider. If it happens, it will be a welcome development, for the simple reason that it will make the benchmark a more accurate reflection of the emerging market corporate universe.While the immediate impact of inclusion would be quite small, the longer-run potential for A-shares – which are the stocks of companies listed inside mainland China – to grow in importance within the index is enormous.Two obstacles to inclusion have been largely removed – reforms to a quota system on investment inflows from abroad and a shortening of the delay in repatriating capital out of China.But one roadblock remains. The lack of transparency in the A-shares market, in particular the repeated suspension of trading by companies, undermines the attractiveness of A-shares to overseas investors.But if this problem can be mitigated, if not entirely erased, then the A-shares’ inclusion in this key benchmark would be another milestone on the road to integrating China’s financial markets into the global system.A symbolic stage in this process was reached in December, when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the renminbi would join the elite basket – the dollar, the euro, the yen and sterling – that underpins the Special Drawing Rights that serve as the IMF’s in-house currency.Progress in liberalising China’s foreign exchange markets have, of necessity, gone hand in hand with the opening up of stock market investment in what is the world’s second-largest economy. It is easy to forget how quickly China has come in how short a time. From the Communist party revolution in 1949 until 1990, the once-bustling Shanghai stock exchange was moribund. After a slow start, interest has burgeoned.The system of A and B shares evolved to try to tap a foreign appetite for exposure to China’s growth story while at the same time protecting both the domestic equity base and the interests of Chinese investors. While B-shares, denominated in foreign currency, were available to outsiders, the renminbi-priced A-shares could be only be bought by Chinese investors. Latterly, foreign investors were also allowed into the A-share market largely through two quota-based schemes, which permitted Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) and Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) – both of which had to apply for permissions from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).As of February, this regime has been significantly liberalised, with SAFE operating a new scheme based on the size of QFIIs’ assets under management and the ceiling for each quota has been lifted from $1bn to $5bn.If this partially addressed one concern about the A-share market, another – the length of time involved in repatriating funds – was also eased by SAFE’s declaration that QFIIs would be eligible for repatriation after three months instead of one year. All this ought to weigh favourably with MSCI when it makes its decision in June. But the lack of transparency will weigh on the opposite side of the scales.During market turbulence in July last year, more than 1,400 companies were allowed to suspend trading in their A-shares. Companies should not be able simply to say they would like to suspend trading and then to do so, but that is what is happening currently and it needs to change.What is also needed is a firm date for the launch of the “Stock Connect” program between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Such a link is already in place between Shanghai and Hong Kong, so Hong Kong investors can buy Shanghai A-shares via Hong Kong, however they currently cannot buy Shenzhen A-shares. “Stock Connect” would allow investors to buy Shenzhen A-shares via Hong Kong without needing a quota. This in turn would mean more balanced investment portfolios, given that Shanghai has many of the “mega-cap” stocks while Shenzhen lists a lot of tech companies.The chances of MSCI including its A-share index in the Emerging Markets Index are currently, in our view, about 50-50. MSCI talks to fund managers and takes the temperature of market opinion, but ultimately it is a decision for the relevant research committee.Inclusion is the right course of action: even if the immediate impact could be small, it should be remembered that A-shares already account for 10 per cent of the world's market capitalisation and about 25 per cent of the world's total market turnover. Despite this, currently China has only 2.4 per cent exposure in MSCI All Country World Index while China currently represents about 13 per cent of the world's gross domestic product.This would be yet another step in the right direction, in terms of integrating China into global financial markets.Ken Wong, Client Portfolio Manager at Eastspring InvestmentsBack to beyondbrics
190;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-24T14:51:57Z;Pakistan closes in on MSCI upgrade;Promotion to emerging market status could prompt funds outflow;For a country so used to bad news, Pakistan has in many respects fared reasonably well in recent years.Terrorism-related deaths have fallen 74 per cent from their 2010 peak, economic growth has accelerated to a solid 4.5 per cent, inflation has fallen sharply to around 3.3 per cent and the fiscal deficit has narrowed markedly to around 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product.Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, an emerging market-focused investment bank, says, on a per capita basis, the likelihood of being killed by a gun in the US is now higher than that of dying as a result of terrorism in Pakistan.But now the country may be about to be get some potentially bad news — an upgrade from frontier to emerging market status by MSCI.The index provider is due to rule on whether Pakistan has done enough to be promoted to EM status on June 14. And while this would be seen by many as a feather in Pakistan’s cap, at least one analyst believes it would have a sting in its tail — a partial exodus by foreign investors.Pakistan currently has a weight of 8.8 per cent in the MSCI Frontier index (making it the fourth largest country after Kuwait, Argentina and Nigeria) but is only likely to account for around 0.19 per cent of admittedly much more widely followed MSCI EM index if promoted.As a result, Hasnain Malik, regional head of frontier markets equity strategy at Exotix Partners, an investment bank focused on smaller markets, believes that, in theory at least, “in terms of potential funds flow, the ‘upgrade’ to MSCI EM would be a negative event”.Admittedly, Mr Malik says this calculation is based on a “simplistic” assumption that all frontier funds currently holding Pakistani stocks would sell as the new wave of EM funds moves in, which may or may not happen.Others disagree, however, believing that an upgraded Pakistan would attract net inflows from foreign funds, even though it would have the second-lowest weighting in the 24-nation MSCI EM index, above only the Czech Republic.“Frontier funds are quite index agnostic and I believe would be in no hurry at all to sell,” says Daniel Salter, head of emerging market equity strategy at Renaissance Capital. “They are often able to hold off-index countries such as Saudi, UAE, Qatar and Egypt.”When it comes to attracting fresh cash from actively managed EM funds, which of course would not need to buy even in the event of Pakistan’s promotion, Mr Salter believes their nose for a bargain will play a role.The MSCI Pakistan index currently trades at 8.9 times 12-months’ forward earnings, according to Bloomberg estimates, below the 9.7 times of the Frontier market as a whole, the 11.3 times of the MSCI EM index and the 16.7 times of neighbouring India, as the first chart shows.Among existing constituents of the EM index, only Russia and Turkey are cheaper.Moreover, liquidity is decent. The $80m daily turnover of the Karachi stock exchange renders Pakistan the second-most liquid market in the frontier world, Mr Salter says.On the downside, though, actively managed funds benchmarked to the MSCI Frontier index are currently very overweight Pakistan, according to data provider EPFR, as the second chart shows.This potentially strengthens the argument that Pakistan could witness significant selling if it is upgraded, although as the chart also shows, some frontier funds are happy to invest in the UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are no longer in their universe.Renaissance Capital estimates that a promoted Pakistan would attract $675m of money from actively and passively managed EM funds, outweighing the $570m it estimates actively managed frontier funds hold. Exotix Partners puts the latter figure at anywhere between $1.8bn and $4.4bn.The general consensus appears to be that Pakistan will be reclassified by MSCI next month, with the upgrade coming into effect at the end of May 2017.“Our assessment is that, based on the number, size and liquidity of stocks, Pakistan should qualify to enter the EM Index, and that market accessibility is also sufficient,” says Mr Salter.While there are still shortcomings around stock lending, short selling and the stability of the country’s institutional framework, Mr Salter says, these deficiencies are shared by some countries that have been admitted to EM status, such as Chile, Russia and Greece.Mr Malik notes that MSCI itself has commented on Pakistan’s institutional improvements, in areas such as reporting and compliance, and improved liquidity.Mr Malik adds that compared with previous upgrades, “MSCI’s public consultation papers appear more specific in terms of simulating a list of stocks for inclusion and the implied country weight”.Nevertheless, he fears that the index provider could be faced with the “commercial reality” that the frontier index could become “excessively weighted towards Kuwait [20 per cent of the index] and Argentina [14 per cent]” should Pakistan be upgraded, particularly given the ongoing doubts about the status of Nigeria, the index third-largest constituent, with a weighting of 13 per cent, which is at risk of ejection due to its imposition of capital controls.More broadly, Mr Malik argues the whole debate reflects a degree of “dissatisfaction” with the selection criteria for the Frontier index.He says most investors want an index focused on frontier countries, that is those in an early stage of development or with low sector diversification. Instead, he says, the MSCI index focuses on countries whose stock markets are at an early stage of development.“They recognise that MSCI has a difficult job, but no one meeting a fund allocator ever says ‘buy my fund because I’m 20 per cent invested in Kuwait’.”
191;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Funds cool on China A-shares as key index decision looms;Dwindling enthusiasm for the equities ahead of MSCI’s judgment over emerging markets inclusion;A dichotomy has opened up in investor attitudes towards China’s A-shares ahead of a key decision by MSCI, the index provider, on whether to include some of them in its benchmark emerging markets index.Foreign funds that invest through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme and Chinese mutual funds exhibited dwindling enthusiasm for A-shares in the quarter to March 31 this year, according to Wind Information, a data provider.However, participants in the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, a channel opened last year that gives international retail investors access to A-shares, put a net Rmb13bn ($2bn) into A-shares in the quarter, according to estimates by Wind.A decision by MSCI on whether or not to include 5 per cent of A-share listed companies into the influential MSCI Emerging Markets index is expected on June 14. If the decision is positive, it would compel fund managers that track the EM index to buy the A-shares that are components of it. This change would then take effect in June 2017.The findings of MSCI’s ongoing industry consultation on the possible inclusion of A-shares are not yet known. While MSCI has said it was keen at some point to bring A-shares into its benchmark EM index, impediments are thought to include the accessibility of A-shares to overseas investors, particularly in light of the suspension in trading last year of shares in more than 50 per cent of A-share companies as Chinese authorities struggled to contain a share price rout.Judging by investment flows, it would appear that funds both inside and outside China have scant expectations that MSCI will decide in June to include A-shares into the EM index. Allocations made by domestic funds to A-shares dropped steadily in the year to end-March, as the first chart shows.This translated into a decline in the number of companies held by domestic funds to 2,321 at the end of March, down by 450 from the end of December last year, according to Wind data. Allocations to bonds by domestic funds took up most of the slack as equity holdings dwindled, the data show.The waning enthusiasm for A-shares was also evident among overseas funds that participate in the QFII scheme. Although the quota allocated to QFII funds continues to rise, the utilisation of that quota declined to less than half its recent peak in 2012, as the second chart shows, while overall holdings have failed to bounce back significantly after last year’s rout.Investors accessing A-shares through the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, which is the main route into mainland China equities for international retail investors, seemed to take a more positive attitude towards the prospects for A-shares.As the third chart shows, the main beneficiaries of the inflows have included several well-known Chinese companies, which would be candidates to be selected as part of the 5 per cent of listed companies chosen for MSCI’s EM index inclusion.While Chinese mutual funds have been easing back on A-share holdings, the so-called national team — big state funds that stabilised the market after last year’s rout — appear to be broadly keeping the faith, according to Wind data.The China Securities Finance Corp, a state-owned institution that sprung into prominence in mid-2015 as it injected capital into the ailing market, scaled back the number of stocks it held to 485 by the end of March, down from 509 at the end of 2015 and 742 at the end of September last year.However, the level of overall state support remains broadly stable, with the state-owned Central Huijin Asset Management holding 1,070 shares at the end of March, up from 1,021 at the end of 2015. Over the same period, the holdings of its parent, Central Huijin Investment, slipped from 29 to 19.The continued support of the national team appeared to be consistent with the will of Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, who told journalists in March that the government was justified in launching last year’s strenuous market rescue to ward off the risks of a systemic crisis.He said the move had bought the government more time to restore a “dysfunctional” market. The question now is whether MSCI feels the market is functional enough to include a portion of A-shares into its EM index.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd

But the stock’s unusual trading patterns and related transactions also attracted the attention of short sellers who bet that it would be unable to sustain its climb.On May 20, 2015, the stock plunged by 47 percent in half an hour and wiped out $19bn in value. The exchange’s trading halt is still in effect, trapping any short sellers who were unable to close their positions. Following the debacle, leading index provider MSCI changed its rules to filter companies, like Hanergy, that the Hong Kong regulator had flagged for over-concentration of shareholding.Exactly one year later, Hanergy said Mr Li had resigned as chairman of the board and executive director of the listed company “for the reason of strengthening corporate governance” following the annual board meeting on Friday. His right-hand man, Frank Dai Mingfang, also resigned, “for the reason of focusing on other business development.”In the year since the stock trading halt, Mr Li has remained a conspicuous promoter of thin film solar power, the light-weight technology that Hanergy embraced despite its lower efficiency ratios than other solar power panels. Hanergy most recently announced a press conference on solar powered cars for early June, then abruptly rescheduled it to July “to avoid disrupting the national college entrance exams.”He has also engaged in an angry battle with the Hong Kong exchange to resume trading. Meanwhile, Hanergy has announced the disintegration of complicated stock for loan deals Mr Li sealed with companies including MacroLink, a private property company that is also the world’s largest producer of refrigerants, and Baota, a “teapot” refinery and petrochemical producer in the western deserts.Hanergy’s woes have touched a number of Chinese banks, notably Bank of Jinzhou which listed in Hong Kong last year. Other Chinese financial institutions that have lent to Hanergy have never revealed the extent of their exposure.Mr Li’s successor as head of the listed company, Yuan Yabin, provides a reminder of the political connections the company enjoys. Mr Yuan formerly worked in the national committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the Chinese government and ruling Communist Party. Mr Li is a representative to the CPPCC.
193;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-11T03:01:50Z;China gets tougher on environmental violations;China’s rising penalties on environmental offenders show a tougher stance in the new five-year plan;China imposed stiffer punishments on companies that violated environmental laws last year, according to new research that illustrates Beijing’s growing resolve to push through aspects of a greener social agenda.The research, conducted by financial index provider MSCI, recorded a near doubling in the cost of environmental penalties on selected companies in 2015 compared with the previous year and a near tripling in the likelihood that punitive action would be taken against offenders.The study covered 155 Chinese companies that are constituents of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.The findings correspond with Beijing’s policy — evident in the Five-Year Plan covering the period from 2016 to 2020 — to combat an environmental crisis that has made China the world’s biggest carbon emitter, driven air quality in many cities to below minimum international health standards and aroused virulent public discontent.Emily Chew, vice-president of MSCI (Hong Kong), said the research showed China’s regulators were taking a more aggressive stance against polluters as official determination to repair the country’s environment builds. “What I think is really interesting in the 13th five-year plan is that you really see this intention toward green development interwoven throughout,” Ms Chew said.Since a new Environmental Protection Law came into force in January last year, the proportion of cases involving the 155 companies leading to punishment has surged along with the total cost of the punishments, which rose to Rmb4.2m ($644,000) from Rmb2.2m in 2014.Ms Chew said the costs of the penalties remained too small to really “bite” corporate violators, but the trend was nevertheless indicative of Beijing’s desire to tighten supervision over environmental issues.With the new law abolishing ceilings on environmental fines and NGOs empowered to initiate public interest lawsuits, the MSCI report predicts that the size of penalties is likely to increase over time.On a nationwide basis, China punished 25,164 environmental offenders in the first half of last year, fining them more than Rmb230m and transferring 740 cases to the police for criminal investigations, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has said. The ministry did not give comparative numbers for 2014.However, green consciousness remains conspicuously lacking, even among the relatively sophisticated 155 Chinese companies with overseas listings that are included in MSCI’s EM index. For example, only 6 per cent of these companies publicly disclose their carbon emissions, compared with 32 per cent of all MSCI EM constituents.The Five-Year Plan, which was formally adopted in March this year after a lengthy consultative drafting process, identifies new energy vehicles as one of the 10 priority strategic industries that Beijing has earmarked for significant investments.According to the official target, China aims to sell 5m pure electric and hybrid plug-in vehicles a year by 2020, up from 330,000 in 2015. This highly ambitious target looks unlikely to be met, even though new energy vehicle sales grew four times year-on-year in 2014 and 3.4 times year-on-year in 2015, Ms Chew said. If current trends continue, new energy vehicles may rise to around 1.75m in 2020, according to MSCI research.Behind the ambitious projections, Beijing is putting into force higher standards for new energy vehicles to qualify for 2016 subsidies — such as requiring cars to be able to run for 100km on a single battery charge and a maximum speed of no less than 100km/h.Thus those companies at the technological cutting edge are set to benefit, potentially favouring Dongfeng Motor, which has 38 different types of new energy vehicles on the subsidy list, putting it in a good position to challenge the market leader, BYD.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd

195;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-05-08T09:02:44Z;When markets ignore vital warning signs;Analysts knew about VW governance flaws;Four months before news broke that Volkswagen had cheated in US emissions tests, ratings and index provider MSCI signalled that all was not well at the German carmaker.The auto company had long been a component of a popular MSCI index used by investors to gain exposure to global companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.But in May 2015 VW was dropped from the MSCI ACWI ESG Index, chiefly due to corporate governance issues. MSCI ranked the carmaker’s governance — assessing factors such as board independence, executive pay and accounting standards — as worse than 72 per cent of companies globally. It was an exceptionally low rating for a large, well-known company located in a developed economy.VW’s governance score at MSCI had been falling since 2014, on the back of public arguments between then chairman Ferdinand Piëch, whose family controls a large voting stake in the company, and former chief executive Martin Winterkorn. It culminated in Mr Piëch resigning last April. Mr Winterkorn later quit in the wake of the emissions scandal.MSCI said the power struggle at the company raised questions about the effectiveness and stability of VW’s management. The index provider also had wider concerns about a lack of independent directors at the company, the Piëch family’s control of the business and the fact that some shareholders held stock with no voting rights.MSCI was not the only company highlighting governance concerns about VW at the time. At Sustainalytics, which rates companies based on ESG factors, VW ranked in the bottom quartile of businesses globally when it came to governance. Vigeo, the French agency that provides corporate responsibility analysis to investors, also ranked VW far below its peers before the scandal broke.The warnings, however, did little to deter investors and many saw their holdings fall in value as the share price dropped nearly 40 per cent in the weeks after the scandal emerged. “The risks that were embedded within those governance concerns [at VW] weren’t sufficiently appreciated by the market,” says Gary Hewitt, director of corporate governance research at Sustainalytics.ESG research agencies have long lists of companies where they had flagged governance concerns before larger problems emerged. These include Svenska Cellulosa, the Swedish company that was embroiled in a scandal last year over the use of private jets, and ITT Educational Services, which the US regulator has charged with fraud.Investors who were not bothered about governance in the past, now pay it more attentionThese warnings and subsequent scandals have led to questions about whether or not investors take corporate governance risks seriously enough.Neville White, head of socially responsible investment policy at UK asset manager EdenTree, says: “Investors are looking for a range of things when they decide to go into a company or not, and corporate governance is not high enough up that list.” Ian Simm, chief executive of Impax Asset Management, the £3.6bn fund house, adds: “Many asset managers do not take governance seriously enough. Governance should be right at the heart of the investment decision. If you buy a car and you just look at the paintwork rather than the engine, you are taking a real risk.”With VW, some asset managers point out that they were aware of the governance problems MSCI and others were highlighting, such as a lack of board independence, and had already factored these issues into their decision-making process. “[The governance concerns at VW] were understood and priced in by a lot of investors,” says Josh Kendall, ESG analyst at Insight Investment.Others argue that despite the bad governance ratings, many providers of ESG research had given VW a good score when it came to environmental issues. The argument is that, like many investors, the ESG rating agencies had not expected a large-scale environmental scandal.The German carmaker is engulfed in the worst scandal in its 78-year history after it admitted to manipulating emissions test data on its diesel vehicles in the US and Europe. The deepening crisis has wiped billions of euros off the company’s shares and rocked the European car industry.But this misses the point, says Mr Hewitt. The fact that VW had governance issues meant it was more likely to suffer other problems throughout its business, he says: “You can’t know that someone is going to commit catastrophic fraud, but if a company has the types of governance patterns we saw at VW, the risks of wider problems is higher.”More investors are waking up to the implications of governance for a company’s performance, says Howard Sherman, head of corporate governance at MSCI. “I have seen a lot of investors who were not bothered about corporate governance in the past, but they are now paying it much more attention,” he adds.He believes, however, that many asset managers are likely to struggle to factor governance concerns into their investment process. He says the research produced by brokers and investment banks, which asset managers typically rely on when investing, focuses heavily on finance, but rarely takes account of governance.Hans-Christoph Hirt, executive director at Hermes EOS, which engages with company boards on behalf of institutional investors, adds: “It is often possible to pick up signs [of potential future problems at a business], but this will most likely require investment in dedicated resource and some interaction with the company concerned.”
196;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;MSCI Peru ruling threatens to unbalance Frontier index;Fears the move would drive foreign investment away from $67bn bourse;An impending ruling on whether Peru should be demoted from MSCI’s influential Emerging Markets equity index to its lower tier Frontier benchmark might seem an esoteric matter of little wider import.But, as so often in a world where most money is either managed passively or by active managers who hew closely to their benchmarks, even a seemingly small index reshuffle matters.The Peruvian stock exchange fears that the move would drive foreign investment away from its $67bn bourse. Moreover, the move would further unbalance the MSCI Frontier index and potentially divert much-needed foreign investment from countries such as Nigeria, Argentina and Pakistan.“It may seem like linguistics, but the index designation is important in terms of retaining and attracting foreign investor assets,” says Mark Mobius, executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, who believes foreign investors are responsible for roughly a third of Peru’s trading volume.MSCI launched a consultation on Peru’s potential ejection from its flagship EM index — tracked by an estimated $1.5tn, against just $12bn for the Frontier equivalent — in August last year.At the time the index provider said it planned to make a decision within a month. That its deadline has since been put back to June this year is an indication of its contentiousness.MSCI’s concern was that only three stocks in its Peru equity universe meet its liquidity and free float requirements, the minimum number to be eligible for its EM index.The first chart illustrates the decline in Peru’s trading volumes, which have long lagged behind those of several of its Latin American peers.Compounding the problem, MSCI has proposed switching Southern Copper, one of these three stocks, to its US equity universe, where it is listed (it is currently included in the Peruvian section for “historical and index continuity reasons” and generates 43 per cent of its revenues from Peru, with the remainder from Mexico), pushing Peru below the minimum threshold.In contrast, if Peru was demoted to frontier status, the more lenient size and coverage requirements in that universe would allow eight of its stocks to enter the Frontier index, MSCI says.This in turn would create its own dilemmas, however. MSCI calculated in August that a demoted Peru would become the second largest country in its Frontier index (behind Kuwait), with a weighting of 12.8 per cent.If investors do not allocate more money to frontier markets as a result of a Peruvian demotion, the existing countries in this index would be likely to lose 12.8 per cent of their existing foreign investment tied to the frontier benchmark.The biggest losers from this are likely to be Nigeria, Argentina and Pakistan, as the table shows.“The money will have to come from somewhere. That could put some pressure on some markets,” says Thomas Vester, chief investment officer of Lloyd George Management and manager of the BMO LGM Frontier Markets Equity fund.In addition Credicorp, a bank, insurer and asset manager that is Peru’s largest stock, would also become, by some distance, the largest stock in the Frontier index.MSCI calculated in August that it would have a weighting of 9.1 per cent, dwarfing the next largest stock, National Bank of Kuwait, which has a current weighting of 6.7 per cent. A recent rally in the stock suggests its weighting would be greater still.“Credicorp would be about 10 per cent of the frontier market. Would you really want that?” asks Will Landers, senior portfolio manager of the BlackRock Latin American investment trust.Moreover, the addition of Credicorp would arguably further unbalance an already skewed benchmark.As of March 31, financial stocks already accounted for 52.3 per cent of the Frontier index, with telecoms, the next largest sector, at 13.7 per cent. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks, arguably a key attraction for foreign investors seeking to tap into spending growth, accounted for just a combined 9.4 per cent.Given that Credicorp would comprise 49 per cent of the Peruvian stock market capitalisation injected into the Frontier index, according to MSCI’s August calculation, the weighting of financials would rise still further, at the expense of every other sector.A presentation by the Lima stock exchange suggests financials would represent 54 to 58 per cent of the Frontier index if Peru is demoted.Mr Vester believes this would be problematic, particularly given that “many [frontier] countries are resource dependent, so banks are very much [about] commodity exposure in these countries. That is really starting to show up, we have seen some pretty horrible numbers come out of the banks in Nigeria.“It has a very high weight in financials and Peru would only make it higher,” adds Mr Vester, although he is able and willing to take enough benchmark risk to have a 20-30 per cent exposure to consumer stocks.Even though Peru is another commodity-focused country, at least Credicorp is popular. One of the reasons behind the delay in MSCI’s ruling is believed to be that EM investors are fighting to keep it in their universe.Peru has not taken this potential slight laying down. The government and stock exchange have come together to push through a series of reforms in an attempt to bolster trading volumes.These include eliminating capital gains tax on many transactions and improving the environment for stock lending, short selling and algorithmic trading. Five stocks now have market makers, up from just one at the end of 2015.“Peru is taking actions to lure foreign investors. These actions include a 10-year plan to make Peru a financial hub in Latin America, as well as tax reforms that are more investor friendly,” says Mr Mobius.The stock exchange says trading volumes have stabilised and “should improve”. Nevertheless Christian Laub, chairman of the exchange, fears that EM investors would withdraw $1.5bn from Peru in the event of demotion, and that it would take seven to 10 years for the country to return to the EM index.Some believe Peru’s rearguard action will be enough to stay MSCI’s hand.“We have noticed what Peru has done. They have taken a very proactive stance. Our sense from MSCI is that they have noted it, so we are not certain that they will be downgraded,” says Mr Vester, who has already gone “off-piste” to buy two Peruvian stocks for his frontier fund, but hopes the country retains its EM status.Some are more relaxed about the situation. Daniel Salter, head of emerging market equity strategy at Renaissance Capital, says frontier investors “pay a lot less attention to their benchmark” than EM investors do, meaning most will have the freedom to, say, significantly underweight financial stocks.In addition “little” passive money tracks the frontier world. The iShares MSCI Frontier 100 ETF, for instance, had assets of just $420m as of March 31.Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, says that whatever happens, Peruvian companies “do not go away”, and if the country was demoted “there may be an additional liquidity premium to be harvested for any investor who is not hamstrung by an index”.“As far as I am concerned, the quality of names in the frontier space would go up [with demotion] as would diversification. If it goes ahead — and it is still an if — then maybe it will be one more case for rotating from broad to frontier investments, a switch I actually quite like, not least because I like Peru,” Mr Dehn adds.Additional reporting by Jonathan WheatleyFollow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
197;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-04-25T16:15:46Z;GE Money: bouncy Czechs;The US group’s local subsidiary is a profitable, growing bank with a valuation to match;Falling profitability, negative interest rates, middling-to-rubbish economic growth, a 13 per cent decline in the benchmark MSCI banks index this year. All good reasons not to invest in European banks. None of them applies to the Czech Republic, where General Electric has announced plans to list a majority stake in its local banking arm, GE Money, the country’s sixth-biggest lender by assets.The Czech economy, growing at 2.7 per cent, is one of the strongest in the EU. Demand for loans is buoyant, with household lending having increased nearly a third since 2010, according to the central bank. Non-performing loans are a low single-digit percentage of the total.GE Money has plenty to crow about. Western rivals will eye its 16.5 per cent return on tangible equity with envy. A core tier one capital ratio of 17.7 per cent is well in excess of the regional average. A pledge to pay out at least 70 per cent of post-tax profits is red meat to yield-starved investors.It is not, however, immune to the eurozone’s woes. A net interest margin of 6.7 per cent would induce drooling from most European bank chiefs — but two years ago it stood at 7.5 per cent. Fees have plunged by a quarter because of a shift to free current accounts. A cost-to-income ratio of 45 per cent compares well with competitors but has risen five percentage points since 2013.Local banks confirm the impression of a challenged outlook. Ceská spořitelna, owned by Austria’s Erste and the largest bank by assets, posted a 6 per cent decline in 2015 operating profits as low rates weighed on income.GE Money wants to use its retail-focused branch network to move into small business lending, which has higher margins and barriers to entry. The midpoint of the offer range is CZK 76.5 per share, implying a price above 1.5 times tangible book value, twice the European average. Erste has a locally-listed subsidiary on just 1. Even in a healthy economy, the premium leaves little room for downside.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
198;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-04-17T09:06:21Z;Berkshire Hathaway and Coke boards face investor pressure;LGIM and Aberdeen will vote against ‘stale’ long-serving directors;Berkshire Hathaway and Coca-Cola are among a number of large US companies that will come under pressure from two of Europe’s biggest investors over the composition of their boards.Legal & General Investment Management and Aberdeen Asset Management, two of the UK’s largest asset management companies, will begin voting against company directors who have held board seats for more than 15 years.This will pose problems for the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett, and Coca-Cola, the fizzy-drinks manufacturer. Both companies have three board directors who have served for more than 15 years, according to MSCI, the data provider.Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen, said: “We have a clear view that people go a bit stale and that you need refreshment on boards.“There are some extraordinary situations where substantial portions of the board have been in place for 20 years and much more. We will vote against these non-executive directors.”The fear among a growing number of institutional investors is that entrenched boards lack independent thinking, increasing the likelihood of bad decision-making on issues such as technological or regulatory change.Across the S&P 500, more than 100 companies have an “independent” board director who has served for 25 years or more.Ric Marshall, corporate governance expert at MSCI, added that the tendency for directors to remain in place for decades has contributed to the lack of board diversity in the US, where women account for one-fifth of board positions.He said: “US boards have been pale, male and stale for a long time. The fact there has been such little change is really distressing. There is huge resistance to change, but the US economy would be healthier if we had greater [board] diversity.”To address the issue, LGIM has contacted 100 companies in the US about the lengthy tenure of some of their directors. From 2017, the £746bn asset manager will start voting against US board members who have important roles and have served for more than 15 years.Clare Payn, head of corporate governance in North America at LGIM, said: “There are companies that have a real problem with board succession. [Lack of] board refreshment not only stunts diversity but also the diversity of skill sets [on issues such as] cyber crime and environmental [risk].”Aberdeen plans to vote against non-executive directors who have sat on the board for more than 20 years from this year. Directors who have been in place for more than 15 years also face being rejected by the Scottish group, depending on the company’s efforts to improve board diversity.Nearly a fifth of the directorships in the S&P 1500 are held by individuals who are 68 or older and have served on the board for at least 10 years, according to consultancy EY.Under UK corporate governance guidelines, directors are not considered independent after nine years of service, unless the company can provide a strong reason for retaining them on the board.In Hong Kong, companies appointing an independent director who has served for more than nine years must allow shareholders to vote on that appointment through a special resolution.
199;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-04-15T16:46:24Z;Pro-LGBT stocks tend to outperform – Credit Suisse;;Diversification is known as the only “free lunch” in markets. And it turns out that markets might actually reward diversity as well.Following on from research that shows that the shares of companies with at least one female director perform better over time, Credit Suisse’s equity analysts have constructed a basket of 270 companies that embrace pro-lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender policies, and looked at how well they do, reports Robin Wigglesworth in New York.Over the past six years it turns out that the “LGBT basket” has outperformed the MSCI All Country World Index by 3 per cent a year. Against a custom basket of companies in North America, Europe and Australia the LGBT basket outperformed by 140 basis points annually. Here’s the chart:The basket was constructed by finding companies that either have openly LGBT leaders and senior management, that are voted as leading LGBT employers in surveys by rights groups like Stonewall, or those that have many employees in local LGBT business networks. As Credit Suisse wrote in the report:Our hypothesis continues to be that diversity brings financial benefits to organisations and investors…. As usual in this field of research, we can only draw associations, not causality. Do better companies have better LGBT policies and attract more LGBT employees or do LGBT employees make companies better? Probably both.Unsurprisingly, nearly 60 per cent of the companies in the LGBT index – weighted by market capitalisation – are in the technology, financial and consumer industries. The single biggest component is the information technology industry.
200;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-04-15T15:22:36Z;Even the best chief executives are not worth megabucks;Steve Johnson looks at the thorny issue of pay;"The thorny issue of pay is, once again, back on the news agenda.BP, the oil major, has become the latest company to attract investor ire over executive pay, with a majority of those voting at last week’s AGM opposing the 20 per cent pay rise handed to Bob Dudley, the chief executive. This takes his remuneration to $19.6m — 125 times more than that of the average BP worker.Maybe BP’s remuneration committee thought Mr Dudley needed cheering up, given the company reported its largest ever annual loss, of $5.2bn, in February, and outlined plans for 7,000 redundancies.It is a fair bet we will also see more rows of this nature in the US from next year, when a diktat from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator, requiring companies to disclose the ratio between the pay of their chief executive and the median worker, comes into effect.At the other end of the scale, the UK is experimenting with a markedly higher minimum wage of £7.20 an hour, which is scheduled to rise to £9 by 2020, one of the highest floors in the world.This trend is international. Germany introduced its first minimum wage last year; Japan’s prime minister has called for minimum-wage increases of 3 per cent a year for the foreseeable future, US cities such as Seattle are raising their wage floors to $15 an hour and big employers such as Walmart, the retailer, and McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, have unveiled significant pay rises for lower-paid staff.Developing nations such as Malaysia are also using minimum wages to redistribute growth more equitably.Much of the agitation is driven by a view that income inequality has risen to unacceptable levels, and the “1 per cent” are taking more than their fair share at the expense of the masses.There is a body of evidence to suggest that the resultant inequality is bad for economic growth. The OECD found that the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, rose about 10 per cent between the mid-1980s and 2011/12 in its member states. Its analysis suggested this had depressed economic growth by 0.35 percentage points a year over that quarter of a century.The substandard education received by 40 per cent of the poorest people in particularly unequal societies appears to be a big driver here.However, rather less work has been done on the link, if any, between the intracorporate pay gap (the gap between the highest-paid executive and the average worker) and corporate profitability.MSCI, the index provider, has had a go at doing so. It analysed 591 companies in its All Country World index with a market capitalisation of $6.9tn.These companies were illustrative of the trend towards greater inequality. Between 2009 and 2014, the pay of their highest-paid executive rose at a compound annual rate of 20 per cent, while the pay of the average employee rose at a rather more modest 2 per cent.20%The compound annual rate at which the pay of the highest-paid executives in the All Country World index rose between 2009 and 2014. The average employee’s pay rose 2%MSCI’s tentative conclusion is that the losers from this lopsided state of affairs include shareholders, as companies with larger than average intracorporate pay gaps experienced lower profitability than their more egalitarian peers.This relationship held across nine of the 10 sectors it studied. The divide was particularly stark in the utilities and energy sectors, where companies with low pay gaps generated average profit margins of 15-16 per cent, three times the 4-6 per cent of companies with large pay gaps.MSCI itself is a little wary of the findings. One caveat is that the outperformance was statistically significant in only one sector, consumer staples, where the operating profit margin divide was 18 per cent to 11 per cent in favour of low pay-gap companies.Further number crunching suggests that the high pay-gap companies did manage to deliver a slightly higher return on equity during the five-year period, but they had lower dividend yields.One thing is clear, however. Apologists for the corporate elite often claim the best chief executives are worth paying megabucks for. Overall the analysis found no evidence to back that argument up.More research is clearly called for and MSCI says that pension funds are already poring over its findings, with a view to voting en masse over corporate pay or tilting their portfolios in favour of more egalitarian companies. It is surely only a matter of time before we see an exchange traded fund aping such an approach.Many pension funds are, of course, ideologically opposed to high levels of inequality. Any evidence that such a stance will also reap financial returns, or at worst will not lead to underperformance, will embolden them, and others, still further.Highly paid corporate titans should prepare for a bumpy ride ahead.Steve Johnson is deputy editor of the FT’s EM Squared"

The terms of the deal are not yet known. A takeover is a step into the unknown, as it is Caixabank’s first major acquisition abroad.Unlike Santander or BBVA, Spain’s biggest banks, Caixabank makes most of its earnings in Spain, where it has ridden the domestic economic recovery well.Pre-tax profits tripled in 2015 and non-performing loans as a share of gross lending declined from double digits two years ago to 8 per cent.It has been a skilful buyer, snapping up distressed banks for less than book value and extracting savings. Supporters argue that it would benefit from being a consolidator in Portugal.Once a deal is finalised, Caixabank will be obliged to make an offer for the rump of BPI, after the latter has sold its operations in Angola.But regrettably for the buyer, the risky Angolan operation was also the most profitable part of BPI, delivering a return on equity in excess of 30 per cent (compare this with just 5 per cent in Portugal).BPI made a €76m profit in the first half of last year, with Portugal contributing only €6.6m. Group-wide, its cost to income ratio, at 57 per cent, is high compared to rivals.Also regrettable is the impact on capital. Berenberg estimates that BPI’s domestic business will raise risk-weighted assets at Caixabank by €13bn and reduce its core tier one capital ratio by 100 basis points (from 11.6 per cent last year).Meanwhile, net interest income in Spain is expected to drop this year as eurozone lending rates, to which 80 per cent of Caixabank’s loans are tied, plunge further into negative territory. The bank will also be hit by a Spanish court ruling against interest rate “floors” on mortgages, making them less profitable.Last year, Caixabank made an unsuccessful bid for BPI at a 12 per cent premium to the current share price, implying a tangible book value of 0.8 times. Given the headwinds, this time it needs a significantly lower price tag for the deal to make sense.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

If it’s tracking the regional MSCI index you’ve already shed 10 per cent this year. Where to go?The periphery looks cheap. But Greece is too wild and Italy looks shaky. Ireland is already pretty expensive. What about Spanish banks? Down 20 per cent this year on average, in spite of operating in the eurozone’s fastest growing economy, they stand to benefit from solid recent economic data, too. The biggest retail banks, Santander and BBVA, have both fallen in line with the index, and now trade at a discount to book value (0.7-0.8 times). Their expected dividend yields are in excess of 5 per cent, and they have cost to income ratios well below the European average.One major difference between the two lies beyond Europe — in Mexico (BBVA) and Brazil (Santander), their biggest countries by earnings. Conventional wisdom would opt for Mexico, which accounts for two-fifths of BBVA’s total profits. It’s a growing economy whose largest trading partner is the resurgent US. Net profits grew there by nearly a tenth last year. Santander Brazil’s performance is in a way more impressive. Tighter cost-control helped it grow pre-tax profits even as the country endured its worst recession in a generation.The gloom pervading the global economy demands a measure of safety, both in terms of capital and the sustainability of payouts. Here is where the case for buying starts to wobble. BBVA reported a core tier one capital ratio of 10.3 per cent at the end of 2015. Santander’s is a fraction less, the lowest for any major European bank. This did not stop it boosting its cash dividend by four-fifths last year.Even with exposure to one of South America’s fastest-shrinking economies Santander looks a lot like an investible bank.

Introduction of restrictive measures, such as capital or foreign exchange controls, which can lead to material deterioration of equity market accessibility, may result in the exclusion of such market from the MSCI Frontier Markets Indexes and a reclassification to Standalone Market status.The risk of Nigeria actually being evicted is now “acute”, says Renaissance Capital, which estimates that large sums could potentially head for the exit:The latest data tells us that the asset-weighted aggregate MSCI Frontier Markets benchmarked fund is currently underweight Nigeria; if they were to sell their entire remaining holdings in Nigeria, this would account for $410m of foreign equity selling. Global frontier equity ETFs are still tiny, with just $570mn of passive money benchmarked to MSCI, of which only $70mn is in Nigeria.…with implications spanning out from the financial markets:The government prefers longer-term foreign direct investment rather than more volatile foreign portfolio investors. However we suspect it is tough to attract one without the other… Being excluded from such indexes creates a higher hurdle to attract future investments.With this news, Nigeria’s hopes of attracting private sector investors have been dealt another blow.Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, has been hit hard by the collapse in oil prices, with its currency, the naira, coming under immense downward pressure. It fell 24 per cent against the dollar in the space of four months between October 2014 and February 2015, before currency controls arrested the decline.Read more: Nigeria’s dollar crunch adds to fuel crisis"
205;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-31T12:30:16Z;MSCI revives talks on China joining EM index;Inclusion would give mainland shares a 1.1% weighting in benchmark;The leading provider of emerging stock market indices has revived talks on adding mainland Chinese shares to its benchmark despite concerns following last year’s stock market swings.MSCI chose not to include Shanghai and Shenzhen listed companies — known as “A shares” — to its Emerging Markets index last summer after investors expressed worries about their ability to buy and sell mainland shares.At the time MSCI said it would remove China from its annual review process. On Thursday, however, they issued a new “inclusion roadmap”, a consultation paper to be sent to clients for feedback, ahead of a decision in June.“The reopening of the consultation follows the recently implemented changes by the Chinese authorities aimed at enhancing the accessibility of the China A shares market for international institutional investors,” MSCI said.The new inclusion proposal would give mainland-listed Chinese shares a 1.1 per cent weighting in the global EM index, which is tracked by $1.5tn of assets.Inclusion in the MSCI EM index would enhance China’s reputation in global stock markets and require funds that track the index passively to buy the shares regardless of their feelings towards the stocks.Global investment firms expressed surprise that MSCI would reconsider its position so soon after last year’s stock slide prompted heavy-handed intervention by China including the suspension of two-thirds of listed stocks from trading.Devan Kaloo, head of emerging market equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: “The events of 2015 have scared off a lot of foreign investors and raised questions about the efficacy of the regulator in China. The country is likely to be included in the index, but it may take some time.”MSCI noted lingering worries and said: “International institutional investors continue to be concerned by the significant liquidity risks that may result from potential renewed voluntary suspensions in trading on the local stock exchanges of mainland Chinese companies.”Marco Mencini, head of EM equity at Pioneer Investments, said the events of last year should not cost China access to the leading index of EM stock markets.“I’m surprised by those who think A share inclusion should not happen. It’s unrealistic when you consider the size of the market. Disclosure is improving and China is opening up its system. It is paving the way to become part of the global financial system. The inclusion is a matter of if not when.”The MSCI index already has exposure to corporate China, through a mix of Hong Kong and US listings. Shanghai stocks can be traded easily through a link with the Hong Kong exchange, although issues remain, such as daily trading limits and a lack of clarity over beneficial ownership.Access to Shenzhen stocks is still restricted to a quota system, following the delay in launch a cross-border trading scheme slated for late last year.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
207;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-27T09:21:35Z;Quarter of investors think Brexit is likely;Survey of pension funds and asset managers finds 27% believe Britain will vote to leave the EU;More than a quarter of some of the world’s largest investors believe Britain will vote to leave the EU in June and have begun taking measures to protect their investment portfolios.According to a survey of 104 international pension funds and asset managers, 27 per cent said it was likely that the referendum scheduled for June 23 would result in a UK departure from the EU.NN Investment Partners, the Dutch asset manager that carried out the research, said it found a sharp rise in the number of investors predicting a UK exit. Fewer than a fifth of investors polled in March last year said they thought “Brexit” was likely at that time.Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, head of strategy at NN Investment Partners, said: “Economics, policy and politics have already taken so many surprising turns in recent years that we believe the only certainty we have is uncertainty.“In that respect, there is no point in being surprised by the fact that the odds [for a Brexit] are now apparently so high.”According to analysis compiled for institutional investors by MSCI, the index provider, the UK stock market would contract by 10 per cent and the global stock market by 2 per cent if Britain left the EU and the impact was just “limited”. In a scenario where the impact caused more “disruption”, MSCI predicted a 22 per cent fall in UK stocks and an 11 per cent slide in global equities.“The second scenario envisions that a Brexit would shatter the eurozone and drag down growth across the world,” said Jahiz Barlas and Raghu Suryanarayanan, researchers at MSCI.The consensus among fund managers, whether they are for or against a UK departure, is that Brexit would potentially be more damaging for the EU.Stephane Dutu, an equities analyst at Unigestion, the Geneva-based fund house, said: “In terms of UK interests, it makes little difference to the long-term picture whether the UK remains in the EU or not.“Commercial interests between the UK and the rest of the EU are significant for both zones, and are likely to push them to find a rapid trade agreement in the case of Brexit. The outcome of a Brexit would actually be more detrimental for the EU and the eurozone than for the UK, as it would be the first actual step backwards for the EU.”
208;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-25T04:50:23Z;Dollar’s streak sets RMB for biggest weekly drop since January;;"The strengthening dollar has prompted rather notable weakness in two closely-watched Asian currencies; the yen and the renminbi.The dollar index, a measure of the US currency versus a basket of global peers, is up 0.2 per cent on Friday and on track for a sixth-straight day of gains. It is the longest winning streak for the greenback since a seven-session run from December 28 to January 5, writes Peter Wells.Keen observers will know that’s a period that coincided with the sharp depreciation in the renminbi that triggered heightened volatility and handed global financial markets their worst start to the year in decades.The yen, down 0.2 per cent today, is weaker for the sixth session in a row, equalling a run from November 2 to 9 last year.But dollar strength has also placed downward pressure on the renminbi. The People’s Bank of China has fixed the midpoint around which the currency is allowed to trade weaker by a cumulative 0.9 per cent this week to Rmb6.5223 per dollar.That is its biggest percentage drop since the first week of January, when it depreciated by 1.1 per cent. And although global equity markets are set to decline this week – with five-week winning streaks for the S&P 500 and MSCI World Index about to end – investors have reacted more calmly than at the start of the year.The onshore renminbi, CNY, which trades around that reference rate has weakened by three-quarters of a percentage point this week to Rmb6.5201 per dollar . The PBoC caught investors off guard last August with its decision to give markets a greater voice in setting the reference rate.Since then, the fixing is supposed to be more reflective of where the spot market finishes in the previous session. But sometimes the markets still takes its cue from the spot rate.The offshore renminbi, CNH, which is traded outside the mainland and not subject to a trading band, has weakened by 1 per cent this week to Rmb6.5291 per dollar.After the Lunar New Year break, and in the wake of the volatility at the start of the year, the spread between the various renminbi rates has narrowed.Moves in the renminbi reference rate have increased in size in the past week or so. On Thursday, the fix was set a third of a percentage point lower, the biggest weakening since January 7 (the crazy week). Wednesday’s strengthening – the only this week – has been swamped by weakening moves of 0.3 per cent on Monday and 0.23 per cent on Tuesday.Analysts at HSBC have also taken note of the increasing size of the fluctuations. They said:We believe its sensitivity to overnight movements in major currencies has risen, especially when the US dollar is broadly stronger. If sustained, this latest subtle change in the fixing pattern could highlight the PBoC’s intention to introduce greater FX flexibility. We believe the PBoC has seized this opportunity of relative calm in the global financial markets to introduce greater two-way volatility in USD-RMB."
209;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-24T04:34:14Z;China bulls must hope for a holiday reboot;Easter break could refresh trading ideas and reduce uncertainty about the recent rally;What a difference a long weekend can make. China’s new year holiday last month proved a turning point for asset prices, from oil to stocks. So what might the more global Easter break do for sentiment?Investors can only hope. Since mid-February, charts have mostly pointed upwards but the mood has been not so much conviction, or even relief, as a vague feeling that what went down will probably go up. Strategists at Société Générale have termed it “risk-uncomfortably-on”.Nowhere is that clearer than in investor attitudes to Chinese equities. Take the Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks of the Hang Seng China Enterprises index. Compare the 10 worst performers before February 11 — its nadir — with the 10 best performers since, and many names appear on both lists. That suggests traders covering their earlier short selling positions more than any willingness to bet on outperformance by specific companies, or sectors.Some strongly bearish views on China explain why fear might have beaten conviction. But macro bets on a weaker renminbi have been one of the more crowded, and most painful, trades of the first quarter. Holiday-refreshed investors might want to entertain a rethink next week.Strong bullish calls involving China are unlikely — and highly risky. But there are tactical reasons to seek further gains in some areas. One of these is the greater weighting to be given to shares of US-listed Chinese groups in the MSCI indices from the end of May.Changes last year have already added the likes of Alibaba, Baidu and Weibo to benchmarks in the MSCI universe. Further tweaks are now due. After those, China’s weight in the emerging markets index will rise by about 2 percentage points to 26 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs.It is easier to be positive on China’s internet giants than its other sectors, with Alibaba, Baidu and Weibo gaining 29, 33 and 54 per cent respectively since the mid-February trough — performances that would rank all three in the top five risers in the HSCEI over that period.Perhaps some investors will use the Easter break to come up with other China-related ideas. MSCI’s move, and the changes it forces on investors, are another reason why investors can’t ignore China, even if they wish they could.jennifer.hughes@ft.com

Heavy declines among the banks pushed Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 1.1 per cent lower.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 1.1 per cent, while China’s Shanghai Composite dropped 0.9 per cent and the tech-focused Shenzhen Composite slipped 0.5 per cent. Japan and China are the only two major regional markets that won’t be closed tomorrow for the Good Friday holiday.US stocks slipped on Thursday amid falling oil prices, which have increasingly become a barometer of market sentiment, and a rising dollar. The S&P 500 was down nearly two-thirds of a percentage point, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent.A five-week rally for global stocks looks likely to end this week, with the MSCI World Index ending lower on Wednesday for the third session in a row, its longest losing streak since February 11.Investor sentiment had been underpinned by expectations that monetary policy from the world’s major central banks will remain accommodative.The Federal Reserve’s policy meeting last week showed it was on track to deliver just two 25 basis point rate rises this year, half of what it had flagged last December, but more hawkish commentary from the US central bank’s policymakers this week have supported a recovery in the dollar.The dollar index, a measure of the US currency versus a basket of global peers was up 0.1 per cent at 96.149 on Thursday and on track for a fifth-straight session of gains and its longest winning streak since the start of the year. Gold, which is sensitive to US interest rate expectations was down 0.1 per cent at $1,218.40 an ounce.The stronger dollar saw the yen weaker for as many days, and has it sitting a third of percentage point softer this morning at Y112.75 per dollar. But it has also fed into a weaker Chinese currency.The People’s Bank of China fixed the midpoint around which the renminbi is allowed to trade a third of a percentage point weaker this morning at Rmb6.5150 per dollar. That is the biggest one-day decline since the first week of January and continues a fortnight of depreciation.“This has fuelled speculations that the PBoC has again acted ahead of the curve as the market has started to price in more possibility of a Fed rate hike in April,” Zhou Hao, Commerzbank economist, said.Separately, data from Swift, the international payments network, this morning showed the renminbi’s use as a global currency slipped in February to its lowest level since October 2014.Oil prices were mixed in Asia after dropping more than 3 per cent on Wednesday as data showed US stockpiles rose to a record high for the sixth week in a row. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was 0.2 per cent higher at $40.56 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was down 0.1 per cent at $39.74.Commodity plays in Japan were weaker across the board today after Mitsui & Co. yesterday issued a profit warning after market close and said it would swing to its first fiscal year loss since 1947. Shares in the the trading house fell as much as 8.2 per cent today, making it the worst performer on the Nikkei, while commodity plays such as Marubeni, Inpex Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation were down more than 3 per cent.Exposure to the commodities sector was hurting sentiment toward Australian banks. ANZ Banking Group said it would need to boost its provision for bad debts by A$100m ($75m) to more than A$900m owing to Australian and multi-national resources companies that have come under pressure from the drop in commodity prices.ANZ was down 5.7 per cent, while its “four pillar” peers were down more than 2.5 per cent.
211;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-23T20:03:00Z;US stocks hit by firm dollar and weak oil;S&P 500 slips back into the red for 2016;Wednesday 20:00 GMT. A rising dollar and falling oil prices provided headwinds for US and European equity markets although activity remained subdued in the run-up to this weekend’s Easter holiday break.Energy stocks were easily the worst performers on both sides of the Atlantic as US West Texas Intermediate crude fell back below $40 a barrel, less than a week after retaking that level for the first time since early December.The dollar, meanwhile, continued to recover from the sharp sell-off that followed an extremely dovish policy statement from the Federal Reserve last week, as some in the markets reappraised their expectations for when US interest rates might rise again.The S&P 500 index fell 0.6 per cent to 2,036, taking it back below where it ended 2015. The S&P energy sector shed more than 2 per cent, while a drop of nearly 4 per cent for Nike shares after a poorly-received set of results also weighed on the market.The US equity benchmark turned positive for the year last week after rallying more than 13 per cent from a two-year intraday low hit in February.A late pullback for the pan-European Stoxx 600 index left it less than 0.1 per cent lower — having been down 0.5 per cent at one stage — while in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 per cent as volumes dwindled to the lowest this year.Much of Wall Street’s rebound over the last five weeks has been driven by expectations for continued policy accommodation from the world’s central banks — culminating in the Fed’s decision last week to scale back its interest rate forecasts for this year.The central bank’s so-called “dot plot” was revised to indicate just two 25 basis point rate rises in 2016, from the four it had pencilled in last December.However, a number of policymakers have recently provided more hawkish commentary — including the heads of the Philadelphia and Chicago Feds on Wednesday — prompting some to conclude that a rate rise in April remained a distinct possibility.“We still do not expect the Federal Open Market Committee to act in April — [chair Janet] Yellen’s sentiment is certainly more important than the sum of the [regional Fed] presidents who have spoken so far,” said Derek Halpenny, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.“But the tone of Fed rhetoric is such that it will not take much for the median “dots” to move back to three rate hikes this year, reinforcing our view that there remains scope for renewed dollar strength on the back of Fed action as we move into the second half of the year.”John Briggs, US rate strategist at RBS, argued that the recent comments by Fed officials were not a guided attempt to “correct” market interpretation of last week’s FOMC statement.“A more plausible theory — for me — is that the Fed is buying time, not only to watch the data, but in the way of financial conditions and the market itself,” he said.“Knowing they would not hike in March, and it was unlikely in April, the best way to keep stocks up and the dollar down was to be dovish for now. Then, if conditions remain as they are into April, the Fed can start to set up a June hike.”Nevertheless, the dollar index, a measure of the currency against a basket of peers, was up a further 0.4 per cent at 96.06. The index closed at 96.63 the day before the Fed’s policy meeting concluded.The euro was down 0.3 per cent at $1.1177 while the dollar was flat against the yen at Y112.38.The dollar’s strength helped push gold down $29, or 2.3 per cent, to a four-week low of $1,219 an ounce. Copper fell 2.3 per cent in London to $4,949 a tonne.However, the bullish trend in the dollar was not backed up by moves in the Treasury market. The yield on the policy-sensitive two-year note was down 3bp at 0.86 per cent, while the 10-year yield was 6bp lower at 1.88 per cent.US interest rate futures continued to price in just a 10 per cent chance of an April move by the Fed, according to Bloomberg data.The 10-year German Bund yield slipped 1bp to 0.20 per cent.Meanwhile, oil prices staged a sharp retreat as data showing US crude stockpiles climbing to a record high for a sixth successive week rekindled concerns about a global supply glut.The Energy Information Administration said total inventories rose by 9.4m barrels last week, way more than expectations.The price of West Texas Intermediate was down 3.9 per cent at $39.83 a barrel, having earlier hit $39.67. Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell 3.2 per cent to settle at $40.47.For market updates and comment, follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
212;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-23T17:27:33Z;Emerging markets lead the great rebound;Investors bet central banks will support global economy for an extended period;Emerging markets are back in positive territory after a sour start to the year as investors bet that central banks will support the global economy for an extended period.The MSCI Emerging Markets index, dominated by stocks in China, South Korea and Taiwan, is up 4.6 cent this year. Demand for government bonds issued by developing economies has pushed up prices and pulled the yield on JPMorgan’s dollar-denominated index down to a six-month low of 5.89 per cent.“There is some confidence that global growth is not going into a black hole,” said James Barrineau, co-head of emerging market debt at Schroders.The recent rally in emerging markets represents a sharp turnround from the first month of the year, when China’s economic slowdown, falling oil prices and a rise in US interest rates in December drove investors to remove money from emerging markets at a record pace.The Federal Reserve’s markedly cautious view of the global economy last week has cemented market expectations that there will not be an aggressive schedule of interest rate rises in the US this year.“One of the most important drivers is the Fed’s dovishness,’’ said Mr Barrineau. ‘’That has stopped the rally in the US dollar and been beneficial to EM currencies.”Some of the countries regarded as being most exposed to rising US rates are Brazil and South Africa, which rely on international capital to service budget deficits. In January, both the Brazilian real and South African rand touched multiyear lows against the US dollar while the average cost of borrowing across emerging markets reached a five-year high of 6.78 per cent.In credit markets, investors say talk is now fixed on how long the calm in emerging markets can last. Policy officials in the US refuse to rule out more than two rate rises this year, Brazil remains tangled in a corruption scandal, Russia is still subject to western sanctions and Turkey has endured a string of terrorist attacks, which means that many of the concerns that preoccupied investors remain a threat.Bhanu Baweja, emerging market strategist at UBS, says changes in global risk appetite seem to be occurring more frequently, meaning rallies can quickly become downturns.“The improvement in risk appetite since its worst point in January has been rapid,” he cautions. “ . . . upward momentum is nearing an advanced stage, in our view cautioning against chasing EM assets aggressively.”Around $9tn in capital flowed into emerging markets between 2005 and 2015, fuelled in part by central bank-enabled easy money, raising concerns that developing countries could face a credit crisis once the US tightened monetary policy.As the US economy has showed signs of improvement and the Fed made plans to raise rates for the first time since the financial crisis, emerging market currencies endured one of their worst years on record in 2015, falling 15 per cent against the US dollar according to JPMorgan’s index.
213;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-23T04:13:29Z;Asian shares weaker as caution reigns;;Asian markets were subdued on Wednesday after cautious moves on both sides of the Atlantic as the recent global rally lost steam and in the wake of bomb attacks in Brussels.Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.1 per cent and the broader Topix down by a quarter of a percentage point, with the yen sitting slightly stronger.China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.3 per cent and the Shenzhen Composite was a tenth of a percentage point higher, while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng was down 0.3 per cent.Global shares have rallied for five consecutive weeks, with the MSCI World Index up 10.7 per cent in that period. Stocks and bonds received a boost in the past fortnight as a handful of major global central banks struck a cautious tone, prompting expectations for monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time.Markets have been sluggish since the Federal Reserve issued a rather dovish policy statement at its meeting last week. That initially weighed on the dollar, prompting other currencies to rally, which in turn put pressure on stocks of exporters, particularly those in Japan.However, the dollar index, a measure of the US currency versus a basket of global peers, has since reversed course, and has been propped up this week by more hawkish commentary from Fed officials.The dollar was 0.1 per cent higher on Wednesday and on track for a fourth-straight day of gains, while the euro was sitting 0.1 per cent softer at $1.1209. The yen was 0.1 per cent stronger at Y112.27 per dollar.Investors initially moved toward haven assets such as gold and government bonds on Tuesday following a series of bomb attacks in Brussels. Gold gained 0.4 per cent yesterday but had given it all back on Wednesday to sit at $1,243.83 an ounce.German and UK government 10-year bonds rallied on Tuesday, but their counterpart in the US staged a late sell-off on Tuesday and continued to weaken in Asian trade.Japanese government bonds were weaker on Wednesday, with the yield on the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction to price, 1.4 basis points lower at -0.083 per cent.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down half a per cent, weighed down by the energy sector as heavyweight Woodside Petroleum announced it was delaying development of a major gas project of the Western Australian coast.In oil markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, were both down 1 per cent in Asian trade at $41.37 a barrel and $41.02, respectively. Crude rallied on Tuesday amid reports Saudi Arabia was prepared to join an oil production freeze next month regardless of whether Iran would participate or not, in a move that would go some of the way to justifying a nearly 50 per cent price rebound since mid-January.That recovery has also been helping the Malaysian ringgit, which rose as much as 1.2 per cent to a seven-month high of Myr3.9615 per dollar this morning. The ringgit was again the best-performing Asian currency, having crossed through the Myr4 yesterday.
214;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-15T05:39:19Z;SGX plans to list contracts on MSCI China Free Index;Asian exchange aims to build on regional uncertainty;SGX, the Singapore exchange, is looking to capitalise on investors’ concerns about direct exposure to Chinese markets by offering a series of equity derivatives based on the popular MSCI indices.The Southeast Asian bourse has teamed up with MSCI, one of the world’s largest global equity index compilers, to tempt investors with what it argues will be a more representative and reliable benchmark for trading China markets. SGX received regulatory approval from the Singapore authorities to make the talks public only in recent days.SGX is looking to exploit investors’ keenness to have exposure to emerging Chinese stocks, but have concerns about accessing the markets directly. Investors remain wary of open official interference in China’s markets after last summer, when market volatility prompted the suspension of hundreds of stocks. It has also intervened in the currency markets. Other incidents, such as the high-profile disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, has added to market participants’ concerns about the potential influence of the mainland in Hong Kong.But investors are also keen to get exposure to newer Chinese companies with better growth prospects in technology, financial services, telecoms and consumer goods.At present, most of what is termed “China” in the MSCI emerging markets index are Hong Kong-listed H shares but in recent months it has begun to shift its weighting to include American Depositary Receipts of Chinese companies listed overseas in its individual country indices, such as Baidu and Alibaba.That trend is set continue this year as more shares from Shanghai and Shenzhen are drip-fed into the market. The aim in time is to make the MSCI China a full and representative index as China’s market liberalises, with more than 500 stocks and more than $2tn of assets benchmarked against it.SGX’s contracts are based on the MSCI China Free Index and are US dollar denominated.“Lots of investors looking at the underlying [equity] are using our ‘A’ shares futures product,” said Michael Syn, head of derivatives at SGX. “Our bet is MSCI China’s current investment community, who followed the China index in H shares, will follow MSCI China in future.”Chinese markets have been the engine for SGX’s growth in recent years as demand for SGX’s FTSE China A50 futures contract has boosted its derivatives business. It also developed an emerging offshore renminbi market.

It is up nearly 15 per cent since slumping to a six-year low in January.Brent crude’s climb back above $40 a barrel and iron ore’s record 19 per cent spike on Monday are helping to boost commodity companies across a number of emerging market bourses. Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS Index was among the biggest winners, rising more than 2.5 per cent on the back of rallies in big energy companies such as Gazprom and Lukoil.Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index is up 0.6 per cent, adding to last week’s record busting 18 per cent gain as the detention of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva over his role in a multi-billion dollar kickback and bribery scandal at state-owned oil company Petrobras has given investors hope that the political stalemate in the country could be set to break for the better.Shares in Petrobras are up nearly 50 per cent since last Monday to a 2016 intraday high of $R7.90 while those in Vale, the mining giant, have risen by tw0-thirds over the past week.EM stocks’ move into the black comes after the benchmark gauge for EM currencies erased its losses for the year last week. Along with the commodity rally, an easing in fears over the the US economy is also helping to reignite investors’ appetite for risk assets.
216;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-07T15:22:17Z;EM: is this rally for real?;;After a torrid start to the year, emerging market assets have roared back as a rebound in commodity prices, and an easing in fears over the the US economy, reignited investors’ appetite for risk assets.EM equities – as measured by the MSCI Emerging Market Index – is within a hair of moving back into the black for the year after a 7 per cent jump last week. The index is up for a sixth straight session on Monday, marking the longest rally since April.Among currencies, the JPMorgan Emerging Market Currency Index is up nearly 6 per cent from its record low in January. Led by the monster rally in the Brazilian real and the South Africa rand, the index clocked in its best week in more than four years and erased its loss for the year.Meanwhile, yields on EM bonds have also fallen sharply as investors resume their hunt for yield. Blended yields on the benchmark JPMorgan EMBIG emerging market index ended the week at 6.41 per cent, down from 6.63 per cent a week earlier and 6.94 per cent at the start of February.“February brought some fresh air to the emerging markets,” said Alberto Ades, economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Whether last week’s rally, one of the biggest in years, will mark light at the end of the tunnel or just a dead cat bounce is up for debate. Analysts at Citi recently raised their recommendation on EM equities to overweight, while those at Goldman Sachs claimed there is “value” in EM forex.However, others warned that the economic backdrop – weak global growth led by China’s slowdown and low commodity prices – remains bleak for a broad swathe of EMs.“The recent positive tone in EM assets contrasts sharply with the economic pulse check provided by the monthly PMIs,” noted Barclays. “It appears that technical factors, rather than fundamentals, drive market momentum at present.”Further reading:Markets: Can the good vibes last?Citi warms to EM stocks Goldman ‘sees value’ in EMFX (Feb 25)

The detention of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as part of an investigation into alleged corruption at Petrobras has given investors hope that the political stalemate in the country could be set to break for the better, fueling the biggest rally in Brazilian stocks in 20 years and a jump in the currency, the real.The real climbed as much as 9 per cent against the dollar last week, and ended the week up 7 per cent, its biggest weekly rise since 2008.Oil is still holding above $39 per barrel, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which offers a broad measure of equity-market performance across a wide range of emerging markets, has climbed by some 15 per cent since its late-January low, and by 12 per cent since February 11.Citi notes that the lack of clear inflationary pressures in the US is acting as a dampener on expectations for aggressive US interest rate rises.That, it says……continues to draw leveraged money interest in EMFX (especially in the carry currencies).But it cautions:We believe dynamics among risk assets has never been so dependent on Central Bank actions in the past couple of years. That, in the context of depressed inflation expectations, leaves EM in a period of calm, but the equilibrium is rather unstable.Private bank Julis Baer is taking a cautiously brighter view on emerging markets from here, upgrading the sector to neutral from underweight.Says Heinz Rüttimann at the bank:We believe that the time has come to be tactically less pessimistic and upgrade emerging markets back to neutral for the following reasons: First, the sharp drop in earnings and the currency sell-offs versus the dollar over the last 12 months are slowing. Second, we expect the Fed to officially delay further rate hikes on March 15 which will support emerging market currencies. Third, China is taking more serious counter-measures.To be clear, global emerging markets are not out of the woods yet but after five years in a bear market, we are testing the water.Bolt holes are seeing lighter demand. US bank BBH points out that the yen, a magnet to traders in times of stress, has flipped from being the best performing currency in the world to the worst over last week.Similarly, Bunds have backed down. Yields on German 10-year government debt now stand at 0.2 percent. Skinny, but a reversal from the apparent decline to zero in place only last week, and a sign that gnawing concerns over a deflationary black hole are subsiding. Some reckon yields can get to 0.5 per cent before really hitting a wall.Some investors say that maybe, just maybe, nerves at the start of this year were somewhat overdone.As Axa’s Chris Iggo says:Our view is that current credit risk premiums have moved to levels that suggest a much worse economic outcome than we expect.If you are considering calling time on the Great Markets Wobble of 2016, the voice of the permabear/devil’s advocate comes from Nomura’s Bob Janjuah:To reiterate my bearish views on risk assets for H1 2016 – I continue to see much lower equity prices, lower core bond yields, wider credit spreads, and weakness in EM and commodities over the next four months (at least). In January I said that the S&P500 would fall from 2000/2050 to the 1500s as my target over 2016. I reaffirm this view.In my view, stocks’ countertrend bounce off the February lows has now run its course and I believe we are – in early March – likely to see the onset of the next leg weaker in risk, vs stronger in core duration.It is important to remember that in bear markets the strength is to the downside, the violence is to the upside, with countertrend rallies in bear markets often being the most painful. Markets simply do not go down (or up) in straight lines. But if I am right that this bounce is over, we should continue to see a series of lower lows and lower highs in stocks around the globe.Further reading: Citi warms to EM stocks Goldman ‘sees value’ in EMFX (Feb 25)
218;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-03T16:12:40Z;South Africa joins EM wave of sovereign sales;BlackRock and Pimco declare that emerging markets represent a buying opportunity;South Africa is preparing its first sale of debt this year as global investors including BlackRock and Pimco declare that emerging markets represent a buying opportunity after three years of underperformance.The country announced on Thursday it had hired Deutsche Bank and Investec to organise meetings with bond investors in London, Boston and New York and discuss their options for a debt sale.In recent weeks, Russia, Argentina and Turkey have also made plans to sell sovereign paper as broad market sentiment has recovered after a torrid start to the year.A pullback in the US dollar has helped ease pressure on EM countries and companies that own debt denominated in the reserve currency.Sergio Trigo Paz, head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock, believes emerging markets are at the start of the healing process and that it is time to look at positives including signs that China’s economy is stabilising.“We are more bullish,” he said. “Volatility is calming and the US dollar has retraced.”Appetite for emerging markets has been knocked in recent years by the slowdown in China’s economy, collapse in commodity prices and sharp appreciation of the US dollar.Emerging market-focused asset managers including Pimco, Franklin Templeton and Aberdeen were among the worst-selling investment companies in 2015 as volatility left these funds struggling to calm investor fears and staunch outflows.As credit flows reversed, average yields in emerging market debt issued in “hard” currencies such as US dollars jumped, reaching a five-year high of 6.8 per cent last month.Now that outflows have slowed, yields are falling again and are now at 6.2 per cent, according to data from JPMorgan.Pimco said it saw “specific pockets of value” and was ready to reassess the entire emerging markets sector if positive catalysts materialised.Franklin Templeton’s Michael Hasenstab, known for contrarian bids in emerging markets, has also called time on emerging market negativity, which he says has led to a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity.In particular, he favours Brazil, which he believes stands on a clear path out of economic crisis, and countries such as Mexico, Malaysia and Indonesia that he thinks have been erroneously included in an indiscriminate sell-off.If South Africa raises new debt, it will hope to capitalise on these shifts in sentiment.However, the country is battling an economic crisis as it seeks to stave off a ratings downgrade below investment grade status with the economy seen growing less than 1 per cent this year.The Treasury’s target is to stabilise net national debt — most of which is in local currency — at 46.2 per cent of GDP in 2017-18, compared with a current level of 44.3 per cent.However, uncertainty hangs over the government’s commitment and ability to meet its targets, business confidence is weak and the country is enduring its worst drought in a decade.Pravin Gordhan, who had previously served as finance minister between 2009 and 2014, has since been reappointed and will head upcoming meetings with bond investors.
219;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-03-01T14:13:25Z;MSCI tightens index composition rules;Hanergy-linked company among those affected in quarterly review;Index provider MSCI has said it will no longer include in its indices companies that the Hong Kong regulator has flagged for a high concentration of ownership, after steep rise and sharp plunge of Hanergy stock last year raised investor concerns over potential manipulation of closely-held stocks in the territory.Among the 18 firms axed under the new rule are one with links to troubled solar group Hanergy, which was dropped by MSCI last year after trading in its shares was suspended, and another whose share price plummeted the same week as Hanergy’s.The move is a rebuke to Hong Kong, which prides itself on its markets and corporate governance but also has a cohort of smaller brokerages trading in highly volatile small-cap companies. Many involve non-transparent shareholding structures and undisclosed ownership ties.The index cut 18 companies as part of its quarterly review, following “feedback from the investment community”, it said. Those include Goldin Properties — whose shares inexplicably tanked the same week as Hong Kong-listed Hanergy Thin Film Power suddenly plummeted— and frozen food maker-turned-casino operator Imperial Pacific, which had previously announced a co-operation with Hanergy on the island of Saipan.For years, the Hong Kong regulator has issued “concentration warnings” flagging companies whose shares are owned by a small number of parties. Many of those companies experience strong price run-ups followed by sharp drops, usually following announcements of asset acquisitions or related party transactions.Most of the companies are too small to attract the notice of international investors. But the steady rise of Hanergy’s Hong Kong-listed stock caused it to be included in several international indices and last year attracted attention from short-sellers, before it dived in May. In a series of articles, the Financial Times has detailed unusual transactions between Hanergy’s listed unit and mainland parent, strange trading patterns in its shares, and the parent group’s reliance on loans from China’s opaque shadow banking sector.If a stock is added to an index, it can accelerate its upward momentum by bringing in a wave of new money. MSCI’s new rule against including stocks flagged by the regulator will help prevent that positive feedback loop in future.David Webb, the Hong Kong-based shareholder activist, said: “A lot of index-tracking fund-holders have already paid the price, because their funds had to buy the bubble stocks.”In 2002, Mr Webb criticised MSCI for including InterChina, a sharply rising stock at the time, in its index, which further pushed up the stock’s price by bringing in additional buyers. MSCI later withdrew the inclusion, but recently began including flagged stocks again in its indices.
220;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;China rule change clears path to equity index inclusion;Loosening of restrictions could let A shares into the MSCI index and drive capital inflows;China may not be everyone’s dream investment destination at the moment, but Beijing may possibly have found a way to pretty much force a phalanx of foreign investors to pour money into the country.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange last week unveiled the partial liberalisation of its Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor programme, the prime conduit used by overseas fund managers, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to access the Shanghai and Shenzhen equity markets.Some believe the relaxation may be enough to prompt the major index providers, such as MSCI, to include these Chinese onshore A shares in their flagship emerging market indices.“All major impediments to MSCI A-share inclusion have now been removed and this could bring the decision [to include them in the MSCI EM index] forward from 2017 to 2016,” said Neil Flynn, analyst at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based consultancy, who lauded the move as the “most significant step towards harmonisation and liberalisation so far”.If A shares were included in the major indices, fund managers offering passive global EM equity funds would have no choice but to buy them, helping combat the acute capital outflows Beijing is currently battling.Active fund managers would have a choice of whether to buy or not but, given the tendency for many of them to closely shadow their underlying indices, most would be expected to start snapping up A shares as well.Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, the $49bn emerging markets house, said last year that China’s inclusion in global benchmarks was “without doubt the single most important financial event in the next decade”.In June 2015, MSCI ruled against including China’s onshore stock markets in its flagship Emerging Markets index, which has about $1.6tn of money benchmarked to it, following a consultation with major investors.However it said Shanghai and Shenzhen were still “on track for inclusion” and that it would work with Chinese regulators to address its three remaining areas of concern.The first of these was the quota allocation process, where it said large investors should be given access to a quota “commensurate with the size of their assets under management”, something particularly important for passive managers. It added that “all investors said they needed sufficient flexibility and assurance to secure additional quota should the need arise”.Last week’s announcement from Safe addressed these concerns by saying that holders of QFII licences would no longer need to seek individual approval for quotas, but would be automatically awarded a quota of between $200m and $5bn depending on their assets under management. Permission would still be needed beyond the $5bn cap.Second, MSCI said in June that investors needed daily liquidity, ie the ability to repatriate money immediately rather than being the subject of a capital lock-up.Safe said last week that managers of open-ended mutual funds will now be able to redeem their investments on a daily, rather than weekly, basis. However, a separate cap, limiting monthly net repatriation to 20 per cent of the size of their QFII assets as of the end of the previous year, remains.Third, MSCI also raised concerns about the beneficial ownership of investments, although it added that these would largely be solved once previously announced regulatory changes to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect scheme had been proven to work effectively.Mr Flynn said the announcement by Beijing “not only addresses all three issues but the wording is actually word for word in terms of what MSCI had suggested”.He noted that three months before the International Monetary Fund’s November 2015 decision to add the Chinese renminbi to its special drawing rights basket, the Chinese authorities had released a similar word-for-word statement addressing the remaining obstacles to the renminbi’s inclusion.“The obstacles [to MSCI including onshore Chinese stocks in its EM index] are being knocked down by Safe. It really brings the decision [to incorporate them] forward by 12 months,” Mr Flynn added.MSCI is due to reconsult large investors in April, with a view to making a fresh announcement on the fate of A shares in June.One concern may be that, given the recent volatility in the Chinese equity market and Beijing’s repeated intervention to attempt to prop up prices, investors may say they want to steer clear of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets for the time being, even if all their technical concerns have been met.Mr Flynn said he understood that view, but MSCI may feel “a little bit of pressure” given that any unnecessary delay could allow a rival such as FTSE Group to gain a “first-mover advantage” by adding Chinese A shares to its global emerging market indices first.He added that asset managers could attempt to “front-run” any anticipated decision by index providers to incorporate A shares by building stakes ahead of the ruling.Beijing’s move comes as global demand for QFII quotas has fallen for the first time in the scheme's decade-long history, dipping by $30m in January to just over $81bn, a move attributed to mounting nervousness about Chinese equities.However Mr Flynn said some investors were cutting their QFII quota because they were instead concentrated on the Renminbi QFII scheme, a related programme for investing offshore renminbi back into onshore Chinese markets, which currently has $71.5bn of outstanding quotas in issuance.The Hong Kong market is currently the largest in the MSCI EM index, accounting for 24.4 per cent of its weight.MSCI has previously said that, should it decide to add Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks to the index, it would do so in a gradual way to reflect the currently low level of foreign ownership of the market.A first step might be weighting the onshore market so it accounted for about 1.3 per cent of the index. However, its modelling last year suggested that if and when onshore stocks are fully included, Greater China would account for about 43.6 per cent of the EM index, potentially reducing investment flows into every other emerging market.MSCI declined to comment.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
221;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Asian markets ex-China brush off PMIs and rally;;A cluster of weak readings on Asian manufacturing activity failed to halt the continuation of a global rally in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s surprise decision last week to adopt negative interest rates.Japan’s Nikkei was up 1.8 per cent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was 1 per cent higher and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.5 per cent.In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 1.3 per cent, while the tech-focused Shenzhen Composite was 0.5 per cent lower.Those performances follow gains of more than 2 per cent for US and European stocks on Friday as reacted positively to the BoJ’s effort to spur inflation and boost the economy.The first day of the new month brings with it hopes that markets can stabilise and recover some of the heavy losses incurred in January, which marked the worst start to a year for global stocks since the financial crisis. The MSCI world index saw global stocks fall 6.1 per cent last month, the worst January since an 8.9 per cent January drop in 2009.But the quality of recent economic data could complicate that recovery.China’s manufacturing sector remained in contractionary territory in January, according to official data from the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, and a private survey prepared by Caixin-Markit.Policymakers are attempting to transition China toward a more consumer-led economy, which makes the slowing pace of expansion in the services sector worrisome. The non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.5 last month from a 17-month high of 54.4 in December.Analysts at ANZ said the weak official PMI readings may prompt the central bank to support the economy by cutting the reserve requirement ratio for commercial lenders.“In our view, as deflationary pressure remains high, further RRR cuts are still needed to support the slowing economy and permanently inject liquidity into the market. In fact, refraining from further easing could risk an even weaker economy, which will then intensify depreciation expectation and capital outflows,” they said.Readings on manufacturing activity outside China were also disappointing. Japan’s manufacturing PMI slipped 0.1 points to 52.3, while South Korea’s PMI slipped below the 50-point threshold.That continued a rough day for South Korea as data showed exports tumbled 18.5 per cent year-on-year in January, the biggest drop since August 2009, as China’s economy slows and oil prices tumble.Korea’s won was the worst-performing currency this morning, 0.4 per cent weaker at Krw1,204.72 per dollar. China-exposed currencies were also hurt, with the Australian dollar down 0.2 per cent and the New Zealand dollar down 0.1 per cent.Japan’s yen was 0.1 per cent weaker at Y121.25 per dollar. The currency weakened by 1.9 per cent on Friday as the BoJ caught markets off-guard when it announced it would lower the rate on excess reserves to minus 0.1 per cent from 0.1 per cent, but kept the pace of its asset purchase programme unchanged. It was the biggest drop for the currency since October 31, 2014, when the BoJ ramped up the pace of its quantitative easing programme to Y80tn worth of government bonds per year.Japanese government bonds rallied following Friday’s decision. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell to a record low 0.061 per cent this morning, while yields on 2- and 5-year Japanese government bonds fell turned negative on Friday. Yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices.The yield on the benchmark Australian government 10-year bond hit a three-month low today of 2.592 per cent.In commodity markets, oil was weaker this morning after notching up their first back-to-back weekly gains in months. Brent crude, the international benchmark was 1.6 per cent lower in Asia today at $35.43 a barrel, having gained 8 per cent last week for its first weekly double since the end of November.West Texas Intermediate was 1.4 per cent lower this morning at $33.15, having gained 4.4 per cent last week. It was the first back-to-back weekly gain for the US benchmark since the end of September.Owing to growing rumours about production cuts, oil prices have recovered by more than a quarter since hitting 12-year lows in late January.
222;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The Brics are dead. Long live the Ticks;Tech-heavy Taiwan, India, China and Korea are the new darlings of the EM world;The Brics are dead. Long live the Ticks.The Brics concept, based on the belief that the quartet of Brazil, Russia, India and China would power an unstoppable wave of emerging markets-led economic growth, gripped the firmament for more than a decade after it was conjured into existence by Jim O’Neill, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs, in 2001.But the deepening recessions in Brazil and Russia have now dealt such a blow to faith in the Bric hypothesis that, late last year, even Goldman closed its Bric fund after assets dwindled to $100m, from a peak of more than $800m at the end of 2010.In its place, emerging market fund managers appear to have stumbled on its potential replacement — the Ticks, with tech-heavy Taiwan and (South) Korea elbowing aside commodity-centric Brazil and Russia.Aside from a catchy acronym, the realignment tells us much about the changing nature of emerging markets — and the world in general — with services, particularly technology, to the fore and trade in physical goods, especially commodities, in retreat.“Bric is not the engine of emerging market growth it was. There is a new order of things,” says Steven Holden, founder of Copley Fund Research, which tracks 120 EM equity funds with combined assets of $230bn.“Tech is just rampant and the consumer is what you are investing in EMs now. I don’t think many people are aware of the new EM story as much as they should be. They think of Brazil, Russia, materials, big energy companies. That has changed hugely.”Richard Sneller, head of emerging market equities at Baillie Gifford, whose EM Growth and EM Leading Companies funds invest 45-50 per cent of their $10bn-$15bn of assets in technology companies, adds: “In many emerging markets the speed with which young consumers are adapting to technological change, in areas such as ecommerce and online shopping, is much faster than in the US.“Trends that we hoped would emerge 15-20 years ago have come to generate significant cash flows.”Luke Richdale, chief client portfolio manager, emerging markets at JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages $70bn in EM and Asia-Pacific equities, says: “We are seeing leapfrogging [of technology] going on in China. There are models in the west, bricks and mortar etc, that simply won’t happen there.”According to Copley’s data, the average emerging market equity fund now has a near-54 per cent weighting to the Ticks, up from 40 per cent in April 2013, while the weighting to Brics has remained in the low 40s, despite a sharp rise in China’s index weighting, as the first chart shows.As of December, 63 per cent of funds had at least 50 per cent of their assets invested in the Ticks, while only 10 per cent had such high exposure to the Brics.Houses such as JPMorgan, Nordea and Swedbank have a weighting of at least 35 per cent to Taiwan and Korea alone in at least some of their funds, while vehicles managed by Carmignac, Fidelity and Baillie Gifford have exposure of 3 per cent or less to Brazil and Russia.The average EM equity fund now has as much exposure to China’s IT industry as it does to the country’s financial sector, as the second chart shows — despite the index weighting of financials being 4 percentage points higher — following a sharp rise in tech holdings in the past three years.The trend was turbocharged late last year when MSCI widened its EM index to include companies listed overseas, adding the likes of New York-listed Alibaba, Baidu and Netease to the index alongside existing heavyweights such as Tencent.Wider afield, the two stocks most commonly owned by the 120 funds monitored by Copley are Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC and Korea’s Samsung Electronics.“These are global companies that are either leaders or significantly well positioned in oligopolistic industries,” says Mr Sneller, who also holds Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry (also known as Foxconn), partly in the hope that Apple, its largest customer, will start to source automobile parts from it if the US tech group makes a strong push into vehicles.To some extent, funds’ buying of Ticks and tech stocks reflects their rising weightings in the MSCI index, particularly with many basic materials and energy companies suffering sharp falls in market capitalisation amid the commodity rout. The four Ticks now have a combined weighting of 62.4 per cent.But Mr Holden says many managers have been making active choices. “Managers are definitely ramping up their technology exposure. The numbers buying and overweight [the index] have gone up. For some funds, the index means nothing.”Almost a third of funds are now overweight Taiwan, up from just 8 per cent in September 2013, Mr Holden says.One unanswered question is whether this trend reflects an underlying structural change or whether it is purely cyclical, with sectors such as IT and consumer stocks naturally seeing their weightings rise as commodity-related companies go backwards.Taiwan was the largest country weighting in the MSCI EM index during the dotcom boom of the early 2000s, before the start of the commodity supercycle. Brazil, which led that phenomenon, has subsequently seen its weighting fall from a peak of 17.6 per cent in June 2008 to just 5.2 per cent.JPMAM’s Mr Richdale believes it is a bit of both. “There is an underlying structural story but at the same time equity markets in emerging markets are quite cyclical in nature,” he says.Mr Sneller accepts there is a cyclical element, with some of the consumer-oriented “toothpaste and tractors” stocks he also likes having previously been in vogue in the 1990s, before the Asian financial crises.However, he believes structural factors are also at play with, for instance, online shopping likely to become far more dominant in China than, say, the US.“The established incumbent legacy [shop] network is not there [in China],” he says. “You go to a third tier city in China and you don’t have swanky malls.“[Chinese people] value their time extremely highly. Why would you want to waste your time walking around second-grade shopping malls when you can do it online in a fraction of the time?”Analysis by Michael Power, strategist at Investec Asset Management, suggests the trend may be cyclical. All the Ticks (barring India which has a small current account deficit) are in the same quadrant of a matrix he uses to distinguish emerging market countries — that comprising manufactured goods exporters with an external account surplus.As the fortunes of these quadrants tend to ebb and flow in line with global liquidity and commodity demand, they tend to perform in a cynical manner.Yet even here there could be a structural factor. Mr Power says the quadrant inhabited by most of the Ticks “always does best”, in risk-adjusted terms, over an economic cycle, suggesting it should increase its weight over time.Whatever the truth of that, the rotation of the MSCI index away from primary industries and towards technology does raise a question as to why emerging market equities are still so driven by sentiment towards commodities.Follow us in Twitter @em_sqrd

But other similar stocks are still sagging.Monte Paschi’s shares have jumped 5 per cent to €0.73 today. That’s still a historically weak level, but it marks a pick-up from a dip to €0.58 earlier this month, writes Joel Lewin.The price of Banca Monte dei Paschi’s 2021 bond has bounced 4 cents to 87 cents, after falling as low as 59.5 cents last week.The MSCI Italian banks index fell 24 per cent from the start of 2016 to last Wednesday, but it has since recovered some of that ground.The deal between Italy and the EU is a guarantee scheme that aims to help Italian banks sell their large portfolios of troublesome non-performing loans by creating a “bad bank”.Christian Dubs, a fixed income analyst at Julius Baer, said:The agreed mechanism will help stabilising the troubled Italian banking sector and will bring down the non-performing loan rate of 17% of total loans, which is much above other countries such as Spain with 7%.The deal “has been well received by the market,” said Neil Williamson at Aberdeen Asset Management, noting “the subordinated debt of weaker Italian banks jumped sharply on the announcement.” He added:Although details are limited at this stage it appears that the proposed securitisation based solution introduces market pricing and close rating agency scrutiny into the murky world of Italian NPLs.More broadly, Italian bank shares have not responded so brightly.

On the equities front, every major EM stock market (except Taiwan’s) is down. The MSCI Emerging Market Index is now at its lowest level since May 2009 after tumbling 1.9 per cent on Friday.Underscoring the ferociousness of the recent selling, Brazil’s Bovespa, Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS index, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite Index are all back in bear market territory.Among currencies, the JPMorgan Emerging Market Currency Index fell to another record low following a 0.7 per cent drop. Analysts at UniCredit warned further is ahead turbulence ahead:A number of negative catalysts are in place for EMFX. While EM currencies have already been battered since the beginning of the year, we believe that further weakness is in store. While EM data have been better of late, a combination of (a) rising CNY depreciation expectations, (b) still falling commodities, and (c) more hawkish Fed rhetoric, are negative catalysts for EMFX as a whole.EM bonds are also getting squeezed, with yields for Brazil’s 10-year dollar bonds up 16 basis points at 6.955 while those for Colombia and Mexico rose nearly 9 bps to 5.4 per cent and by 8.5 bps to 4 per cent respectively.

True, Nikkei 225 futures are down 1.4 per cent, but that’s largely a catch-up play because Japanese markets were closed on Monday as the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1 per cent – a sixth straight loss – to its lowest since late September.The MSCI World Index declined 0.25 per cent on Monday, also the lowest since late September.It’s anyone’s guess how far the correction in China needs to go, but in just six days the Shenzhen Composite has lost a fifth of its value and the Shanghai Composite has fallen 14.8 per cent. At some point someone will go bargain hunting.The MSCI World Index declined 0.25 per cent on Monday, also the lowest since late September.Overnight in the US, the S&P 500 saw a late rally and finished with a 0.1 per cent gain, while the VIX gauge of volatility declined 10 per cent. The price of gold also fell 0.9 per cent to $1,094.20 an ounce and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 2.175 per cent.CNH, the offshore renminbi, strengthened 1.5 per cent on Monday after a key lending rate in Hong Kong spiked to a record high, making it more costly to short China’s currency. The spread between the renminbi’s offshore and onshore rates – which had struck a five-year high last week – tumbled to a two-month low. (In early Tuesday trading, CNH has weakened 0.3 per cent, but the gap between the two rates is still much narrower than last week).In early Sydney trading, miners are under pressure after the price of copper dropped 2 per cent on Monday, a six-year low after melting by more than a quarter over the past year.Alongside market coverage we’ll offer you the latest economic data.

226;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-01-11T17:15:04Z;Pain for emerging market equities deepens;;New week. Same pain for emerging market investors.Having endured their worst week since 2011, emerging market stocks continued their march lower on Monday, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropping more than 2 per cent to hit a fresh six and a half year low.Much of the pain were once again concentrated on Chinese bourses. The Shanghai Composite closed down 5.3 per cent and the tech-heavy Shenzhen Composite lost 6.6 per cent – taking the two exchanges since the start of the year to nearly 16 per cent and one-fifth respectively.But China isn’t the only country whose stocks are in correction mode. Concerns that the slowdown in the world’s second largest economy could sap demand for commodities and imports – along with fears over Beijing’s willingness to depreciate its currency – had a knock on effect on many of its trading partners.In Russia, the country’s dollar-denominated RTS Index entered bear market territory after dropping 5 per cent to a 12 month low of 699.13 on Monday. The index is down more than 22 per cent from its recent November peak, as a combination of sliding oil prices and depreciating rouble hit investor sentiment.The country’s other major index – the rouble denominated Micex – has proved more resilient, dropping “only” 10 per cent from its November peak.Hours earlier, the Philippine Stock Exchange Index also became a member of the bear market club following a 4.4 per cent drop. Brazil’s Bovespa stock market is nearing a bear market. The index, down 0.2 per cent on Monday, is now more than 18 per cent lower from its recent October highs.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that despite the sharp sell-off, they expect pressure on EM equities to remain in the near term:China remains the biggest risk to our view – a continued slowdown in China need not trump the improvement in the rest of EM, but left-tail events such as a CNY devaluation could be problematic for all EM. In terms of valuation, EM equities trade below our assessment of current fair value by 9%, but past bear cycles suggest that EM equities could trade down another 10% before hitting significant valuation support levels.
227;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-01-08T20:36:55Z;EM stocks head for worst week since 2011;;Emerging market stocks gave up their gains on Friday, doing little to alleviate the pain that has been inflicted on the asset class over the previous four days.EM stocks, as measured by the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index, are on track for their worst week in more than four years as fresh market turmoil in China, further weaknesses in crude oil prices and continued strength in the US economy prompted investors to dump their riskier positions.Having risen by as much as 0.5 per cent earlier on Friday, the index retreated to close unchanged from their Thursday level after a blockbuster US non-farm payrolls report raised the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates four more times this year.Friday’s recapitulation takes the index’s loss this week to 7 per cent, its worst weekly performance since September 2011.That investors are wary of EM equities is no surprise. The sharp fall in commodity prices, along with the economic slowdown in China have already cast a pall over the growth prospects of many major EM stocks. Adding to the headwind has been the rampaging dollar, which eats into the local returns for foreign investors and rising bond yields, which are making equities a less enticing proposition for increasingly risk-averse investors.Indeed, the JPMorgan Emerging Market Currency Index tumbled to a new record low on Friday – with the Mexican peso, the South African rand and the Russian rouble among those touching new lows this week.Analysts at UniCredit think EM currencies could weaken further still:A number of negative catalysts are in place for EMFX. While EM currencies have already been battered since the beginning of the year, we believe that further weakness is in store. While EM data have been better of late, a combination of (a) rising CNY depreciation expectations, (b) still falling commodities, and (c) more hawkish Fed rhetoric, are negative catalysts for EMFX as a whole.
228;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2016-01-04T14:05:09Z;EM stocks on track for biggest drop since August;;Emerging market investors have started 2016 as they ended 2015: in full risk-off mode.A market rout, triggered by another set of weak manufacturing data from China and rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East, have prompted investors to further cut their exposures to markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down 3 per cent – its biggest one day loss since August. Should the index close at its current level of 770.53, that would put it at its weakest level since July 2009.China’s Shanghai Composite led the declines, plunging nearly 7 per cent while the small cap-heavy Shenzhen Composite lost 8.2 per cent. The market gloom ricocheted across the globe – with Brazil the hardest hit.The country, which has already endured waves of intense selling in the final days of 2015 following the departure of its finance minister, a second downgrade to junk by a major ratings agency, deteriorating finances and a growing political crisis, saw its benchmark Bovespa stock market index fall by another 2 per cent in early trading on Monday.The real retreated 1.7 per cent to R$4.0270 per dollar, putting it back on path towards the record low of R$4.1783 reached last September.The currencies of countries dependent on exports to China also suffered heavy losses. The Chilean peso – which tied with the South African rand as last year’s third worst EM performer – hit a fresh 13-year low of 717.77 per dollar after falling another 1.3 per cent on Monday. The Colombian peso dropped 1.4 per cent to 3,218 per dollar while the South Korean won fell 1.3 per cent.Data from the Institute of International Finance showed that 2015 was the worst year for EM fund flows since the global financial crisis. EM portfolio inflows totaled only $41bn last year, down 86 per cent relative to the 2010-2014 average.
229;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Can Russia remain stable with oil at $30?;;"Investors in Russian equity and debt enjoyed, on average, a relatively better year than peers in other major emerging markets. The rouble-denominated Micex gained 17 per cent in the year up to Christmas week, while the dollar denominated RDX added only 0.3 per cent – the difference being accounted for by the 16.5 per cent year-to-date fall in the value of the rouble versus the dollar. Over the same period, the MSCI EM Index lost 17 per cent and the MSCI World Index was off 4 per cent. The yield gap applied to Russian sovereign debt, and that on issues from the biggest corporations, contracted substantially despite the cut to sub-investment grade by two rating agencies earlier in the year.Valuations started 2015 excessively cheap because of political and economic fears that proved unfounded. The conflict in eastern Ukraine did not spread further and sanctions were not added to. Domestically the government’s response to falling oil revenues and tough macro conditions was pragmatic and effective. For sure nobody can say that 2015 has been a good year for Russia; what we can say is, “it could have been a lot worse”.As we stare into 2016, valuations are no longer excessively cheap but, on average, equities and debt are trading with a bigger risk premium, ie discount, than usual. Investors are more hopeful about the country’s ability to survive the crisis but are still a long way from believing in a sustainable recovery.The big issue coming into 2016 is the falling oil price and the question over how this may endanger the economic stability that the Kremlin and government officials have been lauding over the past few months. That stability is perfectly safe with $50 average oil but what happens if the price of Urals drops to $30 a barrel or even lower? While one can justifiably argue that such a low oil price should be a catalyst for a supply reaction, which should see a higher price in the second half of the year, the trend between now and spring looks more dangerous for oil producers.One of the main reasons why Russian asset prices performed relatively well in 2015 is because of the pragmatic and generally effective actions by government agencies to counter the effects of sanctions and the weak oil price. Budget discipline held firm and the many demands of the big state companies to tap the sovereign wealth funds were rejected. But the biggest positive was the 180 degree turn in the central bank’s rouble policy; after 15 years of regularly spending financial reserves to support the rouble, in 2015 it was allowed to fully free-float against the oil price.This meant that the central bank’s financial reserves remained close to $360bn from mid-March; the finance ministry has been able to contain the budget deficit at 2.5 per cent of GDP; some sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, received a boost as consumers switched to cheaper domestic products; and the current account is likely to have run a surplus of $60bn because of the big collapse in the value of imports.With $30 oil the story will certainly change. One may argue that low oil for longer is actually good for Russia because it will force the government to start addressing issues, such as improving the investment and business climate, that have been avoidable during the period of high oil. That’s a valid long-term assumption which doesn’t provide much comfort for investors over the medium term. Oil at $30 a barrel will mean the rouble is likely to trade in the 75-80 range against the dollar. That will be even better for domestic producers but it will make it tougher for the central bank to achieve its inflation and interest rate targets. Consumer and business confidence will also stay very low and this will delay spending and investment decisions. The finance ministry will again press for more tax revenue, which will likely lead to windfall taxes on hard currency exporters by mid-year. All of which suggests the economy will remain in recession for the first half of 2016 at least.Chris Weafer is a partner at Macro-Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.Back to beyondbrics"
230;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-12-16T19:11:49Z;Emerging markets shrug as Fed raises rates;;Emerging markets have had plenty of time to prepare for today’s Fed historic interest rate rise. So little surprise then that EM reactions have been rather muted so far.JPMorgan Emerging Markets Index, which measures the strength of the most traded developing country currencies against the greenback, is down 0.2 per cent – unchanged from the level it was at ahead of the Fed decision.On the equities front, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index held on to its 1.5 per cent gain for the day. EM bond yields were also little changed from their pre-Fed levels.Given that the impact of a Fed rate hike has largely been priced in before today, analysts say the focus now is on how fast US policymakers plan to raise rate, where commodities price go and how domestic issues in EMs play out.Kit Juckes of Societe Generale said:We’ve waited so long for this policy move that the initial reaction may be meaningless.As for markets in the coming days, I think the rest of us take our cue from Treasuries…any upward momentum in treasury yields will keep emerging markets nervous, will be followed by a re-focus on the other major central bank whose policies are in play – the PBoC – and support the yen relative to emerging market and resource currencies.
231;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-12-16T10:16:13Z;Alliance Trust seeks to reassure on turnround;Dundee-based group says it has outperformed its benchmark for the past year;Alliance Trust, the 127-year-old Scottish investment group that has been under pressure from activist investors for not delivering good enough results, has sought to reassure shareholders it has achieved a turnround.The group, which recently saw former chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox leave its board to head its fund management arm, said it had outperformed its chosen benchmark since September 2014, which is when it installed a new set of portfolio managers.Alliance said its total shareholder return was up 11.5 per cent since September last year, compared with a 3.3 per cent gain in the MSCI World Index.“The progress made underlines the board’s commitment to the strategy and its continuing belief that Alliance Trust is now well placed for the future,” the company said in a stock exchange announcement.Alliance also assured investors its strategic changes were well under way. It said it has substantially reduced its exposure to fixed income and narrowed the discount of its share price to the net value of the assets it holds.The discount still stands at around of 10.5 per cent, however, signalling investors are looking for more changes.To narrow the discount, Alliance has been buying back shares, having purchased and cancelled 4.5 per cent of the company’s stock since October 1.Some analysts have questioned the choice of the MSCI World as a performance yardstick, however, as Alliance Trust is not focused on investing in emerging markets, which make up around 10 per cent of the global index. Alliance Trust was unavailable for comment.The trust is also likely to have been boosted by its “socially responsible investing style”, said Ewan Lovett Turner, analyst at stockbroker Numis, meaning it will have avoided mining stocks, which have fallen sharply over the past year.He added that while the MSCI benchmark was “reasonably appropriate,” the period since September 2014 was a “relatively short one to monitor”.Alliance Trust has achieved a net asset value-based total return of 6.6 per cent in the 12 months to December 15, Mr Lovett Turner said. A peer group of similar trusts have outperformed Alliance on average, according to Numis’ data, with an NAV total return of 8.5 per cent.Dundee-based Alliance has announced a series of changes in recent months after coming under pressure from US activist investor Elliott Advisors over its performance.Chairman Karin Forseke announced last month that she would also step down, sooner than had been expected. Ms Forseke, a key ally of Ms Garrett-Cox, had been set to lead a new non-executive board that would ensure the trust was run independently, and in shareholders’ interests.Alliance Trust shares rose 0.6 per cent in the opening minutes of trading on Wednesday.
232;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
233;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-12-14T16:30:21Z;EM assets out of favour as oil heads lower;;Emerging market stocks and currencies anyone? Anyone?EM assets are continuing to struggle to find buyers on Monday, as a renewed slide in oil prices and a widely expected interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve this week further sapped investors’ appetite for risk.EM stocks – as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index – fell to a fresh six-year low of 771.08 on Monday after retreating another 0.3 per cent.Within this, Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS stock index fell 2.5 per cent, the most among the main EM bourses. Other countries with exposure to oil were also squeezed, with Brazil’s Bovespa and Mexico’s IPC indices both down 1 per cent.After dropping to a new record low on Friday, the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Currencies index, which measures the strength of the most traded developing country currencies against the US dollar, edged back up 0.3 per cent to 65.83.The rise was mainly driven by the South African rand, which rallied more than 4 per after President Jacob Zuma back tracked on his choice for a new finance minister.Stripping out that gain, the index would probably have fallen for a sixth straight session. Both the pesos of Colombia and Mexico sank to new lows.Analysts at Capital Economics argue that although most EMs seem well placed to withstand a Fed rate hike, pockets of vulnerability exist.EMs with large external financing requirements (Turkey, South Africa, Malaysia) as well as those with sizeable dollar debt burdens (Turkey, again) look exposed.For these economies, the real risk is not “lift-off” itself but the pace of tightening by the Fed thereafter. The concern here is that Fed embarks on a more aggressive tightening cycle than is currently priced into markets, which could trigger a sharp rise in US Treasury yields and a broader retreat from EMs. This is the key threat to watch for. If we had to pick one EM to keep an eye on it would be Turkey.

235;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-11-25T11:04:22Z;Frontier markets struggle to break through;Deteriorating credit ratings point to entrenched weaknesses and the risks of great expectations;"Frontier markets are sometimes referred to as pre-emerging economies in the belief that they will one day graduate to full emerging market status. Anyone investing on this basis might want to rethink, however.Given that most frontier market countries are significant commodity exporters, the commodity supercycle that ran for most of the past decade might appear to have been the perfect environment for the likes of Nigeria, Vietnam and Belarus.But during the past decade, Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has seen fit to raise its rating for just one of the 29 frontier markets it covers, Bolivia. In contrast, 13 have a lower rating than Moody’s initially assigned to them, with Egypt, Ghana, Vietnam and Mongolia among those downgraded, as the table shows.“While they remain popular avenues for equity and bond investors, none of the frontier market sovereigns have seen dramatic improvements in their credit profiles over the past 10 years,” Moody’s says.“The scope of frontier markets as long-term investment plays will depend on whether, and how quickly, their risk-reward profiles converge with those of emerging markets.”Moody’s does proffer the caveat that many of these countries have short rating histories. Yet this cannot fully explain the negative trend; countries such as Fiji, Jordan, Honduras, Moldova and Pakistan, which were first rated in the 1990s, have gone backwards since then, in the rating agency’s eyes.Worse may be to come. Moody’s ascribes negative credit outlooks to seven of the 29 countries but a positive outlook to just Georgia, Honduras and Senegal.One of its big concerns is rising debt burdens. Between 2000 and 2008, the median debt burden across the 29 tumbled from 76.2 per cent of gross domestic product to 31.3 per cent, primarily due to debt relief through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.However, according to Moody’s, it has since inched back up to 42.1 per cent of GDP, above the 39.8 per cent figure for emerging markets, with Egypt, Jordan and Sri Lanka among the most indebted, as the chart shows.If frontier market countries are not capable of moving upwards, even during a broadly supportive global environment, this has implications for investors, but more so for the 1.1bn people, 15 per cent of the world’s population, who reside in them.As emerging markets overtake developed ones in some areas the FT investigates whether it is time to coin a new phrase for the developing powersIn aggregate, they may account for just 3 per cent of global GDP, but their current low income levels, combined with young populations (with an average age of 25, compared with 37 in China), are commonly cited as reasons why they can outperform emerging and developed nations and transcend their frontier status.As a group, they produced median GDP growth of 5.5 per cent a year between 2000 and 2014, outstripping the 4.2 per cent recorded by emerging markets, thanks to robust commodity prices and an influx of foreign direct investment in extractive industries, according to Moody’s.However, the quality of this growth was often poor. In each year between 2007 and 2014, total factor productivity across frontier markets declined, subtracting from overall growth, according to analysis by The Conference Board.Instead, GDP growth was merely driven by an increased supply of capital and labour.Neil Shearing, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics, believes this is a crucial factor.While it may be relatively easy, in theory at least, for a country to ascend from poor to middle-income status if it adopts the correct policies, making further progress relies on raising total factor productivity growth, Mr Shearing argues, rather than just calling up more capital and labour.Achieving this is a “bit more difficult”, requiring upfront investment in skills and research and development.Given this possibility, though, Mr Shearing does not believe frontier market countries are “condemned in any way, shape or form”, to remain frontier. But he does believe any advance will be slow.Looking back at the progress seemingly made in the past 15 years by sub-Saharan commodity exporters, some of the poorest countries on the planet, Mr Shearing says two-thirds of the pick-up in growth can be explained by the commodity boom, “maybe three-quarters when you start to add in some of the indirect effects”.A failure to accumulate savings in the boom years in countries such as oil-rich Nigeria made it harder still for many states to hold on to the temporary gains when the commodity cycle turned.“Expectations were too high, rather than countries being doomed to always lag behind,” says Mr Shearing. “They are going to converge but they are going to be converging at a slower rate than was expected. The expectations are now starting to be adjusted but because their institutions are less developed, they are more prone to shocks.”The failure so far of frontier nations to step up to full emerging status has parallels with the relatively few emerging countries that have become developed, despite this latter process having had far longer to work through.Marc Chandler, global head of market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, argues such promotion has “proven difficult, though not impossible”, with Japan blazing a trail in the 1950s and 1960s when it adopted an export-oriented model and “succeeded in moving up the value chain quickly”.However, he argues that the examples of the handful of other countries that have made the transition to developed status “are difficult to replicate”.“Consider that many successful emerging market economies in Asia [such as Hong Kong and Singapore] were British colonies. Others, like South Korea and Taiwan, were aided by a superpower rivalry,” says Mr Chandler.Moreover, there is no universal acceptance that any of these latter countries are developed. MSCI, the index provider, for instance, still classifies them all as emerging.Mr Shearing agrees that the experience of small entities such as Hong Kong and Singapore probably does not produce many meaningful conclusions.Nevertheless, he does think the journeys of South Korea and the Czech Republic, another country he believes is making the transition to developed status, are more replicable.“There is a pattern there, they were manufacturing-based economies,” he says.This ties in neatly with the failure of many frontier markets to make concerted progress. In the wake of EM Squared’s calling into question the “Africa rising” narrative that has dominated in recent years, much of the subsequent debate (see here and here, for example) has centred on the continent’s lack of progress in building a manufacturing base.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd"

237;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Gold miners: shining examples;"Producers should offer a better return than the yellow metal itself; do not be fooled";The standard complaints about gold, considered as an investment, are widely acknowledged and impeccably logical. It generates no income. It has few industrial uses. It should, in theory, perform poorly when the US dollar strengthens — as it has lately in anticipation of a rate rise. It is just a shiny rock. Sell it.How annoying, then, that at times in the past year gold has bettered the returns of global equities and widely traded (and useful) commodities such as crude oil or copper.Time to buy gold miners, then? They offer — again in theory — a leveraged play on gold prices and dividend income to boot. MSCI’s World Gold Miners index has outperformed the broader MSCI miners index by nearly a fifth over the past year. This is not a high bar to clear, of course, but is notable all the same.Do not be fooled. Since gold exchange traded funds appeared in 2003, making owning the stuff easier, gold miners as a group have rarely outperformed bullion. When they did, as gold soared between 2008 and early 2011, the spread between the gold price and the miners’ production costs doubled, to $750 per ounce. Costs kept rising after prices peaked, though, and this spread is now nearer $250.And the mining sector has become riskier, too. Many producers have added debt as prices have fallen. Leverage has risen significantly. The largest miners by market value have increased their net debt by half while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have fallen by the same proportion, according to S&P Capital IQ data.This higher leverage comes as shareholders demand both dividends and rising production. That is a worry. Much below the current price (about $1,100 per ounce) and gold miners will not have any free cash flow, RBC thinks. That would mean more debt, or equity, would be needed to sustain production and dividends.While some gold producers, such as UK-listed Polymetal and Randgold, have benefited from lower local currency costs, the broader sector has trailed the gold price this year. If you must buy gold, buy the metal, not the miners.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

239;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-11-15T02:21:16Z;Profiting from passive aggression;The rapid rise of ETFs is boosting revenue growth for index providers;"Indices and the companies that calculate them are playing increasingly important roles across financial markets as disenchantment with the poor performance of active managers fuels interest in passive investment strategies.Profits generated by index providers have risen significantly in the aftermath of the financial crisis, boosted by the rapid growth of the exchange traded funds industry.ETFs have a gathered more than $1.5tn in new cash from investors over the past seven years, swelling the value of global ETF assets to just over $3tn, according to ETFGI, the London-based consultancy.Index providers also generate revenues from structured products and derivatives such as stock index futures. But ETFs have become the key engine driving growth for index providers.“A bigger portion of the indexing industry’s growth is coming from ETFs. They [ETFs] are a very important part of our business,” says Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices.More than $824bn in ETF assets track S&P’s benchmarks, making it the top ranked provider of indices for ETFs ahead of MSCI ($438bn) and FTSE Russell ($383bn), the business owned by London Stock Exchange Group.Leading ETF managers, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, are fighting a price war to attract investor inflows.Reductions in headline ETF fees mean supplementary index licensing costs account for a rising share of the total cost of ETF ownership.
But index providers have remained relatively immune to these pricing pressures and it is rare for fund managers to switch their ETF benchmarks.But Christos Costandinides, the founder of BlueHarbor, a US-based investment consultancy, says there is friction between fund managers and indexing providers over fees.“There is growing discussion as to what the level of compensation should be for using an index, especially for equity indices where a lot of the information is already available for free,” says Mr Costandinides.Indexing providers are reluctant to reveal details about their fees and contractual agreements with fund managers. However, MSCI recently separated the reporting of its indexing business from its other divisions when it published its latest earnings.MSCI earned an average of 3.4 basis points from ETFs in the three months to the end of September, helping its indexing business generate revenues of $141.7m in the quarter. Analysts noted that MSCI was able to generate high profit margins of 72.7 per cent across its indexing business, far higher than reported for its other divisions.Alex Kramm, an analyst with UBS, expects the new reporting format to boost investors’ valuation of MSCI’s indexing business, already its fastest growing and most profitable division. But he questions whether pressure over costs from fund managers or increased competition among rival index providers will have a big impact on indexing fees earned by the largest players.“We expect the indexing industry to maintain its pricing power despite more aggressive competition from FTSE, Stoxx and Nasdaq for those with strong assets such as S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI,” he says.But Mr Costandinides says smaller indexing providers are making significant efforts to compete with the larger players, particularly in fixed income markets where passive investment strategies are less widely used as well as in more niche areas of equity markets.WisdomTree, the US asset manager, runs two of this year’s fastest growing ETFs, a Europe equity dollar hedged ETF and a Japan equity dollar hedged ETF. It creates its own in-house ETF indices partly to save costs.Nizam Hamid, head of sales for WisdomTree Europe, says self-indexing allows a fund manager to retain more of the value created by an ETF.“Indexing providers do not generally sign exclusive agreements. Multiple ETF issuers often end up competing on exactly the same indices. So it becomes very hard for an ETF manager to retain any competitive advantage over a rival and discussions with investors tend to focus on the price of rival ETFs. Our strategy allows us to focus on innovation” says Mr Hamid.He detects little pressure on the best known index “brands” such as the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indices.But Mr Matturri defends current pricing arrangements, saying that there are “break points” for assets beyond which an ETF provider will pay less.Rising demand for smart beta ETFs that do not track conventional market capitalisation weighted indices is a developing rivalry between large index providers and smaller players.Goldman Sachs Asset Managagement launched its first smart beta ETFs in September. The ETFs track proprietary indices instead of using a third-party index provider. This has allowed Goldman to undercut rival providers with the GSAM ETFs carrying an annual fee of 24 basis points, well below the 55bps average for other smart beta ETFs.“Price competition is also starting to ramp up in smart beta,” said Mr Costandinides."
240;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-11-15T02:21:16Z;Footwear measure offers well-trodden path;Indices provide access to a growing range of specialist investment themes;In a sequel to his cult classic The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams cited an economic concept dubbed the Shoe Event Horizon. In this scenario, a depressed population buys itself treats, usually shoes. Eventually, the high street has nothing but shoe shops and the economy is no longer sustainable.If this troubling prospect keeps you awake at night, you can track its likelihood using Dow Jones Footwear Index.Although it is very specialised, the footwear index which includes the Nike brand and various rivals is not the most niche out there. Index companies are prepared to create indices for almost anything their clients can request, although in many cases there are technical challenges that must be overcome.“It’s important that they’re created with a clear, transparent and orderly methodology,” says Diana Tidd, head of equity index products at MSCI. “And when it’s for a product, it also has to meet local regulatory requirements.”These are absolute requirements for all indices, of course, but when the specification is for something outside the mainstream, index providers need to think laterally.Steffen Scheuble, chief executive of Solactive, a German index provider that specialises in niche indices, gives the example of building a driverless car index. A car manufacturing index would include BMW and General Motors, but not Google. Yet a driverless car index would have to include the latter but not the two big carmakers — although GM at least has plans to change that by joining the fray.But this raises further difficulties: in a traditionally constructed index weighted by market cap, Google would dwarf any pure-play companies and the index would effectively be a tech index. In this case, Mr Scheuble says, it would be more meaningful to weight companies in the index according to their share of the underlying market. So, if Google had 25 per cent of the market, it would constitute a quarter of the index.“There is this trade-off with all tech themes,” he says. “How small is the universe if you keep it pure-play [companies that only have exposure to the relevant industry], or do you want to have an index that is broadly diversified, but still covers the topic?”One answer is to base inclusion — and weightings — on the proportion of revenues a company derives from the relevant industry. In the case of Solactive’s wearable technology index, a company has to secure 7.5 per cent of its revenues from wearable technology.In sectors where there are both pure-play companies, with revenues solely from that sector, and other companies that have significant exposure to it but are mostly players in different industries, other solutions might be suitable.One such solution is to give the pure-play companies a fixed weighting in the index — 10 per cent is the chosen figure for Solactive — and a similarly fixed, but lower, weighting for non-pure-play companies.Mr Scheuble admits this is simplistic and that it would in theory be possible to create a more representative index with more complicated weightings, but “that data is just not out there”, he says.Access to data is an obstacle for many specialist indices, not just those tracking small industrial sectors. This problem arises at MSCI for environmentally themed indices. “It’s very possible companies don’t disclose the information [resource or energy use] regularly,” says Ms Tidd, adding: “If the companies don’t publish the information, sometimes they’re happy to help by providing it to us.”Specialist indices can interrogate more sophisticated themes. S&P Dow Jones Indices has an event-driven index family that includes indices tracking IPOs, spin-offs and activist investor interest.The later index provider follows a list of known activist investors, keeping an eye on regulatory filings. As soon as one of the list takes a 5 per cent or larger stake in a company, that company is added to the index. “The question is whether there is real value creation going on, and the performance [of the index] does suggest there is something in it,” says Vinit Srivivasta, senior director for strategy indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
241;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-11-15T02:21:16Z;Investors seek ethical benchmarks;Meeting the challenges of climate change with low carbon indices;"With the Paris climate talks just days away with the aim of reaching a radical deal between countries to curb their greenhouse gas emissions, investors’ role in making this a reality is in the spotlight.After many years when environmental issues were seen as a concern mainly for niche ethical or socially responsible investors, the topic has moved firmly to the centre stage in the last 12-18 months, says Frederic Samama, deputy head of institutional investing at the asset manager Amundi.“We have seen a fascinating shift among asset owners. They are now entering the climate change game,” he says.Asset owners and asset managers have become increasingly aware of the investment risks associated with climate change, says Thomas Kuh, head of environmental, social and governance ESG indices at MSCI, the data provider.“We have seen interventions on the risk of climate change recently from the Central Bank of China and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, while a new French law makes it mandatory for investors to disclose the carbon footprint of their portfolios,” he says.Meanwhile, California has recently signed into law legislation that forces Calpers and Calstrs, two of the world’s biggest pension funds, to divest their coal assets and New York State is considering something similar, says Kevin Bourne, FTSE Russell’s managing director of database services.But the awareness has also been driven by a range of initiatives, including the global divestment movement that has seen investors responsible for more than $2.6tn of assets pledging to sell out of fossil fuels of some kind.The success of the Asset Owners’ Disclosure Project and the Montreal Pledge, both of which encourage investors to make public the carbon footprint of their portfolios, have played a part in this. So too has work done by the Carbon Tracker Initiative to highlight the risk of carbon-intensive stranded assets which has made investors take notice.“Investors are recognising that they have a risk in their portfolio but they don’t know when that risk will manifest itself or how big it will be,” says Mr Samama. With share prices failing to reflect the risk to returns caused by climate change, low-carbon indices offer an elegant way to reduce those risks in your portfolio “until the markets price correctly the risks it creates.”There are three types of green indices, says Mr Bourne: “There are ESG indices, such as FTSE4Good, which measure how a company operates rather than what it makes; low carbon indices that look at whether a company pollutes; and environmental markets indices, which include companies that make green products such as wind turbines or solar panels that will help to manage the risks of climate change and resource depletion.”Low carbon indices respond to the increased demand from investors to be able to exclude fossil fuel companies, says Mr Kuh, as well as allowing them to invest in companies helping to cut emissions.But while some investors are happy to live with a high tracking error because they are betting that companies providing solutions to climate change will outperform, most investors want a product that can reduce the carbon intensity of their portfolios without deviating from their benchmark, says Julia Kochetygova, director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.“Mainstream investors with a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries find it difficult to explain, if they are investing passively, why they are using anything other than the main benchmark. For those investors, the transition to a low-carbon investment strategy is easier if they can match the benchmark,” she explains.As a result, many green indices “tilt” the benchmark rather than simply excluding all polluters. MSCI’s Low-Carbon Leaders Indices, for example, exclude the most carbon-intensive companies in each sector rather than chopping out the most polluting sectors.Investors such as foundations and sovereign wealth funds, which have more leeway in how they invest, were among the first to use low-carbon indices but a few institutional investors have also started to do so, including France’s FRR, AP4 of Sweden and the UK Environment Agency pension fund.The market is still held back by a lack of reliable, certified data, says Mr Bourne.A number of asset owners are waiting and watching to convince themselves that these environmental investment strategies perform as expected, says Mr Kuh, but growth in the sector will be rapid, Mr Samama argues “because investors cannot keep their heads in the sand any longer”."
242;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-11-13T17:29:13Z;Emerging market outlook divides investors;MSCI EM index has lagged behind its developed market equivalent over past five years;Are emerging markets an opportunity or a trap?Despite the current malaise, emerging market equities still offer the prospect of exposure to some of the fastest growing economies in the world, with trade, technology and liberalisation promising long-term growth in profits.Yet it has been not just a tough year, but a tough half decade for investors: buyers of the MSCI Emerging Markets index in late 2010 have lost 14 per cent of their money, while the developed market equivalent has returned a gain of 35 per cent, with most of the losses coming this year.Pressures on emerging market businesses remain intense. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin its long-awaited tightening cycle in December, drawing capital back to the US and further boosting the dollar at the expense of “soft” currencies. Commodities, a big business for many emerging countries, continue to inflict pain, with oil prices falling back below $44 this week.Some investors have seen enough.“We have had this love affair with emerging markets, but it’s over,” says Marc Chandler, global head of market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.For him, the elements that support emerging market equities — a weak dollar, easing by the Fed, strong commodity prices and global growth — are all reversing. “Each one of those legs has been undermined or broken,” he says.Still, opportunity strikes when assets are unloved. Valuations for emerging market equities have fallen to levels that invite an investor to weigh the many challenges facing the market against the longer term prospects.Judged by price to earnings ratios, the MSCI Emerging Market index is comparatively cheap, on 12 times this year’s earnings, down from 15 times in April. The MSCI World, comprised of 23 developed market indices, is valued on 18 times prospective earnings, according to Société Générale.Capital Economics forecasts a rebound in MSCI’s EM index over the next two years, while equities in much of the developed world will “grind only a little higher”. Although the research firm admits that other forces may influence the market in the short run, improving news out of China and a gradual recovery in commodity prices are seen supporting a sustained outperformance of emerging markets.GMO, the Boston-based asset manager founded by the bearish Jeremy Grantham, is also optimistic on the long-run return potential in the developing world.In its latest seven-year return forecasts, the investment house predicted that EM equities would deliver 4.6 per cent annually over that period, smashing the annual 1.1 per cent returns they see for US quality stocks. Only timber — one of Mr Grantham’s favourite exotic asset classes — will rival EM stocks in terms of returns over the next seven years, GMO forecast.Others are less convinced and point out that the short-term headwinds remain ferocious.Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, says his preference for developed over emerging markets is not as strong as it was a few months ago, but argues “we are only at interesting valuations now, it’s not a market that can only go one way”.“The counter [to cheap valuations] is China, China, China,” he points out. “How can emerging markets prosper in the face of a deterioration in China that looks long-lasting?” he asks. “No country has ever built up as much debt as China without having a crisis, and it would be a success story if growth just slows.”Generalising about a group of countries that includes the energy rich and belligerent Russia, the world’s largest democracy, India, and second-largest economy, China, may also be a risk. But the impact of the latter is inescapable. Brazil, where financial problems are complicated by political scandal, has many analysts worried that the country’s crisis will deepen before it abates.“If generalisations need to be made, it is fair to say that the emerging market equities asset class (as defined, for example, by MSCI) is predominantly Asian, with the region accounting for nearly 70 per cent of market capitalisation,” says Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global macro strategist for Barclays. He advises clients to wait until currency markets settle and the outlook for global trade brightens before diving into emerging markets.Much depends on the trajectory of the Fed’s transition from zero interest rate policy, which is also key for gauging future returns in emerging markets. Expectations are for a measured pace of interest rate tightening. A more aggressive shift by the Fed and subsequent rapid move higher in US Treasury yields would draw capital out of risk assets like emerging markets back to seek higher returns for less risk in the US.All this comes at a time when growth comparisons between emerging and developed economies has tilted. Between 2005 and 2009, emerging markets economies were growing 5 to 6 percentage points more than the developed world but now that difference is 2 percentage points.“I don’t see a particularly quick turnround for EM,” says Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC. “That said, a little bit of goods news goes a long way when an asset class is this out of favour.”
243;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-11-13T08:57:43Z;MSCI to add Alibaba and Baidu to its China benchmarks;Inclusion of more US-listed China groups will increase representation of consumer and tech groups;Chinese consumer and tech stocks including Alibaba and Baidu will be more heavily represented in benchmark MSCI indices following a rule change with far-reaching consequences.Moves by the index provider to allow companies to feature in indices for countries they operate in rather than just those they are listed in will enable at least 14 US-listed heavyweight Chinese groups to join the MSCI China and its global emerging markets index.With more than $9tn of funds thought to be benchmarked to its indices, any change in MSCI’s methodology has the power to affect the value of savings around the world.MSCI China, which includes large-cap and mid-cap stocks, has become an important gauge for investors following China because it includes only stocks listed outside the mainland, where investment access is still restricted.Alibaba, Baidu, Netease, JD.com, Ctrip, Vipshop and others will be added to the China benchmark in two stages, after which they will account for 14 per cent of the total index weight, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analysts.The additions will take the representation of internet stocks from 14 per cent to about 23 per cent — and relieve Tencent of its position as the index’s sole tech stock.Baidu will be the largest inclusion. Although the search engine’s $68bn market capitalisation falls far short of Alibaba’s $198bn, it has a larger free float.$9tnAmount of funds thought to be benchmarked to MSCI indicesFormer leading sectors will shrink, roughly tracking broader changes in the Chinese economy. Financial stocks will drop from 42 per cent to 35 per cent of the index, while energy eases from 8.4 per cent to 6.7 per cent, according to Morgan Stanley.The changes will increase the divergence between the MSCI measures and those of Hong Kong’s main index provider, Hang Seng Indexes. The dominance of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong’s market gave HSI a leading role in providing China-linked gauges, but because of the preponderance of financial stocks in the city its indices are weighted towards the sector, with few tech or consumer names available.Almost three-quarters of the benchmark Hang Seng China Enterprises index, for Chinese companies with local H-share listings, consists of financial stocks, with just 3.5 per cent consumer stocks and no tech stocks.The HSCEI is down 15 per cent this year, compared with 5 per cent for the MSCI China.
244;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Chart that tells a story — Not-so Little Britain;UK makes up increasing proportion of assets in global equity income funds;Global equity income funds — as the name suggests — invest in an international basket of equities which pay strong dividends. But the chart shows that some “global” income funds are more geographically diversified than others.While the MSCI World Index, an index of over 1,500 stocks and a common benchmark for global funds, offers 7.8 per cent exposure to UK equities, the average of the IA Global Equity Income Sector sits much higher at 18.1 per cent. And some individual funds have an even greater weighting to UK equities — Liontrust’s Global Income Fund has 38.6 per cent exposure to the UK.UK companies traditionally benefit from a well-established dividend culture compared with their international counterparts — an important factor to consider when investing in income funds. In addition, the UK economy has recovered at a faster rate than many international peers, helping those stocks in the FTSE 100 that are domestically focused.Liontrust’s global income fund had previously sat in the IA UK Equity Income sector, hence its greater weighting to the UK. It expects to lower its UK exposure to below 30 per cent by the end of the year. But Samantha Gleave, the fund’s manager, insists that UK exposure remains important: “The yield requirement of the fund is high (5 per cent) and the UK represents one of the highest yielding markets worldwide,” she says.Not necessarily. It does mean that investors’ portfolios may not be as diversified as they think, however. “There can be an element of ‘doubling up’ UK exposure when UK retail investors, who’ve long been serial buyers of UK equity income funds, seek to diversify internationally by purchasing a global income fund,” says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Bestinvest.George Boyd-Bowman, manager of the Neptune Global Income Fund, says his fund avoids over-investing in UK equities for this reason. “I am mindful that many UK investors use Global Equity Income to diversify their domestic exposure, and so I am keen to ensure that my fund isn’t too UK-focused,” he says.However, a geographical weighting similar to that of the MSCI would not be ideal either. “The main thing to remember is that, with active fund management, you don’t want an index hugger. You want a manager who has conviction in their ideas,” says Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services. “There is nothing necessarily wrong with being overweight UK if the investment case for the underlying stocks is sound.”The dividend record of UK-listed companies remains an attractive option for global income fund managers, so it should be no surprise that many are overweight UK. “Quite simply,” says Mr Hollands, “a global income fund that ignored the UK would struggle to meet investors’ income expectations.”But investors should probe the global weighting of their chosen fund before parting with their cash, to ensure their holdings are as diversified as they believe.“It doesn’t really matter where the stock is based as long as the investment case is sound and the holdings are clearly disclosed, so that investors can make their own minds up as to whether the fund is suitable for them or not,” says Mr McDermott.
245;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-10-29T11:36:29Z;Emerging opportunities in Chinese stocks;;"Emerging market stocks, as measured by the MSCI EM Index, have seen more than a quarter of their value wiped out in the past four months, led by the travails of the Chinese stock market. We are not saying that now, or next week, or next month will represent the ideal buying point. We believe there is further disruption ahead, with suggestions that the devaluation by the Chinese central bank in August did not go far enough, and with others calling for a more profound market-clearing event to cleanse the final remnants of the price inflation seen earlier this year.Many have been trying to call the bottom of the market; what we would say is that we are beginning to see tentative indications of discrete, selective buying of the babies that have been thrown out with the bathwater. We don’t think there is ever a bad time for rigorous, bottom-up analysis of companies exhibiting strong fundamentals. We do think that now looks like a particularly good moment to put old-fashioned research skills to work, and particularly in China.It has been a stomach-churning summer. A mere 12 months ago, China was stumbling through its fifth year of sluggish stock returns, a bear market brought about by a slowing economy and concerns about the sustainability of the government’s economic liberalisation programme. The ride since then has been frantic and furious, with the Shanghai Stock Exchange surging more than 150 per cent in a year, buoyed by manic, largely retail-driven speculation, before hitting the skids in spectacular fashion. From peak to trough (thus far), the index has lost over 40 per cent of its value, with almost 9 per cent of this wiped out on China’s own Black Monday, the August 24. There has been government intervention, investor panic, numerous involved articles and research pieces trying to sift through the wreckage, all illustrated with pictures of Chinese everymen (and women) staring glumly at screens of falling stock quotes.How do we go about investing in Chinese equity in such an environment? The short answer in our view is: extremely carefully, and with long nights of due diligence and contemplation, but with some grounds for optimism. It would be unusual to see a return to the sharp market spikes of late-2014 and the first half of 2015. We expect the Party to be firmly focused now on managing an orderly stabilisation and on minimising the impact of the stock market on the real economy. While deflation remains a risk, we want to avoid companies that have built up debt, particularly US dollar debt.This would not be the first time that an economy slowing from a period of investment-led growth produced better stock market returns than during its period of hyper-growth, as better allocation of capital and a rationalisation of overcapacity improved returns to equity. We have seen such a phenomenon in Korea, Taiwan and Japan in the last 50 years. Until last year, China had been the fastest-growing major economy over the previous five years, but had the worst-performing stock market. It is entirely plausible that this will flip over – but of course only IF we start to see evidence of better capital discipline. The latest micro data are encouraging as there is some evidence of better capital discipline by Chinese companies in the last 18 months. We need to see this trend continuing as evidence of real, not just show, reform.What’s more, the recent speculative mania has been most prevalent in the ‘story’ stocks (One Belt One Road, stockbrokers, environment, internet) so beloved of domestic investors, but which simply do not possess economic “moats” (the ability to maintain a competitive advantage over time), cashflow generation and strong balance sheets. There were several dozen of these stocks available in China at very attractive valuations a year ago, and as the present rout continues they are once again becoming available at what we believe to be very attractive prices for an investor prepared to hold for the long term.To illustrate these upbeat sentiments, let us offer three sectors that we believe will prosper despite (or even because of) any market/economic headwinds in China over the coming months:1) Bus/large automotive manufacturers. The sector benefits from a number of secular trends. Congestion and environmental concerns have led to a focus on bus travel in China, with a nation-wide move towards environmentally-friendly buses. Greener buses benefit from higher margins, government subsidies, and a centrally-dictated mandate that 30 per cent of all new buses should be electric/hybrid. Chinese large automotive firms are also well positioned for growth in other Emerging Market economies, particularly in Latin America and in the Middle East/North Africa.2) Cosmetics manufacturers. Chinese cosmetics companies trade at a fraction of the multiples of their Korean, Japanese and European peers. Skincare continues to be high on the list of aspirational products for China’s burgeoning middle classes (aspirations which seem to be undampened by the economic climate). Chinese consumers appear to prefer local brands. No Chinese firm has more than a 2.5 per cent market share in China, which leaves significant room for growth – market leaders tend to control 20 per cent of the market, or more.3) Airports. While airports globally are typically highly leveraged and require large outlays of capital expenditure, Chinese airports have solid balance sheets and generally exhibit low capacity utilisation, meaning they are in an excellent position for significant future growth. This is a country that will not stop travelling and continues to be one of the world’s most vibrant economies.In this environment, we believe it makes sense to look for companies headed by strong management teams that have shown long-term commitment to improving returns. More than anything, we believe it is important to target companies that exhibit excellent fundamentals – either to weather potential storms, or to grow into any recovery – whose valuations have been dragged down by the market turmoil and now look compelling. The fear/greed continuum is an investing cliché, but lurking in the shadows cast by the headlines and the violent stock swings, there are gems to be found.Edward Cole and Simon Pickard are emerging markets portfolio managers at Man GLG, the discretionary investment management business of Man Group.Back to beyondbrics"
246;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-10-26T15:50:11Z;Asian stocks extend dominance of EM index;China’s surge means continent now accounts for 70% of MSCI index, undermining diversification;Emerging market equity investors may believe they are benefiting from broad-based EM exposure if they track MSCI’s flagship stock index.But in reality the $1.6tn of money benchmarked to the MSCI EM Equity index has become ever more narrowly focused, in regional terms at least, since 2000.Asia now accounts for a record 69.5 per cent of the index, up from 63.1 per cent a year ago and a little over 40 per cent in 2000, according to analysis by Geoff Dennis, a strategist at UBS.As a result, the weighting of the (Eastern) Europe, Middle East and Africa region has fallen to 17.6 per cent and that of the Latam region has plummeted to a record low of just 12.9 per cent, less than half its weight in 2000 (see chart below).Moreover, there are reasons to believe the dominance of Asia in the MSCI EM index is likely to rise still further.The Asian surge has been led by China, which has gone from a weighting of 0.4 per cent in 2000 to 23.8 per cent (having hit a record high of 26.2 per cent in June).At present, what is termed China is purely the Hong Kong-listed H-shares market. But from next month MSCI will begin to include companies listed overseas in its individual country indices and aggregate benchmarks such as the MSCI EM.The biggest impact of this is likely to be the addition of US-listed Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Netease to the MSCI EM index, increasing China’s weight still further.Further out, China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen-based A-shares markets are also likely to be drip-fed into the MSCI benchmark. The index compiler shied away from including them in June but said they were “on track” for inclusion in the future and set up a working group to examine the remaining obstacles.Given Shanghai and Shenzhen have a combined market capitalisation of $7.61tn, compared with the $3.25tn of the Hong Kong market, China’s weighting could potentially double.“China has embarked upon a multiyear process of opening her markets, so China’s share is destined to grow and grow and grow,” says Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management.“All investors should have a China strategy. Ultimately, China will have the next dominant reserve currency, the world’s benchmark ‘risk-free’ bond market and be five times larger than the US.”Although China has massively increased its weighting in the MSCI index, the country’s investment performance has been far worse than most of its peers, with returns of just 60 per cent of the index’s average since 2000, as the chart above shows.As Mr Dennis notes, this shows that the sustained rise in China’s weighting is entirely due to changes in index definition (such as the inclusion of “red chips”, the shares of mainland China companies incorporated outside mainland China and listed in Hong Kong), new listings, rises in the number of shares outstanding of existing stocks and increases in free float.Several of the other cyclical and structural changes in the MSCI index are neatly illustrated in the third chart, which shows four countries have, at various times, been top dog in the index since 2000.With the technology bubble in full swing, Taiwan started out as the dominant country, with its weighting peaking at 26.7 per cent in May 2000, before falling away sharply.Fellow Asian tiger South Korea next took up the mantle, with its powerful chaebols powering the country to a peak weighting of 24.2 per cent in November 2002. With Samsung still the largest company in the index, South Korea’s decline has been less precipitous and it is still the second-largest country with an index weighting of 15.5 per cent.China briefly grabbed pole position from South Korea in 2007, only to be immediately usurped by Brazil which, aided by the commodity supercycle, surged to a peak weighting of 17.6 per cent in June 2008. Brazil’s weighting has since dwindled to a paltry 6.1 per cent as the supercycle imploded and oil producer Petrobras became embroiled in a corruption scandal.China took the helm soon after Brazil peaked, establishing a lead it looks unlikely to relinquish any time soon.The commodity supercycle is also reflected in the rise and fall of the energy and materials sectors (encompassing miners), which boasted a combined weighting of 37.6 per cent in June 2008, but can now muster just 14.5 per cent between them (see the last chart).Despite the bursting of the technology bubble, the information technology sector has been surprisingly resilient, however, and remains the second-largest sector, with a weighting of 18.1 per cent — marginally above where it started the century.The seemingly unstoppable rise of the financial sector is more eye catching, however, with banks, insurers and their ilk having enjoying an almost seamless rise to a 28.6 per cent weighting, sailing merrily through the choppy waters of the global financial crisis on the way.Only time will tell if this is a structural change, or a cyclical one based on a very long wavelength.One other significant change may be bad news for active fund managers. These groups often argue that passive, index-based EM equity funds have little exposure to emerging market consumers (whose rise to middle-classhood EM investors typically hope to tap into), but are instead heavily weighted towards commodities.This argument reached its apotheosis in 2008, when the combined weighting of consumer staple and discretionary stocks fell to just 8.9 per cent just when energy and materials took their combined share to 37.6 per cent.However, consumer stocks have now rallied to a century (to date) high of 17.9 per cent, overtaking the combined heft of the energy and materials sectors for the first time since 1999.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
247;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-10-22T14:43:41Z;Global refugee bonds can match historic crisis;;"The plight of tens of thousands of Middle East refugees pouring daily into eastern and western Europe has prompted EU and UN emergency action to raise billions of dollars for unmet previous pledges as well the historic fresh influx. But the funding model that relies on governments supplemented by private donations has long been unable to keep pace with the global spread of internal and external displacement now affecting 60m people, 80 per cent in developing countries, according to the UN’s latest figures.Financial markets, both debt and equity, could be mobilised for emerging economy frontline states to provide a new, long-term source for immediate infrastructure and social needs and future professional training and employment entry. Sovereign refugee bonds would be a logical start, building on existing investor local and foreign-currency portfolios across emerging market regions. Issues could carry partial guarantees from the World Bank and other development lenders, but more creditworthy governments are in a position to continue normal borrowing on commercial terms that could be discounted with a commitment to carefully track the proceeds for a range of refugee hosting and resettlement purposes.The Syrian and Iraqi exodus to Europe opened a clear developed-emerging market and east-west split, as cash-strapped governments were unable to absorb asylum seekers without additional aid or special funding. Greece and then Hungary strained to handle the numbers, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban criticized the EU quota system that was agreed at Germany’s behest as a preliminary response. His stance may have been tinged with xenophobia, but with public debt at 80 per cent of GDP and foreign investors holding one-third of domestic state bonds, fiscal room to manoeuvre is limited.Orban may also have been trying to ensure that local companies would have the capacity to provide goods and services along the refugee supply chain, helping to sustain the stock market’s 20 per cent best MSCI index performance through September. However, Serbia, which was equally overwhelmed, is in a different category as investors shun the country’s currency, stocks and bonds, despite progress with budget and balance of payment adjustments under its IMF program. Interest rates there are the highest in southeast Europe as inflation just jumped with electricity price hikes, unlike neighbours in deflation and monetary easing mode.Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have already absorbed millions of refugees from next-door conflicts under severe financial strains. Turkish officials reported spending $7.5bn to date directly from the budget, with the EU just recently offering cash assistance. Heading into fresh November parliamentary elections and the G-20 summit in Antalya, a major refugee transit point, the investment-grade sovereign rating is under pressure on continuing capital outflows. Local bond yields are over 10 per cent and the MSCI stock market gauge was down 35 per cent through September. The primary fiscal surplus may be at risk from further migrant outlays. Remittances from the Syrian and Iraqi diaspora help but do little to offset the 5 per cent of GDP current account deficit.Jordan depends on a combined $7bn in IMF and Gulf aid and the US has guaranteed a sovereign bond. It has hosted Palestinian refugees as well for decades under a special UN agency, and the last border crossing for its once-thriving Syria trade recently closed. Lebanon’s debt burden is 140 per cent of GDP, and economic growth will only be 2 per cent this year. Despite a ratings downgrade it has managed to place bonds with a loyal investor base of local banks and expatriates abroad, although with increased difficulty as a government has not been formed for year. Iraq had contemplated the traditional sovereign bond route for resources to handle a big internally displaced population, but abandoned plans with yield demands well above 10 per cent.In north and sub-Saharan Africa, Tunisia is inundated with Libyan refugees and Kenya has taken them from Somalia and Sudan. In Asia, Rohingya boat people from Burma have fled to Malaysia and elsewhere; and in Latin America, Mexico is a way station for Central Americans escaping violence.All these countries are included in emerging and frontier financial markets and structures could be found to tap global investors otherwise overlooked as a durable crisis funding solution. The refugee instruments could fit with World Bank and Islamic Development Bank plans to float their own special bonds for Middle East projects, and migration policy organisations and foundations have expressed interest in considering pilot issues. Middle and lower-income economies most affected, working with a dedicated task force of banks and fund managers, should pioneer landmark financial market approaches to meet the unprecedented tragedy.Gary Kleiman is Senior Partner, Kleiman International Consultants, a global emerging economy and financial market advisory firm.Back to beyondbrics"
248;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Markets and central banks forever linked;The volatility caused by markets watching central banks watching markets is not over yet;The bind between markets and central banks is beginning to resemble the ouroborus, an ancient Greek symbol for eternity that depicted a serpent swallowing its own tail.Markets focus on the timing of a possible interest rate rise in the US. The committee responsible for setting US rates focuses on volatility in markets.Economists may still think there’s a good chance of the US Federal Reserve raising rates before the end of the year, but investors put the odds at less than 33 per cent, preferring March as a more likely date.The consequence is a rebound in emerging market equities which are turning out to be one of the best performing assets of October.So far this month the MSCI index of EM equities is up 9.25 per cent while emerging market equity funds tracked by EPFR Global have just recorded their first positive weekly inflows since June.But rebounding markets are not the same thing as recovering economies.Official data released by China on Monday showed better than expected growth of 6.9 per cent between July and September but that marks a slowdown compared with last year. It was enough to drag down prices for the types of commodities exported by emerging markets.Instead, the postponement of a shift in US Federal Reserve policy in September and the decision to leave rates where they are explains why money is now drifting back into riskier assets.The cycle is now moving towards Europe. This week the European Central Bank will meet to discuss whether fresh stimulus measures are needed to ward off the threat of deflation.With the latest figures showing that annual inflation in the eurozone turned negative in September, markets seem convinced that an extension to the €1.1trn bond-buying programme is all but assured, although nothing has been confirmed.The euro is already reversing its recent rise against the dollar, dropping 21 basis points on Monday, on the grounds that more stimulus will put downward pressure on the currency. Prices for bonds are rising, pushing the yield on 10-year German bonds down to the lowest point since late August.Eternity may be stretching it, but the volatility caused by markets watching central banks watching markets is not over yet.elaine.moore@ft.com
249;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-10-08T17:26:48Z;Emerging markets: diving the wreck;Is there treasure hidden in emerging markets?;"Somewhere beneath a distant sea lies the wreck of the MSCI Emerging Market Index. It is covered by fathoms of water. It has underperformed, for example, US stocks by a watery 100 percentage points over five years. Its value has sunk by a quarter since April.Wrecks should contain treasure chests, though. The trick is finding the doubloons without being eaten by a shark. Buying the index and hoping for a little mean reversion is not a strategy, given that the commodities supercycle and associated Chinese boom may be gone for good.What the divers seek is solid stocks that have been pulled under along with the stuff that sunk the ship in the first place.Begin with the 837 stocks in the index, and cut. Commodities go first — still too early to tell if prices have bottomed. The banks go, too, as natural targets of contagion and notoriously opaque.Speaking of opaque, avoid conglomerates. Then remove political imponderables, ruling out Greece and Russia, along with companies intimately tied to government. Out go expensive companies (a price/earnings ratio over 20), highly leveraged ones, any with shrinking sales, and those not generating cash flow in line with earnings.What is left? Just 40 companies. Half of these are cyclicals, from chipmakers TSMC and SK Hynix, to Chinese carmakers, to Taiwanese component makers. There is value here for those who believe that the world is not, as many fear, inching into recession. Cheap, yes; defensive no.And then? Odds and ends. Hong Kong-listed Chinese property firms, for example, generate cash and their markets have held up well. Missing are companies with attractive valuations that provide exposure to the emerging consumer — who was at the heart of the emerging market investment thesis all along. These remain pricey. Someone, it seems, made it to the lifeboats, taking most of the treasure with them.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
250;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-10-06T13:02:49Z;A story in charts — are Asian shares the sale of the century?;Analysts are starting to see value in Asian equities as they trade near levels last seen in 1998;Emerging markets, particularly in Asia, have suffered a savage sell-off over recent months as investors panicked over China’s slowdown. While nobody can predict the future of the Chinese economy, sentiment among the money managers and bankers who move the mood of the markets has turned a corner, with many investment analysts now arguing that Asian stocks are too cheap.The MSCI index of Asian stocks has slumped to near the level it reached in the late 1990s, the time of a deep financial crisis in the region, with indebted companies going bankrupt after currency meltdowns prevented them from repaying loans they had taken out in US dollars.As this chart shows, these equities are almost the cheapest they have been so far this century — setting aside market shocks such as that generated by the September 11 terrorist attacks — on a price-to-book basis that compares market values to businesses’ net assets:Today, Asian companies are also constrained by “high levels of corporate debt,” analyst Joyce Poon of independent research house Gavekal points out in a note, after many binged on easy credit made possible by the US central bank’s money-printing campaign, which began in the wake of the credit crisis.But Asian equities have now become oversold, Ms Poon argues, explaining that “the extreme nature of the summer sell-off,” which will have hurt private investors who own Asian index tracking funds, “assumes a far higher level of financial stress than is observed”.The Gavekal analyst believes the market has “priced in a hard landing for China and the rest of the region,” which does not, in her view, appear possible.She is not alone. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg mostly expect Chinese economic growth to stay at least above 6 per cent in coming years (the numbers in the chart beyond 2014 are their forecasts) instead of any major economic crash occurring in future:Asian nations are stronger than they were in 1997-98, even withstanding the debt companies have taken on, Ms Poon argues, as they are mostly net creditors to the rest of the world, meaning they hold more in foreign exchange reserves than they owe to overseas lenders. Think, for example, of China’s massive holdings of US government bonds, which are estimated to be worth more than $1tn.HSBC’s head equity strategist for Asia, Herald van der Linde, has published a research note arguing that now could be the time to buy Chinese stocks again.Like Gavekal’s Ms Poon, he reckons they have been oversold, and “there is an upside risk that signs of stabilisation in growth in China could lead to a sharp reversal in fortunes”, for stock markets, particularly if the Beijing government decides, as it often does during slowdowns, to introduce extra economic stimulus measures, such as cranking up the pace of infrastructure investment.China’s housing market, which for several years has been the growth engine for global commodities demand, has also stopped declining quite so much in recent months.This comes after efforts by the Chinese central bank to make it easier for lenders to approve mortgages, which are now “starting to have an impact,” Mr van der Linde writes.But what should private investors, who may not have large amounts of money for high-risk investments in uncertain Asian economies, do with all this information?For those that already hold Asian funds, it could strengthen confidence to hold on, instead of joining the panic selling.And for investors with enough risk appetite, Asian-focused investment trusts that either offer a high dividend yield or trade at a discount to their net asset value, may be worth exploring.John Newlands, an investment trusts expert at Brewin Dolphin, is currently recommending Aberdeen Asset Management’s Asian Income trust.As the chart below shows, the trust is trading at a slight discount to the market value of the stocks that it holds, with a dividend yield of around 5 per cent.“The presence of a decent dividend yield tends to underpin the [stock’s] rating,” Mr Newlands says, explaining that this — combined with Aberdeen’s “experienced” Asian management team — may attract new investors into the trust, “despite the volatility in this uncertain part of the world”.
251;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-09-27T03:07:54Z;Emerging market ETFs bleed $19bn so far this year;Fears about economic conditions in developing world could lead to even bigger sell-off;Fears about deteriorating economic conditions in China, Brazil and Russia have led to a massive retreat from emerging market exchange traded funds.So far this year investors have pulled $19bn from emerging market ETFs but experts suggest these vehicles are vulnerable to much more selling pressure.Geoff Dennis, head of emerging markets equity strategy at UBS, the bank, said: “It feels like no one wants to be in emerging markets at the moment.”According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of fund managers in September, the number of investment managers that are “underweight” emerging markets is the largest since 2005.The two largest products tracking these markets — BlackRock’s MSCI emerging markets ETF and Vanguard’s FTSE emerging markets ETF — have experienced divergent levels of outflows.BlackRock’s fund suffered net withdrawals of $7.4bn, while Vanguard’s ETF, which comprises mostly retail investors who tend to be “stickier” than institutional investors, had outflows of $1.1bn.Ursula Marchioni, chief strategist at iShares, BlackRock’s ETF arm, said: “It is too early to call a bottom in emerging markets, but valuations now appear attractive.”Ritesh Samadhiya, an equity strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, said fund managers fear a possible recession in China and the threat of a broader debt crisis in emerging markets.The US Federal Reserve cited concerns over China as a factor in its decision not to increase US interest rates on September 17.BlackRock is hopeful this will improve the situation. “The Fed’s decision to hold rates could provide a boost to sentiment, but fundamentals in emerging market economies remain weak and we expect to see more volatility,” said Ms Marchioni.Since the Federal Reserve’s announcement, $1bn flowed into BlackRock’s MSCI emerging markets ETF, although this is due to some investors closing short positions and ending bets on further price weakness.Other casualties of the sell-off include BlackRock’s single-country ETFs that provide exposure to Brazil, Mexico and South Korea. Together they registered net outflows of almost $2.3bn this year.China-focused ETFs have also been subject to extreme pressure, with the Shanghai stock index down 40 per cent since its peak in late June.The iShares FTSE A50 China ETF, which is listed in Hong Kong, has seen outflows of $5.6bn this year. Mainland Chinese assets managers have also been hit by withdrawals. Harvest, China Asset Management, Huatai-Pinebridge, CSOP and E-Fund together experienced net outflows of $18bn this year.ETFs tracking Chinese markets were dented after volatile conditions led to trading suspensions of more than half the companies on the country’s two main exchanges in July.Managers insisted their Chinese ETFs traded without interruption despite the suspensions in many of the underlying stocks. This failed to convince the majority of investors to stick with their funds, and experts suggest they might not be persuaded to return.
252;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-09-20T05:21:10Z;Fund managers split over whether mining is at rock bottom;There is a bit of value appearing in the sector but dependence on slowing China still a concern;Bar-room brawls in mining towns can be bloody affairs, but they are as nothing to the battering meted out on mining shares as commodity prices slide and China’s economy slows. The MSCI metals index is down almost 30 per cent this year.Yet some fund managers who have been underweight the sector see signs that things are almost “bad enough” — as one manager puts it — to invest again.Mining company bosses, for their part, are adapting to the lower growth outlook as China makes the transition from a production-based to consumer-driven economy. With these companies’ cash flow under pressure, they have cut costs and capital expenditure to eke out returns.Reducing debt has been harder — not for big diversified miners such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, which have greater financial wiggle room, but for the likes of miner-cum-trader Glencore and Anglo American.Just weeks after releasing first-half results, Glencore has raised $2.5bn in a controversial equity placing to help preserve the investment grade credit rating on which its trading business depends. Anglo, meanwhile, has sold non-core copper and platinum assets to reduce debt.Baring Asset Management’s Clive Burstow, whose global mining fund’s assets under management have dropped from £19m to £10m since its 2012 launch, highlights the improvements that have been made.He says: “If I look back three years, mining companies have learnt a very painful lesson. Balance sheets have been restructured, capex has been cut, project pipelines trimmed and costs removed.”Despite sticking to miners with low production costs, top quality assets and balance sheet strength, BlackRock’s world mining fund— co-managed by veteran commodities investors Evy Hambro and Olivia Markham — has been emblematic of the sector sell-off.The fund’s performance is down 30.5 per cent year to date, worse than the negative 28.3 per cent return for its benchmark. Assets under management, meanwhile, have dropped to $3.4bn from $17.9bn at their peak in May 2011, according to Morningstar data.China has been roiling global markets all summer as its authoritarian leaders try to stop a huge stock bubble from bursting and its slowing economy from stallingMiners — for all their progress with financial cutbacks — have been slower to scale back production — although recent cuts by copper miners such as Glencore, BHP and Chile’s Codelco have contributed to a rebound in the red metal’s price.“The number of cuts is rising and we’ve some inklings of demand recovery, which makes me at least feel we’re near the bottom,” says Investec Asset Management’s George Cheveley. He adds: “The cuts quite often signal the bottom — but not the recovery.”Mr Cheveley, whose resources fund spans mining, energy and agriculture and has been underweight miners, says: “We’re now adding miners in our portfolio. Three months ago we preferred energy to mining. I prefer mining as much as energy now.”BlackRock also notes the “classic signs” that suggest the mining sector is reaching a cyclical bottom: Return on capital in the sector has fallen to historic lows, costs and capital expenditure have come down and many mined commodities’ prices sit well below marginal costs.While the near-term outlook for commodity prices remains subdued, the world’s largest asset manager says the risk-reward of being underweight the mining sector has “significantly reduced”.Mr Cheveley tracks metal fundamentals, looking at what physical markets and traders reveal. In recent months the premium paid above London Metal Exchange prices for immediate delivery of the red metal by Chinese buyers has more than doubled to around $120 a tonne as domestic stocks have been used up.The physical market is strong, but the equity market says it’s all over. Who’s right? There’s definitely a different mood between the physical market and equities. Demand is just — but only just — better than people think“In July, China started buying more [copper] . Traders had their busiest month in August, just as everyone was selling China,” he says, adding: “The physical market is strong, but the equity market says it’s all over. Who’s right? There’s definitely a different mood between the physical market and equities. Demand is just — but only just — better than people think.”Mr Burstow is similarly optimistic. “[Sentiment in the industry is] still not great, but better than I thought it was going to be,” he says. “There is a bit of value appearing in the sector. Maybe, just maybe, we’re getting towards some stability. I’m not calling the bottom, but it’s also the third year in succession of negative [capital expenditure] growth in the industry.“Combine [declining physical supply] with a stabilising demand outlook and we are entering a more supportive environment for the equities.”Although the sell-off has been especially tough on sector-focused funds, Orbis Investment Management is a more contrarian investor. Its involvement in the sector is limited to “nibbling” on businesses that both mine commodities and process them.Dan Brocklebank, a fund manager at the Anglo-South African investment house, strikes a more cautious note: “When you think about cycles, think about the extent of the upcycle. If you look back in 20 years’ time, I’d be surprised if this is the bottom. We haven’t seen a cathartic cleansing yet. Look at basic commodity consumption: China has about a fifth of the world’s population but consumes 55 per cent of basic commodities — that’s just not sustainable.”Mining companies have come to rely heavily on demand from China, which accounts for more than half of the world’s basic commodities demand. Concerns around the country’s economic slowdown as it shifts from a production-based to a consumer-driven economy have hammered the market value — and indeed the intrinsic value — of mining stocks.The world mining fund of BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund management house, has been hit hard by the slowdown. Its assets under management had dwindled to $3.4bn by the end of August.Miners have done what they can to palliate the effects of the downturn. Some — such as Rio Tinto — were chastened by their experience in the last downturn and moved more quickly to prioritise returns over production tonnage. They reined in costs and reduced capital expenditure, but have cut back production only recently. Many markets remain oversupplied, depressing commodity prices.BlackRock, while noting that economic conditions in China have deteriorated and demand is undershooting expectations — as is evident from declining automobile sales, deteriorating consumer sentiment and contracting steel demand— remains confident in its outlook for the world’s biggest commodity consumer.Its base case is that the Chinese administration has “the levers to pull” to manage its economic transition in an orderly way.It concedes that the outlook for commodity prices remains subdued in the near term, but expects an improvement in China’s overall commodity demand in early 2016 as stimulus feeds through with a lag effect. It has already detected early signs of improvement, notably in the property sector where prices appear to be stabilising in China’s tier one and tier two cities.Other fund managers flag the risk of further renminbi devaluation. BlackRock says the overall effect that China’s devaluation will have on commodities remains unclear — and will depend on its ultimate scale — but notes that a relatively modest devaluation could be stimulatory.Even so, it tempers its guarded optimism, warning that a larger devaluation move could have negative implications for commodity affordability in China.
253;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-09-14T13:34:32Z;Three-fifths of investors excited about Saudi Arabia opening up;Large capital inflows expected as the country starts market liberalisation;Three-fifths of institutional investors expect large capital inflows into Saudi Arabia despite the triple threat of a low oil price, a declining government surplus and a leading role in the conflict in Yemen.Nick Tolchard, head of Invesco Middle East said: “The key emphasis [of the study] is not the actual amount of money that will go to Saudi Arabia but the sentiment. It is very exciting that Saudi Arabia is liberalising.”According to the fund house’s latest Middle East asset management study, a net three-fifths of respondents predict net capital inflows into the world’s biggest oil producer. This is a big swing from the 17 per cent predicting net outflows this time last year.The annual study was based on interviews with global and regional sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurers and wealth managers. It comes after Saudi Arabia’s first step toward market liberalisation in June with the opening up of the Tadawul, the biggest stock market in the Middle East.Rami Sidani, head of Middle East and north Africa portfolio management at Schroders, which manages about $2bn in frontier market funds, added: “Saudi Arabia opening up is a big development due to the sheer size of the market, with a capitalisation of $570bn and high underlying liquidity”.Liberalisation will come in stages and with limitations, such as the 10 per cent limit on foreign ownership of the market. “Like everything Saudi does, it does it cautiously,” said Mr Sidani.Inflows will come only once Saudi Arabia is included in recognised indices, such as the MSCI Emerging Market index, added Mr Sidani.“It could be included in the MSCI index by 2017, when we expect representation of about 1.8 per cent. That could attract passive inflows of up to $25bn,” he said.A further trigger for inward flows is Saudi Arabia’s drive to diversify its economy away from oil and establish itself as a regional hub for petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing and car manufacturing.John Sfakianakis, regional director for Gulf Cooperation Council states at Ashmore, the asset manager, said: “The regional demographic dynamics, especially those related to the consumer and domestic-retail story, offer good opportunities.”Although Invesco’s survey was conducted between April and June, before the market upheaval, Mr Tolchard says institutional investors in the region are “very long term” in their thinking.Invesco did admit Saudi Arabia is volatile. The opening up of the capital markets could disappoint, the government could turn cool on future reforms and economic and political issues could resurface.The Tadawul has not been immune to China-led global turmoil. It has fallen about 9 per cent this year, less than Spain’s Ibex 35 and emerging market indices such as India’s Sensex and Mexico’s IPC.Despite increased interest in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, with its more diversified economy, remains the main regional investment destination. However, the proportion of survey respondents expecting net inflows of investable assets to the UAE has declined to almost three-quarters from closer to 90 per cent last year.
254;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-09-10T16:00:41Z;Nigeria bank governor defends policies;JPMorgan’s decision to remove country from bond index a further blow has already triggered bond and share sales, a further blow;Nigeria’s central bank governor has dismissed concerns about foreign exchange liquidity, despite JPMorgan’s removal of Africa’s biggest oil producer from its influential emerging markets bonds index amid concerns about the country’s economic management.The US bank’s decision was a further blow to Africa’s biggest economy, already battered by falling oil prices and emerging market turmoil just three months after President Muhammadu Buhari rode into office on a wave of optimism.But Godwin Emefiele questioned the reasons behind JPMorgan’s decision. “JPMorgan raised two issues, liquidity and transparency,” he told the Financial Times on Thursday.“But there [remains] a range in the volume of liquidity from between $350m to almost $400m daily, and that has never been a problem. And we’ve also addressed the issue of transparency. So I don’t really know what the issues are.”The central bank governor, whose protectionist policies and management of the foreign exchange rate has alarmed analysts, said that dollar demand was still being met, although traders say liquidity has dried up.The country’s ejection from the GBI-EM index late on Tuesday has already triggered outflows from the $2bn of local bonds the index tracks. Nigeria’s bond market regulator imposed a new spread limit on Thursday, reports said. By mid-morning on Thursday, the domestic stock market had slid nearly 3 percent to hit the biggest two-day decline in eight months.China has been roiling global markets as its leaders try to stop a huge stock bubble from bursting and its economy from stallingWith Brent crude below $45 a barrel, “the last thing Nigeria needed was exclusion” from the index, says Razia Khan, chief Africa economist at Standard Chartered bank.Nigeria will be ineligible for next re-entry for 12 months. “This could well be the crunch time, because it’s when Nigeria most needs its access to markets, external borrowing, and foreign capital,” Ms Khan added.Some investors voiced concerns on Thursday that Nigeria could also be removed from the MSCI frontier index. But investors say the bond and equity markets sell-off is of less concern than the underlying reasons JPMorgan removed Nigeria from the index three years after the country’s inclusion boosted confidence in it as an investment destination.The US bank cited tight capital controls introduced by the Nigerian central bank to prop up the naira as one reason for its decision. The naira officially trades near the central bank pegged rate of 197 to the dollar but on the black market has hit 240 to the dollar in recent months. On Wednesday, the naira firmed slightly to 221 to the dollar.The protectionist policies of Mr Emefiele and his refusal to devalue the naira again — it has already been devalued twice in the past year — have alarmed observers, as has the lack of action taken by Mr Buhari.“Nigeria needs to acknowledge that oil prices have fallen and that prices, including the FX, must adjust accordingly, even if it hurts in the short term. This is vastly preferable to entering a heterodox system that creates perverse incentives and results in permanent and ever-worsening distortions,” said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore, the emerging markets-focused asset manager. “Where is Buhari? Is he in control of economic policy at all?”Nigeria’s ejection from the index follows a tough year for policymakers managing the currency which is traced largely to the “massive macroeconomic shock” of the oil price crash for Africa’s top crude producer, said Antoon de Klerk, portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management.“There isn’t clarity yet on what direction Nigeria will take and for now, let’s say, the first priority is not the free flow of capital. So this is what we are watching. What we do have clarity on is that Buhari is working on tackling corruption and this is a positive, although the big oil shock is clearly a negative.”As frustration with his administration grows, the president’s office urges patience. More than three months since he took office, Mr Buhari has neither appointed a cabinet nor charted an economic policy vision, frustrating investors.Mr Buhari’s spokesman said on Thursday that “there is no alternative to patience” because the president is still working to clean up state institutions before appointing his cabinet. “Without clean-up there will be no change.”“Today is September 10, let us wait until the end of the month when a cabinet will be in place and an economic team will be constituted,” he said.
255;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-09-09T16:12:26Z;Nigeria rails at bond index expulsion;Index influence questioned as country ejected from JPMorgan gauge;With just a few words, JPMorgan has thrown the financial integration of Africa’s biggest economy into reverse.From the end of this month, Nigeria will be phased out of JPMorgan’s influential index of emerging market government bonds after the US bank declared that the country’s attempts to protect its currency have made transactions too complex for foreign investors.Nigeria’s inclusion in the GBI-EM index three years ago was seen as a significant moment in the west African country’s evolution, boosting its international profile and attracting new flows of overseas investment.Ejection from that index is expected to trigger significant outflows as investors who track it shed their holdings, although many were already underweight. For the next year, Nigeria will be ineligible for index re-entry, meaning the effects are likely to be long-lasting and could ripple across to both equities and the country’s currency.Decisions taken by global index providers can have profound effects, thanks to both the growth in global passive investment and the demands placed on active fund managers to measure their performance against a benchmark. JPMorgan’s EM bond index, for example, is tracked by about $200bn of assets and Nigeria, understandably, has railed against its expulsion.As they wield ever more power, investors and analysts are increasingly questioning exactly how comprehensive indices are and how influential they should be.Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore, the emerging markets-focused asset manager, considers the sector a work in progress, representing a fragment of the emerging market asset universe.The JPMorgan main index for emerging market bonds tracks just 14 countries he points out, equivalent to less than one-fifth of the possible market. The MSCI Emerging Markets index of equities includes 23 countries.“In fixed income, investment bank committees make these decisions and may or may not consult investors,” he says. “It creates a weird situation where only markets that investment banks are involved in are covered [by an index] properly.”“It is a little weird,” agrees Angelo Corbetta, head of Asian equity at Pioneer Investments. “We tend to follow MSCI and it does direct investment. Although it doesn’t stop you taking investment decisions outside it. We invest 30 to 40 per cent of our assets outside the benchmark.”In debt markets, traditional EM indices are flawed for a number of reasons, says Kevin Corrigan, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. But efforts to improve them can create their own problems.“Just like developed market bond indices, the countries that borrow the most assume the biggest weights — irrespective of how good they are as investments,” he explains.Attempting to address this by imposing caps on issuer weights run the risk of forcing investors into putting more money in more illiquid debt or bonds issued by higher risk countries, he says.But the dominance of indices provided by just a handful of providers can have dramatic consequences for the countries involved.Take Qatar. Nick Wilson, chairman of London-listed Qatar Investment Trust, points out that when Qatar was upgraded from riskier frontier status to an emerging market by MSCI in 2013, shares on the exchange experienced a significant boost, approaching a five-year high.Conversely, when index provider MSCI opted not to include China’s mainland A-share market to the leading index of emerging stock markets earlier this summer, the index dropped soon afterwards, leading to months of intense market volatility.MSCI, which added emerging markets to its classification of equity markets in 1998 and frontiers in 2007, insists that decisions regarding their composition are considered from all angles.“We never push through a change that could be contentious,” says Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI.Indices are now one of the most potent — and little understood — forces in markets, with great power over the $60tn world fund management industryGo to full seriesUAE was on MSCI’s review list for five years before it was upgraded from frontier to emerging market, he points out, although when Malaysian authorities opted to stem capital flows in and out of the country in 1998 a decision to remove it from the index was made within three weeks.“We don’t classify countries — just the markets,” he says. “That’s an important distinction to make. And in every case we know that when we make a decision regarding changes in a country’s classification it has a major impact on investors. That’s why we consult and speak to participants and continuously review. And that’s why in every case investors are provided with a time lag to make the necessary changes to invest in that country or to plan their exit from it.”While an index can be a useful tool, in emerging markets their role as classification provider is controversial, says Ewen Cameron Watt, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world’s largest fund house.“The general definition [of EM] tends to follow that of MSCI or JPMorgan,” he says. Identifying smaller groups can be more helpful than lumping such a diverse set of countries together.“We haven’t created a Brics or Mints or Next 11 definition. But we look at countries where the populations are ageing and the governments are encouraging domestic funded savings schemes: Chile, Mexico, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea. It’s one way of looking at things and there are many others. But no index should provide the sole interpretation.”
256;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-21T17:22:02Z;China currency turmoil spreads to other emerging markets;As capital flows out, fund managers caution not to tar all economies with the same brush;Currency turmoil spread across emerging markets this week, following China’s devaluation of the renminbi, with investors panicking that a rise in US interest rates could make it tough for the developing world to repay dollar-denominated debt.China’s surprise move — prompted by a deceleration of economic growth — has not only impacted emerging market currencies but also bodes ill for economies such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey which have prospered on the back of China’s voracious demand for commodities.With an estimated $1tn of investment outflows from emerging markets over the past 13 months, according to research by NN Investment Partners, investors are herding out of the sector. A group of 162 fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch have moved their so-called “underweight” positions on emerging markets to a record level, meaning they are more pessimistic about this asset class than at any point the bank has documented.The MSCI emerging markets stock index is trading at its lowest since May 2011, and the sell-off in equities is contributing to a currency rout, with the same compiler’s EM currency index having fallen to its weakest point since June 2010 as countries face mounting refinancing bills as the value of the dollar rises.Brazil’s Ibovespa equity index has lost 15 per cent of its value in just three months, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has tumbled 18 per cent lower.“Fear is feeding on itself,” said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at investment bank Jefferies, of this week’s turbulent events.Nick Price, emerging markets portfolio manager at investment house Fidelity, said he believed the fear was warranted.China’s economic growth since the global financial crisis has been underpinned by high government investment in infrastructure, he said, adding that this created “an artificial level of demand for raw materials” produced by nations such as Chile (copper), Malaysia (oil) and Brazil (iron ore).However, Mr Price cautioned that not all emerging markets were the same, and that some compelling investment themes remained.For example, while Russia’s economy is forecast to shrink by 3.6 per cent this year, India’s is expected to grow by 7.6 per cent, according to the median expectations of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Similarly, Ukraine’s dollar debt amounts to 80 per cent of GDP, Capital Economics estimates, while the figure for the Philippines is around ten per cent.“It is also worth remembering at times like this that emerging markets are home to 6bn out of the world’s 7bn people,” Mr Price added. “And in many countries the internet, for example, remains nascent,” while lower oil prices are greatly boosting the spending power of poorer householders in nations such as India.Why the panic? Paul McNamara, portfolio manager at GAM Holding, tells Roger Blitz why the markets should not have been shocked by China’s slowing economy, how it plays on the Fed’s rate hike calculations and why the bottom in emerging market currencies may soon be reached.Jefferies’ Mr Darby pinpointed Taiwan as a place that could be more resilient to the EM gloom. On a map, this archipelago resembles a tiny speck to the east of China, but it is a high-tech export powerhouse. The US is the second largest customer of its goods after China.Taiwan’s most famous US customer is Apple, whose iPhone chips are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, which has the largest weighting in the Taiex equity benchmark. TSMC’s shares are trading near record lows, although the company’s July sales were 25 per cent ahead of the same month last year.The Taiex index, meanwhile, has hit a two-year low, valued at 12.1 times earnings, its cheapest valuation in nine years, and offering a 4.2 per cent dividend yield.Gareth Leather, an emerging markets expert at London-based consultancy Capital Economics, said he was relatively positive about Mexico, which he thinks is “well placed to benefit from the recovery in the US”.Mr Leather was also optimistic about the Philippines, because of what he describes as “strong growth, low dollar debt, the current account surplus and encouraging political reforms, as well as some infrastructure investment”.We have just seen a perfect storm. Markets gave a strong warning to the bulls and underlined why many people chose balanced or cautious funds to limit sudden swings into loss on their investments. In recent weeks some markets have issued a timely reminder of why investment specialists usually recommend a spread of assets to limit your risks. This summer has brought big falls in some markets.Continue readingThe Philippines’ PSI benchmark stock index has fallen 6 per cent so far this year, but Fidelity’s Mr Price said the Asian nation had “one of the best sets of macroeconomic indicators,” adding, “I do not think company valuations are egregious”.Investors seeking to pick an emerging markets fund may be challenged to find a manager who can outperform the overall asset class, as professional stock pickers remain relatively constrained by mandates that force them to stay close to a benchmark index.Data provided by the New Zealand-based Copley Fund Research shows that Samsung, Tencent and TSMC — the largest members of the MSCI emerging markets index by weighting — are also the largest stock position held by 78 of 122 EM funds Copley has analysed.This, according to the researchers, highlights “the need for many funds to keep within a certain benchmark tolerance” which in turn puts them at great risk of being slammed by generalised negative sentiment towards emerging markets.However, individual investors have more freedom to dip into individual countries. Providers of exchange traded funds such as Vanguard and iShares offer a range of stock market trackers, with the Philippines, Taiwan and Mexico all in the mix.
257;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-20T14:08:40Z;Commodity surpluses set to rise as renminbi helps China producers;Renminbi slide set to boost domestic production;China’s weaker currency could help producers of some commodities in the country who are struggling to survive as prices move below the cost of production.The renminbi made its biggest single-session decline in two decades after a surprise devaluation last week. It followed the direction of other emerging market currencies, which have fallen to their lowest level since 2010, according to an MSCI index.Along with weaker oil prices, the pattern is helping miners operating at the so-called marginal cost of production, who are only just making a profit at current prices.A weaker currency raises the cost of imported raw materials, making domestically produced resources more attractive. For China, it could mean a boost for coal, iron ore and aluminium production.The extent of the effect of a weaker renminbi will differ for each commodity. China accounts for more than half of the world’s production of aluminium and steel and over 70 per cent of thermal and metallurgical coal, according to Macquarie. But it only produces 10 per cent of the world’s iron ore, a key steelmaking ingredient.All these materials are already in oversupply, which has driven prices down. Aluminium prices hit their lowest level in six years this week, while coal futures are at a 12-year low. A weaker currency effect, therefore, could temporarily send prices even lower as supply keeps growing.“In a situation where we are dealing with oversupply of commodities and where Chinese mines are often the marginal producer, any devaluation of the renminbi makes removal of marginal supply harder,” says Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein.Outside China, large miners have already felt the benefit of falling emerging market currencies. The Australian dollar hit a six-year low last week, and the Chilean peso recently touched a 12-year low against the dollar.Kazakhstan’s currency lost more than 20 per cent of its value at the start of trading on Thursday, after the government announced it would allow it to float freely. That has boosted shares in Kaz Minerals, a copper producer listed in London, which rose 19 per cent on the news.Miner and commodities trader Glencore said this week that 42 per cent of the price impact on its earnings in the first half of the year was offset by cost reductions and currency movements.In coal, Chinese imports traditionally balanced the seaborne market. But a weaker renminbi could further cheapen China’s domestic price compared with global prices. That could worsen the downward trend of China’s imports, which fell nearly 34 per cent for the first seven months of the year.It has become a running joke over the past week that devaluing its currency was the best thing China did to stop people talking about its wild share market. And that the best way to stop people talking about devaluing the currency was to get people talking about the share market. Mission accomplished. How frenetic has share trading been?Continue readingChina’s domestic coal production has already been supported by policy. This year Beijing banned the burning of coal with a high ash and sulphur content, which hit Australian imports.In thermal coal “a weaker renminbi is set to widen the gap with domestic coal prices, and we expect spot demand from Chinese buyers is likely to contract significantly until the price differential narrows once again”, Goldman Sachs says.Coal makes up a large share of production for global mining houses such as Glencore and Rio Tinto.Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore, said this week that China’s coal imports could fall to around 130m tonnes this year from 200m tonnes last year. However, that is likely to be made up by demand from Indonesia, he said.In aluminium, current prices are putting pressure on more than 4m tonnes worth of production outside China, and 6m tonnes inside the country, according to Goldman Sachs. But the bank forecasts the longest period of weak marginal producer margins in a generation, at two years, due to lower costs, subsidies and the fact that most of the easy cuts outside China have already been made.Most Chinese smelters purchase raw materials from local suppliers, with only a minority importing alumina or bauxite and paying in US dollars, so the currency should help their costs, according to consultancy CRU.Roger Blitz and Jane Foley of Rabobank discuss the repercussions of China’s economic weakness, with emerging market fundamentals laid bare and the Fed’s dilemma over when to move on interest rates intensified.“A weaker renminbi will boost the profitability of Chinese aluminium exports, maintaining pressure on prices in the globally oversupplied market and reduce earnings of European and US primary aluminium producers,” says Elena Nadtotchi, vice-president and mining analyst at Moody’s.Still, the effect of the currency is not likely to be that dramatic on exports as the price differentials that incentivised shipments of aluminium products has already disappeared, according to Eoin Dinsmore, an analyst at CRU.In iron ore, a weaker renminbi is likely to prolong the life of marginal producers in China, according to Georgi Slavov, head of research at broker Marex Spectron. Before China’s devaluation, he estimates that about 5.5m tonnes a month of Chinese iron ore production was being displaced because of low prices.“Part of this now will be reversed,” he says. “It is basically a hidden subsidy for local iron ore production, which has been struggling for a number of years to control its costs.”
258;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
259;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-17T09:21:44Z;Smart beta’s new kids on the index block;Fresh breed of indexers seek to demonstrate new ways to beat the market;“Can I create an algorithm to be Warren Buffett? No,” says Baer Pettit, head of index strategy at MSCI. “But over time, can I do a lot of what he does systematically? Maybe. You can at least avoid the same things that he avoided.”His question highlights a new direction for index providers. While once they merely attempted to reflect markets passively, now they are actively involved in finding quantitative strategies that capture what the best active managers do to beat the market, and turning them into transparent indices that can be the basis for investment products.The trend, one of the most powerful in the global investment management industry, is now universally known as “smart beta”. According to Mark Makepeace, who runs the FTSE Russell index group, smart beta strategies account for between 60 and 70 per cent of requests for new products from its clients. It is clients who typically produce the idea, although FTSE Russell — like all its competitors — maintains a growing team of experts in quantitative finance to work on strategies.“The quant house in FTSE Russell is as big as at any investment bank,” he says.According to the latest survey of international fund management by Create-Research in the US, smart beta currently accounts for about $300bn in assets, or about 18 per cent of the assets of US-listed equity exchange traded funds. The expectation seems almost universal that they will grow from here.There are many variants, but the concept is clearly illustrated by Research Affiliates, founded 10 years ago, which developed the FTSE-RAFI indices. These take standard FTSE indices and reweight them according to a basket of stocks’ fundamentals, such as sales, earnings and dividends.And the results, back-tested over 15 years, have been impressive. Despite the criticism that “fundamental indexing” is little more than a different name for the value style (buying stocks that look cheap), its performance has looked respectable in the tough environment for value of the last few years.Other popular smart beta strategies screen stocks according to their dividend yield, or aim for low-volatility, or attempt to capture stocks with strong momentum.Such indices directly counteract one of the chief criticisms of traditional passive investing, which weights stocks in an index according to their current market value. Critics contend that this allows bubbles to form by guiding money towards the most overvalued stocks or, in bond indices, the most heavily indebted debt issuers. As George Cooper, author of The Origin of Financial Crises and a critic of index investing, puts it: smart beta is “quite a healthy development, because it fractures and diversifies the investment community,” and mitigates the natural human tendency to herd around the hottest stocks.But smart beta also raises the risk of confusion. Different indexers develop and trademark indices to capture similar strategies. The gaps in performance of apparently similar indices can be startlingly wide.The popular area of investing in stocks with high and increasing dividends is a good example. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index, base for a $13bn ETF, has made a total return of 98.4 per cent since June 2006. Over the same period the Nasdaq Rising Dividend Achievers index, basis for a $19.8bn ETF, has a total return of 62.08 per cent, and the WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend index has a return of 83.52 per cent.Even if the ideas come from elsewhere, index providers are critical components of smart beta. The point of the exercise is to reduce costs compared to a normal active quantitative fund. That requires linking to a publicly available index, which makes it possible to package a product as an ETF, and ensuring that the index does not involve such high turnover that trading costs eat up any superior performance.With costs at issue, the fees charged for licensing indexes, and for end investors, are under downward pressure. This is heightened by competition. The biggest indexers all benefit from what Nasdaq refers to as historic “flagship” indices, which are well entrenched, such as the FTSE 100 for UK stocks or the S&P 500 for US large stocks.Indices are now one of the most potent - and little understood - forces in markets, with great power over the $60tn world fund management industryGo to full seriesThere are no such entrenched players in smart beta. The field is up for grabs, with a real risk that new entrants could establish themselves. Most prominently WisdomTree, a New York-based ETF provider, develops its own indices and, according to research group ETFGI, it is now the tenth most widely used index provider by ETFs.Emerging Global Advisors, another ETF provider, takes a similar approach. “The pros are the third party and the brand. You pay a small fee, but the view was that you needed someone else’s imprimatur. Now, the market doesn’t care who draws it up,” says Nick Smithie, its head of research. Having an in-house index division “gives us more freedom and speed to market”.The established players will not cede the ground easily. Alex Matturri of S&P Dow Jones suggests that new entrants will still need to show that they are following the same processes as the bigger players. “Regulators look at our business now, in a way they didn’t five years ago. They want to know: ‘What’s your business continuity planning?’ We have to be open 24 hours. People ask these questions now. If there’s an index you are tracking, you have to know that it will be available when needed.”Treat smart beta investing as an active strategy / From Jeremy Baskin
260;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-16T20:05:39Z;Investing: The index factor;FT series: Indices have become one of the most potent forces in markets;"It seemed a mundane statement. MSCI, the New York-based index provider that runs the most widely accepted benchmarks of the emer­ging markets, had decided against a proposal to add China’s domestic A-shares to its main indices.The company explained that China had still not shown that A-shares — open to non-Chinese only through a steadily expanding quota system — were sufficiently available to overseas investors. It also announced a joint working group with the China Securities Regulatory Commission with a view to adding A-shares by 2017. This innocuous sounding announcement turned out to be one of the catalysts for the huge sell-off in the Chinese stock market that sparked alarm around the world. It also offers a dramatic demonstration of the rising influence of the index.Indices and the companies that calculate them have grown so powerful that they do not just track markets, but move them. With some critics contending that they help to inflate investment bubbles, the role that indexers play is facing closer scrutiny from regulators.MSCI’s decision on China mattered because some $1.7tn in global assets are benchmarked against its emerging markets index, making it the dominant benchmark of the sector. None of that is in A-shares. Even MSCI’s modest proposal to admit A-shares to the index at only 5 per cent of their total market value would have forced investment managers to switch at least $20bn into A-shares. Any subsequent decision to admit A-shares at their full market value could mean as much as $400bn at current values switching from other emerging nations such as South Korea or Brazil into China’s internal market.In these circumstances, any decision MSCI took would inevitably move the market. This raises the ire of critics.According to George Cooper, a fund manager and author of The Origin of Financial Crises, “the big beef” involved in tracking an index is that “you mech­anically lend most to the biggest borrowers, and buy the most overinflated stocks”. He draws an analogy with road safety: “Imagine a motorway where cars all benchmark their speed to everyone else. Then imagine what happens if everyone is trying to be a little faster than everyone else. They end up crashing.”Paul Woolley, head of the London School of Economics’ Centre for the Study of Capital Market Dysfunctionality, suggests that market benchmarks inflate bubbles and should be abandoned altogether, in favour of comparing fund managers to rises or falls in gross domestic product. “When used as benchmarks for active management, market cap indices carry perverse in­centives that impair fund returns, distort prices and make them an inefficient basis for passive investment,” he says.Index providers themselves strongly disagree. “It’s a theoretically valid concern but we are very, very far from it being structural,” says Baer Pettit, MSCI’s head of index strategy. “The 1929 and 1999 bubbles weren’t about indexation. Neither was the tulip bubble [of 1637]. I’d love to see empirical evidence that validates that point. There isn’t a lot of it.”Indexers’ power derives partly from the growing number of funds managed “passively” to follow an index. Indices provide the basis for futures markets and for exchange traded funds — that by design must directly track indices. ETFs were introduced only 25 years ago but now manage more than $3tn globally.But active managers, who merely use the MSCI index as a benchmark, would also have been obliged to buy A-shares. They know that big pension fund managers and their consultants will decide whether to allocate them money based on their performance compared with the MSCI benchmark. Not buying A-shares would have been too great a career risk.Not only are the indexers powerful, but that power is concentrated in a few hands. Consolidation has left three big companies — S&P Dow Jones, FTSE Russell and MSCI — jointly providing the benchmarks for 73 per cent of US mut­ual fund assets, worth some $9.4tn. In bonds, the indices overseen by Barclays are dominant. Its bond aggregates (formerly known as the Lehman Aggregates) account for more than half of all ETF assets held in fixed income.Indexing has become a big business. In the case of the world’s largest ETF, the $177bn SPDR, which tracks the S&P 500, S&P Dow Jones receives a licence fee of a little over 0.03 per cent of assets, currently equivalent to more than $50m a year.Yet despite their power, indexers are little understood. James Breech, who runs Cougar Global Investments, a Canadian firm that allocates money to index-tracking exchange traded funds for wealthy clients, offers this confession: “When we tell our clients that we look at index construction, they say they never thought about it. Even advisers don’t pay attention. End investors have no idea whatever.”This is a recent phenomenon. Fifty years ago, indices were simple averages produced by newspapers and academics using slide rules, to help gauge the general direction of the market. They covered only stocks. The FT-30 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average provided a crude guide to how the market was performing, and investment managers did not pay them close attention.Now, computerisation has revolutionised them. With benchmarks for stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate and many other assets, there are far more indices in the world than there are stocks. S&P Dow Jones, the biggest indexing company, alone calculates more than 1m indices each day.According to Mr Pettit: “The rise of indexation over the past 15 years, as it strengthens trends in markets towards transparency, is a good thing for savers and investors. There has been a huge rise in the quality of financial information systems from 1980 to 2000.”Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, says: “Why do we calculate a million indices every night? Because there’s a demand for that.”With so much at stake, providers have to avoid conflicts of interest — particularly in bonds, where the main indices are controlled by banks, who themselves have businesses issuing bonds. In the wake of the Libor scandal, in which traders manipulated a benchmark for their own profit, banks are aware that bond indices could open them to legal risks. Barclays has been exploring a sale of its index business — for a price tag that could exceed $1bn — since last year.Even if banks’ indices do not change hands, independent operators believe there is room in the market for them. “Our job is to capture market share,” says S&P’s Mr Matturri. “I think we can. Three years ago it was hard to launch fixed income indices. Post the Libor scandal, people understand the conflicts in the business when you aren’t an independent provider.”Indexers go out of their way to use their power responsibly, as MSCI demonstrated with a long and transparent consultation before making its decision on China’s A-shares. Their rules are published and transparent, overseen by boards that include big investors. The major indexers themselves have no vested interest in whether an index goes up or down.Mark Makepeace, CEO of FTSE Russell, contends that the power truly belongs with indexers’ ultimate clients, the big investing institutions such as BlackRock and Vanguard. “If we do a rule change, we have to consult with the institutions. The power is with them. We only make changes with their support. They do have the ability to choose between us and MSCI.”However, index providers do have the final say over which stocks, bonds or countries go into which index. And once an index becomes dominant, more or less any change, however it is organised, will move the market.For example, Russell indices follow very transparent rules, meaning that alert investors can calculate in advance which stocks will be moving in and out of its indices on the day each June when its indices are reshuffled.This is almost always the busiest US trading day each year. This year, Nicholas Colas of Convergex in New York calculated that, from the start of May, the 120 stocks to be added to the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gain­ed 11 per cent, while those being deleted fell 2 per cent and those facing promotion to the less widely tracked Russell 1000 index of larger stocks barely moved. The transparency warped and changed the market outcome.But the alternative, of leaving some discretion, also has drawbacks. S&P fills vacancies in its S&P 500 index of big US companies whenever they arise, usually through mergers. It attempts to maintain a balance between sectors and to avoid companies that have not yet built a history of trading profitably. This gives its committee some discretion, and frequently creates controversy. Facebook and Google were already huge companies when they joined. The stocks it adds invariably rise sharply on the an­nouncement — annoying fund managers who say this makes the index prohibitively hard to beat, just as the Russell’s transparency makes it easy to beat.How deeply the indices warp markets remains hotly disputed. Most bond indices are weighted according to how much debt a company or country has issued. This means that the more indebted an issuer becomes, the bigger share it will take in the index, and the more of its debt passive funds will be required to buy. This is why many funds were led to load up on Argentine debt before its default crisis.But there are also concerns about the use of indexing in equities. Most indices are weighted according to market capitalisation. That means the more a company’s price grows, the more index-trackers will be required to buy of it, open­ing them up to accusations that they help to inflate bubbles.A second charge is that indexing at­tacks market efficiency. The more money passively tracking indices, the less devoted to seeking out underpriced stocks. If all money were managed passively, markets would cease to function.Dave Gedeon, managing director of Nasdaq indices, suggests there are natural counterweights. “The more money tracks passive, the more opportunity there is for active managers who can demonstrate value. They should be able to find more opportunities in certain assets,” he says.A final concern is that indices alter perceptions. The growing field of behavioural finance — applying insights from behavioural psychology — suggests this could create anomalies. For example, fund managers now generally refer to themselves as being “overweight” in a stock, rather than saying that they own it, showing that their thinking is dominated and framed by their index. With so few providers now dominating the market, Peter Atwater, of Financial Insyghts, a US consultancy, suggests there is “an oligopoly of confidence”.This matters because subtle differen­ces in methodology lead to huge differences in outcomes and perceptions. The three most widely followed indices of commodities give a radically different picture (see above) of how raw materials prices have performed since the crisis, largely bec­ause they give very different weights to oil.Within equities, Mr Breech points out big differences between the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, two rival indices of US smaller companies. The Russell is based solely on market value, and is of great interest to academics; but the S&P tends to perform better, because it requires that companies have a record of making profits before it includes them, and because it sets a much higher standard for liquidity. “We always used the Russell 2000 as our small-cap index, but then I realised that people like it because it’s easy to beat. If you’re an institution you’d rather have a benchmark that’s easy to beat. For us, an ETF is a means of access to securities. We care what we own and we want profitable companies.”When indices were merely used as general measuring sticks, such issues did not matter. Now that they are the building blocks for multibillion-dollar products, they matter a lot.Yet most investors remain blissfully ignorant of this. Nick Smithie, chief investment strategist at Global Advisors, a small New York-based ETF provider that creates its own indices, puts it this way: “We never get asked about the brand of index we are using. Nobody ever says, if that’s not an S&P index we won’t buy it, or anything like that.”If such thinking takes wider hold, the big index providers might yet be displaced. For now, they remain among the most powerful, if least heralded, players on the financial markets.Indexation, bubbles and circumstantial evidence / From Stephen Swift"
261;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-14T15:23:33Z;Book review: Cracking The Emerging Markets Enigma;;"How do you classify the countries known as emerging markets (EM)? That question has become more relevant since the FT declared the EM term unhelpful and obsolete as a definition.So what should replace the EM term? Alexander Kozhemiakin recently argued that investors should look at the risks affecting an EM’s growth to get a sense of how safe their investments in particular markets might be.Andrew Karolyi, a professor of Emerging Market Finance at Cornell’s Johnson School, however, also focuses on measuring risk, and has come up with a matrix to do so. In his book “Cracking the Emerging Markets Enigma”, Karolyi ranks 57 emerging markets and developed markets by averaging their score on six components.He concludes that Venezuela is the most vulnerable of all markets, and Taiwan the strongest. While that conclusion may not raise eyebrows, the way he got to it might. Before we get to that, take a look at the EM scores, which vary from a theoretical normalized maximum of +2.5 to a minimum of -2.5:Venezuela, as indicated earlier, stands out as the only country to have a score lower than -1.5, at -1.83. In addition, five more countries score particularly poorly: Egypt, Pakistan,Russia, Nigeria and Vietnam. On the positive end, Taiwan edges out South Korea and Malaysia, while Slovenia, South Africa and Israel are the only other MSCI “emerging markets” to have a positive score. Among the developed markets, finally, the median score is a positive 0.63, higher than any of the emerging markets, though individual countries did score lower than the highest scoring EM ones.To get to these scores, Karolyi adds a mind-boggling amount of variables: in all, each country is scored on over 70 variables, spread out over 6 components. The components measure:1. Market capacity constraints, including the scope, breadth and activity of a particular country’s capital markets (Taiwan comes out best,Venezuela worst)2. Operational inefficiencies, including mechanical and technical inefficiencies of trading systems(South Korea comes out best,Nigeria worst).3. Foreign accessibility restrictions, that limit foreign ownership, currency convertibility, or repatriation, amongst others (Poland comes out best,Pakistan worst.4. Corporate opacity, based on elements such as (the lack of )disclosure requirements and (the presence of) voluntary reporting (South Korea comes out best,China worst).5. Limits to legal protections, through the presence or absence of anti-director rights, anti-self dealing rules, and judicial (in)efficiencies (Malaysia comes out best,Venezuela worst).6. Political instability, the lack of democratic institutions and regulatory burdens (Chile comes out best,Venezuela worst).Each individually, those components have their merit to be included as investment predictors, but also their shortcomings. (Why, for example, would you put indicators that are relevant to traders, such as trading systems inefficiencies, next to indicators that are important to equity investors, such as political instability?)Time will tell whether Karolyi’s 70 indicators will give a more or less reliable ranking as the much more publicised Bloomberg Magazine Ranking of Most-Promising Emerging and Frontier Markets, which uses only very straightforward indicators: projected GDP growth, price-to-book ratio of the primary equity index, two-year sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Rank.Nevertheless, it is clear after wading through pages statistical formulations, footnotes and academic arguments that Karolyi’s matrix is far more detailed and intricately engineered than other alternatives.The reader may raise an eyebrow, however, at the lag in the dataset, which uses 2012 data to calculate the country ranking (and as we all know, a lot has changed since then in many EMs). Another flaw of the book is that the author doesn’t distinguish between different types of EM investors, giving a final ranking for all types of investment asset – bonds, stocks, private equity investments – as if they were driven by the same considerations, which of course they are not.But despite those shortcomings, the best argument in favor of Karolyi’s ranking and book may be that it has proved visionary. Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria, to name three countries which made arguably some of the worst EM headlines in 2015, were all in the top 5 of Karolyi’s most risky EMs to invest in, based on 2012 data. At the same time, China scored worse than India, and of the top 5 best scoring countries, all but Malaysia actually had a positive stock index evolution in the years following Karolyi’s calculations.Of course, data can only prove so much, and even the best statistical regression cannot predict some of the events affecting emerging markets. But in times where people seem to have a penchant for rankings, it is reassuring to see that there is finally a ranking for EMs that makes sense both from an academic and a real world perspective.Further reading

262;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-04T18:57:32Z;Emerging market investors dominated by indices;Crowding into a small slice of the market results in price distortions;"International investors are slaves to indices. Most of the time, they limit themselves to buying only stocks and bonds that are included in indices put together by index providers such as MSCI and JPMorgan.This severely narrows their investable universe. According to the Institute of International Finance, only about $2.8tn out of $12.6tn in emerging market bonds and about $7.5tn out of $24.7tn in EM equities are bought or sold by foreign investors. The rest, they simply ignore.The result is not only a lot of missed opportunities. It means that investors end up exposed to risks they might otherwise avoid. It can also produce sharp movements in asset prices that have little or nothing to do with the assets themselves.“It’s a huge problem,” says Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management. As bond yields have fallen, he says, global fixed income investors have become more and more “passive” as a way to avoid fees charged by ‘active’ fund managers. “So they only invest in what goes into an index.”He notes that the main EM local currency government bond index, JPMorgan’s GBI-EM, contains bonds from just 16 countries. “Of $6.7tn [of such bonds], only 14 per cent is in the index. You are narrowing to an incredibly thin slice of securities and doing that along with all the other guys.”But it is not only “passive” investors who are in the sway of indices. In a recent paper — International Asset Allocations and Capital Flows: The Benchmark Effect — Sergio Schmukler of the World Bank and colleagues divided mutual funds into four groups: index trackers, which try to match the performance of a benchmark index, often by buying the same assets; closet trackers, which claim to be more active but hug their benchmarks closely; mildly active funds; and truly active funds, which typically hold a much narrower selection of securities than their benchmark. Their analysis showed that about 5 per cent of global bond funds and 20 per cent of equity funds were index trackers or closet trackers. The rest were mildly or truly active.But even the most active funds measure their performance against a benchmark and this, the report found, has a big impact on their investment decisions. When the composition of a benchmark changed, the authors found, 97 per cent of that change was transmitted to tracker funds. For closet trackers, 96 per cent was transmitted; for mildly active funds the figure was 87 per cent and even for funds found by the authors to be truly active, the figure was 60 per cent.“Even if a fund doesn’t follow its benchmark one to one, the fact that it follows it 50 per cent will be enough to move the market,” says Mr Schmukler.The paper illustrates the point by showing what happened when Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were upgraded from frontier to emerging market status by MSCI, the leading EM equity index provider. The upgrades were announced on June 11, 2013 and took effect on June 1, 2014. Shares on both countries’ exchanges that were included by MSCI enjoyed a significant boost on both dates; shares not included in the index did not.A similar effect can be seen in China’s A shares in June this year. Many investors expected MSCI to include the Shanghai exchange in its main index. After MSCI surprised many on June 8 by announcing its decision not, after all, to include A shares, the index began its precipitous fall."
263;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-03T18:00:20Z;Emerging markets: Redrawing the world map;The term has become obsolete, say critics, as developing markets overtake developed ones in some areas;"When Matteo Ricci, the Italian 16th century Jesuit missionary, travelled to China to win converts to his faith, he found that his European maps, which showed China relegated to the cartographical margins, failed to endear him to his hosts. So he redrew them. The resulting world map of 1602 placed China at its centre, an accommodation that is said to have helped him win influence among the Middle Kingdom’s elite.Ricci’s revisions were made on woodcuts and paper. Now, commentators say, it is the world’s mental map that is in dire need of an overhaul, particularly when it comes to the practice of categorising countries as “emerging” or “developed” markets.The current economic hierarchy, which places emerging nations at the periphery and developed markets at the core of world affairs, no longer accurately describes a world in which EM countries contribute a bigger share to global gross domestic product than their developed counterparts, when measured by purchasing power parity. Nor does the capacious category, which lumps together countries of such diverse economic strengths as China and the Czech Republic, serve to illuminate crucially different realities between these nations.“The EM term has outgrown its usefulness,” says Michael Power, strategist at Investec, a fund management company. “The term today embraces big and small, developed and under-developed, industrialised and agrarian, manufacturing and commodity-based, rich and poor, deficit runners and surplus runners, and I could go on,” he adds. At issue are not merely the niceties of symmetry and order. Emerging markets is one of the most powerful definitions in the world, with an estimated $10.3tn invested in emerging financial markets via an alphabet soup of equity and bond indices. But these indices embrace such a collection of incongruous assets, that they misdirect investors and potentially reduce returns to pension funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions.As emerging markets overtake developed ones in some areas the FT investigates whether it is time to coin a new phrase for the developing powersThe term also forms one of the organising principles for global databases and an analytical starting point for those seeking insights into economic, environmental, social and other trends that shape the world. But this, commentators say, generates flawed perceptions and fuzzy arguments that impact on the efficiency of global governance.“As an asset class, EM equities are nearly finished,” says John Paul Smith at Ecstrat, an investment consultancy. “The old paradigm is dead.”Already, some commentators are proposing alternatives to the definition, seeking to identify ordering principles and shared dynamics among clusters of developing countries. This, they hope, will allow institutions, companies and multilateral organisations to assess more accurately the balance of risk and opportunity in large parts of the world.At its inception, “emerging market” was not designed as a definition with specific criteria. Antoine van Agtmael, then an economist at the International Financial Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, coined it as a marketing catchphrase in the 1980s.Michael Power argues that any static grouping, such as Brics, inevitably loses relevance over time and that a more dynamic system is needed.Continue readingThe attraction was clear: it sounded aspirational. Countries previously known by monikers such as “less developed” or “third world” were suddenly imbued with the promise that they might be on a journey towards something better.Since the 1980s, the stunning success of the term has spawned several attempts to nail down a set of commonly recognised characteristics — with the unintended consequence that different organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, the UN and financial index providers such as MSCI, JPMorgan and FTSE use a clutter of conflicting criteria to categorise emerging markets.Adding to the confusion, the term is sometimes used to describe equity, bond or currency markets in developing countries and sometimes to describe the countries themselves. Different criteria make a world of difference. The MSCI equity index identifies 23 emerging markets countries and puts 28 into a “frontier emerging markets” category. The IMF, by contrast, defines 152 “emerging and developing economies”.Even accepting prevailing classifications, it is often unclear why one country has been awarded emerging status while another merits a developed tag. Chile has a bigger economy, a bigger population, less debt and lower unemployment than Portugal but is classed as emerging, whereas the European nation remains part of the developed world. Similarly, on a per-capita income basis, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Korea are wealthier than several developed countries, but are still consigned to the emerging camp.We are interested to gauge the views of Financial Times readers in this important debate on whether it is time — or not — to redefine the way we look at the investment world. We therefore invite you to answer the following three questions and undertake to publish the results.
Participate below>Such judgments often depend on the classifier. Providers of financial indices look at issues such as the freedom with which international investors can access the stocks and bonds of a particular country. Others such as the IMF consider questions about the diversity of a country’s economy, in terms of how many products they import and export. Increasingly, the sense that emerging nations take their lead in global affairs from the so-called developed world is also under examination. In some senses, emerging economies already wield power. When calculated by purchasing power parity, which takes account of exchange rate changes, developed countries account for only 43 per cent of global GDP, down from 54 per cent in 2004.Developed markets are also weaker, in aggregate, when it comes to the size of their foreign exchange reserves, the huge stashes of money that accumulate when a country notches up trade surpluses and attracts foreign direct investment. Developed markets hold $3.97tn, compared with $7.52tn for developing countries, according to IMF data.This leads to the curious situation in which emerging nations, which need
to invest their reserves in large liquid debt markets, have ended up bankrolling years of deficit-financed excess in large developed countries. China, for instance, was the biggest foreign buyer of US Treasury debt for six years until early 2015.But aside from the various ways in which the EM tail appears to be wagging the developed dog, the broad inclusion of scores of countries glosses over crucial differences between emerging nations, misleading observers to construe equivalence where none exists.Sree Ramaswamy, senior fellow at McKinsey Global Institute, says that key determinants of a country’s economic dynamism and resilience often come down to “economic structure, industry dynamics, corporate landscape and role of government or social and political make-up”.“When it comes to these indicators, the differences between emerging markets outweigh their similarities,” Mr Ramaswamy argues.“For instance, capital investment makes up 20 per cent of GDP in Mexico, but 45 per cent in China. Household consumption makes up 50 per cent of GDP in South Korea but 70 per cent in Turkey,” he adds. “The populations of China and India are similar in size but their demographic trends are very different. So is the corporate landscape; 60 per cent of Latin America’s corporate revenue is held by family controlled firms but in India it is 50 per cent and in China 30 per cent.”To many, the problem of how to classify China highlights the emerging market dilemma. In PPP terms, China is already the world’s largest economy and yet it is still classified as emerging. The country has a literacy rate of 96 per cent, more high-speed rail track than all other countries combined and more college students than any other country.Its near $8tn stock market is the world’s second largest after the US and its $5.5tn domestic bond market ranks third in the world after those of the US and Japan. Nevertheless, its domestic equities, not counting those listed in Hong Kong, and its bonds feature only marginally in the MSCI EM Index and JPMorgan EMBI+, the world’s leading equity and bond indices.As a result much of the investment opportunity and risk that Chinese assets represent remains largely sequestered from global investors. In June, MSCI decided not to include China’s A-share stock market into the index because of governance concerns.The term began as a euphemism for the pejorative-sounding “third world” but, as the FT argues, “emerging market” now stands for a haphazard collection of countries.Continue readingInclusion in an index may sound like a relatively minor detail but, in fact, such indices pack an enormous financial clout. The competence of fund managers is assessed by their ability, or failure, to generate returns that exceed those of the dominant index in their asset class. This results in an industry-wide tendency to buy stocks or bonds that are included in an index, thus reducing the risk that a fund manager will egregiously underperform it.Inducting even a mere slice of the huge Chinese stock and bond markets into emerging market indices would create a financial earthquake, effectively forcing fund managers with ambitions to match an index’s performance into loading up on Chinese assets.Peter Marber, fund manager at Loomis Sayles, echoes a widely held view that China’s size may break the emerging market mould.“China is so enormous that if it goes [fully] into EM indices it will dwarf everything, so it is required to treat China as a separate category,” he says. But if China stands outside such indices, the case for India to be treated as separate may also harden, hastening the disintegration of emerging market indices.As it is, Mr Marber says, emerging market indices mix investment assets that range from “garbage” to high quality, rendering investors unable to properly assess risk and dissuading them from investing.These contradictions threaten to consign the term emerging markets to the dustbin. But if it follows the likes of “third world” into virtual extinction, its passage will raise the question of what, if anything, should replace it.Rethink the grouping of world economies / From Tom Wynter"
264;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-08-03T18:00:19Z;Q&A: What is an emerging market?;It groups economies as diverse as China and the Czech Republic but what does it really mean?;What is an emerging market?The term began as a euphemism for the pejorative-sounding “third world” but, as the FT argues, “emerging market” now stands for a haphazard collection of countries with varying economic sizes and growth rates.The classification matters primarily because of index providers such as MSCI and JPMorgan that have a major influence over how international portfolio investors allocate their money. An estimated $10.3tn is invested in so-called emerging markets.This helps explain why Greece’s stock market actually rallied when the country was demoted from developed to emerging status by MSCI in November 2013. Less than $200m of passive money tracking developed market indices would seep out of Greece as a result, according to one HSBC estimate, while inflows from emerging markets investors could top $1bn.Just how many emerging markets are there?According to the International Monetary Fund 152. Just 23, says MSCI.The IMF classification basically comes from dividing the world in two: advanced economies, and emerging and developing economies. Its criteria are per capita income, export diversification and degree of integration into the global financial system.MSCI, by contrast, approaches the issue from the point of view of investible equities, so its division of the world into developed, emerging and frontier markets is based on the level of market access to foreign investors, and standards of size and liquidity.MSCI offers a Frontier Emerging Markets Index, with 163 equities from 28 countries — of which four: Colombia, Egypt, Peru and the Philippines are also represented in its Emerging Markets Index. Launched in 1988 it includes the shares of 838 listed companies from just 23 countries including 85 per cent of the market capitalisation of equities in each nation, weighted according to free float (the shares available to investors).Do emerging markets actually emerge?It is one of the most powerful definitions in the world and accounts for investment of more than $10tn. But with developing markets overtaking developed ones in some areas the term has become obsolete, say criticsContinue readingNot really. Argentina once had developed status and lost it — as did Greece. Japan and Singapore are widely said to have gained developed status since the second world war, but others, such as Venezuela, seem to be “submerging” instead in that its economy has imploded under policy mismanagement, with soaring inflation, a collapsing currency and widespread shortages of the most basic household essentials.At issue is an idea implicit in the emerging markets concept: that those economies are on the way up, riding an escalator to developed market status. Some may be. But others are not.Why all the fuss about this term now?Because investors, economists and commentators are coming to the conclusion that it has outlived its usefulness and has actually become counter-productive.Rethink the grouping of world economies / From Tom Wynter
265;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-07-28T11:13:14Z;Smartphones and Chinese banks hold key to EM exposure;Active fund managers trying to navigate the bad headlines may still be torpedoed by passive funds;Emerging market investors might count themselves lucky. As China’s stock market boom turns to bust, MSCI’s decision not to include mainland shares in its global EM index looks increasingly merciful.EM fund managers have plenty of bad news to contend with already. Brazil and Russia are in recession, growth is sliding everywhere from Indonesia to Turkey to Peru, while the US Federal Reserve is inching closer to a rate rise. Throw in the rout in global commodities, which many developing nations dig up and export, and it is the closest thing in years to a perfect storm.But how much do these well-worn EM worries really matter to fund managers benchmarked to MSCI indices? The answer is perhaps not so much.The EM index, which is followed by funds holding more than $1.5tn in assets globally, is heavily-focused on two sectors: Asian tech, and Chinese financials. Of the top 10 holdings, three are involved in making consumer electronics — Samsung, Hon Hai and TSMC. Three of China’s big four state-owned banks are in there, as is Ping An, the insurer. Online games maker Tencent, Naspers — its South African shareholder— and China Mobile complete the list. Together these companies make up almost a fifth of the index. China, South Korea and Taiwan account for over half the benchmark, with no other single country having a weighting above 8 per cent.So what should be keeping EM investors up at night?For one, China’s stock market gyrations are actually close to home — big lenders and insurers have been hit hard by the recent sell-off, and are doubly on the hook either through loans made to other investors, or through direct holdings of their own.Global consumer technology trends are also important to watch. Samsung’s smartphone division has been struggling as low-cost Chinese competitors like Xiaomi and Huawei gobble up market share in the mainland market. Apple’s recent disappointment is also worth watching — Hon Hai derives more than a third of its revenue from the iPhone.Active managers trying to navigate the bad headlines may still be torpedoed by the effect of passive funds. If a rising dollar and falling commodity prices prompt investors to pull cash from EM trackers, then the nuances of the different companies, sectors and geographies could quickly be forgotten.josh.noble@ft.com
266;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-07-28T07:46:32Z;China tech to gain index inclusion boost;Plans to include Alibaba and others in MSCI EM index could feed bubble or bring some stability;More than two weeks after a series of strenuous official efforts to arrest their decline, Chinese stock markets remain volatile.On Monday, the index of Shanghai A-shares dropped 8.5 per cent to 3,903, ever closer to the government-determined floor of 3,500 and further from the perceived ceiling of 4,500.The uncertainty about where the market will trade without the support of the regulators and government as well as a six-month ban on new listings, means that plans to take private numerous Chinese companies listed in the US and bring them back to the motherland markets are also on hold.Meanwhile, the private markets in which mainland technology companies have been raising far more capital than they need, have not seen much of an impact — at least not yet. While investors hope valuations will come down, so far they remain at levels beyond those that entrepreneurs could have commanded in the public market.If anything though, the tech companies are about to get a boost that will probably cause a rise in the value of publicly listed tech companies and then an equivalent rise in the value of their private counterparts. While MSCI has decided not to include China generally in its benchmark indices, in November MSCI plans to rejig the composition of its China indices to include more than a dozen additional tech companies in the MSCI EM index, most of them in the form of American depositary receipts.Today, the China indices are heavily weighted to the state-owned enterprises that used to dominate the economy but now account for far less than half of the country’s output, especially those in the three sectors of banks, energy and telecoms companies. By contrast, Tencent, the online gaming company that has morphed into social media, and owns WeChat, is the only new economy stock heavily weighted in the index.The list of companies that will be included and is making the rounds of investors and brokerage firms in Hong Kong includes Alibaba, Baidu, JD, Netease, Ctrip, 58.com, VIPShop and Qihoo 360. The change will force investors whose performance is measured against benchmarks such as the MSCI EM index to increase their holdings of these shares.The change will also mean the entrepreneurs will have new leverage in their negotiations with their financial backers, making the private market even more bubble-like. Ego is already playing a big role in the market as hedge funds and venture capitalists spar to take ever bigger pieces of deals — only to later syndicate them out to lower echelons of the financial food chain, taking a substantial fee for themselves in the process.Those lower echelons include family offices and mutual fund firms like Fidelity that are weary of waiting for initial public offerings in companies whose market debuts are constantly deferred. Banks such as JPMorgan are expanding their private markets desks to get a piece of the action.The question, of course, is whether this change will improve the quality of companies included in the indices and contribute to more stability in the market, or simply feed the bubble. The amount of traffic these companies generate is impressive — the mobile internet generation is very different from the new economy bubble of the turn of the millennium. Including the higher quality tech names that are listed in the US rather than their lower quality A-share rivals is an improvement.“The internet is the best part of China’s slowing economy and the best hope for China’s future,” says Francis Cheiung, head of strategy for CLSA in Hong Kong. “In the first half, ecommerce sales were strong, up 39 per cent, showing that China’s consumers are alive and kicking.”Yet many of these companies are burning cash and subsidising consumers in their bid for ever more traffic. In some cases they have combined to derail a potentially larger threat, as did Didi and Kuaidi in the face of Uber’s planned entry into their home market. At other times, their investors have forced them to combine, as was the case with 58.com and Ganji.com. But Ctrip and Qunar have twice discussed merging and then decided against. Both recently raised more capital to finance their rivalry.The steeper the valuation, the greater the risk — even in the private market. The dynamic is similar to that in the property market, when one bidder overpays massively and everyone else marks their portfolio up. If there is a big correction in perception, and a dramatic series of down rounds, (where a later round is done at a discount to the previous one), valuations could fall dramatically.By contrast, state owned enterprises may not be rising stars but at least they tend not to be shooting stars either.Henny.Sender@ft.com
267;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-07-17T17:27:11Z;Market heroes would do well to avoid the madness of crowds;This week’s flash rally report contains key lessons for investors;"Markets are easier to explain when there are heroes and villains. The traditional story was of widows and orphans seeing their savings filched by the bad boys of Wall Street. The modern version sees pension funds drained by the “flash boys” of New Jersey and Chicago, and their high-frequency trading systems.There are few heroes and no villains in this week’s report on the so-called flash rally in US Treasury bonds of October 15, produced by five regulators. Investors should pay attention anyway: it contains important lessons about the danger of following the herd, and a surprise in just how well markets worked.On the day I was sitting by a terminal, awestruck at the disaster unfurling live on the screen. That day’s moves were of the size that can end careers.The benchmark 10-year bond yield plummeted by 0.36 percentage points, before recovering, with a round trip down and up again of 0.16 points in just 12 minutes, what the watchdogs call the “event window”. There have been only three other daily moves this size since 1998, and all had obvious causes.After analysing trading on the day in millisecond detail, the regulators were left scratching their heads. There was no algorithm running wild, nor a single massive buyer pushing prices up (and so yields down). Indeed, while it became harder than usual to make large trades, the market worked smoothly even in the “event window”, and record volumes of bonds and futures were traded.One conclusion is that markets are complex; trying to understand exactly what triggered a move is like asking which snowflake caused an avalanche.There were patterns of snowflakes on October 15, though, which investors need to understand. The same patterns were behind the “francmaggedon” when the Swiss franc leapt a fifth against the euro in just hours in January and the German 10-year yield soared 15-fold in 13 days in April.The pattern is one of crowded trades, large numbers of investors buying into the same story, in large part because others are buying into it, too. Since they have only a shaky belief that they are right, once prices move against them they lose confidence, closing out trades and accelerating the price move.In October a crowded trade was in the process of being unwound, as those betting on an imminent rate rise worried about weakness in the US economy. Speculative futures bets on rising rates, as well as on rate-sensitive 2-year bond yields rising, were dropping from record levels reached the previous month.Early in the day of the flash rally, bonds had an outsize response to disappointing retail sales figures, perhaps because it eliminated the last hope of those gambling on growth.Bets against the Swiss franc were similarly crowded by those who believed the Swiss National Bank’s promise to cap the exchange rate; when the cap was removed, those trades made no sense and had to be closed immediately.The Bund bubble, meanwhile, was as crowded as trades can get. Even though everyone knew negative yields as far out as nine-year bonds made no sense for Germany, traders saw the chance to make money in the short term as the European Central Bank was willing to buy at almost any price.The problem for the investor trying to avoid crowded trades is not just spotting them, but managing to resist joining in. The basis for crowding is usually compelling. The US economy seemed to be doing well; the Swiss central bank was stopping the currency strengthening; and the ECB seemed to be offering a guarantee of easy profit on German bonds. The fact everyone agreed seemed not to matter.It is hard to buck the consensus. Investors need to recognise that while the story may be obvious, the risk that it is wrong is not properly discounted. When that risk becomes clear, “the mass volte face is what causes some of these crowded trades to reverse spectacularly,” says Altaf Kassam, head of equity applied research at MSCI.MSCI has combined common measures such as mutual fund holdings and hedge fund futures positions with valuations and correlations to try to spot crowds. The trade of the moment is the bet on easy money continuing even after the first rate rise from the Fed, with shares in highly-leveraged companies that benefit from low rates having an MSCI “amber” crowding warning.A similar bet helped the Nasdaq hit a new high on Friday, as investors look for growth from technology and biotech, rather than from the world economy.The popular market villains came out of this week’s report with burnished reputations. Far from exiting en masse, computerised traders continued to make markets in the flash rally, albeit in smaller size, as banks pulled back.Investors should be concerned that with little understanding of the cause, such extreme volatility may be repeated. But it is only short-term noise. Those who want to be heroes should focus instead on avoiding the crowds.james.mackintosh@ft.com"
268;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;China’s MSCI hopes soured by stock rout;Traders say Beijing’s support measures damaged credibility;China’s shock intervention in propping up its once highflying stock market has cost the country near-term access to more than a trillion dollars invested in emerging markets, according to some of the world’s biggest investment groups.Just one month ago, foreign investors were focused on whether China’s mainland A-share market was on the cusp of gaining entry to the leading index of emerging stock markets, tracked by funds with $1.7tn to invest.Although MSCI decided not to permit inclusion of China’s mainland shares this year, it suggested inclusion was inevitable and might be possible in the next couple of years.Now, many institutional players believe otherwise and say Beijing’s mass suspension of stocks from trading and a ban on short selling in the wake of a savage market downturn has damaged its credibility, setting back the inclusion of stocks denominated in renminbi and listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen in MSCI’s global benchmark indices.Michael Lai, investment director at GAM, says the actions taken by the authorities mean that domestic Chinese equities, known as A-shares, effectively became an un-investable market.“Many investors have been starkly reminded over the past weeks that China is a policy-driven market,” he addsIt has now emerged that the scale and nature of state support was even greater than first thought. In recent weeks China’s biggest state-owned banks have loaned the margin finance agency Rmb1.3tn ($209bn), raising questions about the strength of the market’s recent recovery.Earlier this month at the height of panic selling, shares in Shanghai had tumbled 32 per cent from their peak in mid-June, with the Shenzhen market down 40 per cent. The extent of the falls spurred the Chinese Communist party to implement an unprecedented series of measures designed to halt the plunge. These included using the central bank to buy shares, banning shareholders from selling stakes and allowing half of the country’s listed companies to suspend trading in their shares.While China’s share markets rallied on Friday, leaving the Shanghai Composite some 13 per cent above its closing low earlier this month, the bursting of the country’s bull market over the past 12 months will register for some time.Franz Wenzel, head of investment strategy at Axa, says the events of recent weeks are likely to have a lasting impact on how international investors view the Chinese market.“We think the confidence shock to the government’s credibility may be a bigger risk [than equity market turbulence] — something that will have greater ramifications.”The extreme lengths that policymakers have gone to in order to prop up the market have risked its integration with global markets, say analysts.“It certainly hasn’t accelerated inclusion [into the MSCI emerging markets index] ” says Ewen Cameron Watt, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund house.“That seems obvious. The review committee will have to include the events of recent days in their considerations for the market’s inclusion. Full foreign access to China’s domestic equity market is happening, but it’s happening slowly.”Although few international investors hold domestic Chinese equities, those pondering buying mainland stocks for the first time may have put back their plans.“Market interventions have led to a rapid deterioration in investability conditions in China,” wrote Macquarie’s Trista Rose in a report comparing Beijing’s recent moves to those of Pakistan and Argentina during 2008-9. “It may be argued that the market is presently not operating as a stable ‘free market’.”Such negative statements mark a distinct shift in sentiment towards China from international investment groups, some of whom had begun adding Chinese stocks to their emerging market funds this year in anticipation of future MSCI index inclusion.Now, inclusion appears a far less likely prospect, says Angelo Corbetta, head of Asian equity at Pioneer Investments.“We won’t be talking about MSCI inclusion for at least a year, and that’s optimistic,” he says. “What happened was serious. China has demonstrated that it is not ready to handle a difficult situation. If they are lucky the process might start in 2017.”However Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, said that the criteria for China’s market inclusion had not changed.“We made it clear that it is a question of not if but when,” he says. While the events of recent weeks are serious, they do not mark a structural change in the country’s domestic equity market, which remains on the index’s watch list.“If China decided tomorrow to remove its quota system then that would be a deep structural change. A temporary situation is a different problem.”There is always the possibility that entry to MSCI’s emerging market index is not uppermost in the minds of Chinese policymakers anyway, says Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management.“China is working on a different time line to that of western markets. We are very short term, I think China is thinking longer term and preparing for the future. I don’t think recent events will change that.”
269;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-07-17T01:30:01Z;Political lessons to learn from China’s equity bubble;;China’s authorities are in a near panic trying to manage an equity market bubble. The more pessimistic see this problem as further evidence of a coming financial collapse building on an overextended property market and surging debt levels. Yet the downside risks of the debt and property market problems have been largely contained and the economic consequences of the equity bubble should be minor given its limited role in the economy. The political implications, however, are serious since this bubble was driven by an unwarranted faith in the power of government intentions.The reputational damage comes from the losses of millions of middle-class investors who are politically important for the Communist party’s base. How did such a widely admired system of economic management allow this to happen? Many observers now worry about the prospects for continued reforms but the more pressing issue is to understand how such reforms should be implemented.The last time there was a bubble was in 2006-7 when the Shanghai Composite Index soared from 1,000 to 6,000 and then within a year collapsed to 2,000, where it remained until June last year. That bubble was also grounded in excessive speculation and greed, but memories are short lived. With economic growth slackening, why did the equity market suddenly become so attractive again?This surge was unrelated to fundamentals given the protracted economic slowdown. But with a president who has staked his reputation on having a firm grip on everything and a premier who has been championing an elevated role for the equity market, the average citizen was persuaded that here was an opportunity for enrichment. After watching others making a small fortune as the SCI increased from 2,000 a year ago to 3,500 by the time of the spring festival holidays in February, betting on continued rising levels seemed a sure thing for untested investors who piled in and were rewarded as the index rose to 5,000 within a few months.The surge was the result of two well-intentioned but poorly implemented policy decisions, with the consequences exacerbated by the decision to allow excessive risk taking through margin buying and other forms of leveraged financing to continue when risks were already getting out of hand. Policy makers rightly felt that savers needed a broader array of investment options beyond just parking their money with banks or buying property. Compared with other countries, China’s equity market was under-developed and lacked credibility after the 2006-7 debacle. Their second objective was to use the equity market to moderate the country’s debt burden by encouraging companies to raise financing through equities rather than borrowing from banks. To make all this work, senior officials and the China Securities Regulatory Commission talked up the gains to be achieved by investing in stocks.As investors were attracted by the rising stocks, the financial community realised that if China’s request to be included in the MSCI Emerging Market index was approved it would trigger additional global demand and even higher prices. The market euphoria was also boosted as countless retail investors carried on buying stocks on margin with borrowed money. Within a few months, margin trading pushed prices beyond any reasonable relationship to fundamentals. Yet while the CSRC expressed caution at times, it continued to talk up prospects and was not firm enough in reining in excessive leveraged buying.Months before the crash began sentiments were beginning to shift. First was a gradual realisation by the more savvy investors that prices had overshot fundamentals, since gross domestic product growth was still declining. Yet equity prices did not fall because less sophisticated investors were still being drawn in by high returns. Gradually, as concern emerged about the power of government intentions to sustain such increases, selling pressures began to build up. When the decision to include China in the MSCI global stock index was shelved in early June, sentiments totally changed. The slide was now in full force but any possibility of moderating it was negated by the margin calls, which triggered even more selling with the SCI falling to 3,500. The same forces that exacerbated the market’s rise made it inevitable that the decline would be amplified. Recent stopgap measures to prevent selling and encourage buying may have temporarily stabilised the market, but it is not clear whether further declines are likely without such draconian measures.When this bubble is finally over and emotions have settled, the lesson should be that a strong and broad-based equity market must be founded on economic and financial forces operating under a regulatory system that is not unduly influenced by political sentiments. Unlike China’s state-dominated bond market and commercial banking system, its equity markets are shaped by private investors and companies that are increasingly private. Thus the role of government as a regulator in protecting standards and mitigating risks should not be compromised by any conflicting pressures to champion rising equity prices, as CSRC frequently seems to be doing. For this to happen, the role and accountability of managers of regulatory agencies such as the commission need to be separated further from China’s party-dominated personnel process to provide assurances that its equity markets are really markets rather than politically motivated institutions.Yukon Huang is a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment and a former World Bank Country Director for China
270;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-07-15T11:13:49Z;Environmental, social and other risks stalk Chinese listed companies;The A-share crisis has done little to expose risks facing investors in Chinese groups listed overseas;"Gyrations on China’s domestic stock exchanges over the past month have dramatised a gamut of market risks, including an excess of margin leverage, the conflicted role of the state as promoter and regulator and the see-saw sentiment of a retail-dominated investor pool.But the A-share crisis has so far done little to expose a range of corporate risks — such as corruption, environmental malpractice, aggressive accounting and poor labour relations — that riddle Chinese companies listed beyond the mainland where foreign investor participation is high.Such issues raise the risk profile of many of China’s largest companies as the country tries to get to grips with a huge backlog of neglected environmental, social and governance (ESG) problems, according to a report by MSCI, the US-based provider of index and portfolio analysis tools.“With a focus entirely on economic growth in the past, China has ignored many significant environmental, social, and governance issues – issues that have grown to threaten not only longer-term sustainable economic growth, but also the social and political stability of the country,” noted the report, authored by Xiaoshu Wang, Shuyuan Jin, Frank Li, Sabrina Zhang and Emily Chew.Indeed, Chinese companies listed offshore — mainly in Hong Kong — have among the poorest ESG standards in the emerging markets universe, the MSCI research shows.Of 140 companies included in the MSCI China Index, more than 85 per cent have an ESG rating below BBB, putting them in the lowest three among seven categories. By contrast, some 45 per cent of companies included in the MSCI EM index have ratings of BBB and above.One area of considerable ESG stress derives from China’s degraded environment. Driven by social pressures, Beijing has pledged to reduce pollution, limit carbon emissions, save scarce water and penalise companies that step out of line.Such plans could spell a surge in costs for some listed state-owned enterprises, which historically pay three times more in environmental penalties than their private sector counterparts, according to MSCI research. Particularly at risk are companies — such as Huadian Power, Huaneng Power, China Resources Power and China National Building Materials — that have poor environmental records but have largely escaped penalties so far.Another source of rising costs for Chinese listed companies is likely to come from pressures to comply with carbon emissions standards. Seven “pilot” emissions trading schemes across the country are set to be folded into a single national market by 2019, after which China’s total carbon market is likely to become the world’s largest.But in order to get there, companies will be forced to invest in a range of carbon mitigation technologies and abide by reduction regulations — or be fined. First on the list of industries targeted for regulatory attention are electricity producers, construction materials, metals and mining, chemicals and airlines.Some of the biggest costs are likely to be shouldered by companies such as Datang, Huaneng, Huadian, and CGN Power, MSCI’s report said.In addition, intensifying water management policies — which include water rights trading schemes in seven provinces introduced in 2014 — are set to drive up the costs of this scarce resource. Particularly at risk, according to MSCI, are food and beverage companies that are based in areas of extreme water shortage. China Huishan and China Mengniu, two dairy companies, are among the most vulnerable.Data analysed by MSCI shows that among the 140 Chinese companies included in the MSCI EM index, about 43 per cent are in the top five water-intensive industries, namely oil, gas and consumable fuels; food products; beverages; independent power and renewable electricity producers; and pharmaceuticals.Another source of risk, which again is focused on state-owned enterprises, is corruption. The anti-corruption campaign waged by Xi Jinping, China’s president, has resulted in a doubling of corruption controversies among large and medium-sized Chinese companies to 19 in 2013 from nine in 2012. The number is likely to double again in 2015 after a total of 20 controversies had been logged by May, MSCI estimates.Thus far the crackdown has been focused on banks and energy companies (see chart), but investigations into utilities, capital goods and telecoms sectors are likely to throw up more cases in these industries, MSCI said.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd"
271;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-07-12T01:09:34Z;MSCI: board term limits are misguided;Companies with longstanding directors have outperformed their competitors, analysis shows;A push by corporate governance experts to limit the length of time directors can sit on company boards could be misguided, research from MSCI has found.The data provider’s analysis showed that companies with longstanding board members have outperformed their competitors globally over the past five years.The findings undermine established corporate governance theory that regular turnover of independent directors improves how a company is run and by implication its performance.The figures have also raised questions over whether the limits on how long directors serve on boards introduced in several European countries make sense.US regulators have come under pressure from large investor groups to apply limits to board tenure. Proxy advisers, which help institutional investors make voting decisions at annual meetings, have also begun evaluating board independence as part of their company analysis.Ric Marshall, executive director of environmental, social and governance research at MSCI, said: “There has been talk of imposing these kinds of limits in the US. We wanted to say, hold up a minute, what would the actual impact be? If you apply [strict limits on board tenure] across the board, there will be negative effects.”MSCI pointed to Tootsie Roll, the US candy maker, as a prime example of a company that has outperformed with an entrenched board. The confectionary company has proved a very safe and rewarding investment over the past half century, as one of the most consistent dividend-paying stocks in US corporate history.If you apply [strict limits on board tenure] across the board, there will be negative effectsMelvin Gordon, Tootsie Roll’s chief executive, and chairman died in January aged 95 after 46 years occupying the two roles. His widow, Ellen Gordon, took over as chief executive in January, having served as president and chief operating officer for 46 years.If the US were to bring in similar standards to the UK (which has a nine-year limit that can be extended thanks to a “ comply or explain” regime), almost a third of companies could be deemed to lack sufficient board independence, MSCI found.

273;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-30T03:08:43Z;Debt clouds hang heavy over emerging Asia;Export route to economic growth also blocked as world trade slows;By keeping interest rates on hold a while longer, the Federal Reserve has given emerging markets, braced for possible capital outflows with rising yields in the US, at least a temporary reprieve. And by not including China in its benchmark indices quite yet, MSCI has indirectly helped support other emerging markets, as fund managers underinvested in Chinese shares would have had to sell down other markets to adjust to new weightings. But there is not much other good news on the horizon.Today, emerging market central bankers have two contradictory concerns. They fear the combination of low rates and the temptation for their own borrowers to take on too much debt when it is priced attractively. And they also fear the inevitable end of the low rates that will make the debt burden heavier.But that is only part of the reason why this particular rainy season the clouds are especially heavy in emerging Asia. Analysts are trying to understand the paradox that while today there seems to be plenty of liquidity in the world, the banks are not channelling that abundant capital to the real economy to support growth.Part of the reason for their reluctance must surely have to do with the fact that Asian corporates have borrowed a lot. Private debt in Asia alone amounted to 125 per cent of gross domestic product in the final quarter of 2014, according to the BIS, and too much of it was in dollars.Eventual rate rises, whenever they do finally materialise, will be especially damaging for this large group. The combination of financial and economic stress with more debt and fewer revenues to support borrowings is likely to prove challenging worldwide, but especially for companies in the region.The macro situation is also sobering. For years, Asia grew on the back of exports to developed markets. It was a formula that worked first for Japan, and then for Korea and Taiwan. But it does not seem to be working any longer. World trade has been almost flat for the past three years and been slower than (also anaemic) world GDP.“This is something we haven’t seen in a generation,” notes David Lubin, an economist with Citigroup in London. Trade matters not only because it supports economic growth, but because it cements relations among countries and should reduce geopolitical tensions. It is therefore of double concern that this year the outlook has worsened.Today, emerging economies are losing market share in the developed world as the growth rate in the volume of exports from emerging countries is below the rate of growth of the volume of imports in the developed world. That is true both for commodity exporters (whose year-on-year volumes are turning negative) and manufacturing exporters, according to Mr Lubin. Only a few nations, including China and Mexico, have been exceptions to this sobering trend.So the developed world is not the catalyst for growth that it was for developing nations. Meanwhile China, whose demand fuelled a rise in income for commodity producers such as Australia and Indonesia and manufacturers outside the mainland that were vital to its own supply chains, is both reducing its demand for goods from beyond its borders and taking market share from others. “China seems to be outcompeting emerging markets in an environment where the overall weakness of world trade growth leaves developing countries badly exposed,” Mr Lubin of Citigroup concludes.The most optimistic spin to put on all this is that China’s shift to becoming a more active exporter of capital and a massive offshore investor will inspire growth in a different paradigm. Both at the Boao Forum in March and in Shanghai at last weekend’s Lujiazui Forum, government officials such as Li Keping of CIC and a big shareholder in the new Silk Road Fund, testified to China’s determination to “play a bigger role in boosting the world economy” through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank.“We have the highest savings rate in the world and we should leverage this advantage and export capital,” added Jin Qi, the chairwoman of that Fund. Every day it seems a new fund is launched, such as one for central Europe from China Exim Bank.The world can use China’s capital — and, by the way, more of it will be in the Chinese currency. But whether even $4tn in mainland reserves is enough to lift the world out of its doldrums is uncertain.henny.sender@ft.com
274;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-28T01:08:12Z;Goodbye Australia, hello China at Invesco Perpetual;Lower commodity prices and monetary easing prompt changes to Asia Trust;Invesco Perpetual’s Ian Hargreaves has held on to a handful of Australian stocks within his Asia Trust despite a big change to how the fund’s performance is measured.The trust is now pitted against the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan index, which does not include Australia. Its old benchmark, the MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex Japan index, had a 21 per cent weighting to the country.This change prompted the manager to sell out of several Australian holdings, including Westpac Banking, ANZ Bank, Goodman Group, the property company, and QBE Insurance.“We have retained exposure in selected stocks where we believe valuations are particularly attractive,” he said.These include Origin Energy and Transfield Services, the engineering services contractor. Both companies’ share prices fell in recent months, partly due to weaker energy prices.But both stocks could recover, should commodities maintain their recent positive trajectory, he said.Away from Australia Mr Hargreaves believes the slowdown in Asia’s economic growth appears to be stabilising, supported by monetary policy easing such as interest rate cuts.“At a corporate level, lower commodity prices and a slowdown in wage inflation are helping to stabilise margins and support the region’s earnings growth outlook,” he said.“At the same time, while we believe valuation levels for the Asia ex Japan region remain reasonable compared with developed equity markets, they are trading towards the upper end of their five-year historical range and have to some degree already priced in an improvement in earnings momentum.”Mr Hargreaves said China, in particular, was easing its monetary policy in a bid to support consumer confidence as other areas of its economy, such as fixed asset investment, slowed.He said: “These policy measures, combined with reform progress in other areas, have either directly or indirectly driven the recent rally in China and Hong Kong’s equity markets.“China’s economy is likely to need support beyond the near-term, but the market’s re-rating may not be sustainable unless it is supported by an improvement in earnings momentum.”Mr Hargreaves has increased his Chinese exposure in recent months after adding to an existing position in China Mobile.He said the trust had a “significant level of exposure” to Hong Kong and China, where he held Hong Kong-listed conglomerates and financials, and US-listed Chinese internet companies.He added: “We also have an overweight position in South Korea, relative to the benchmark, with holdings in both large exporters and more domestically focused companies.”Bradley Gerrard is news editor at Investment Adviser
275;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Responsible investment: Vice versus nice;Is divesting from sectors such as fossil fuels really the best way to force companies to be more responsible?;The movement to divest from fossil fuels has some powerful friends. Last month Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest, announced that it would sell all its stock in coal companies, following an example set by several big university endowments, such as Stanford’s.These big asset owners have huge influence over the fund management industry, and this month they were even joined by Pope Francis, whose encyclical on climate change nodded to the power of social boycotts.But the campaign against fossil fuels is only the most visible manifestation of the increasing importance of responsible or social investing. There is a huge range of different environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing approaches, but, globally, more than 30 per cent of institutionally managed assets have some kind of social mandate, accounting for $21.4tn in assets. In Europe 58.8 per cent of invested assets are run according to an ethical mandate.In the past two years, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, which started to track these issues in 2012, assets have grown by 61 per cent. In that period, the global sustainable investment market rose from $13.3tn at the outset of 2012 to $21.4tn at the start of 2014, and from 21.5 per cent to 30.2 per cent of professionally managed assets in the developed world.The irony is that much of the investment industry has moved on from divestment as a strategy because it has been shown over time not to work. Rather than sell a stock, ethical investors now prefer to be actively involved with a company. “The vast majority of our members say they’re active owners of stocks, and divestment is the last thing they want to be involved in,” says Fiona Reynolds, managing director of Principles for Responsible Investment, a UN-backed group that includes 1,380 investors managing $59tn. “For most of them, divestment is only a last resort.”“We are moving away from negative screening to positive impact investing,” says John Streur, chief executive of Calvert, which was one of the pioneers of ethical investing in the 1980s. “That’s because of advances in technology. At one point all we had available to us were some negative screens. Now we can look in depth into the non-financial behaviours of companies globally, and we can use multiple data sources.”London Business School research earlier this year showed that tobacco stocks — subject to divestment campaigns over the past three decades — had still outperformed all other sectors over the very long-term, going back to the start of the 20th century. Alcohol stocks — also a target of ethical investment — similarly led all others in the UK.In the US, the Barrier Fund — once known as the Vice Fund because it invests only in alcohol, tobacco, gambling stocks and arms manufacturers — has comfortably outperformed ethical funds over time.This was easy to explain. Selling “sin” stocks merely succeeds in making them cheaper for others with fewer scruples, who will then make a greater return. To quote Harvard’s president, Drew Faust, who is resisting campus pressure for the university’s endowment, the world’s largest, to divest from fossil fuels: “If we and others were to sell our shares, those shares would no doubt find other willing buyers. And such a strategy would diminish the influence or voice we might have with this industry.”When it has worked, divestment has primarily been part of a political campaign, as in the 1980s boycott of South Africa over apartheid. Fossil fuel divestment’s backers now will happily concede that the tactic is more meant to help “delegitimise” the fossil fuel industry and crimp its political power than it is meant to prod the industry in a different direction.But if divestment is no longer believed to work as an investment tactic, there is now far more evidence that positive screening — deliberately investing in companies with good behaviour, or agitating to improve the behaviour of miscreants — can deliver results. All the main indexing groups offer “carbon-free” indexes.MSCI, one of the biggest indexers, employs more than 200 people just to measure non-financial factors, such as attempting to standardise measures of carbon emissions, while in the US, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, now under the chairmanship of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also working to produce agreed standards. With such standards, it becomes much easier and cheaper for investment managers to attempt responsible investing.Now, with far more data available, academics are developing measures to show good behaviour is rewarded by markets. Harvard Business School compared a group of 90 US companies that adopted a raft of sustainability policies in 1993 with another 90 companies that avoided them. It found that over the following 16 years the high-sustainability companies outperformed the others in the stock market by 4.8 percentage points per annum — a huge difference. The high-sustainability companies also performed markedly better on accounting metrics such as return on assets.Meanwhile, investment banks are promoting “thematic investing”— only buying stocks from lists compiled to take advantage of important environmental and social themes. Bank of America Merrill Lynch offers baskets of stocks aimed to profit from a range of social improvements. Over the first 18 months (far too short a period to draw firm conclusions), the bank says that all bar one of its themes, including stocks to combat obesity and to deal with food security and energy efficiency as well as climate change, have beaten their benchmark, the MSCI All-World index.The interest in ESG investing has also driven hopes that the huge scale of many of the biggest asset-owners can allow them to focus on their longer-term responsibilities. As these funds are responsible for their members’ security in retirement, the theory is that they can become “universal owners”, treating it as part of their remit to prod companies towards more healthy social outcomes for their members.John Rogers, former head of the CFA Institute, the largest professional body for investors, calls this “fiduciary capitalism” which could replace the “financial capitalism” that perished in the global financial crisis of 2008. “If we look back 30 or 40 years from now we could see we lived through an era in which capital was allocated by investors who were looking to invest for the long term, minimising negative externalities and maximising positive ones,” he says. “That would be a wonderful thing. It’s an aspiration.”The attempt to build stewardship like this has prompted many large asset owners to group together in the Long-Term Value Summit, which met in New York this March to discuss stronger active long-term ownership.However, with the popularity of passive investing — which minimises fees — there is concern that less active stewardship will result in less activism, not more. Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of Hermes in the UK, an aggressive steward of the stocks that it holds, says the problem with the growth of indexing is that “you end up with a world with corporations that have absolutely no ownership structure to them. Executives become too powerful and look after their own interests rather than those of passive shareholders.”He says passive managers will have to evolve to become more active “stewards” of the companies they own, and that this will eat into their low fees. “The vast majority of the service that asset managers will have to provide will be stewardship and the behemoths will have to evolve into stewardship houses. That is the future, and it means that index funds become more expensive.”Indexers disagree strongly with this. At the Long-Term Value Summit, Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, the world’s largest indexer, said passive investors had the strongest incentive to be involved with companies. “In our index oriented accounts, we can’t sell those stocks even if they are terrible companies. As an indexer, our only action is our voice and so we are taking a more active dialogue with our companies and are imposing more of what we think is correct.” BlackRock also disputes the notion that active stewardship will force it to raise fees. It already employs 20 people to deal with stewardship issues, and made 140,000 separate votes last year. “It’s frankly one of the advantages of being a scale player,” says Rich Kushel, who heads BlackRock’s governance operations. “Doing the analysis to vote 10 shares in a company or 1m is still the same amount of analysis.”Such governance efforts have received a strong impetus from activist investors, who take large stakes in companies and then cajole them into making moves, such as buying back stock or paying one-off dividends that will boost the share price in the short term. Famous investors who use these tactics, such as Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman or Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn, “have shown the institutions what’s possible”, says Mr Rogers.The activist playbook is already being used by the fossil fuels divestment movement. Earlier this year, shareholders brought a resolution to Chevron’s annual meeting calling for an exceptional dividend. The point of the resolution, which received about 4 per cent of the vote, was to force the company to pay out the cash it would otherwise have used to extract more fossil fuels. Even before the Pope’s encyclical, US Catholic groups such as Roman Catholic Sisters of St Dominic had been active in pestering the US oil majors with resolutions to address climate change.Whatever the success of the fossil fuel divestment campaign, Wall Street executives seem convinced that ESG investing is not going away. There is now pressure for it from all sides, led by the big asset owners who employ other fund managers to work for them.“Mainstream managers don’t come here on their own, they come here because of the pressure from big asset owners,” says Ms Reynolds. “Fund managers will do what they’re contracted to do, if the mandates are big enough.”Consumers will also apply pressure. According to Barry McInerney, co-chief executive of BMO Global Asset Management, “ESG will really take off because millennials and women have demanded it. They have particular attraction for these strategies. Providing it gives the same return they would rather pay their money into an ESG fund.”Perhaps more surprisingly, wealth managers report that even individuals with $100m or more to invest now want “impact” or ESG funds. John Taft, chief executive of wealth management at RBC, says: “They have always been charitable. But they were in the old-school [Warren] Buffett mode — he said make it and then give it away, because he didn’t believe you could solve for two variables at the same time. It’s new that people want to be charitable through their portfolio.”Why? Mr Taft, whose book A Force for Good argues that shareholder capitalism could drive improvements in society, suggests that mounting concern has finally brought a tipping point. Those who were sceptical now believe that ESG investing can work. “There’s a sense that the world needs help on many fronts. People are awaking to stewardship to prevent any number of slow-motion trainwrecks before us.”Fewer scruples, but a greater investment risk to worry about / From Simon Holman
276;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-14T00:59:10Z;SEC seeks views on ‘shocking’ auditor relationships;Concerns mount over possibility of independent oversight in long, cosy relationships;Companies could soon be forced to disclose the length of their relationships with auditors amid concern that accounting firms have become too cosy with the companies they oversee.The US regulator plans to consult investors this summer over how to strengthen the audit market. The big four accounting firms drew criticism after the financial crisis, due to their failure to highlight problems in the banking sector.One of the ideas under consideration at the US Securities and Exchange Commission is compulsory disclosure of auditor tenure, according to Joseph Carcello, a member of the regulator’s investor advisory committee.According to figures compiled for FTfm by MSCI, the data provider, a large number of S&P 500 companies have used the same auditor for well over 50 years.This includes Procter & Gamble, the consumer products group, which has used Deloitte as its auditor for 125 years, and General Electric, one of America’s best-known conglomerates, which has used KPMG for 106 years.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment company, has used PwC for 90 years, while Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, has employed PwC for the past 89 years.Investors, particularly those based in Europe, are concerned that such lengthy relationships could limit an auditor’s ability to deliver independent oversight of a company.A corporate governance expert at one of the UK’s biggest fund houses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “[Auditor tenure] at P&G is completely ridiculous. I am shocked. I don’t think you would find anyone who would think having the same auditor for 100 years is a good thing.”Peter Lundkvist, head of corporate governance at AP3, the Swedish national pension fund, added: “It is very difficult for auditors to claim they are independent in these cases.”A spokesperson for General Electric said: “In our engagement with investors, they generally have not had an issue with KPMG’s tenure — they are more focused on disclosure. As a result, over the past few years we have significantly enhanced our proxy disclosures around the auditor engagement process.”P&G, Goldman Sachs and Caterpillar declined to comment.ABP, the biggest Dutch pension fund, said companies should change auditor every 10 years, while Calstrs, the Californian pension fund, said auditors should be rotated every seven years.A significant proportion (44 per cent) of S&P 500 companies give no information on how long their auditor has been in place, according to MSCI. This includes General Motors, the carmaker, Microsoft, the software company, and Starbucks, the coffee chain.Simon Wong, professor at the Northwestern University School of Law and former head of corporate governance at Barclays Global Investors, said it would be difficult for accounting firms or companies to object to greater disclosure.He said: “It is not an onerous requirement or unreasonable. It is something investors and the public have a legitimate interest in knowing.”The push for more transparency is widely seen in corporate governance circles as a positive development in the absence of mandatory auditor rotation, which was introduced in Europe last year. Listed European companies are now required to put their audit mandate out to tender every 10 years and to change auditors at least every 20 years.The US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which oversees the audits of listed companies, attempted to introduce similar rules in 2013 but its efforts were blocked by the US House of Representatives amid fierce lobbying from the business community.James Doty, chairman of the PCAOB, said: “Bringing greater transparency and clarity about the audit and the auditor is good for investors and capital markets.”
277;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-14T00:59:10Z;Audit firms called to account for cosy tenures;Investors are concerned about the remarkable length of some auditor-client relationships;A lot has changed in the past 125 years.Since 1890, the year in which Shredded Wheat, the popular breakfast cereal, was created and the fire alarm was invented, modern society has been transformed completely, from the discovery of antibiotics to the development of aeroplanes, television and the internet.But one thing has remained stubbornly constant: the accounting firm used by Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods company behind products such as Pantene, the shampoo, and Gillette, the shaving brand.P&G’s relationship with Deloitte is coming under increasing pressure to end.A number of the world’s largest investors are becoming concerned about the remarkable length of some of these relationships and the ability of audit firms to deliver independent advice when they have worked for the same company for decades, if not centuries.“[Auditor tenure] at P&G is completely ridiculous. I am shocked,” says a corporate governance expert at one of the UK’s biggest fund houses, speaking on condition of anonymity.He adds: “From an investor perspective, I think we have been spending far too much time speaking to remuneration committee chairmen and not nearly enough time talking to audit committee chairmen. I do not think you would find anyone who would think having the same auditor for 100 years is a good thing.”Investors have intensified their focus on auditor independence in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Questions were raised about why the big four accounting firms (PwC, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG) either failed to spot or failed to highlight mounting problems in the banking sector.125 yearsThe length of time Deloitte has been Procter & Gamble’s auditorWorryingly for some investors, P&G is by no means alone in its decision to stick with the same auditor for a substantial length of time. General Electric, one of America’s best-known conglomerates, has used KPMG for 106 years, according to figures compiled for FTfm by MSCI, the data provider.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment company, has used PwC for 90 years, while Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, has employed PwC for the past 89 years.Bram Hendriks, senior corporate governance officer at NN Investment Partners, the $227bn Dutch fund house, is concerned. “An excessively long association between the auditor and [its] client may constitute a threat to independence. Auditor tenures of 50 years plus are considered excessive,” he says.106 yearsThe length of time KPMG has been General Electric’s auditorPeter Lundkvist, head of corporate governance at AP3, the Swedish national pension fund, adds: “The independence of auditors from the company and its management is critical for maintaining investor confidence. In some cases companies have had the same audit firm for more than 100 years. It is very difficult for auditors to claim that they are independent in these cases.”There could be many more companies with extended auditor relationships, but it is difficult to tell. MSCI estimates that only 56 per cent of all S&P 500 companies disclose how long they have used the same auditor, although this is an improvement on 2012, when just a quarter of companies volunteered this information.In the Russell 3000 index, meanwhile, there are 114 companies that have used the same auditor for between 50 and 99 years, according to Calstrs, the $193bn Californian pension fund. Another five companies in the Russell 3000 index have had the same auditor for more than 100 years.90 yearsThe length of time PwC has been Caterpillar’s auditorCalstrs says it expects companies to change auditor every seven years. “Regular rotation is seen as necessary to maintain external auditor independence and to avoid the types of cosy relationships that could lead to conflicts of interest,” a spokesperson for the pension fund says.Although the issue of lengthy auditor tenure appears to be of growing concern to a number of investors, there are no examples of shareholders rejecting the reappointment of an auditor among the 3,000 largest US companies in the 2014 voting season.Institutional Shareholder Services, the proxy adviser that helps investors decide how to vote at company meetings, says that of the 17,810 votes held on auditor nominations at large companies globally last year, only 16 failed. This means that investors approved auditor nominations on 99.9 per cent of occasions.Asset managers are not only reluctant to reject auditor reappointments, many of them, particularly those based in the US, are also unwilling to discuss their views on appropriate auditor tenure.89 yearsThe length of time PwC has been Goldman Sachs’ auditorFTfm asked 30 of the world’s biggest asset managers to comment for this article. Of the eight that agreed only one was US based: Calstrs. The remaining seven were UK asset managers Hermes, Aberdeen and Sarasin, as well as Nordea, the Nordic fund house, France’s Amundi, NN Investment Partners and AP3.Among those that declined to comment were BlackRock and Vanguard, the world’s two biggest fund houses by assets, as well as Franklin Templeton, Dodge & Cox, T Rowe Price, Pimco, Legg Mason, JPMorgan Asset Management, Schroders and Standard Life Investments.BlackRock, JPMorgan and Franklin Resources are also among the companies that do not disclose their auditors’ tenure, according to MSCI.One of the asset managers, who did not want to comment on the record, says she believes the problem may lie in the fact that investors simply are not aware of how long some auditors have been in place. “There is a complete and utter lack of awareness around this issue,” she says.This lack of awareness could be resolved soon. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to consult investors this summer on whether large companies should be forced to disclose how long their auditors have been in place, according to Joseph Carcello, a member of the regulator’s investor advisory committee.Mr Carcello, who is also executive director of the University of Tennessee’s corporate governance centre, adds that the regulator is keen to see companies publish better-quality audit reports.Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, has adopted a policy of recommending its clients oppose the reappointment of auditors when they have been in place for more than a decade. Pirc believes the impact of this policy could be substantial, given that its clients account for £1.5tn of assets and are estimated to hold approximately 1 per cent of the shares of S&P 500 companies collectively.Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen, believes more US investors will begin to question auditing arrangements at the companies they invest in.He says: “If additional transparency alerts people to the fact that many companies have had the same audit firm in place for upwards of 50 years, then that can only be a good thing. Auditors are the independent eyes and ears of shareholders within the corporate reporting process and we need them to be free to do that to their best ability.”Many of the companies that have had the same auditor in place for close to a century did not want to comment for this article.General Electric, the conglomerate that has used KPMG as its auditor for 106 years, was the exception. It said: “The board of directors annually reviews KPMG’s independence and performance in deciding whether to retain [the accounting firm].“The board considers KMPG’s audit performance, their ability to handle the breadth of our worldwide operations, an analysis of their known legal risks, the audit quality and efficiency benefits of having a longer-tenured auditor, and controls in place at GE and KPMG to mitigate against any potential independence concerns.“In our engagement with investors, they generally have not had an issue with KPMG’s tenure — they are more focused on disclosure. As a result, over the past few years we have significantly enhanced our proxy disclosures around the auditor engagement process.”Procter & Gamble, Caterpillar and Kimberly Clark all pointed FTfm in the direction of their proxy statements — documents they must send to their shareholders containing relevant information ahead of an annual meeting.P&G said that “the retention of Deloitte to serve as the company’s independent external auditor is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders”.
278;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Stocks retreat as Greece worries weigh;Euro shrugs off Merkel comments;Friday 21:00 BST. Mounting concerns about the possibility of a Greek default dominated proceedings at the end of a week that saw further evidence emerge of a rebound for the US economy, fresh volatility in the bond markets and Chinese investors shrug off a significant blow to sentiment.Thursday’s withdrawal of the International Monetary Fund’s negotiating team from “cash-for-reforms” talks with Athens, plus a more hardline stance emanating from EU leaders, set the scene for a sharp pullback for European stocks and “peripheral” eurozone government bonds.The mood was further unsettled by reports that senior EU officials had formally discussed for the first time the prospect of Greece defaulting on loan repayments due to the IMF at the end of June.“The Greek government has virtually no cards left to play other than hoping that its approach of pushing things to the brink will create enough turmoil in financial markets that the fear of a major fallout from the country’s bankruptcy will soften the creditors’ demands for an agreement and make their proposed terms more lenient,” said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.“European equity markets remain the most vulnerable to the continuation of the brinkmanship surrounding Greece, with US equities likely the second most vulnerable asset class in the coming days.”Indeed, the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300equity index tumbled 0.9 per cent, leaving it barely changed on the week. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 2,094 for a five-day rise of less than 0.1 per cent.Greek stocks fell 5.9 per cent and the yield on the country’s 10-year sovereign debt — which moves inversely to the price — rose 52 basis points to 11.76 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.Elsewhere in Europe’s government bond markets, the yield on Spanish 10-year debt rose 13bp to 2.26 per cent while that for Portugal leapt 19bp to 3.04.But German Bunds, plus other “core” European sovereign bonds, resumed their traditional roles as bolt-holes in times of turmoil, following a midweek bout of volatility that saw the 10-year implied borrowing cost for the eurozone’s biggest economy climb back above 1 per cent for the first time since September.“The price action today was significant in that it provided a real test to the widely held belief that European Central Bank quantitative easing would help to contain Grexit risks,” said Divyang Shah, global strategist at IFR Markets.“We continue to see contagion contained and the ECB will play a key role in this with well-timed QE purchases. These purchases have thus far been market neutral but the ECB could choose to make it less market neutral in a positive manner.”The 10-year Bund yield ended at 0.85 per cent, down 5bp on the day, leaving it flat on the week. That on the 10-year US Treasury was flat at 2.39 per cent — 1bp lower on the week.Meanwhile, the euro showed resilience to Greek worries, even after Angela Merkel said the strength of the single currency had prevented countries like Spain and Portugal from benefiting more from structural reforms undertaken in the past few years.The German chancellor’s remarks echoed Barack Obama’s reported concerns about the strong dollar earlier in the week.The euro bounced off a low for the day against the dollar of $1.1151 to stand unchanged at $1.1255 — a move that left the dollar index flat on the day at 94.99, and 1.4 per cent down on the week. The index — a measure of the US currency versus a basket of peers — had earlier touched 95.68.The dollar’s decline over the week came even as the markets digested economic reports that appeared to show the US consumer coming out of winter hibernation.Retail sales recorded a solid rise last month, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates later this year.There was little impact on sterling from late news on Friday that S&P had downgraded the outlook on the UK’s triple-A credit rating to negative from stable, citing risks from a referendum on EU membership. The pound was up 0.3 per cent against the dollar at $1.5557.Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite stock index ended the week at a seven-year high as the market managed to shrug off news that MSCI had deferred including mainland shares in its indices.“MSCI’s decision is seemingly a compromise between investors who expressed concerns over market access and flexibility against the need to include China in the emerging market index given its size and growing importance,” said Commerzbank.Gold was down $1 on Friday at $1,180 an ounce but was up $8 over the week. Brent oil capped a volatile week with a 1.9 per cent drop to $63.87 a barrel but was up 0.9 per cent over the five-day period.
279;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-12T13:40:26Z;Emerging markets suffer biggest weekly outflow in 7 years;Chinese equities hardest hit as investors withdraw $7.1bn in 4 days;Emerging market funds have suffered their biggest outflows since the financial crisis this week, as investors pulled billions of dollars from Chinese equities.In total, $9.3bn left EM funds in the week to Thursday, according to data from funds tracker EPFR, the most since 2008. Of that, $7.1bn came from Chinese equity funds, which had previously seen three weeks of robust inflows including a record $4.6bn in the last week of May. Global EM funds saw $829m of withdrawals, while Latin America funds lost $442m.Emerging markets have come under increasing pressure recently as the US dollar has strengthened — something that has often led to the underperformance of EM assets. In the past month, the Russian rouble has dropped 8.6 per cent against the dollar, the Colombian peso is down 5.9 per cent and the Malaysian ringgit is off 3.2 per cent.Bonds in particular have been hit, as rising yields on German government debt and improving economic data in the US may prompt a rethink about exposure to lower-rated credit.“The rates markets are more worried about whether higher US dollar and euro bond yields could prompt a reallocation of assets to developed markets, and thus capital flows out of EM,” said analysts at Société Générale in a note.Many developing nations are also in the midst of an economic slowdown, as Chinese demand for raw materials wanes and domestic credit booms grind to a halt.Earlier this week, the World Bank warned that emerging economies face a “ structural slowdown” likely to last for years, just as activity in the west begins to pick up in earnest.China’s equity market — the main source of outflows this week — presents a different set of concerns. Despite a slowdown in the economy, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indices have both more than doubled in the past 12 months, making them by far the best performing markets in the world.However, the rally has been characterised by the opening of millions of new retail trading accounts, soaring share turnover and rapidly increasing margin debt. All this has raised fears of a policy-induced bubble.The Shanghai Composite now trades at 25.7 times current earnings, up from just 9.7 times a year ago. Mainland listings are now typically 38 per cent more expensive than their Hong Kong counterparts, a sign of a growing disconnect between onshore and offshore markets.“All people see is a bubble — and they have been stuck on this theme like an old-fashioned record for years,” said Markus Rosgen, Asia equity strategist at Citi. “If you don’t own it, it is a bubble. If you own it, you are in a bull market.”This week, index provider MSCI chose not to add mainland-listed Chinese stocks to its global emerging market index, citing lingering access issues. Had it decided to press ahead with inclusion, billions of dollars of passive fund money would have been forced to buy Chinese shares.Analysts at ANZ said this week’s outflow from China funds was probably due to increased volatility in the domestic share markets, but that the MSCI decision may also have been a factor.
280;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chinese whale could sink emerging markets;EM indices that include A-shares risk reinflating China bubble;"The Chinese A-share market is now the world’s most heavily traded. But it is disconnected from trading in the rest of the planet. It is like a whale, thrashing in a small tub of water.Everyone now acknowledges that this cannot continue much longer. And so this week was dominated by arguments over how, and how quickly, the Chinese whale can be introduced into the sea of global markets. But that requires big changes in the behaviour both of China’s authorities and of investors.Both sides are, correctly, nervous that the Chinese whale could displace a lot of water. And in return for opening a big new conduit for foreign capital, Chinese authorities will have to relax their control over their domestic market.The issue of A-shares, the category of shares that with a few exceptions is still restricted to domestic Chinese investors, also shines a light on the dominant role that indexers now play. No longer passive, they are unavoidably active players, driving many trillions of dollars.This week MSCI, the biggest indexer of international markets, announced its annual review of the members of its emerging markets index, used as a benchmark by funds with $1.7tn in assets. Not only index funds but any nominally active fund that uses the MSCI EM as a benchmark is, in practice, obliged to shift its holdings in response to the review. China, through shares quoted in Hong Kong, makes up 25 per cent of the MSCI EM. That would rise to more than 45 per cent if A-shares were included.MSCI consulted on admitting A-shares to this index, at a weighting of only 5 per cent of their total market value, and came under passionate lobbying from all sides.The A-shares market is plainly big and liquid enough. The problem is its accessibility to foreign investors. Over the past year, China has unveiled a series of measures to open the market. The Hong Kong-Shanghai Connect service makes it easier to trade in Shanghai-quoted shares; capital gains tax rules have been clarified; and the “QFII” quotas giving qualified foreign investors fixed quotas to invest in the market have been widened. China wants to be included; this would drive fresh international capital in its direction.But plenty lobbied against it. Fund managers complained that it would be unfair to judge them against a benchmark which included some stocks (A-shares) that they were not allowed to buy. Furthermore, the past 12 months have featured worrying news for China. Its imports are declining, the prices of commodities it imports have tanked, and yet A-shares have shot through the roof.It is hard to explain this rally unless it is driven by speculative liquidity. This implies that including A-shares in the index could inflate the bubble further, while the many investors who have avoided China, due to its poor fundamentals, stand to be embarrassed if judged against an index that included A-shares.So MSCI came to a compromise. China needs to make more reforms. There is a working party to thrash this out jointly with Chinese regulators — who obviously want this to happen — and A-shares are on course to join the index in May 2017.Meanwhile FTSE, the other big player in international indexing, announced its own approach. Both the big indexers agree that China must soon be included, but is not ready yet. FTSE set up a shadow index that includes A-shares in proportion to the amount that foreign investors can hold through the quota system. This allows funds to avoid the embarrassment of staying out of mainland China — and Vanguard, the biggest indexer of them all, will be offering funds to track this index.To understand how indexers command such attention, look back a year, to when the United Arab Emirates was added to the MSCI EM, following a two-year consultation.In the two years to May 2012, the UAE’s stock market moved sideways, in line with the MSCI EM. In the ensuing two years, as funds readied for it to join the index, it rose 234 per cent, while emerging markets were flat. Once it finally joined, its shares tanked by some 40 per cent in six months.A Machiavellian investor might therefore start to dabble in Pakistan, which MSCI is reviewing and which could arrive in MSCI EM in 2017, or Saudi Arabia, which has merited membership of the index for years — but has been excluded because of its strong restrictions on foreign investment. Given that both countries tend to suffer a stigma among western investors, there is every chance they could take off as membership of MSCI EM approaches.Beyond grabbing such opportunities, investors must rethink how they view emerging markets. Coined three decades ago when the World Bank wanted to rebrand the Third World, the term is barely useful any more. China is such a whale that to buy “emerging markets” is little more than buying China. We can expect interest in “Asia excluding China” or “A-shares-only” or “Emerging Markets excluding China” indexes.We should also rethink the power vested in indexers. Like rating agencies before them, to whom judgment on credit quality was fatefully outsourced in the years before the credit crisis, investors have given indexers more power than they were designed to wield. The mere fact that this technical issue has dominated markets for weeks is disquieting. Through no fault of their own, indexers’ power looks dangerous.john.authers@ft.com"
281;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Stocks shrug off renewed Bund volatility;S&P 500 has best day for a month;Wednesday 21:00 BST. US and European stock markets roared back from days of losses as equity bulls shrugged off another bout of volatility in fixed income and foreign exchange markets.Oil prices also had a choppy session, with Brent touching its highest in nearly three weeks before paring its advance. Gold rose for a third successive session.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 equity benchmark rose 1.2 per cent to 2,104, its best showing for a month, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.3 per cent higher, its first advance in five days. The day’s move left the S&P just 1.2 per cent short of the record close set three weeks ago.Across the Atlantic, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 snapped a six-day losing streak as it bounced 1.7 per cent from a four-month low, while the Xetra Dax jumped 2.4 per cent. The German benchmark entered “correction” territory on Monday after falling more than 10 per cent from April’s record high.But in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 per cent after the yen rallied strongly on the back of verbal intervention from the governor of the Bank of Japan.Haruhiko Kuroda said the yen’s real effective exchange rate (Reer), which adjusts for inflation and trade patterns, was very weak, and that it was hard to see the currency falling further.“The BoJ’s Reer has fallen by around 30 per cent since the introduction of ‘Abenomics’ policies, to its lowest level since the early 1970s,” noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.He added: “The latest IMM report revealed that speculative short yen positions have been increased sharply in recent weeks, which likely contributed to the short squeeze overnight.“The improving economic outlook in Japan is likely at the margin offering some support for the yen as well, reducing the likelihood that the BoJ will accelerate easing later this year.”Akira Amari, Japan’s economy minister, attempted damage limitation, saying Mr Kuroda had not intended to move the market with his remarks and foreign exchange participants seemed to have misinterpreted the comments.Nevertheless, the dollar — which hit a 13-year high against the Japanese currency on Friday near Y126 — fell as low as Y122.47 and recovered only slightly to Y122.66, down 1.3 per cent on the day. The euro was 1 per cent lower at Y138.84.Milestone passed for first time since SeptemberContinue readingIt was not just the yen making gains against the dollar — the euro reached a high of $1.1384, up 1.1 per cent on the day, as the yield on 10-year German government bonds rose above 1 per cent to reach a nine-month high of 1.06 per cent.The move came as eurozone inflation expectations, measured by the 5yr-5yr break-even, hit a three-week high.The single currency subsequently drifted back to stand 0.3 per cent firmer at $1.1313 as the Bund yield retreated to 0.99 per cent, up 4 basis points on the day. The 10-year US Treasury yield was up 8bp at 2.49 per cent, the highest since the start of October.The dollar’s weakness helped gold rise $10 to $1,186 an ounce.The latest Bund sell-off belied lingering anxieties over Greece, as the stalemate between Athens and its creditors over “cash for reforms” negotiations continued — despite excitement in some quarters at newswire reports that Germany might be prepared to accept a staggered deal on aid.Greeks ‘do not want a deal: they just want debt relief’Continue reading“The creditors are clearly frustrated by the wholly inadequate level of detail within the [Greek] government’s latest proposals,” said Daiwa Capital Markets.“The sense is that [Prime Minister] Alexis Tsipras’ latest actions have placed the fraught negotiation process into reverse.”Meanwhile, so-called peripheral eurozone sovereign debt saw smaller moves on the day than Bunds, with Italy’s 10-year yield slipping 2bp to 2.27 per cent and Spain’s edging 2bp higher to 2.31 per cent, according to Reuters.“The change on the day masks the intraday volatility which continues to unnerve both bulls and bears,” said Divyang Shah, global strategist at IFR Markets.“There remains a desire not to stand in the way of this, especially after an already bad quarter and half-year, with many turning to the charts for clues. Given the extent to which the market has surprised over the last few weeks, any recovery is going to be fragile and cautious.”In Shanghai, the Composite stock index pared an early fall to end 0.2 per cent lower as participants overcame disappointment that MSCI had opted not to include mainland A-shares in its indices.Brent oil touched $66.36 a barrel before easing back to $65.70, up 1.3 per cent on the day, as the market digested data from the US Energy Information Administration.For market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
282;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
283;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-10T04:51:17Z;China MSCI inclusion is inevitable but not imminent;Decision deferred, but intention to eventually add A-shares made ‘crystal clear’;"Mainland China’s grand entrance to the global equity club may have been delayed for now, but its membership papers are already being drawn up.MSCI’s decisionnot to include Chinese A shares — those listed on the mainland rather than in Hong Kong — in its global emerging market index kicks the can down the road for the time being. Its new proposal points to May 2017 as the likely date, although the door has been left ajar for an earlier move.The end game is no longer in dispute. China is set to join at some point; the question is merely one of timing.“MSCI has made its intentions crystal clear: A shares are ultimately going to get included,” says Peter Alexander, managing director at Z-Ben Advisors.While the index provider observed “significant positive market opening developments” since its last review a year ago, it highlighted three main areas where further progress is needed.First, global fund managers want China to make its quota system for accessing onshore assets more transparent and predictable. Too often, applicants are left waiting with little clarity on when they might be given increased allocations, or how large those increases might be.Of the $298bn of quota available through the qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) scheme and its renminbi-based sister programme (RQFII), only $162bn has been granted.Second, access to daily liquidity needs to be improved, such as by lifting the existing limits on traffic through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect.Finally, many traditional fund managers remain concerned about beneficial ownership of assets — who is the ultimate holder — in spite of recent steps by the Chinese regulator to clarify its position.While not a matter for MSCI to contend with, some investors may also have been nervous about being pushed into a market that has soared in the past year. The Shanghai Composite is up 150 per cent in the past 12 months alone, which many commentators see as an indication of a market bubble.“After A shares’ wild rise over the past year, investors are probably relieved that index funds tracking the MSCI emerging market index won’t be forced to add China A shares at this point,” says Larry Cao of the CFA Institute, in a note.A number of analysts believe the key to unlocking access to China will be the much-anticipated launch of the Shenzhen Stock Connect, a replica of Shanghai’s cross-border trading link with Hong Kong, which would give global funds access to China’s second-largest stock market.“The imminent launch of a Shenzhen Connect scheme is a key driver for benchmark inclusion,” says Michael Chan, Asia head of asset servicing at BNY Mellon. “Its launch will likely see another reassessment later this year.”But once the remaining technical barriers are dealt with, focus is set to shift from the issues facing Chinese authorities to those investors themselves must overcome.MSCI’s initial plan calls for a small allocation to mainland China — equal to 1.3 per cent of its global emerging markets index. Russia, by comparison, would have a weighting three times larger, while Taiwan would be almost 10 times bigger.However, the ultimate goal of giving Chinese A shares a 20.5 per cent slice of the EM benchmark is raising worries about a future index swamped by a single country. When added to offshore listings, Chinese companies would make up 43.6 per cent of the EM index, according to MSCI’s inclusion roadmap.Arthur Kwong, head of Asia equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, warns that such a scenario would risk “massive overlap” between pan-Asia, global EM, and China-only funds.“My concern is that MSCI inclusion will make China too big as a country. It will be like buying a China fund,” he says. “Will we be able to diversify in an absolute sense?”Chin-Ping Chia, MSCI’s head of Asia research, says a heavy China weighting would be an accurate reflection of the country’s economic rise, and points to the US dominance of developed market benchmarks.However, he also notes the potential for new EM indices that strip out China, just as Japan was split from the rest of Asia when it became too large.Other practical concerns, such as a lack of English-language research and English-speaking investor relations staff will also present challenges to asset managers for whom China is unfamiliar territory. Mr Alexander says many institutional investors remain completely unprepared.“The issue at hand here is what global investors are doing about it right now,” he says. “The answer is nothing.”"
284;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-10T01:51:34Z;China stocks’ inclusion in global index put on hold;Concerns about foreign investor access stall A-shares accession to MSCI benchmarks;China will have to wait to join MSCI’s global benchmarks due to lingering investor concerns about international access to one of the world’s largest equity markets.The provider of equity indices said on Tuesday that it would include China A-shares, which are listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, but only once quota, liquidity and ownership issues were resolved.The Shanghai Composite was down 1.9 per cent in Wednesday morning trading while Shenzhen was off 0.9 per cent.Tracked by funds worth close to $1.7tn, the MSCI index is the key barometer for investors in emerging markets. China’s eventual inclusion would lead to a rebalancing of global investment, forcing funds to buy shares to match the new index.MSCI forecasts that global funds would add around $20bn to the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets as a result of its plans, while HSBC puts the figure at closer to $50bn. Its updated consultation paper would give Chinese A-shares a 1.3 per cent weighting in its EM index.MSCI is now proposing to implement its inclusion plan in May 2017, but left open the possibility of an earlier move if all the criteria were met sooner. Clients will be given at least 12 months’ notice between an announcement and formal implementation, it said.At the moment, only Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong are included in the index, although New York-listed Chinese companies — including Alibaba and Baidu — will join in November.Decision deferred, but intention to eventually add A-shares made ‘crystal clear’Continue reading“Substantial progress has been made toward the opening of the Chinese equity market to institutional investors,” said Remy Briand, MSCI’s global head of research. “In our 2015 consultation, we learnt that major investors around the world are eager for further liberalisation of the China A-shares market, especially with regard to the quota allocation process, capital mobility restrictions and beneficial ownership of investments.”The launch in November of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect facility enabled many investors — including hedge funds and retail investors — to access mainland equities directly, without the need for an investment license. Since then, overseas investors have added almost $25bn to Shanghai stocks through the cross-border trading link.Beijing has also expanded its longstanding quota system to allow large global funds to allocate more to domestic stocks. In March, Fidelity became the first non-sovereign asset manager to have its so-called qualified foreign institutional investors quota lifted above $1bn.Chinese authorities have also been doling out new US dollar-denominated quotas, and granting renminbi-based quotas to financial centres around the world, including London, Singapore, and Paris.MSCI pointed to the impending launch of a Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect facility as improving investors’ access to A-shares. MSCI said it will work with the China Securities Regulatory Commission to resolve lingering concerns.BlackRock said in a statement that it welcomed “the Chinese government’s policy of opening the Chinese capital account and broadening global investors’ participation in domestic stock markets”.“We also support MSCI’s deliberate process on the inclusion of China A-Shares into its global indices, recognising the practical obstacles that remain for their addition,” it added.Many investors had voiced concerns about adding China to global indices prematurely, pointing to a range of worries from accessibility and settlement to a lack of research coverage and shareholder protection.
285;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-09T22:56:12Z;As non-events go, this was a big one;China fails to convince MSCI over A-share move — for now;A passive benchmark has been left unchanged — and yet it is a big event for world markets.MSCI, the leading indexer of emerging stock markets, has decided not yet to go through with a proposal to start a partial admission of China’s domestic A-share market into its flagship emerging market index. As funds with assets worth $1.7tn are benchmarked against this index, the effect is profound.The earliest A-shares can now be added is May 2017 — at a point when the current rally in A-shares, which has seen them more than double inside 12 months, may well have gone into reverse.MSCI made clear that talks with the Chinese authorities are ongoing, that it is continuing on a road map that leads to eventual inclusion, and that a decision to admit A-shares could come at any time. But the bottom line, for now, is that China has failed to convince the indexers on three points — that the process for allocating quotas to foreign investors needs to be “more streamlined, transparent and predictable”, that capital needs to be more mobile to allow daily liquidity for all investment vehicles, and that the issue of ownership of separate accounts in the new Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programme needs to be clarified.All these issues have already been under intense discussion. But the argument that appears to have held sway is that while some investors can gain access to A-shares and others cannot, it would be unfair to judge them against a benchmark that includes A-shares.China is too big for this indexMSCI wants to admit A-shares — which are plainly now a huge part of the emerging markets world — but for now it is saying the authorities have not done enough. China’s authorities had plainly been very keen to earn inclusion in the index for A-shares, despite claims by many sceptics that this would suck foreign money in at the top after the A-share market had already doubled within 12 months.Meanwhile, the implications for the fund management industry are profound. China’s scale is making it ever harder to allocate assets within emerging markets.According to MSCI, if all A-shares were to be included at their full weighting, China would take up 43.6 per cent of the emerging markets index. This accurately reflects the importance of China to the emerging world, but makes the job of asset managers close to impossible.As Nick Smithie of Emerging Global Advisors in New York puts it, “China is too big for this index”. Questioning whether anyone would feel that an “emerging markets” fund that was almost half in China was truly diversified, he predicted instead that there is likely to be a proliferation of new indices. He suggested there will soon be a boom in categories like “Emerging Markets ex-China”, “Asia ex-China” and “China A-shares only”.As non-events go, this was a big one.
286;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-09T03:33:52Z;Why China is blowing an equity bubble;High valuations will make it easier and cheaper to recapitalise state-owned groups;Bubbles come in different shapes and forms, but it is striking how often they are the byproduct of attempts to make difficult economic transitions. This was true of the US stock market in the late 1920s as Americans reluctantly stumbled towards the hegemonic global role previously played by the British.It was true of the property and equity markets in Japan in the 1980s, when an export-led growth model that had worked well in the catch-up phase ceased to be viable in a country that had turned into an economic giant. So, too, with China today, where first a property bubble and now an incipient stock market bubble have a great deal to do with imbalances in an economy that needs to shift from investment-led growth to increased consumption.Such transitions are difficult because of the clash of vested interests. Chinese local government officials have been big beneficiaries of easy financing of infrastructure investment and the accompanying land grab. State-owned enterprises have lived handsomely off the same gravy train. At every level of the public sector there are people for whom the status quo is a cornucopia. Equally to the point, liberalisation, which is the key to an effective transition, can only erode the power of the Communist party.For those officials who see that change is essential, a further difficulty arises from the new sluggishness of the Chinese economy. Since their legitimacy derives from delivering high economic growth they are under pressure. It is all too easy to solve the problem by throwing more money at infrastructure and at industries that suffer from surplus capacity. Yet this can only be done at the cost of creating bubbles, running up more debt and misallocating resources on a grandiose scale in what economists of the Austrian school call malinvestment.There is one sense, though, in which euphoria in mainland Chinese equities is unusual. Far from being an unintended consequence of policy, the authorities are egging investors on with articles in the state-run press seeking to justify extreme valuations. The People’s Bank of China has been busy cutting interest rates. And to good effect. The Institute of International Finance, a club of global banks, says Chinese retail investors have increased their equity investment via margin borrowing by almost 85 per cent this year to a record $400bn.Why, you might ask, would those charming officials in Beijing wish to encourage a bubble? A consequence of the investment boom is that many state-owned enterprises are lossmaking, while state-owned banks have lent excessively to these companies and to local governments. The authorities are urging them to lend more despite the fact that they will never be repaid in full.The obvious way to de-risk this dangerous game of extend and pretend is to recapitalise the state-owned corporate sector. Bubble valuations will make this easier and cheaper. Foreign investors, meantime, are set to be granted better access to China’s domestic A shares. While Chinese capital is pouring out of the country foreigners are clamouring to move in. EPFR, the data provider, detects a thaw in sentiment towards a market that foreign institutional investors have recently shunned.The debate on whether Chinese A shares should be included in the MSCI Emerging Market Index suggests that there will soon be more forced investors in this market. How convenient for the authorities in Beijing. That also illustrates how passive investing can reward bad behaviour. China, after all, has the world’s biggest crisis of corporate governance.Recent scandals have highlighted failure to enforce securities laws to ensure the integrity of accounts, abuse of conflicts of interest in state-owned enterprises, abusive related party transactions and seriously deficient property rights. In other words, any investor in an indexed fund that includes A shares will be exposed to serious corporate dross. When companies in the index raise capital that exposure will increase. The game will change from extend and pretend to pass the toxic parcel.Until now the possibility of a Chinese bubble deflating was of little concern in the west. Bubbles were financed by domestic saving. That is now beginning to change. As the incremental process of liberalisation continues the scope for contagion outside China will multiply. In short, China and the developed world are set to become more uncomfortable financial bedfellows.The writer is an FT columnist
287;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-08T17:49:43Z;Smart beta offers promise as Chinese markets open up;Portfolios tilted towards value, yield and low volatility outerperform country’s indices;"Index heavyweight MSCI will announce on Tuesday whether it will open up its flagship emerging market benchmark to China’s $9tn onshore A-shares market, a decision that could usher in an avalanche of foreign money.But whatever MSCI’s immediate decision, the direction of travel is clear; the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets — two of the few worldwide to still be dominated by domestic investors — will become more international.Beijing is steadily opening the door to outsiders by granting foreign institutions ever larger quotas, while its Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programme has opened another conduit for overseas money.Last week’s decision by Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, to include A shares in its flagship emerging markets exchange traded fund, may prove a watershed.But exactly how should one invest in a market as esoteric and seemingly unfathomable as that of A shares?In the rest of the world, it has long been noted that investors can, over the cycle, outperform markets by skewing their portfolios towards certain risk factors.Smaller companies, cheap “value” stocks and high-yielding equities all have a tendency to deliver outsized returns. Investors can also, more often than not, beat the index by favouring stocks that already exhibit strong upwards momentum or low volatility.These insights have spawned a new segment of the global investment industry — dubbed “smart beta” — one that Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE Group, believes will ultimately come to account for 35 cents of every dollar invested worldwide.But do these factors apply in a market that is 90 per cent-owned by domestic retail investors, where turnover is so high the average holding period is just two months, and where investors see nothing odd in stocks surging in value simply because they have switched between market sectors and an entire market (step forward the Shenzhen Composite) trades on a multiple of 62.7 times earnings?In an age of ever-creeping global uniformity, the A-share market’s idiosyncrasy is clear from the fact that its movements are completely uncorrelated with those of global bourses and even, in essence, with those of other emerging markets (see chart).Nevertheless, research by State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest fund house, suggests many of the behavioural biases found elsewhere in the world are also present in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Strongest of all is the value effect, according to number crunching by Sunny Ng, head of SSGA’s Asia ex-Japan portfolio strategists, and colleagues George Hoguet and Christopher Cheung.Using data from the start of 2002 to the end of 2013, they found that the quintile of stocks with the lowest price-to-book ratio beat the wider A-shares market by 83 basis points a month (equivalent to more than 10 percentage points a year), almost double the 44bp found in the US market in a 2012 study by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, the creators of the Fama-French three-factor model of market behaviour.This trend for value Chinese stocks to generate outsize returns was found to be statistically significant, while the highest price-to-book stocks have underperformed the broader market, at least since 2010 (see chart).Yield, or the tendency for the highest dividend-paying stocks to outperform, also appears to work in the Chinese market. The highest-yielding fifth of stocks beat the MSCI China A market by 55bp a month between 2002 and 2013, the SSGA team found, another finding that was statistically significant.Likewise, the tendency for the least volatile stocks to outperform also appears to translate to China; the equities with the lowest volatility over the previous five years went on to outperform the market by 47bp a month, on average.Mr Ng confessed to being “surprised” by the finding, given that the “frenzied turnover” on the mainland market might be expected to “overwhelm” the volatility premia.The SSGA team concluded that two other widely observed phenomena — the tendency for small companies to outperform and for those stocks with the strongest upward momentum to continue rising for the following period — do not appear to work in China.However, in both cases, the team found a degree of outperformance, but concluded it was not statistically significant, with the momentum effect potentially undermined by the unusually high turnover.Nevertheless, Mr Ng concludes that factor-based investing “may be attractive” in mainland China, especially strategies tilted to yield and value.And, of course, if these strategies work now, it is logical to assume they will work better still as China continues to open up and, over time, the ownership of its domestic stock markets comes to look more like that in the rest of the world.Factory-based investing has made fortunes for some in China. As the country moves up the wage scale and conforms more to global norms, factor-based investing may be the way to go in future."

289;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-03T17:50:33Z;Vanguard to start buying mainland Chinese equities;Passive heavyweight adopts A-shares laden FTSE index;A surprise move by Vanguard to include onshore Chinese A-shares in its flagship emerging market fund will “put pressure” on other asset managers to follow suit.Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, which has $3.3tn under management, has said its $50bn FTSE Emerging Markets exchange traded fund, the world’s largest such vehicle, is to adopt a 5.6 per cent weighting to mainland Chinese stocks.The move follows last week’s decision by index provider FTSE Group to launch a new emerging markets index with an initial China weighting of about 5 per cent, which will run alongside its existing index that has no exposure to A-shares (see table).Vanguard has opted to switch the benchmark for its ETF to this new FTSE index.Jian Shi Cortesi, an investment manager at Zurich-based GAM, said Vanguard’s move “puts pressure on other funds to follow suit”.John Kennedy, investment director of Harvest Global Investments (UK), a subsidiary of Beijing-based Harvest Fund Management, China’s largest institutional asset manager, said: “Everything I read post the [FTSE] announcement was that this was going to be ignored by the world and his wife, so this is potentially quite a revelation.“To see somebody adopting it within the week is very very important indeed. It will have quite an impact because it’s a very prominent provider. I would expect others to follow.”Mr Kennedy, whose parent company manages $85bn of assets, about half of which is in A-shares, added: “The direction of travel is quite clear. International investors have got to think about how they are going to access mainstream Chinese equities and fixed income”.However, any significant inflows could further inflate a potential bubble in mainland Chinese equities, with the Shanghai market trading on 20.9 times trailing 12-month earnings and Shenzhen on 63 times, after both more than doubled in the past 12 months.MSCI, a rival index provider, is due to announce the results of its annual classification review next week. It had proposed adding a 1 per cent weighting to China to its emerging markets index, but could potentially go further given the moves by FTSE and Vanguard.Vanguard’s move is an early indicator of what is likely to be an avalanche of overseas investment into the mainland market in the years to come, with most foreign institutions currently having little or no exposure to A-shares.The Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses are now large enough to account for 24.2 per cent of emerging market stock capitalisation, according to recent calculations by FTSE (see chart).However the main index providers have shied away from including these A-shares in their benchmarks because of concerns over capital controls and access for foreign investors.At present, foreign groups can invest in A-shares if they have a quota allowance under Beijing’s qualified foreign institutional investor or renminbi-denominated QFII schemes, for which just $125bn of allocations have so far been made, although this is increasing.Vanguard was recently awarded a Rmb10bn ($1.6bn) allocation, which it will use to buy A-shares for the ETF and an umbrella fund, which between them have $69bn of assets.Failing this, institutions can use the recently unveiled Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programme, which allows Hong Kong-based investors to buy up to Rmb13bn of Shanghai-listed shares a day. Since launch in November, foreign investors have bought $24bn of Chinese equities through this pipeline.Fund managers without access to either of these systems have only been able to buy via P notes, which are issued by banks and backed by stocks the banks have bought with their own QFII or RQFII allocations.“From an execution point of view, [buying A shares] is very difficult,” said Ms Shi Cortesi, who is currently applying to the Luxembourg regulator for permission for her Greater China and Asia-focused funds, which are domiciled in the Grand Duchy, to be able to use Stock Connect.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE Group, told the FT last month that the A-shares market was within “two or three years” of being eligible for FTSE’s flagship emerging markets index, and had the potential ultimately to account for 20 per cent of global equity portfolios.Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, described the likely addition of A-shares to the global benchmarks as “without doubt the single most important financial event in the next decade”.“It probably should not be like this, but the truth is that the financial industry is incredibly beholden as to whether a country is in an index or not. It is a very powerful technical signal,” Mr Dehn said.However, Ms Shi Cortesi warned that any wholesale foreign buying of mainland Chinese stocks could create problems.“The market is currently small and can’t digest large flows, and if all index providers announce an inclusion in short proximity, the potential for market dislocation could be quite large,” she said.Ms Shi Cortesi also believed many active investors would struggle to prosper in the A-shares market, given its historic volatility, with 80 per cent of stock owned by notoriously momentum-driven Chinese retail investors, and the tendency for many companies to report purely in the Chinese language.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
290;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Vanguard adds China shares as MSCI weighs inclusion;Move by world’s largest fund provider comes days ahead of MSCI decision on the issue;Vanguard, the world’s largest fund provider, has chosen to add Chinese stocks listed on the mainland to its flagship emerging market fund, just a week ahead of a key decision on the issue from index compiler MSCI.The move to add domestic Chinese equities — known as A shares — to the fund will give Vanguard investors “more complete exposure to a key emerging economy and the second-largest stock market in the world by market cap”, the company said in a statement.After the change, Vanguard’s main emerging market index exchange traded fund (ETF), which has around $50bn in assets under management, will give Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks a 5.6 per cent weighting.The formula is based on a new index compiled by FTSE Russell, which is designed to give investors the option of switching their exposure to China at their own pace ahead of a formal review in September this year.Vanguard’s decision comes just days before MSCI announces the results of its annual classification review, in which it has proposed adding Chinese shares to its own emerging markets index but with a 1 per cent weighting.Pennsylvania-based Vanguard will be buying Chinese shares in the midst of an eye-catching bull run. Shenzhen stocks have more than doubled this year and Shanghai is up by around 50 per cent, while trading volumes on both exchanges dwarf those of anywhere else in the world.“There is no doubt that this is a bold move especially given the level at which China’s A shares are currently trading,” said analysts at Z-Ben, a Shanghai-based financial consultancy.China’s markets, though still restricted, have opened up considerably to foreign participation in the past year, most notably with the launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. Since the November debut of the cross-border trading platform global investors have added around $24bn of exposure to Chinese stocks.However, most large fund managers continue to access Chinese markets using the twin quota system controlled by the mainland regulator.Vanguard Australia recently received a licence to buy onshore assets through the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) scheme.Some investors have voiced concern at the prospect of being forced to buy Chinese shares should MSCI choose to alter its index weightings. MSCI estimates that around $20bn of fresh capital would flow into China if it gives inclusion the green light.“If all index providers announce an inclusion in short proximity, the potential for market dislocation could be quite large,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, investment manager at GAM, in a report. “Sourcing information is challenging for many investors due to the language barrier, and many are not be prepared to buy A shares.”Although investors added a record $4.6bn to China-related equity funds last week, most funds remain underweight China, according to Goldman Sachs.
291;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-03T08:24:09Z;Waiting for smoke on MSCI China A shares;Restrictions on trade and weightings must be considered carefully;It is not quite like waiting for white smoke over the Vatican but, for anyone investing in emerging markets, it comes close. Next Tuesday, we will find out the results of the latest reshuffle of the MSCI Emerging Markets index and so will know whether Chinese A-shares have been added.This does not sound like a momentous event. MSCI, like other index providers, aims merely to reflect the markets it benchmarks, not lead them. And China’s domestic stock market is already enormous — this year, its stock index futures overtook S&P 500 futures to become the most heavily traded on the planet.But it matters hugely because China places heavy restrictions on external investment, which it is only gradually opening, and because MSCI’s EM index is hegemonic among all those managing emerging markets money. Either via direct indexing or the indirect but potent influence of benchmarking active managers, any decision to open to A-shares would spark an influx of foreign money into China.That could have profound consequences after domestic Chinese indices have already gained about 150 per cent in a year. Some unquantifiable part of what is an almost entirely speculative phenomenon may well represent bets that foreign funds will soon have to buy A-shares, but it is likely that any opening by MSCI will add fuel to the speculative fire.MSCI’s methodology is public and transparent, but still leaves room for judgment and discretion, and often generates controversies — perhaps most importantly, many perennially disagree with its classification of South Korea and Taiwan as still “emerging”.Thankfully MSCI is aware of the power it has come to wield, and has gone to great lengths to handle this situation with care. If A-shares are admitted, they will be weighted according to 5 per cent of their total market value. Thus China’s total weighting within EM will be 100 per cent of H-shares (quoted in Hong Kong) plus 5 per cent of A-shares.That will mean adding 250 to 280 stocks quoted on the mainland, and will bring the total Chinese allocation within MSCI EM to just under 30 per cent. (It now stands at 25.26 per cent, but much of this rise will be driven by the strong rise of Chinese stocks compared with other emerging markets over the past 12 months).But A-shares on their own will be only about 1.2 per cent of the EM index — the current weighting of the Philippines — rather than the huge 24 per cent they would assume if added to the index in full.Even on this featherbedded basis, MSCI’s move combined with the Chinese bull market of the past 12 months and the glut of initial public offerings it has allowed, would jointly mean that funds benchmarked to the MSCI would be expected to put about 66 per cent more of any new money into China than they would have done a year ago (when China’s weight in the MSCI EM index was 18.3 per cent).According to Sebastien Lieblich, MSCI’s executive director, the decision on adding any market to the index is based on two factors — its breadth and depth, and its accessibility. The A-shares market is very deep, so the critical question is whether it is now accessible enough to external investors.Events of the past few months have sharply raised the chances that A-shares will pass this test. Positive developments listed by Mr Lieblich include the development of the Shanghai Stock Connect system, clarification of capital gains tax, the award of additional quotas for qualified foreign investors, along with the award of larger quotas to some foreigners.From now on, MSCI says it will expand A-shares’ weighting in line with improvements in accessibility. If Chinese authorities abandoned all restrictions on foreign investors this year, Mr Lieblich says it could theoretically move to a 100 per cent weighting in short order — or it could take decades if China moves slowly.Objectively, the chances are strong that A-shares will join the index this year. Such a move would make sense. It recognises reality. And it is hard to see how MSCI could manage the transition more responsibly.But the fact that it needs to tread with this care should give everyone pause. Benchmarking in most businesses makes sense. But in investment, it prompts investors to outsource their judgment to a few indexers that have become the world’s stockpickers of last resort. Thankfully, they are making their decisions more transparently than a papal conclave.john.authers@ft.com
292;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-02T07:56:39Z;Q&A: MSCI considers China A shares;Will Shanghai and Shenzhen shares be listed on global EM index?;On June 9, index provider MSCI will announce whether it plans to include Chinese A shares — those listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen — in its global emerging markets index from May 2016. The decision, says MSCI, will not really be its own, but rather a “reflection” of the views of its clients, and follows a year-long consultation that began last May. MSCI decided not to include A shares at its last review in June 2014 after pushback from investors.It will be a simple yes or no on whether A shares will be added to the MSCI emerging markets index, which is tracked by funds worth close to $1.7tn. At the moment, only Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong are included in the index, although New York-listed Chinese companies — including Alibaba and Baidu — will join them from November this year.The launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect has revolutionised the way foreign funds access China, essentially sidestepping longstanding quota and licence systems. However, many issues remain with the Stock Connect, largely concerning legal ownership rights and settlement. Shenzhen is not included in the Stock Connect, although it is in the works for later this year. Separately, Chinese authorities have been doling out new investment quotas over the past year, giving more investors improved access through the traditional routes.Passive global funds would have to buy shares right away to match the new index, while active managers would probably add them over time to reposition against the altered benchmark. The initial estimate is that around $20bn of foreign money would go into Chinese stocks to meet the MSCI target of a 1 per cent weighting in the EM index. That compares to the $23.8bn that has gone into China via the Stock Connect since November, and a current daily trading volume in Shanghai of up to $200bn.Analysts are split on what MSCI will do. Some overseas fund managers have voiced concern at being forced into a market where so many restrictions still apply. The timing — in the midst of a huge stock market rally that many see as a bubble — could also prove a frustration. Domestic fund managers are more sanguine, with some seeing the expected wave of foreign cash as another reason to buy stocks.One thing is for sure, if it does not happen this time, inclusion is fast-becoming an inevitability as China’s stock market opens up. MSCI rival FTSE Russell recently launched a new set of indices that include Chinese A shares. The idea is to give investors the choice of moving at their own pace rather than face the possibility of being forced to buy shares should FTSE alter the weightings of its standard global indices. FTSE will announce results of its annual review in September.
293;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-06-02T03:20:32Z;Negative bets on China shares may be unwise;Going short equities means taking on the central bank itself;"Despite the correction last week and the crazy volatility, the recent rise in China’s Shanghai Composite Index is good news for the over-levered companies fortunate enough to be listed on the A-share market.It is even better for local investors who have piled in, often with borrowed money. In the long term, though, it is not clear whether it will be good or bad for the many foreign funds that have been either short the market or out of it altogether.There may be worse pain to come for these investors.On June 9, the MSCI will decide whether to include China in major benchmark indices. Since the last yearly review on the matter, much has changed. At that time, the MSCI decided against inclusion because of the difficulty foreign investors had in accessing the market. But with the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme and Beijing’s decision to dismantle capital controls in both directions, the argument in favour of inclusion is more compelling now.Recent developments in China provide evidence that the surge in the equity market has Beijing’s backing. By cutting interest rates three times in six months, with more expected to come, the People’s Bank of China is encouraging flows into the equity market. So far, retail investors have been the driving force behind this rally. That the authorities are allowing these investors to use borrowed money for share purchases is further indication that the buying is in line with official policy — at least within limits.Moreover, by raising new equity, companies can use cash inflows to repay their debt at a time when the real cost of debt has risen as inflation has yielded to deflation, making the cost of servicing this debt more burdensome. Deleveraging will help improve profits, making corporate China healthier.Beijing used to obsess about the social fallout when share booms turn to busts, as they have invariably done in the short 25-year history of the market. In the past, Shenzhen saw riots in the street when the market crashed. This time, fears about unrest seem to have been suspended. Perhaps that is because the authorities expect more foreign money will soon be forced to come in.Today, many hedge funds are bearish on China, citing slowing growth, as China struggles to adjust to higher labour costs, the end of the low value-added manufacturing for export model, excess capacity in sectors including cement, glass and steel and huge ghost developments in places nobody wishes to live.They are particularly pessimistic about the banks given their massive (though minimally recognised) bad debts and the property companies that have borrowed US dollars, which they may not be able to repay.But negative may not be wise because these days going short China shares means taking on the central bank itself.“China is embarking on a pre-emptive easing cycle,” says one Singapore-based investor. “They are aggressive and they have many tools.”The central bank is not undertaking quantitative easing. To its credit, its policy is not about directly encouraging asset price inflation whether in shares or in property; it is more about stabilising prices and stimulating the real economy. Nor is China making the mistake of only relying on monetary policy — fiscal stimulus is also part of the plan.The PBoC wants to bring down the price of money (which may have the indirect benefit of stemming the rise in the renminbi) and to direct credit to smaller companies that are still starved of funds. Still, asset prices also respond to lower rates. Already there are signs that the property market is beginning to recover, as transactions increase and prices stop falling.This is a tough time for underweight foreign investors because the market is no longer cheap. “The easy returns and the low volatility returns have already been made,” says another investor. “Now the market is fairly valued.” But is the underweight now justified?Many underweight fund managers plan to make the argument to the MSCI that the Chinese stock market still is not ready for prime time, given that empty shells command multibillion dollar valuations and the market careens up and down with sickening speed.The motto of mainland investors has long been that he who does not believe in the greater fool theory is the greatest fool. This time, the uneducated punters may actually be right — at least for a while. This is not an easy time for fundamentally driven investors.henny.sender@ft.com"
294;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-05-31T04:44:16Z;Tax havens are still a desirable destination;One in six of world’s largest companies based in tax haven or have majority-owned subsidiary in one;One in six of the world’s largest companies are either based in a tax haven or have a majority-owned subsidiary in a haven, according to MSCI.The finding comes as corporate tax minimisation strategies are increasingly targeted by politicians and campaigners, while concerns about the potential reputational risks are rising among institutional investors.The index provider said 16.3 per cent of the 1,612 companies in its flagship MSCI World index are either domiciled in a tax haven or have at least one majority-owned subsidiary in one, with the latter most commonly based in the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Singapore.This figure, marginally higher than the 15.6 per cent it found in 2013, rises to 20.5 per cent if the Netherlands, which has been accused of facilitating sweetheart tax deals but is not on the list of havens compiled by the US Congressional Research Service, is included.Despite this, the proportion of MSCI World companies with a wholly owned tax haven-based subsidiary has actually fallen from 10.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent in the past two years.Linda-Eling Lee, global head of environmental, social and governance research at MSCI, said this potentially signalled a slowdown in the rate at which subsidiaries were being created in tax havens as the regulatory spotlight has intensified.As FTfm reported in April, MSCI has calculated that listed, developed-market companies are avoiding at least $82bn a year of tax through the use of havens and other minimisation strategies.The 243 companies with a large tax gap would see their aggregate post-tax profits slashed by 20 per cent if these strategies were outlawed, MSCI estimated.Ms Lee said MSCI had since been approached by a number of institutional investors keen to use the data to enhance their corporate engagement work.The index provider is now looking to develop a ranking tool to help identify companies that provide little transparency on where their revenues and earnings are generated and the tax rates they are subject to.
295;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-05-17T07:28:15Z;Chinese shares to ‘become 20% of portfolios’;A-shares just few years away from inclusion in major emerging market indices;China’s $6tn onshore A-shares market is just two to three years away from being included in the major emerging market indices, Mark Makepeace, chief executive of the FTSE Group, has said.China’s inclusion in global benchmarks would probably herald a huge inflow of capital, as most institutional investors currently have little exposure to the world’s largest emerging market.“It is without doubt the single most important financial event in the next decade,” said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, a $61bn emerging markets house.“It probably should not be like this, but the truth is that the financial industry is incredibly beholden as to whether a country is in an index or not. It is a very powerful technical signal.”In an interview with FTfm, Mr Makepeace said China’s inclusion was “getting closer”.“My guess is they are within two or three years of becoming eligible. I used to say five years,” he said. “China has the potential to become 20 per cent of global portfolios. It will dominate emerging markets.“All institutional investors are going to be holding A shares in the next three or four years, there is no doubt about that.”“The timing is right for institutional investors to start planning and start getting some exposure to the A-share market.”The comments add to the sense of momentum about China’s progress. Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets, told a Morningstar conference last week that he now had “no objections” to China’s inclusion in MSCI’s indices.“Every time MSCI came around I said ‘forget it’,” he said of his previous position.MSCI is due to make an announcement on whether A shares should be partially included in its emerging market indices on June 9. If the decision is positive, investors would expect to be given 12-24 months to build up their exposure before the move becomes effective.Index providers have held back from adding the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets to their major indices because of concerns over access for foreign investors and capital controls.At present, foreign groups can only invest if they have a quota allowance under Beijing’s qualified foreign institutional investor or renminbi-denominated QFII schemes, for which just $125bn of allocations have so far been made, although this is increasing.According to FTSE, the quotas approved to date would be enough to give China a 4.8 per cent weighting in its Emerging index. If the full A-share free float was included, this weighting would increase to 24.2 per cent, ahead of the 19.8 per cent for Hong Kong’s H shares.“I think the Chinese authorities are moving forward much, much quicker than the international community is able to grasp. It will be a real eye opener when China joins the index, because [institutional investors] are not ready for it at all,” said Mr Dehn, who pointed to a similar scenario in China’s $4.5tn onshore bond market.“Whenever the decision is made it will be a milestone for the opening up of China’s financial market and there will undoubtedly be flows,” said Hugh Young, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management.However, any large-scale buying of A shares could further inflate a bubble in Chinese equities. The Shanghai market is trading at 21.4 times earnings and Shenzhen at 60.8 times, with both having more than doubled in the past 12 months.Despite this, Mr Makepeace believed foreign investors’ biggest impact would be to make the market “more sustainable and stable”, particularly given the long-term nature of index tracking funds.
296;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-05-13T08:11:54Z;Why multi-factor funds are smarter beta;A fascinating new take on an old strategy tries to beat the market for longer;Smart beta is getting smarter. In the process, while at risk of becoming more esoteric and harder to sell, it may be putting itself on a firmer footing when it comes to claims that it can beat the market in the longer term.For the uninitiated, smart beta is the catch-all term for rules-driven quantitative strategies that take major indices and reweight them so as to create a better chance of beating the market in the long term — if all goes well. They cost more than a standard passive (or “beta”) fund, but not much more, and the hope is that they can beat the benchmark by a little more than the difference in fees.Typical strategies include weighting towards value (cheap) stocks, or stocks with momentum, or stocks with high dividends or low volatility.The greatest problem with the concept is that if it is successful, it should carry the seeds of its own demise. Once investors have cottoned on that cheap stocks outperform, more will buy them and the anomaly will disappear. The same is true of other anomalies. Put even more simply — eventually you will run out of the greater fools prepared to buy what you are selling and sell what you are buying.Further, even as these factors should logically lose their power in the longer run, there is also the problem that they tend to be cyclical. The value effect, for example, is strong and has been observed over many decades. But value investors have suffered significant underperformance for the rally of the past five years, just as they did at the top of the bull market in the late 1990s. Similarly momentum usually works beautifully, but occasionally crashes.The new answer is to create multi-factor funds. Combine several factors in one fund, and you will always have the dominant factor of the moment pulling you through. And you might just have reached the holy grail of the fund that stays ahead of the market all the time.How do they do it? Two recent offerings use different approaches. Global X is launching a fund that combines four different factors using an approach designed by the Edhec-Risk Institute. The “Scientific Beta” indices combine four factors — value, size (small stocks do well), low volatility and momentum.The method takes an existing index, and constructs four different indices from it. For example, the value index includes only those stocks that show up as cheapest. Edhec’s system then allocates weightings to each of these subindices. Over time, some will do better than others, and so there is periodic rebalancing. This can happen once a quarter, but in historic back tests rarely happens more than once a year (to limit turnover). This rebalancing can be tweaked to take advantage of factors’ cyclicality. If Edhec’s algorithm sees that the parent index is being driven by one particular factor — for example, value — then it will overweight value slightly. European exchange traded funds have surpassed $500bn in assets for the first time, with investors pumping money into asset classes buoyed by the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing programme.Continue readingThe result, if all works well, is a fund that keeps its nose slightly ahead of the market.BlackRock’s iShares, the giant of the ETF market, also has a multi-factor offering, known as FactorSelect ETFs, and based on indices produced by MSCI. Like Global X, BlackRock’s funds use four factors, but substitute “quality” (a measure of balance street strength) for low-volatility. The method for blending the factors, however, is very different.For each factor, it takes the base index and ranks it. The cheapest stock will score 1 for value, while the most expensive will get the highest rank, and so on. After producing four scores, they are then added together. The top 25 per cent on this combined ranking then go on to make up the new multi-factor index. This exercise is repeated twice a year.This is more like a traditional quantitative screen. The key difference is that a stock that shows up as cheap, but is a big company with a poor balance sheet and lousy momentum, will not get into the final index. Under the Global X approach, a stock that ranked high on value would do so.Both approaches have been back-tested, and have succeeded in beating parent indices in the past. In the case of the MSCI ETFs, the all-world version has returned 10.56 per cent per year versus 6.98 per cent for the all-world index itself — although it did underperform slightly during the crash of 2008.This activity has several implications. ETFs have until now largely been used as vehicles for investors (or usually investment advisers charging for the service) to do their own asset allocation.This is an attempt to do something different and offer a new and improved version of a “total market” fund — possibly even a better mousetrap. Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, who largely created the modern passive indexing business, says that a total market index, which buys all the stocks on offer, is all an investor needs, and that it is arrogance to try to beat it. These new multi-factor funds are effectively accepting his challenge. Both offerings aspire to give you the only fund you should ever need. Time will tell if this is hubris.Second, simplicity has been left behind a while ago. These funds are fascinating, and deserve to be watched closely. But explaining what they do is difficult (as I can attest having just tried to do so). When it comes to finding a market for them, that could be a problem.john.authers@ft.com
297;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Property investors’ appetite for debt finance rises sharply;Intense competition for assets pushedrives investors to seek riskier returns;Property investors’ appetite for debt finance has risen sharply in recent months as intense competition to buy assets drives them to seek higher, riskier returns, according to a survey of lenders.More than half of all loan requests made to UK commercial real estate financiers in the six months to the end of March were for loan-to-value ratios of more than 65 per cent, the research by Laxfield Capital and the Property Finance Forum found.That was up from 35 per cent in the previous period.By comparison, Britain’s largest listed property companies have loan-to-value ratios across their portfolios of 25-35 per cent.Highly leveraged borrowing delivers higher returns for a lower amount of initial equity, but if the value of the property the loan is secured on falls the borrower can quickly lose all their cash.This was a widespread problem for UK commercial property from 2008 onwards, when it faced its biggest crash in the wake of the global financial crisis.After the crisis financiers were unwilling to lend more than 60 per cent of the value of the property, rising to 65 per cent last year, according to Laxfield’s data. Emma Huepfl, co-principal of Laxfield Capital, said that in the past six months “we have seen increasing evidence of lenders stretching this figure to closer to 70 per cent”.The rise in demand for highly leveraged debt is the latest sign that property investors are keen to take on more risk — a trend that market observers have warned raises the threat of a real estate bubble.Prices are rising worldwide as investors searching for higher yields turn to property. The global pricing of real estate has become “increasingly aggressive”, MSCI, a research company, said last month.Mayfair landlord Grosvenor last week warned of the dangers of “complacency” and cited record low yields in several of the world’s biggest property markets as a cause for “concern about overheating”.Ms Huepfl said the UK real estate market was dominated by two types of borrowers: institutional investors such as pension funds, which remained cautious in their use of leverage, and “investors with short-term, high-return strategies” who are “currently seeking high-leverage debt”.“Funding costs have reduced significantly, with lower interest rates and margins” as lenders compete for business, she said. “It does not surprise us to see this stimulating demand for greater leverage.”In particular, private equity investors are “pushing lenders to provide more aggressively structured deals”, she added.The majority of financing requests were for new acquisitions, rather than the refinancing of existing debt, Laxfield found, another sign of the uptick in investor demand for real estate.
298;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-05-03T01:36:50Z;End of the super market in supermarkets;The safest part of the commercial property sector is starting to show some cracks;"In recent years, real estate types have often parroted the same answer when asked to name the safest slice of the commercial property market for risk-averse investors: supermarkets.People will always need to eat, rendering the sector as defensive as can be, they said, adding that the oligopolistic supermarket behemoths are as solid as the proverbial rock.This hunger for hangar-like units begat a wave of sale and leaseback deals that, in the UK alone, has seen supermarket chains offload 268 stores, with a combined value of £6.8bn, as of December, according to MSCI, the data provider.In 2014 alone, blue-chip investors from BlackRock, Aberdeen and Deutsche to the BP Pension Fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme and Canada Life, spent £1.3bn buying stores, according to Colliers International, a property company.Yet, of late, some cracks have begun to appear in this carefully constructed edifice.Last month Tesco, the UK’s largest retailer, stung investors by writing down the value of its property estate by £4.7bn. Its property, plants and equipment is now on its balance sheet at £20.4bn, 16.5 per cent less than a year ago.In February, rival Wm Morrison took a £1.3bn property writedown, while the value of its tangible assets was marked down 19.1 per cent to £2.9bn.The duo kick-started what might ultimately come to be seen as a lengthy period of retrenchment by the supermarket sector, with Morrison announcing 23 store closures and Tesco 43.So if the supermarket chains are marking down the value of their property estates by 15-20 per cent, should institutional investors have to do the same?One might think third party-owned property assets might be more vulnerable still; at the margin a retailer would surely prefer to shutter a store it no longer owns than one it still has on its books, particularly if the former has a short lease.Colliers reports that some institutional investors are now “discreetly” looking to exit from the poorer stores in their portfolios, but are trying to sell at “yesterday’s valuation”, which the market is, perhaps unsurprisingly, “resisting”.“This is a significant change in the retail market. It is something that we as fund managers are monitoring closely,” says Chris Urwin, global head of real estate research at Aviva Investors, which owns some supermarkets. “Go back a few years and people were thinking of [a store] almost as an income stream and not paying any attention to the fundamentals.”23Number of stores Wm Morrison plans to closeA store with a 20-year lease was seen as an equally safe, but higher-yielding, alternative to a 20-year bond issued by the same retailer. With bond yields in general tumbling to historic lows, owning a supermarket became an attractive alternative.For many years investors were rewarded. Even as high streets in many parts of the UK, Europe and US hollowed out as smaller retailers struggled, supermarkets continued to show their resilience by eating up market share.UK supermarkets delivered an average return of 11.7 per cent between 2009 and 2013, comfortably beating the returns from non-supermarket retail every year, according to data from MSCI.“Supermarkets have proved to be a real estate asset that has held up well since the global financial crisis as an attractive, bond-like, secure investment,” says Angela Goodings, associate director of research at TH Real Estate, part of TIAA-CREF, the US financial services provider, which has $82bn of property assets, about $30bn of which is in the retail sector.Supermarkets have yet to demonstrate how they are going to find a way to become competitive“[Inflation-linked] 20-year leases were very attractive to investors who were risk averse and it has proved to be a very secure sector.”However, in the UK at least, large supermarkets are now being assailed by a triumvirate of terrors: online food sales have risen sharply; so-called “ hard discounters” such as German duo Aldi and Lidl have seized market share; and more people are now opting for regular “convenience” shopping rather than a weekly binge at big-box outlets.“Supermarkets have yet to demonstrate how they are going to find a way to become competitive. It is quite possible that the amount of supermarket space that exists in a few years’ time is less than it is today, certainly the space occupied by the established supermarkets,” says Mr Urwin.The implications are starting to percolate through to investors.“There are structural issues where [supermarkets’] race for space has led to an oversupply in certain areas,” says Ms Goodings. She adds that while non-supermarket retail assets generated capital growth of 8 per cent in 2014, “last year we saw nothing for supermarkets. The other asset classes are in catch up.”43Number of stores Tesco plans to closeYet Ms Goodings says it would be wrong for the entire supermarket sector to be written down, arguing instead that the market is polarising and fragmenting.Whereas the strongest-performing stores in the best areas might still be valued on a yield of around 4.25 per cent, secondary assets might have drifted out to a yield of 5.25 per cent. “For some of the weaker areas there certainly will be writedowns,” she adds.Mr Urwin agrees the sector is becoming less homogenous. “A year ago, supermarkets were probably trading at fairly similar levels. Now more concern and attention is being given to the characteristics of the store itself.“The demand is still there for long-term leases that trade well and are in dominant locations,” he says.Investors are also thinking a little more about potential alternative uses of the sites they own, in case their leases are not renewed. In London and other parts of southeast England, residential development might be a lucrative option, Mr Urwin says.Harry de Ferry Foster, fund director of Cordea Savills’ £920m Charities Property fund, is more upbeat, arguing that Tesco “probably deliberately cut too hard” when writing down the value of its stores, in order “to get all of the bad news out of the way”.“I don’t think anyone worries that they are not going to pay the rent, that they are going bust,” he adds. “Tesco yields have drifted out, [but that is] primarily because of sentiment. There are very few [stores] trading [on the secondary market].”…So far, at least, worries over the declining value of supermarket stores appear to be largely a UK phenomenon.As far as Europe is concerned, Chris Urwin, global head of real estate research at Aviva Investors, says the “big weekly shop is quite a British thing and in other parts of Europe people have had the discounters and been willing to use them for longer”.Angela Goodings, associate director of research at TH Real Estate, says the supermarket sector has been “less attractive” to property investors on the continent, although supermarket-anchored shopping centres have gained some traction.These types of shopping centres are also coveted investment assets in the US, with close to 200 transactions in the past two years, says John Ragland, head of retail at TIAA-CREF, the US financial services provider.While margins are being squeezed for traditional supermarket operators and the sector has seen some consolidation, it is not being assailed by the forces at work in the UK, says Mr Ragland.Internet-fuelled home delivery “has not really taken off”, he says, while Europe’s hard discounters remain absent and shopping patterns have not changed.As a result, supermarket valuations are still rising, he says, with yields typically around 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent “for the good stuff”."
299;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-05-03T01:26:30Z;Fossil fuel divestment gathers momentum;Petition signed by 10,000 people calls on Dutch pension fund to drop oil, gas and coal stocks;More than 10,000 people have signed a petition calling on ABP, the $360bn Dutch pension fund, to drop its holdings of oil, gas and coal stocks, in a further demonstration of the momentum behind fossil fuel divestment.Last week, the Church of England, one of the world’s wealthiest religious institutions, decided to blacklist coal and tar sands investments in what was seen as a victory for campaigners seeking to make fossil fuels as unpopular as tobacco.The debate over the merits of low-carbon investment strategies has intensified amid claims that more than half of the oil, gas and coal reserves of publicly listed companies are so-called “ stranded assets” that cannot be used if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change.ABP has promised to take a “critical look” at the influence of its investments on climate change. It follows in the footsteps of a number of other European pension funds, including Sweden’s AP2 and AP4 and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund.Last month, the $1.2bn Syracuse University endowment became the latest US institutional investor to agree to reduce fossil fuel holdings. It joined a list of 23 US universities and college endowments, with combined assets of around $2.8bn, that have embraced divestment.The result is that index providers and asset managers have experienced growing demand — at least according to them — for low-carbon investment products.These range from strategies that exclude fossil fuel companies to those that exclude only coal-related stocks or those that focus on carbon risks.Jane Goodland, co-head of sustainable investment at Towers Watson, the consultancy, says: “Issues such as carbon exposures and climate change need to be understood fully by investors before they start to commit capital. Low-carbon indices are an important development but it may take time before they reach critical mass.”Index providers are notoriously reluctant to reveal details of how much money is benchmarked against particular indices. This means gauging the appetite for index-based low-carbon strategies is problematic.However, Gordon Morrison, a managing director at FTSE International, the index provider owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, says the fact that lawmakers in California are considering whether to require Calpers and Calstrs, the two US pension fund giants, to drop coal-related investments is “concentrating the attention of US investors”.Although only a small number of institutional investors have divested from fossil fuel stocks so far, Mr Morrison believes roughly 80 per cent are considering action.FTSE launched four ex-fossil fuel indices in June 2014. Mr Morrison says it is in discussions with several US retail distribution networks about the possibility of creating retail investor-focused vehicles based on these indices.More pension funds will have to offer ex-fossil fuel options to remain competitiveGiven the strength of interest in environmental issues and climate change, particularly among women and younger investors, Mr Morrison says “more pension funds will have to offer ex-fossil fuel options to clients if they wish to remain competitive”.In October 2014, MSCI launched low-carbon indices, developed at the request of AP4, FRR, the French pension reserve fund, and Amundi, the Paris-based asset manager.FRR and AP4 each provided €1bn of seed capital and Amundi hopes these commitments will grab the attention of other institutions.Olivier Rousseau, executive director at FRR, believes carbon risks are mispriced. The MSCI low-carbon indices historically delivered a performance similar to conventional cap-weighted indices. “But the portfolio will outperform when governments really start to act,” he says.FRR is also working on plans to decarbonise its €2bn portfolio of smart-beta strategies.“We believe we can reduce their carbon exposure by around 50 per cent and that the impact on returns will be negligible,” says Mr Rousseau.ETF providers have launched similar products but investor appetite for these has been mixed.Late last year, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors unveiled directly competing ETFs that track a different MSCI low-carbon target index from that employed by AP4 and FRR.Instead of excluding fossil fuel stocks, the MSCI low-carbon target index used by the two ETFs overweights those companies with low carbon emissions (relative to sales) and low potential carbon emissions (per dollar of market capitalisation). It further seeks to limit any performance deviations from the conventional MSCI world benchmark.“The low-carbon ETFs allow investors to remain engaged with fossil fuel companies, rather than excluding them from their portfolios” says Sarika Goel, an analyst at Mercer, the consultancy.The two ETFs, which were provided with seed capital by the UN staff pension fund, had combined assets of $236bn at the end of March this year. Neither has attracted fresh investor inflows.“Low-carbon strategies are still a niche [market] and it is hard to predict how many assets they will attract. But the debate is getting louder,” says Ms Goel.

Since the beginning of March, the MSCI China index is up one-fifth; MSCI India is down nearly one-tenth.This is not what one might have expected: macro data have favoured India, where growth in output has been revised up and, at 7.5 per cent, is set to surpass that of China this year.Institutional investors have been unprepared for China’s stock market rally. Asia fund managers are very overweight India, but only slightly ahead of benchmarks in China, on EPFR and MSCI data. Notably, as China’s rally has advanced, China country funds have had net outflows in all but two weeks of this year. Citi says that there is less global money invested in China now than at the start of 2012. India has one-tenth more than then.The liquidity environment is similar in both countries, with falling rates freeing cash to chase equities. Yet despite the rally in the MSCI China index, multiple expansion has not been excessive. This is partly down to the constituents: MSCI China includes stately Hong Kong-listed shares such as PetroChina, Bank of China, Lenovo and Haitong Securities, but not racy Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed A shares, which have simply exploded. Still, Citi notes that MSCI China earnings are 58 per cent above their 2008 peak. India’s earnings, meanwhile, are only 6 per cent up from pre-crisis levels.Volatility might also favour China: its volatility index has risen sharply this month, meaning investors must pay up for options to buy or sell shares in the future. Last week, the index hit 32, one-third of the high set at the peak of the 2008 panic. While also up, India’s volatility index is only 19, below the average of 25 since 2008.This suggests that investors are increasingly scared about the rally in China. The more fear there is, the more likely it is that institutions will delay investing — until they have to capitulate and play catch-up. China shares have further room to outrun India.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
301;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Sustainable investors outstrip emerging market benchmarks;Investors who shun polluting and socially irresponsible EM companies reap share price rewards;Turbulent times for emerging markets are proving a boon for “sustainable” equity investors who shun companies that damage the environment, ignore labour standards or take a cavalier attitude towards corporate governance.Indices tracking the share price performance of EM companies that pay attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria show a sharp outperformance over peers that do not bother. A similar premium is evident in investor returns for EM companies that regularly pay dividends to shareholders over those that do not, according to recent research by Standard & Poor’s Indices.The tough EM market environment accentuates the return for “sustainable” investing because a focus on risk management is particularly important in choppy conditions, fund managers said.“The outperformance of [sustainability] indices makes sense to us,” said Gary Greenberg, head of Hermes Emerging Markets, a fund. “Who would want to own companies with poor standards of governance, who pollute, and who mistreat their employees and disrespect the communities in which they operate.”The MSCI Emerging Markets ESG index, which is comprised of 355 companies that meet ESG standards, was up 7.05 per cent in the year to the end of March, compared with a 0.79 per cent rise in the benchmark MSCI EM index, according to MSCI data (see chart). Another sustainability index, the DJSI Emerging Markets index, was up 3.97 per cent in the year to end of March.ESG indices are not developed to serve an ethical agenda, but rather to select reliable firms to defray investment risks, said Emily Chew, head of ESG Asia-Pacific at MSCI. “The indices filter out the worst companies, those highly exposed to risk and with weak and poor management systems,” she said.Hundreds of “sustainability” criteria are applied to screen companies for admission into the ESG index, with a different set of standards for each industry. For example, a mining company that relies on water but operates within a depleting water basin may not qualify, she said. Big emitters of carbon that have not taken potential changes in emissions regulations into account may also fail to make the index, she said.On social issues, health and safety is key. Companies that devalue health and safety standards open themselves to legal claims, while those that skirt insurance requirements are similarly exposed. In terms of governance, the structure of the board is assessed for potential conflicts of interest and dominant shareholders, Ms Chew said.Guido Giese, head of indices for RobecoSAM, which creates sustainable indices for Standard & Poor’s Dow Jones, said: “ESG has two sides: an ethical side and a business side. Our starting point is that we make sense from a business perspective.”In the case of carbon dioxide emissions, for instance, RobecoSAM selects companies that emit the least carbon dioxide per unit of output because “more and more governments impose a price for CO2 emissions, so being an inefficient producer is bad for business”.Mr Greenberg adds: “The EM managements who haven’t yet come to terms with the rights of minorities, for whom employees are interchangeable cogs, and for whom the environment is a free externality to be exploited in the quest for better margins tend to be shorter term, transaction oriented managers focused on short-term gains, not builders of great businesses.”A similar dynamic can be seen among companies that pay dividends, versus those that do not. Dividend payments are traditionally associated with developed market (DM) companies, but in fact EM corporations are now more assiduous dividend payers than their DM counterparts, according to a study of dividends over the past 16 years conducted by Standard & Poor’s.“The percentage of dividend-paying companies in developed markets varies between 60 per cent and 70 per cent. The figure is more dynamic in emerging markets, where the percentage of companies paying dividends has steadily increased from 60 per cent at the beginning of the measurement period in 1998 to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent in 2014, surpassing the levels observed in developed markets,” according to Qing Li and Aye Soe at Standard & Poor’s.According to their calculations, emerging market dividend payers delivered annual average returns of 15.79 per cent, compared with 3.52 per cent for non-dividend payers and 12.96 per cent for the broader market in the 16 years to the end of 2014. In addition, dividing dividend payers into five groups (with the top dividend yield payers in the first quintile), the cumulative performance of such shares reflects the generosity of the dividend (see chart above).“(This) supports the assertion . . . that dividend-paying securities offer a degree of downside protection during volatile markets,” wrote Qing Li and Aye Soe.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
302;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-04-23T15:14:43Z;Opportunities to follow Saudi’s June stock market opening;;Saudi Arabia is making all the headlines at the moment. Firstly, it convinced the OPEC oil cartel to maintain production levels at its November 2014 meeting, helping to trigger the oil price crash. It has also overseen the smooth accession of King Salman after King Abdullah’s death in January, and intervened in the conflict in Yemen during the last month.Last week, Saudi Arabia announced it is pressing ahead with plans to open up the stock market directly to foreigners, giving a precise date of 15 June, ahead of its original deadline of the end of June. The final ‘rules’ will be published on 4 May, giving foreign investors a few weeks to get organised.This is an exciting development – given the size and depth of the market, which is capitalised at $554bn. There are 168 listed companies covering 15 industries in Saudi Arabia – from petrochemicals, banks, telecoms, hospital groups, education and travel companies. The notable exception is oil, which remains state-controlled.A further attraction for global investors is the liquidity of the market, which can trade up to around $4bn in shares a day. Currently, non-resident foreigners, through swaps, only make up 1 per cent of the market in terms of both value traded and percentage held. This compares to 64 per cent ownership in Turkey and 30 per cent in Brazil or South Korea.There are a number of obstacles before Saudi Arabia can win inclusion into the MSCI index, the benchmark for emerging and frontier market share investment. One of them is speeding up settlement times and another is liberalising other eligibility criteria for foreign investors. However, these are likely to be overcome in due course.The lead time towards MSCI index inclusion can be relatively long, but the debate about whether it will enter – and potentially swamp – the MSCI Frontier Index or go directly to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index will now start.For a number of years, Saudi Arabia has embarked on an ambitious investment plan in order to diversify the economy away from oil revenues and create employment for its very young population – more than 50 per cent of which is under 20 years old. Some estimates suggest 3m new jobs need to be created by 2019 to keep unemployment rates from rising above the current 10 per cent. Our regular investment trips confirm the speed at which the landscape is transforming – with new universities, new financial districts, new ports, new airports and of course the world’s largest tower all being built.Oliver Bell is manager of T.

303;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-04-17T16:06:41Z;No easy answers in emerging markets;Some look cheap compared to developed peers, but the rise of the dollar is a threat;"You probably don’t need to worry about the outcome of the UK general election if you’re a long-term investor. As our feature shows, elections don’t affect the stock market anything like as much as events elsewhere in the world.But let’s say you are getting a bit nervous about the outcome, or consider it prudent to introduce a little more diversity in your portfolio. Where should you invest? The US market looks increasingly overvalued; there’s a lovely chart doing the rounds at the moment showing how the All World index (over half of which is US companies) has diverged from earnings estimates, suggesting that valuations are not supported by rising profits.Europe used to be cheap. But since Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, cranked up the printing press and mandated national central banks to start buying government debt, European investors have thrown caution to the wind. The most obvious manifestation of that has been falling and in some cases negative bond yields; even bailed-out Spain can borrow for 10 years at 1.27 per cent.But stock markets have partied too. This may well continue, as FT Money columnist Ken Fisher pointed out last week. Germany’s Dax is up 24 per cent this year (in euro terms), about three times as much as the FTSE 100. Meanwhile in Japan, the Nikkei broke through the 20,000 points barrier this week, so only another 20,000 points to go until it retakes its 1989 high.What of emerging markets? It’s no longer possible — if it ever was — to talk about emerging markets as a single bloc. More than ever, they fall into groups: oil producers and oil consumers; those dependent on exports and those increasing consumption; those that have embraced structural reform and those that are in denial: those with large debts and those with sounder finances. Even the index providers don’t agree when it comes to emerging markets: FTSE says South Korea is a developed market, MSCI says it isn’t.Valuations vary quite widely too. India, the star performer of last year, is still going great guns — it’s a beneficiary of lower oil prices and has a reformist government with a strong mandate and lots of goodwill. But according to Bloomberg data it’s no bargain, with its stock market trading at a higher valuation than the US. Most India equity funds posted big gains in 2014.Emerging markets are taking a battering as investors withdraw at the prospect of higher global interest rates, exposing their economic and political weaknesses.Continue readingTake a look at Russia, the whipping boy of 2014. Russian stocks are off their lows, but the market is still cheaper than Greece and UK investors are getting a currency boost too — a pound now buys 75 roubles, versus over 100 at the start of the year (the bank base rate there is over 8 per cent). Sanctions don’t appear to have crushed the economy, which managed to grow 0.4 per cent in the first quarter. But the country is still high-risk, given the situation in Ukraine and its dependence on oil and gas.Brazil too is looking fairly cheap, but the news flow is awful: street protests, water rationing, corruption scandals and outbreaks of dengue fever. And then there’s China, fascinating as ever. Its economy is slowing; first-quarter output was up just 1.3 per cent, according to official figures, and analysts at Lombard Street Research think it actually fell 0.2 per cent.But you’d never know that from looking at its domestic stock markets. A-shares are in the midst of a spectacular bubble, having already doubled over the past year. A bit of number-crunching by my colleague James Mackintosh, the FT investment editor, shows that the median price/earnings ratio in Shanghai is 30, and in Shenzhen it’s 39 — more than double the S&P 500’s 18x.Money has flowed out of the real estate market and “shadow banking” system and poured into shares; at one point last year, brokers were opening 97,000 new trading accounts every day. Deutsche Bank points out that median valuations for Chinese technology stocks are now twice what US tech valuations were at the peak of the dotcom boom.There are some exchange traded funds that track the A-share market — BlackRock launched another one just this week — but most foreign investors don’t buy domestic Chinese equities. They are not included in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, because MSCI thinks China’s capital markets are not yet open enough. Look at the top 10 holdings in many actively-managed China funds and you’ll see companies like Tencent, China Mobile and CITIC Pacific. These are big parastatal companies whose shares trade in Hong Kong or New York. The indices that track their performance are up by more prosaic amounts and trade at lower valuations.Read more columns by Jonathan Eley, personal finance editorFinally, the entire investment case for emerging markets is complicated by the recent strength of the dollar, which has risen against many other currencies because investors are expecting US interest rates to rise at some point this year.A rising greenback is generally considered bad for emerging markets, because it encourages capital flows back to the US and makes dollar-denominated debt (of which they have a lot) much more expensive. Countries with a lot of dollar debt, such as Turkey, have had a torrid time.The rise in the dollar might not continue, given that recent US economic data has been on the weaker side. But just this week, the IMF warned of the potential for a “ super taper tantrum” once the Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates — and given that the original “taper tantrum” in 2013 caused a big sell-off in emerging stock markets, it’s a threat to be taken seriously.Jonathan Eley is editor of FTMoney. jonathan.eley@ft.com.

304;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Global property bubble fears mount as prices and yields spike;Asset prices rise as ‘wall of capital’ enters riskier real estate markets;Fears of a renewed global property bubble are rising as prices and yields hit records last seen before the financial crisis, according to new data.The pricing of real estate around the world had become “increasingly aggressive”, research company MSCI said. This is particularly the case in the US, where investors’ returns from rental income are now lower than before 2008, when a crash in massively overleveraged property triggered an international banking slump.Globally, property generated total average returns of 9.9 per cent in 2014 thanks to rapid capital value appreciation, MSCI found — the best performance since 2007 and the fifth consecutive year of increasing returns.The spiralling price of property assets in the world’s biggest investment markets was raising “increasing concerns over its sustainability”, said Peter Hobbs, research managing director at MSCI.“Most global markets are at or close to historic low [yield] levels,” he said. The yield expresses rental revenue as a proportion of a property's value. As values rise, yields fall.The main factor behind the pricing is “exceptionally low” bond yields, which made property much more appealing to investors in relative terms, Mr Hobbs said, citing “frenzied buying”.Jonathan Gray, global head of real estate for Blackstone, the world’s largest private real estate investor, said on Wednesday he was confident the market was not nearing a bubble.“Are we at top peak bubble? I don’t think so,” he told a conference in New York. “I think today we’re firmly in the middle of the real estate cycle. We’re only about half way to the ‘06, ‘07 activity, but clearly we’re past the distress from 2009.”Mr Gray just made a $26.5bn bet on the global property market with the acquisition of GE’s commercial real estate portfolio, with assets ranging from shopping centres in Mexico to joint venture assets in Bulgaria. The deal “made a lot of strategic sense for us”, he said.Are we at top peak bubble? I don’t think so. I think today we’re firmly in the middle of the real estate cycleHe said he saw values continuing to grow but at a more moderate pace than that of the past few years, in light of expected interest rate rises in the US.MSCI found listed real estate companies had also significantly outperformed the world’s booming equity markets. Globally equities generated a 10.4 per cent return, but property stocks returned 19.5 per cent.The findings will add to fears that central banks’ quantitative easing programmes are fuelling price bubbles in a number of asset classes.European quantitative easing was likely to boost real estate prices further, Mr Hobbs warned. “QE is sucking in real estate capital because debt finance is so cheap,” he said.A combination of QE, a lack of other high-yielding investment classes and the prospect of rising rents is set to fuel the trend further, Mr Hobbs predicted.“We are pretty close to the previous market top in terms of pricing, but rental income growth has not really come through yet so that could support further growth in the coming years,” he said. “If the US keeps doing what it has been doing for the past five years and Europe catches up, then we are set for another strong year [in 2015].”The renewed boom first appeared in high-quality assets in leading US cities and in London. UK real estate returned 17.9 per cent in 2014 while the US returned 11.5 per cent. In London returns topped 20 per cent.Several of London's biggest buildings have changed hands in the past year for record prices, including the Gherkin and the HSBC Tower in Canary Wharf. London also saw a close-fought power struggle over the Canary Wharf estate itself, which resulted in the Qatar Investment Authority and Canadian investors Brookfield winning control.Although these markets are still seeing exceptionally strong investor demand and consequently asset prices and income yields are back at historic record levels, the voracious spending — dubbed a “wall of capital” — has now spread out into riskier markets.“People are moving up the risk curve into riskier locations and taking on higher levels of debt and more challenging development activity,” Mr Hobbs said. “When you’re at or near the top of the cycle that is not necessarily a good thing to be doing.”In the past year investment cash has poured into continental Europe — particularly the periphery — MSCI found. After a record slump, sharp price rises in Dublin drove the total return in its real estate markets to hit a record 44.7 per cent — the best performer of all world cities in MSCI’s analysis.
305;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-04-12T01:26:28Z;The $82bn listed-company tax gap;MSCI analysis reveals widespread use of tax havens and other minimisation strategies in developed markets;Listed companies in developed markets are avoiding at least $82bn of tax a year by using tax havens and other minimisation strategies, according to detailed analysis of more than 1,000 businesses.The revelation comes as campaigners and investors have increased their focus on the impact of corporate tax avoidance on public finances at a time of widespread austerity.The analysis, conducted by MSCI, the index provider, suggested companies in the healthcare and information technology sectors were among the biggest tax avoiders, in line with anger over the level of tax paid by the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon.Linda-Eling Lee, global head of environmental, social and governance research at MSCI, said companies with a large “tax gap” faced reputational risks, as well as the prospect of lower post-tax profits if these gaps are plugged.“Tax avoidance is an issue investors are increasingly aware of,” said Alex van der Velden, founder and chief investment officer of Ownership Capital, the Dutch asset manager. “The public ire that has been created by businesses found aggressively pursuing loopholes to pay abnormally low taxes has been significant and has led to serious reputational issues. Such risks can have material long-term financial implications.”Kieran Quinn, chairman of the UK’s Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, which last month wrote to every FTSE 100 company asking for details of their tax planning practices, added that “some of the [examples of tax minimisation] we have heard about recently are not just about clever accountancy — in our view it is very close to criminal activity.”MSCI estimated the size of the global corporate tax gap by calculating the average annual tax rate paid between 2009 and 2013 by the 1,505 companies in the MSCI World index, which accounts for about 85 per cent of stock market capitalisation in 23 developed countries.Stripping out lossmaking companies, miners and property groups, MSCI then estimated each of the remaining 1,093 companies’ potential tax rate by calculating the weighted average tax rate in the countries where they derive their revenues. The tax gap is the difference between these two figures.MSCI found that 243 companies had a tax gap of at least 10 percentage points. If these companies, which had an average tax rate of 17.7 per cent of pre-tax profits, instead paid tax at the 34 per cent rate typically incurred by the remaining 850 companies, this would have raised their tax bills by $82bn a year, an average of $337m a company, MSCI said.This in turn would have reduced the aggregate post-tax profit generated by these 243 companies by 20 per cent.Jolyon Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax law, said investors were not paying enough attention to the impact that global tax reform could have on corporate profits.Citing the OECD’s Base Erosion Profit Sharing initiative, due to be outlined in September, he said: “The effect of the BEPS project will fall most heavily on companies that engage in more aggressive tax planning strategies. I do not sense sufficient investor concern about the likely effect of the BEPS project on the post-tax returns of the companies in which they invest.”MSCI’s Ms Lee said investors were viewing the aggressiveness of a company’s tax planning as a proxy for accounting risks and the company’s broader management style.More than a third of healthcare and technology companies are among those with large tax gaps, MSCI found, along with a quarter of those in the energy and materials sectors.At least 40 per cent of MSCI World companies domiciled in Bermuda, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, Hong Kong and Luxembourg were found to have large tax gaps, along with 27.1 per cent of US companies and 22.5 per cent from the UK. Japan came bottom of the list, with just 7 of its 193 companies in this camp.Just under 11 per cent of companies had at least one majority-owned subsidiary in a “tax haven” in which it is not domiciled, MSCI said, with the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg the most popular such countries.Richard Murphy, founder of the Tax Justice Network, a campaign group, said MSCI’s estimate of the size of the global tax gap was “reasonable”, although it may understatement the true figure, given the tax deferral activities many companies use to lower their bills.Mr Murphy estimated corporate tax avoidance in the UK alone amounted to £12bn in 2008, although this figure is likely to have fallen since given a cut in the corporation tax rate from 28 per cent to 20 per cent.
306;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-04-07T16:28:19Z;Corporate boards: Quota, unquota;Why the UK experience demonstrates the importance of diversity quotas;Names matter. Lord Mervyn Davies knew this when his 2011 report on women on boards set a “target” for gender diversity — not a quota. The target had teeth, though. A quota loomed if the 2015 target was missed. Four years on, FTSE 100 boards comprise 24 per cent women, up from 13 per cent in 2010, on track to meet the 25 per cent quota (sorry, target) by year-end.This is good news for UK business. Fairness is not the issue, so much as clubby, inflexible boards. Those with gender diversity had fewer governance scandals between 2011 and 2014, according to an MSCI study of 6,500 global companies in its indices. Boards with three or more female directors had higher returns on equity and capital (5 and 4 percentage points higher, respectively) than those with less, research on Fortune 500 companies between 2001 and 2004 shows. Board performance surely needs more study, but it makes sense that less groupthink and a better understanding of customers and workers would help diverse boards to achieve better results. With a shortage of key talent identified as a critical business issue, women and minorities are an untapped talent pool that should not be ignored — and the change might as well start at the top.All of this will make doctrinaire free marketeers shudder. But Lord Davies’ target has brought substantial change to the UK, as have quotas in Italy and France. Critics worry about tokenism, a lack of qualifications, and a small cadre of qualified women taking on multiple roles (hardly real diversification). While recent experience in India has been marred by nepotism, critics’ fears have not been realised in recent French and British board appointments.Voluntary targets do not lead to substantial change. The UK success shows that a big stick is needed to create meaningful change. In the US, soft targets have increased gender diversity by just 1 percentage point since 2009. Spain, with no penalty for non-compliance, is far behind on its 40 per cent target.Call them quotas, targets or whatever else — then give them teeth and let them bite.E-mail the Lex team at lex@ft.com
307;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-04-02T20:40:13Z;Alliance Trust: numbers up;Investment group must prove it has a strong and unique selling point to investors;Stand-off in Dundee. The local hero: Alliance Trust, an investment trust (or closed end fund) managing about £3bn. The outsider: Elliott Advisors, the US activist hedge fund famous for attacking the Argentine government.Elliott has owned Alliance Trust shares since 2011. It now has a 10 per cent stake. Its main beef is that the shares have traded at an average discount of 13 per cent to their net asset value over the past three years, while performance has been dull at best. Discounts are common at investment trusts, but the average trust investing in global equities (as Alliance does) has a discount of just 6 per cent.Elliott also wants the management fees to fall. Alliance Trust charges fixed active management fees — now worth about 65 basis points — for a fund that has closely tracked the MSCI All Country World Index (93 per cent correlation over three years). Alliance argues that its fixed fee structure means that the proportion will fall as the trust’s assets swell over time. Yet an exchange-traded fund of the same MSCI index would cost half of what Alliance charges.If Alliance could prove that its investment skill is worth the extra charges, then perhaps fewer activists such as Elliott or Laxey Partners (in 2011) would take an interest in it. But the investment performance of Alliance, led by Katherine Garrett-Cox, has trailed the world benchmark since 2010. That has not prevented her pay from doubling over that period to £1.4m.So Elliott makes some good points. But it is overplaying its hand. It has proposed three candidates for an expanded 10-seat board of directors, although it insists that these nominees are independent. Perhaps. But if successful, Elliott could have influence well above the size of its stake in the company. Unless it scales back its ambition (or increases its stake), other shareholders would be right to reject its proposed directors.But Alliance Trust has the bigger questions to answer. Unless it can prove it has a strong and unique selling point to investors, the company will struggle to extend its 142-year history.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
308;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-03-08T08:00:11Z;Boards without women breed scandal;MSCI research finds that male-heavy boards carry a higher risk for investors;Public companies with more women on their boards are less likely to be hit by scandals such as bribery, fraud or shareholder battles, according to research from index provider MSCI, which looked at more than 6,500 company boards globally.The research found that boards with gender diversity above and beyond regulatory mandates or market norms had fewer instances of governance-related scandals.“There is a clear pattern between having higher than mandated percentages of women on boards and fewer governance-related controversies,” the report said.Matt Moscardi, senior analyst at MSCI, said the findings show a board with few or no women should be a red flag to investors “actively looking to limit the possibility of investment capital being subject to fraud or corruption”.Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of Hermes Investment Management, said of the findings: “If you are a Neanderthal and need more reasons to try to have women on boards, here is a bloody good one. It clearly shows you reduce the risk on boards if you have more women.”The MSCI research was careful not to draw any conclusions about women’s abilities and characteristics, and instead suggested the number of women on a board should be seen as “a single data point in a matrix of progressive governance indicators”.Companies that are more concerned about managing extra-financial risks are more likely to appoint women directors, said Mr Moscardi. This would explain another finding: companies with more than average numbers of female directors score more highly on MSCI’s metric for management of environmental, social and governance risks.MSCI data pointed to 12 global companies with a market capitalisation of more than $25bn that had greater than average governance controversies over the past three years and fewer women on their boards than the country average.The list includes Bank of New York Mellon, with one woman among 13 directors, and futures exchange CME, with one woman among 29 directors. In Europe, Crédit Agricole and Nokia feature on the list, while Indian companies Tata Motors and Reliance Industries also appear.Anne Richards, chief investment officer of Aberdeen Asset Management, Europe’s largest listed fund company, said: “It’s not a surprise that more diverse boards have fewer governance issues or scandals. I don’t think this is because women are inherently more ‘moral’ than men. And it’s difficult to tease out cause and effect — are better companies more likely to embrace diversity or does diverse leadership make for better companies?“What we can say with certainty is that gender diversity is a good proxy for more general cognitive diversity, and we know that cognitive diversity leads to better problem solving and outcomes.”Mr Moscardi added there would be a benefit to companies that recruit more widely than the usual white male middle-aged demographic. “Companies thinking about these things will have a bigger pool of talented people,” he said.Fiona Hathorn, managing director of Women on Boards, a women’s business network, said of the research: “It does not surprise me. A woman often brings to the boardroom different perspectives and insights, because she may well have been brought up in different way to a man.“As a consequence …she is likely to ask different questions and hear different things. Research suggests that women do more due diligence, are more reflective and take more measured risk decisions.”
309;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Activist investors’ success owes much to wider bull run;Why a bear market will hit activists again, as it did in 2008;The activist attacks come in wave after wave.Sotheby’s settled with Daniel Loeb last year only to find a second hedge fund, Marcato, demanding yet more share buybacks. From Pepsi to MSCI to Zoetis to Dow Chemical, companies are accepting activists’ nominees on to their boards rather than fight. Activism has outpaced other hedge fund strategies in terms of returns, and the uber-aggressive Bill Ackman was 2014’s most successful high profile hedge fund manager by a mile, up 40 per cent.Take the frenetic pace of headlines together, and little wonder investors sniff something important happening. They have poured money into activist hedge funds — a record $14.2bn last year, according to HFR, taking the global total in these funds to almost $120bn.However, investors’ hopes for fat profits may be based on a misunderstanding. Rather than a secular trend that will reap bumper profits for activists forever, more likely they are chasing a cyclical bull market phenomenon that will leave them bruised when the markets turn.A cheerleading report by the Alternative Investment Management Association, the hedge fund industry’s trade group in London, recently surveyed all the academic literature and concluded that activism is good for the companies that get targeted and good for the market as a whole.That may be the case, although as Aima shows there is a lot of contradictory evidence from different markets around the world. It is not a debate likely to be settled without more evidence, if it can be settled at all. What is more interesting about this latest survey is how weakly it supports the investment case for backing an activist fund.First and most obviously, there is the question of returns. The HFRI activist index climbed 4.8 per cent in 2014, on top of 16 per cent and 21 per cent in the previous two years, so it handily outpaced all other hedge fund strategies, which is why money is clamouring for entry into these funds now. Except that this outperformance is hardly surprising, given the go-go equity market in which these funds are making their stock picks.The activists have not performed markedly differently from the stock market as a whole. They underperformed the S&P 500 in five of the past seven years, roughly one market cycle, but not by much, suggesting they are heavily influenced by market beta.If they were justifying their fees and hedging out this stock market exposure, isolating only the upside attributable specifically to their corporate agitation, then one would expect them to outperform in a down market, but they matched the S&P 500 leg-for-leg on the way down in 2008.A new bear market will have consequences again for activists, as it did in extreme form seven years ago.First, economic uncertainty will make it notably less attractive to pile debt on to a corporate balance sheet and return cash to shareholders, staples of the activist playbook. Second, it will snuff out the merger and acquisition activity that has been a key ingredient in the only incontrovertible value-adding strategy for activists, namely getting their target company to put itself up for sale.$14.2bnThe record amount of money poured into activist hedge funds last yearSomething else dispiriting for activist hedge fund investors: the averages that show industry-leading returns versus other hedge fund strategies obscure huge variations in activists’ returns, according to Aima’s survey of the evidence. A small minority of managers make Ackman-size returns, skewing the HFRI data. A JPMorgan Asset Management survey found that the mean activist return is three times larger than the median. In other words, the average investor is unlikely to match the HFRI index returns.As a collective, activist managers can be applauded for advancing the cause of shareholder democracy and good corporate governance, which was otherwise moving at a glacial pace in the hands of traditional institutional equity owners. That is one secular shift that investors can take comfort in, but it brings societal and market-wide benefits, not ones that accrue to activists specifically.Actually, by encouraging companies to act pre-emptively to respond to shareholders and improve their businesses, activists may be doing themselves out of potential future targets.Activists are the most heavily influenced of all the hedge fund strategies by the ebb and flow of the stock market, and when the ebb tide comes, it will surely wash many of their strong records away.stephen.foley@ft.com

You have to stay in the game as long as possible, even if it means winning by not losing much. Not flashy but profitable eventually. Global emerging market equity managers probably have this sense of survival. The MSCI emerging markets index has trailed the world index in three of the last four years. These EM managers are playing the long game, hoping that these markets come back into fashion.Nevertheless, market storms do affect retail investors. Last year outflows did accelerate at the end of 2014. According to Lipper data, in the fourth quarter over $5bn left EM equity funds (based in Europe), the bookend to a first quarter withdrawal of nearly $6bn. Globally, if exchange traded funds are included, the numbers look much larger. Over $20bn flowed out of all EM funds in 2014 and perhaps $9bn this year so far, much of it from Latin American and Emea regional funds, thinks Credit Suisse.For all the bad press, emerging market equity funds have not performed so badly. As an example, EM funds (in Europe) rose 10 per cent in 2014. So far this year the emerging markets have started relatively well, keeping pace with their developed peers. The market may have noted that the price to earnings ratio for emerging markets is at the steepest discount — 28 per cent — to the developed world in a decade.Plus, there is always a bull market somewhere. India is a major bet for global EM managers these days, believes Credit Suisse. Funds on average hold over 15 per cent of their portfolios in Indian companies, double the benchmark weighting. Good thing, too. India has jumped 41 per cent in dollar terms over the past year.The persistent rise of the dollar has put downward pressure on EM currencies, in turn pushing up interest rates in these countries. Risk is not abating. EM managers have done well considering what they have been dealt. Game on.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The MSCI AC World index has more than 50 per cent in the US; Mr Asante’s funds have around 25 per cent. The US was one of the best-performing markets in 2014.Mr Asante’s funds instead had a lot of exposure to emerging markets, either through companies listed in the region or companies generating a high proportion of profits in these markets.He added these stocks had suffered, as in most emerging markets “currencies were mainly weak [and] hindered [stocks] from rising strongly”.A high weighting in cash also dragged on the funds’ performance, given that global markets rose in 2014. The Worldwide Equity fund holds 8.1 per cent in cash while the Leaders fund has double that.Mr Asante said the funds had additionally missed out due to a lack of exposure to technology and internet companies, which “became increasingly popular as the year progressed”.In the letter to shareholders, Mr Asante wrote: “Lagging US-led markets is regrettable and we certainly do not aim to make excuses for it. What we can say is that we are maintaining the approach to both grow and protect clients’ capital for the longer term.“Philosophically our approach has changed very little over the years and has been proven by our other funds’ track records.”The First State problems have mirrored those of rival Aberdeen Asset Management. Its global equity products suffered a torrid 2014 due to the fact that it owned few US-based or technology stocks and piled into emerging markets.Like Aberdeen, Mr Asante said First State would not change its approach.Mr Asante suggested that the euphoria over some US-listed companies was akin to that seen in Brazil in 2009, following a huge rally many thought would continue despite the market proving expensive.Since the end of 2009, the Brazilian market has fallen 50 per cent.Matthew Jeynes is deputy news editor at Investment Adviser"
312;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-28T18:46:08Z;Why factor investing is flavour of the month;But four-decade run of outperformance may not last;"There is big money in factor investing — the art of tweaking an index to profit from long-term anomalies. That at least is true of the exchange traded fund and index providers who are launching a swath of factor-based products. The trickier question is whether factor investing will be as profitable for end investors.Last year, MSCI — the biggest provider of factor indices — saw the launch of 42 new ETFs that track its factor indexes. There were six such launches in 2013. Providers are also growing more ingenious, launching 12 ETFs last year that combine two MSCI factors.The burgeoning industry of advisers who arrange ETFs into a portfolio for retail investors have taken up factors but they have largely been tailored to the precise requirements of large pension funds, such as the Arizona State Retirement System, which wanted a way to hedge out exposure to specific factors. This is an example of the new ETF technology being used to deal with specific problems.As a share of the industry, factor ETFs remain tiny. But their growth is impressive. The iShares min Vol series, tracking low-volatility stocks, now has $9.2bn under management, while a broader range of factor index funds launched with $400m in seed capital from Arizona in late 2013 is now worth $2bn. There is room for growth and they are the flavour of the month.Is the enthusiasm justified? Certainly, the historical evidence suggests that there is much to it. Academic researchers have long identified value, size and momentum factors; cheap companies, small companies, and companies whose price is already rising, will all tend to do better than others in the long term.Small-cap indices have long been kept, and outperform in the long run. MSCI has back-tested its factor indices, as far as 1973, and the results over those four decades are comparably strong. All are drawn from its World index covering the world’s developed economies. Over that period, a dollar in the momentum index would have turned into $98, by the end of 2014, while the value index would have risen to $49. The World index itself would have risen to $34.To these can be added low volatility— that less volatile stocks tend to outperform the market, once risk is taken into account — while some also add “quality” — companies with strong balance sheets and reliable earnings outperform, even if they are not cheap. And there is the ongoing paradox of dividends. Investors should not care how much money companies choose to pay out in cash but over time high dividend-yielding stocks perform well.The indices based on these factors would all have beaten the World index over the past 20 years. Over the past decade, the value and high-dividend indices, which tend to overlap, have slightly lagged behind. This is a sign that value, which has lagged behind throughout the post-crisis rally, is due to start rallying once more.Attempts to beat the market are expensive and hard to justify. Locking on to factors that have outperformed in the long run, and doing so as cheaply as possible — via an ETF linked to a specially drawn-up index — has a clear appeal. This is not just marketing.Where can the idea go from here? Roger Ibbotson, the veteran market analyst, suggested last year that low liquidity should be regarded as a factor in its own right. Companies with relatively little activity tend, ultimately, to pay a premium. However, this factor is not so far sparking much interest, in part because it is difficult to design a way to extract value from buying illiquid stocks — the factor may exist, but only on paper.More broadly, the risk is that factor investing becomes a victim of its own success. In the short term, there is the risk of overcrowding, particularly if the environment changes against and prompts a rush for the exits. For low-volatility stocks, which prosper in a low-interest rate environment, this means there is the risk of a reversal if rates in the US start to rise this year.Longer term, once enough people understand that there is an anomaly, and act accordingly, it will go away. The four-decade run of outperformance by the MSCI factor indices proves that real and pervasive anomalies were present. But it also suggests that the anomalies have steadily been corrected. Nobody should project such strong returns into the future.john.authers@ft.com"
313;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-21T17:38:53Z;Reits rally looks to be running out of steam;Office real estate is one of few pockets of value in the sector;How long can real estate keep going ? Ever since bond yields peaked early last year and began their descent, real estate — particularly in the US — has been by far the most conspicuous winner.An impressive rally turned into a stampede in the last quarter of last year, as the oil price tumbled, taking away a rival source of yield for income investors.Since November of 2013, when this column pointed out that real estate investment trusts (Reits) made an interesting contrarian bet on interest rates, the FTSE Nareit Reits index has gained 37 per cent. This is a US-led phenomenon, thanks to the strength of the dollar, but equivalent European, global and UK Reit indices have gained 20, 14 and 11 per cent respectively. Since early October the S&P 500 Reits index is up 19 per cent, ahead of the S&P 500 (1.4 per cent up), while the Alerian index of high-yielding oil master limited partnerships is down 22.5 per cent.Alas, this suggests that Reits may have come as far as they can — and could be a geared play on interest rates again, this time on the way down.Basic valuations are concerning. Every real estate sector covered by SNL Securities trades at a premium to its net asset value. Healthcare Reits, buoyed by hospital consolidations and the influx of funds under “Obamacare”, trade at a 25 per cent premium.Yields on the sector have grown less attractive. The world real estate sector yields 3.21 per cent, according to MSCI. This is better than government bonds, but below yields on telecoms, utilities or — for the bold — energy stocks.Jason Lail, head of real estate research at SNL, suggests that valuation concerns are overstated. Reits trade at a premium of 12.4 per cent to net asset value, up from a 6 per cent discount when the rally started. But Reits tend to trade in a range of 20 per cent either side of net asset value, and remain within a normal range.Also the sector’s fundamentals look sound. The lingering effects of the financial crisis mean there is still relatively little new supply on the way, particularly in offices. And net asset values rose last year across the sector, even if valuations rose faster.At these valuations, investors will need to be selective, and restrict to Reits that do not appear overvalued, most obviously in the office sectorThis trend could of course continue, if bond yields keep falling. Investment-grade 10-year corporate bond yields dropped by the end of last week to their lowest level (4.42 per cent) since 1957, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds are at historic lows. This might suggest yields cannot possibly fall much further — but while such extreme conditions persist for other income-producing assets, yields on Reits can stay low.Further, the fall in oil prices justifies optimism (although this may be priced in by the autumn rally). Cheaper oil helps retailers by giving consumers more disposable income, and also makes it that much easier to push up rents on residential blocks. The low oil price has also soured investors on high-yield bonds, another logical place to look for yield, as it calls the creditworthiness of small oil producers into question.And there are some pockets of value in real estate. Office Reits trade at a minimal premium, and benefit from constricted supply. Jason Ko, a portfolio manager of the JPMorgan Realty Income fund, suggests that Boston Properties, which specialises in offices in the most competitive US cities, looks strong on this basis.In retail, he adds, bankruptcies for US malls, and closures by chains such as Macy’s and JCPenney, have constricted supply, strengthening the position of the survivors. Simon Property, which is focused on property after recent disposals, is Mr Ko’s biggest holding, followed by ProLogis, a global industrial player. But with dividend yields of 2.6 per cent and 3.0 per cent, these Reits would look less attractive if rates rose.There are good reasons why real estate has rallied, and it remains a good place for investors who need a yield. But at these valuations, they must be selective, and keep to Reits that remain decently valued, mostly in offices. And they should know that Reits could fall quickly if oil prices rally, or if bond yields rise again.john.authers@ft.com
314;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-18T04:19:17Z;‘Refreshment’ is the new boardroom buzzword;Discussions around corporate governance have moved beyond gender balance issues;"Until recently, the discussion around corporate governance centred largely on board diversity. This appeared to refer mostly to gender balance, although analysts were always careful to say it also referred to ethnic mix and appropriate skill sets.The argument has moved on with a new buzzword: board refreshment. This does not refer to the quality of coffee and biscuits, but the processes that are in place (or not) to ensure so-called independent directors do not become entrenched and that new faces are brought on board in a timely and effective manner.For those wondering how to go about assessing board refreshment standards, Howard Sherman, head of corporate governance business development at MSCI, the stock market indices company, and a 25-year veteran of corporate governance analysis, has a succinct to-do list. “You look at how directors are nominated, how directors are evaluated and how directors are rotated off the board,” he says.GMI Ratings, founded by Mr Sherman and now part of MSCI, has a measure for “ entrenchment” of non-executive directors that is a function of the director’s age and tenure on the board. “You want experienced directors on the board by all means, but if they are past retirement age and have been on the board for many, many years, that is not good.”The average non-executive director of a FTSE 100 company has been on the board almost six years, according to figures from MSCI. Although this appears much better than the nine the corporate governance code suggests is the limit for maintaining genuine independence, this is the mean, indicating that many directors have been in place much longer.Many companies look on the nine-year tenure as a de facto term limit, “pensioning off” non-execs at that point, in the words of one FTSE 100 non-executive director due to stand down this year. Lucy Kellaway combines being a columnist at the FT with a directorship at Admiral, an insurance company. She says: “We usually pension people off at the annual general meeting and so the plan is that I will leave early in 2016.”In the US, the focus is less on limiting board tenure and more on the nominations process. This is currently quite opaque, according to Mr Sherman. “In Europe, there is more the ability to nominate, so the conversations are more about how we can ensure directors are rotated off the board.”Term limits have been suggested to US boards. Some have put them in place, but limiting tenure to a mere 25 years has made them effectively meaningless, according to Helena Morrissey, chairwoman of the UK’s Investment Association and chief executive of Newton Investment Management.In the UK, even the average six-year tenure is too long, says Graeme Ashley-Fenn, co-head of regulatory practice at Alvarez & Marsal, the consultancy. “I think they should start looking after five years.”Mr Ashley-Fenn, who was a director at the UK’s Financial Services Authority between 2004 and 2011, says many chairmen are struggling to interpret the requirements of the corporate governance code as it pertains to board composition. “What they have done is bring a few people in as replacements, but the core is still in place.”Since the object of the exercise is partly to ensure there is no established core that is immune to challenge and deaf to dissent, this means those boards have ticked the box without achieving their aims.Ms Morrissey has a similar warning: “Board effectiveness reviews must not be lulled into a false sense of security [by thinking that] just because there are a few women, everything is different.”With more than 200 FTSE 100 directors in situ for more than six years, and 10 per cent of directors breaching the nine-year guideline, Ms Morrissey suggests that focusing on replacing these directors would improve turnover and bring a more diverse mix of directors.As founder of the 30 Per Cent Club, which campaigns to bring the proportion of female directors up to 30 per cent, Ms Morrissey might be assumed to be working in the cause of equity and fairness. But she says the question of appropriate skill sets is actually “the precursor to the diversity question”.In other words, if you only have middle-aged white men from a certain class and background on your board, you are unlikely to be well-placed to deal with a rapidly changing marketplace driven by moves towards digital, an economy where women have increasing spending power, or a business that is attempting to go from domestic to global.Very few board appointments are made without the involvement of search firms, aka headhunters. These agencies have been criticised for failing to take on board the requirements of boards seeking to build diversity, and in particular for the lack of imagination that leads to bland shortlists for vacancies. Graeme Ashley-Fenn, co-head of regulatory practice at Alvarez & Marsal, the consultancy, is particularly familiar with the financial services sector. He says he can predict the names on the long list for board vacancies at companies such as Barclays or Lloyds Banking Group with unacceptable accuracy. “Banks need to reach out and build a network of potential directors to get the depth of skills they need.”Continue reading“The real issue is not so much refreshment as getting the right composition,” says Malcolm McKenzie, who leads Alvarez & Marsal’s corporate solutions practice and recently launched a performance improvement practice. According to a recent survey conducted by the company, the most obvious gaps in board expertise are “the digital world; various generations and other segments of consumers; and geographical range”.Although Mr McKenzie is optimistic that most chairmen have the question of board effectiveness on their agenda, he warns against moving too fast. “There is a danger of boards refreshing themselves too quickly and losing institutional knowledge.”Regular, formal evaluations are of great importance in creating effective boards and these processes are becoming part of the landscape for most large, listed companies. To be effective, these evaluations must include looking at tenure and skills, but also how the board functions as a team. “Any decent evaluation should be looking at the dynamics of the board, and that means it should include at least one board evaluation,” says Mr McKenzie.This makes for a challenging job. Telling the chairman of a multinational company he should shut up and let others speak in meetings, or explaining why a director who has been there for 15 years needs to step down, is not an easy task, however necessary.“It is a very sensitive process for a lot of directors,” says Mr Sherman. “Once you are a director, you are probably pretty senior and not used to people telling you you are out of date.”These uncomfortable conversations are becoming necessary though, as more and more investors are paying attention to the boards of the companies they invest in, and asking difficult questions about how well they serve their purpose."
315;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-13T18:02:02Z;New activist investor takes aim at MSCI;Naya Management joins ValueAct in calling for change;MSCI, the stock market indices provider, is facing new public pressure from one of its leading shareholders, days after activist hedge fund ValueAct demanded a seat on the board.Naya Management, a London-based value investment firm led by Masroor Siddiqui, has written to MSCI to urge the company to break itself up or put itself up for sale.The letter to MSCI’s lead independent director Rodolphe Vallee, a copy of which was seen by the Financial Times, echoes ValueAct’s criticism of weakening margins at the company, but goes further in urging the board to consider strategic alternatives.Investments in risk management and portfolio businesses, outside its core indexes business, are not generating sufficient returns, wrote Mr Siddiqui, who is a protege of UK activist investor Chris Hohn.“In fact, these acquisitions have turned out to be costly failures. We believe the best way for the company to generate additional shareholder value would be for it to consider strategic alternatives for its various divisions.”MSCI’s management has defended its existing strategy of tightly integrating portfolio management tools with its historic indices business. It says the practice allows it to sell bundles of products to the investment industry. The company has also been returning cash to shareholders. Late last year MSCI hired advisers to help defend itself against activists, and on Tuesday a spokesman said: “We believe the strategic investments the company is making across its platform will enable MSCI to expand margins and capitalise on significant market opportunities in the years ahead.”Mr Siddiqui set up Naya in 2012 after leaving Mr Hohn’s firm TCI. Naya has amassed a 2 per cent stake in MSCI, putting it among the company’s top 20 shareholders.ValueAct, which holds 8.3 per cent of MSCI, went public with a demand that its representatives be added to the board. However, people familiar with the situation say the rift between the company’s management and ValueAct goes beyond the question of a board seat and reflects fundamental differences over strategy.
316;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-11T07:14:55Z;SRI: Ethics beyond the Wall Street walk;Socially responsible investment is becoming a mainstream strategy;Since the economic crisis, the financial services industry has been under pressure to prove it is a good global citizen. There is a way it may be able to justify its existence in 2015: it can now say with some credibility that responsible investing has gone mainstream.Responsible investment — also known as sustainable or ESG-themed (environmental, social and governance) investment, or SRI (socially responsible investment) — has been around for more than a decade. It evolved out of restrictive ethical investment practices. However, until recently it has been a niche activity.But with signatories to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment approaching 1,400 in number, including diverse organisations from huge pension funds to actuarial consultants and US fund distributors, it seems unlikely to go away.“I joined this world three years ago, and the dial has moved up very seriously,” says Francois Passant, executive director of Eurosif, the European sustainable investment forum. Eurosif’s report on SRI activity in Europe, published in October, found that assets managed under SRI principles are growing faster than the overall asset management industry.Sustainability-themed investment has gained 22.6 per cent between 2011 and 2013, while the assets subject to voluntary exclusions have almost doubled in that time. Impact investment, which aims to generate social and environmental good alongside a financial return, has experienced the fastest growth (132 per cent) in that time, albeit from a very low base. Over the same period, European assets under management have grown by 22 per cent.In the US, the trend is similar, although SRI’s profile is lower than in Europe. “We are starting to see some progress, particularly in the US,” says Fiona Reynolds, managing director of the PRI. Vanguard, the passive investment manager, has signed up to the PRI recently, as has Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“It has not just been managers, though,” says Ms Reynolds. She lists the endowments of Harvard and the University of California among others that have come on board. Although the Harvard Management Company, which looks after Harvard’s $36bn endowment, is a recent signatory, it seems to be a wholehearted convert.Jane Mendillo, president and chief executive of Harvard Management Company, told an investor conference in October that it was already integrating ESG factors into its investment processes. Voting and engagement practices are on the agenda and it is working to establish an ESG endowment group to share best practice.Although exclusion (refusing to invest in certain industries or companies) is the main form of responsible investment practised in Europe, Harvard’s intentions cover the more active versions. In many cases, this type of investment is motivated less by conscience and more by a belief that non-financial issues have a measurable impact on the long-term value of companies.Corporate governance, the g of ESG, has long been understood to affect stock performance, and there is a wealth of research showing that, for example, more diverse boards lead to better-run companies. Shareholders have a clear interest in protecting minority shareholder rights, and the way in which executive pay is set has an obvious impact on the agency issues of management versus shareholder.Executive pay, in particular, has been a focal point for shareholder ire. “These are issues that catch everyone’s attention, because they are outrageous,” says Ms Reynolds. “Everyone sitting at home can identify with the anger.”In the past, says Howard Sherman, head of corporate governance at MSCI, the stock market indices company, investors were simply expected to “do the Wall Street walk, just sell what you don’t like”. That is no longer the norm, he says. Voting against the board at annual general meetings is a first line of attack for investors who see governance problems, but it is “not the be-all and end-all”.Company boards are starting to accept that they have to engage with shareholders, particularly asset managers. With the rise of passive managers, who do not have the option of selling shares with which they are unhappy, engagement is likely to grow. Vanguard has announced plans to set up shareholder liaison committees for this purpose.The large body of work on governance means it is an easy way into ESG factors, says Ms Reynolds, but as climate change becomes inevitable and undeniable, investors are engaging more on these issues too.Increasing demand for information on environmental and social issues was a significant factor for Mr Sherman in seeking a relationship for his company, Governance Metrics International, with MSCI, which had established expertise in those areas. The index provider bought GMI and Mr Sherman has been building a new set of skills himself.“I have had to bone up on factor attribution analysis and index construction,” he says. This year, MSCI launched a range of ESG-based indices, including fossil-fuel and climate-change indices. This is in response to customers who want tools to help them make what they see as investment, rather than ethical, decisions.“A lot of people in the ESG space are value driven,” says Mr Sherman. “Chief investment officers and research directors are asking about value.”Ms Reynolds sees this as a recognition that ESG analysis captures some of the risks faced by companies due to a number of global mega-trends, such as climate change and changing demographics. The impact of these issues are less likely to be captured by traditional financial analysis.“They are no longer seen as political [trends, but] more investing trends. A lot of people see them as limiting, but there are definitely opportunities too. If climate change is happening, investors are asking themselves, ‘How do I get in on the ground floor?’,” she says.It is worth bearing in mind that, if sea levels rise, as predicted by climate change scientists, the ground floor may not be the best place to start.
317;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-07T19:48:53Z;Top shareholders call for MSCI break-up;Company urged to put its stock market indices business on the auction block;"Leading shareholders at MSCI are urging the company to consider breaking itself up and putting its famous stock market indices business on the auction block.The extent of a rift between the company’s management and ValueAct, an activist hedge fund which has taken an 8.3 per cent stake, goes beyond the question of whether ValueAct should be given a board seat, according to people familiar with the situation.MSCI rejected ValueAct’s request for boardroom representation because the fund is encouraging the company to split its indices operations from more recently acquired portfolio management software businesses.People close to the discussions say ValueAct believes the indices business could be attractive to a strategic buyer, since stock exchanges are aggressively pushing into indexing.Earlier this week, Nasdaq paid $225m for Dorsey Wright, a US index provider and analytics group, and last year the London Stock Exchange outbid MSCI for the Russell family of stock indices in a $2.7bn deal.There is more than $9tn benchmarked against MSCI indices globally, the company says.At least one other major shareholder, a London-based value investor called Independent Franchise Partners, shares ValueAct’s belief that the company would be better broken up, according to people familiar with its thinking. Independent Franchise has an 8.6 per cent stake in MSCI.A third leading shareholder is backing ValueAct’s push for board representation, although it has not yet taken a view on whether the company should be broken up.“ValueAct have a good track record of being constructive board members,” the shareholder said. “At MSCI, there are questions on whether a longstanding management is wedded to a strategy that doesn’t make sense, and ValueAct are very thoughtful about the questions they ask.”Both the company and activist ValueAct have credibility; this will be an intriguing fightContinue readingMSCI has already started building up its defences against the break-up calls, hiring public relations specialists and strengthening its team of bankers to include those expert in responding to activist funds.Jeff Ubben, founder of ValueAct, went public earlier this week with a letter criticising MSCI management for failing to properly consider putting a ValueAct representative on the board.In it, he questioned the company’s strategy of tightly integrating portfolio analytics and risk analytics software businesses into the core indexing operations, but did not go further in setting out proposals for structural reform.MSCI, led by chairman and chief executive Henry Fernandez, has been promising to increase investment in the software businesses, and to return $1bn in capital to shareholders by the end of 2016."
318;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-07T17:38:45Z;MSCI: index investing;The tussle with ValueAct will be an intriguing fight;"Underperform an MSCI benchmark, and investors ask questions. When shares of MSCI itself disappoint, it draws similar scrutiny. Understated activist investor ValueAct Capital has sent a letter to the board of MSCI. It has been a shareholder for years. ValueAct wonders about the company’s strategy and poor returns, and is also unhappy about how the company has dismissed earlier entreaties.So the benchmark-setting company finds itself in the middle of big debates about activist investing: the tension between the short- and long-term, and just how accommodative a company should be towards dissidents.MSCI’s core business provides indices, particularly for international equities, that asset managers use to measure their performance. The company says that $9.5tn in assets are benchmarked to MSCI indices. It also sells risk and portfolio management software. On the surface, MSCI appears to be a fine enterprise. Margins (at the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) hover near 40 per cent; nearly all revenue is subscription-based; customer retention rates exceed 90 per cent.But while the indices business is increasing revenue at a double-digit rate, the other businesses are expanding more slowly. And while profit margins remain high, in recent quarters they have fallen by a few percentage points. The company is investing in technology and personnel, which it says will pay off in revenue growth in a year or two.ValueAct is not convinced that the strategy is the right one and asked for a board seat last August — a request that has yet to be accepted. And while the dissident points out that MSCI’s total return lags behind the company’s peers, its shares have nearly doubled since they dropped a quarter in October 2012, when index tracking specialist Vanguard dropped MSCI’s services. MSCI is not a terrible laggard. ValueAct is not asking for much. But that adds up to an intriguing fight.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
319;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2015-01-06T02:58:12Z;ValueAct takes swipe at MSCI as activists flex muscles;Hedge fund attacks company over acquisitions and market share;MSCI, the stock market indexes company, has become an early target for what is expected to be a wave of hedge fund activism in 2015.Jeff Ubben, founder of the San Francisco-based hedge fund ValueAct, on Monday attacked the company for the way it has been integrating acquisitions and a failure to grow its market share. ValueAct is one of MSCI’s largest shareholders, having amassed a stake of 8.3 per cent, but the company refused to accede to the fund’s demand to put a representative on the board.The public scolding is unusual for Mr Ubben, who normally takes a different tack to higher-profile activists such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman and prefers to work behind the scenes to makes changes at his investee companies.Previous successes where ValueAct had a representative on the board include easing the exit of Steve Ballmer from Microsoft and building Valeant Pharmaceuticals into a major acquisition vehicle.Mr Ubben’s letter comes with a graph showing returns from MSCI stock lagging behind peers including McGraw Hill Financial, owner of S&P indexes, and the London Stock Exchange, which owns FTSE, setting the stage for a fight over the direction of the company.ValueAct is focusing its battle on MSCI’s strategy of tightly integrating recent acquisitions, rather than running them as standalone businesses.“We have challenged management on its ‘One MSCI’ strategy of centralising management and in some cases bundling licence contracts across the index, portfolio analytics and risk analytics business lines because we have not seen market share gains in any of the businesses,” the letter says.Mr Ubben says he wrote to MSCI’s lead director, Rodolphe Vallee, as a “last resort” after the board’s nominating committee did not agree to interview potential ValueAct nominees.The way the MSCI board handled our request for a board seat leaves us with serious concerns about the board’s independence from management and alignment with shareholders“The way the MSCI board handled our request for a board seat leaves us with serious concerns about the board’s independence from management and alignment with shareholders,” he wrote.MSCI shares were up 8.5 per cent last year compared to an 11.4 per cent gain for the S&P 500 of leading US stocks. The company has a market capitalisation of $5.3bn.MSCI said on Monday night: “MSCI appreciates and values input from its shareholders, and we regularly interact with them and solicit their feedback. We have had extensive interactions with ValueAct since their initial investment in MSCI over two years ago. The MSCI Board has carefully considered ValueAct’s views regarding the company, including their ideas on director representation.“MSCI has delivered significant value to shareholders, including a total shareholder return of 54 per cent over the past two years and 165 per cent since becoming a public company in November 2007.”Activist hedge funds are flexing their muscles as the annual meeting season approaches in the spring, demanding board representation and threatening to take their case directly to a shareholder vote if they are denied.Activists have outpaced the rest of the hedge fund industry over the past two years and attracted substantial inflows that are allowing them to take larger positions and target larger companies.

In contrast, “Europe underperformed — in part because of a renewed slowdown in the economy, even in Germany, but also because of the failure to deliver significant earnings growth for the fourth year in a row.”The core European countries of Germany and France saw losses equivalent to 9.3 per cent and 9.1 per cent respectively after taking into account dividends and price movements.After the army’s ousting of the country’s first elected leader, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi, its former chief has inherited a divided country

Further readingEuropean countries’ poor equity performances also reflected the dollar’s strength against the euro and sterling. The UK market made a return of minus 5.8 per cent — better than Italy’s minus 8.5 per cent, but not as good as Spain’s minus 3.8 per cent.Greece was the worst performing eurozone country with total returns of minus 39.9 per cent. Portugal was the next worst, with total returns of minus 37.2 per cent.Austrian shares suffered a negative return of 29 per cent, due mainly to the exposure of the country’s banking sector to the Ukraine and other parts of eastern Europe. There was also a return of minus 26.9 per cent to investors in Hungary, which has suffered economic fallout from the Ukrainian conflict.This story was corrected to make it clear that Greece, not Portugal, was the worst performing MSCI index in the eurozone last year."
321;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-12-31T14:00:46Z;Russian equities worst performers of 2014;Tumbling oil prices and Ukraine stand-off make bearish year for Moscow investors;The combination of the oil price collapse and the continuing conflict in Ukraine proved particularly toxic for investors in Russian equities.Russia was by some way the worst-performing country in 2014 among MSCI indices, showing a total return of minus 42.3 per cent, calculated on a dollar basis, which includes dividends and share price movements.By contrast Egypt was the best-performing stock market tracked by MSCI, showing total returns of 31.1 per cent.Reform is not a defining feature of Egypt, where 18 months ago an army coup toppled the democratically elected government of the Muslim Brotherhood and subsequently led to the election as president of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former army chief. But a relief rally after the turmoil of the Arab spring has led to the MSCI index for Egypt almost doubling since the middle of 2013.Hopes for reform boosted Indonesian stocks, which have been among the best performers during the past five years and are again near the top of the table, with a total return of 26.6 per cent.International fund managers are moving into Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, attracted by the potential returns from managing Indonesians’ money. Investors have taken heart from early steps by the new president, Joko Widodo, to address some underlying economic problems.Indonesia has just announced that it will ditch petrol subsidies and link retail prices to international oil markets, in one of the biggest reforms to its energy subsidies in decades.Shares in the Philippines have grown steadily since the victory of the reform-minded administration of President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino in 2010. Its stock market shows total returns of 26.4 per cent.Investors are attracted by a structurally advanced economy, with a service sector that accounts for more than half the economy. A big proportion of that income comes from overseas.India was another top performer, with returns of 22.6 per cent. Investors have been cheered by election successes of the governing Bharatiya Janata party, which they hope will encourage premier Narendra Modi to press on with his reform programme.Military rule has not prevented investors in Thailand receiving 16.8 per cent returns in 2014. The army coup in May in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy was followed by pledges to tackle waste and eliminate corruption, although the junta has scrapped all polls and made only a vague pledge for their return.There are also questions over the appetite for reform of Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The former Turkish premier, who was elected president in August, is keen to stifle dissent in business circles and punish those with links to the moderate Islamist Gulen movement. But this fractious political backdrop has not stopped investors getting total returns of 17.8 per cent from Turkish shares.Given the strength of the US economic recovery and the surge in value of the dollar, it is perhaps surprising that the US ranks only eighth in the MSCI league table, with total return of 14.5 per cent.Exposure to the tumbling price of oil has hit Norwegian shares, returns of which were minus 20.3 per cent.But Greece was the worst-performing MSCI index in the eurozone, showing a minus return of 39.9 per cent. Portugal was the next worst, with a total return of minus 37.2 per cent.Austria is seldom thought of as peripheral in the eurozone, but it too has been a laggard with total returns of minus 29 per cent. Analysts said this reflected the exposure of its banks to Russia and eastern Europe, which have been suffering from uncertainty caused by the Ukrainian conflict.The stand-off between Russia and Europe over Ukraine has also hurt Hungary, where shares have suffered a return of minus 26.9 per cent for 2014. Hungary was one of the countries to express dismay when Russia abandoned South Stream, its $50bn gas pipeline across the Black Sea into Europe.Hungary has alienated investors by taxing advertising revenues and forcing banks to compensate borrowers for what it sees as unfair conditions and charges on lending. However, in October Viktor Orban, prime minister, abandoned a plan for the world’s first internet tax following the largest mass demonstrations in Budapest in recent memory.This story was corrected to make it clear that Greece, not Portugal, was the worst performing MSCI index in the eurozone last year.
322;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-12-19T14:52:55Z;Hello 2015: Russian equities – time to buy?;;"Russian asset prices have taken a severe battering this year and are now ranked as among the cheapest in the world. The obvious question many are now asking is, “is this a good time to buy” or “is there more pain to come” which might lead to even lower prices and valuations in 2015?Apart from the cheap valuations, the reason why investors are asking that question now is because, during Russia’s previous two recent crises, in 1998/’99 and 2008/’09, we had similar situations where the reasons to continue avoiding the country were overwhelming but it was, nevertheless, exactly the right time to buy.In October 1998 the RTS Index hit a low of 38.5 and then rose to a peak of 2,500 in May 2008. In late January 2009 the Index closed at just under 500 but three months later it reached 1,000. Recently the RTS Index reached 700, at which level it was down 50 per cent since the start of the year while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was just about flat.So, is this a third opportunity or is it different this time? There are certainly important differences between this crisis and the other two and that means the recovery in the economy and in asset prices will also be different. One of the more important of those differences is the political uncertainty, specifically whether sanctions against Russian banks will remain past 2015 or start to ease in mid year when the EU sanctions are due for review. That will depend on what happens in eastern Ukraine and on the Kremlin’s willingness to compromise and strike an acceptable deal. Clearly the situation remains dangerous and, if there is an escalation in the region, then the risk premium on Russian assets will rise further.The second known unknown is the oil price. Urals crude has collapsed by almost 50 per cent this year and that has hit sentiment towards Russia risk. The damage to the country’s balance sheet has actually been slight because the rouble has collapsed faster than the oil price and more than compensated federal budget revenues in rouble terms. For now, sentiment towards equities and the ruble is greatly influenced by the oil price and if that continues to trend lower then we will see a lower equity market and further rouble weakness. So making a call on Russia, even at these levels, is also an implied bet on the oil price and, specifically, on OPEC’s ability to reach an internal consensus on production cuts.The third factor is the economy. Russia managed to avoid a contraction in GDP this year because the weaker rouble protected budget spending and also created a soft stimulus for the domestic manufacturing sector as consumers switched to cheaper local products. This will not be the case in 2015. The economy is now on a downward path and the recent action by the central bank to raise its benchmark key rate to 17 per cent will certainly hurt both the consumer sectors and, particularly, the small and medium sized companies. Debt service costs have risen sharply, as has the pace of inflation which may now reach 13-15 per cent in the 2nd quarter due to the rouble collapse, while nominal wage growth is falling. Russian people face a miserable six months, at minimum, and that will mean substantial earnings revisions across many sectors of the market.And that’s the nub of the problem right there: valuations are very cheap right now but the key question is “how cheap will they still be” when the extent of the decline in the economy is fully factored into earnings expectations for 2015 and 2016. That really is a big unknown and keeps the speculative element high even after such large price falls this year.But while acknowledging that this crisis has some serious negatives and uncertainties which were not part of the previous two crises, there are also some positive differences. The rouble is behaving as if the country was back in 1998 but that really is a world away in terms of risk. In 1998 Russia was a bankrupt, leaderless country that had just defaulted on some debt obligations. Today Russia has a triple surplus economy. The budget will end this year with a surplus thanks to the weak rouble; the trade balance will be close to $180bn largely due to the collapse in imports; and the current account surplus is double that of last year despite the big spike in capital flight. Available cash reserves are close to $350bn, despite the fact that central bank used almost $100bn this year in a futile effort to stem inflation and protect the rouble, and sovereign external debt is only at 3.5 per cent of GDP. Total external debt is at 35 per cent of GDP and while repayment obligations will total about $100bn in 2015, assuming no relief on sanctions and no money from China, that is well covered with available reserves.This time around investors have a mixture of factors to weigh up. Equity valuations are very cheap but will get much less cheap as earnings expectations are inevitably slashed in the coming months. The country’s balance sheet is in very good shape today but clearly could deteriorate over the coming year depending on what happens to the rouble, sanctions and oil. The rouble is now falling due to a collapse in confidence as much as to the weaker oil price. Investors tempted to buy the rouble after this year’s 100 per cent fall against the US dollar need to ask themselves if they have enough confidence in the Russian central bank and in the OPEC countries to pursue the right strategies in early 2015? On top of that is the unpredictable geo-politics.Those jumping into the market right now are playing on the very edge of risk tolerance. For the majority of investors the prudent course is to differentiate between sectors and individual stocks that are less vulnerable to rising interest rates, to the expected much slower consumer activity and to the weaker rouble. There are many in that category which have also seen their valuations pulled lower in 2014. Picking those stocks rather than investing in a Russia ETF or buying the Index makes much more sense and will be much more profitable over the longer term when Russia inevitably recovers. It always does. Only this time we will be waiting longer.Chris Weafer is a partner at Macro-Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.This is the eighth in a series of guest posts on the outlook for emerging markets in 2015.Back to beyondbrics"
323;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-12-18T17:26:53Z;Emerging markets: view to a killing;Spectre could find financial succour in India, Mexico or Taiwan;"Next year, James Bond will confront Spectre in the 24th film of the 007 series. Bond will surely have an easier battle against his old foes this time round, however. The markets have not been kind this year to the sort of investments that would appeal to any self-respecting shadowy organisation bent on world domination. Macau casinos; Russian or Latin American oil equities; gold; and (of course) hedge funds: these have all struggled in 2014.What is the Spectre employee retirement fund to do? First, note that pain in many of these assets reflected a stronger US dollar and weaker crude oil prices. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down by 17 per cent since its peak this year in early September, so the pain is also generalised. It will not get better if (as Janet Yellen suggested on Wednesday) the Federal Reserve may be ready to raise rates by the middle of 2015.One option is simply to reallocate assets to markets that are relatively impervious to US rate moves, or are special situations. India has been one such market this year. The election of Narendra Modi’s reformist government helped send the Sensex upwards by nearly a third over 2014. The actual reforms (such as state-owned company divestments) will take longer though. Coal India, one potential beneficiary, trades at between 14 and 15 times next year’s forecast earnings. There is, perhaps, plenty of political alpha yet to be captured here.The problem is that this alone may not be enough to pay the food bills for purring white cats, or volcano base running costs. Thus if you can’t beat the enemy, the other option is to join it. Car and electronics exporters in South Korea and Taiwan are natural beneficiaries of a revived US consumer. Mexico’s economy is geared to its neighbour, even though investors pay up for the privilege: Grupo Bimbo, a bakery group, is on a forward P/E ratio of 22. The rule of thumb is to identify companies that can find top-line growth in the US, in case 2015 is another bad year for emerging market equities. “East! West! Just points on a compass!,” as a Spectre operative once said of its outlook. Well, that’s the spirit.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
324;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-12-05T06:22:43Z;China’s bourses: tear it up;Stock markets experience a huge pick up in activity;"Forget the doomsayers’ warnings over the parlous state of China’s economy: the country’s stock markets are on a tear. In the year to date, the main bourses have managed a total return of two-fifths. Notwithstanding the multiple record high closes for the S&P 500, the MSCI World Index has eked out a paltry 7 per cent over that time. Only Argentina has delivered a meaningfully higher return than China — up about four-fifths this year — but in US dollar terms it is still behind.The drivers behind improving sentiment in Chinese markets have been more symbolic than fundamental. Mid-month, the long awaited Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme was launched. The same week, the People’s Bank of China announced an interest-rate cut. But after the flurry of the first few days, the Stock Connect take up was limited and the rate cuts amounted more to guidance than directives. And yet Shanghai’s stock market turnover has surged. In the entire month of November, the market traded nearly $800bn; in the first five days of December, the value traded has reached nearly $400bn.Longer term, there are bullish signs. Economists expect further cuts in interest rates and, more significantly, a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks — a measure that directly increases money supply. Against this backdrop, the capitalisation of China’s equity markets last week overtook Japan’s to rank second only to the US, according to Bloomberg data.And in spite of the rally, Shanghai still looks cheap. The index trades on just over 10 times 2015 earnings, which are expected to grow at 12 per cent. Japan costs 14 times for the same level of growth. And compare this with the S&P 500, trading at 16 times for a mere 8 per cent lift on earnings. Once the froth has blown off, China may have further to run.Hong Kong looks even better. On 7 times earnings its China Enterprise Index is one of the few indices worldwide on single-digit earnings multiples for 2015.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
325;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-27T14:30:26Z;Philippines: think outside the boxer;Philippine shares don’t look cheap, but there is lots of room for growth;The Philippines has a population of 100m, but may be best known abroad as the home of a big shoe collection and a great boxer. The world is missing out. From 2009 lows, the country’s stock market has quintupled, more than doubling the MSCI world index.Since the victory of the reform-minded Aquino administration in 2010, average annual gross domestic product growth has been nearly 6 per cent. Thursday’s third-quarter report delivered only 5.3 per cent, well below the expected 6.5 per cent, on lower government spending. Below-trend growth may not be priced into shares. Companies in the benchmark index are expected to deliver 15 per cent earnings growth and trade at 18 times earnings. Indonesia offers similar growth for 15 times, Thailand for 14.Can growth rebound – and stocks continue to run? There would appear to be room. GDP, at $270bn, trails Malaysia (population just 30m) by more than one-10th, and it is less than one-third that of Indonesia (population 250m). GDP per capita last year was $2765, according to World Bank figures, 5 per cent of the Singapore figure. Despite its size, the economy looks structurally advanced. One-10th of it is agricultural, one-third industrial and the balance – more than half – is services. Within services, a big slice of the income is derived from overseas. Call centres account for nearly 6 per cent of GDP, Bloomberg and Philippines industry figures show. Remittances – funds sent home by Philippine workers abroad – were a 10th of GDP last year.The benefits of growth are not widely spread. Of the Philippines’ top 10 listed companies, nine – such as SM Investments (retail), Universal Robina (a food conglomerate) and Bank of the Philippine Islands – are controlled by five families. This may not stifle growth. South Korea logged decades of expansion despite the chaebol. Still, it leaves investors with a limited set of options, and the bigger companies do not look like bargains on standard metrics. But if reform keeps up past the next election, in 2016 they might be.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
326;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-26T13:17:53Z;Romania stock exchange sets sights on EM status;;"The Bucharest Stock Exchange is the largest bourse in post-communist south-east Europe and for spells in the past decade has been ranked as one of the world’s best-performing.Now the exchange and its new largest shareholder have set their sights on becoming a financial hub for the region, eyeing MSCI emerging-market status within three years, substantial increases in capitalisation, and greater participation by foreign investors and pension funds.On November 19, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it had acquired a 4.99 per cent stake in the exchange, known as the BVB, for an undisclosed sum.Noel Edison, the EBRD’s director for insurance and financial services, told beyondbrics the transaction would help the exchange achieve MSCI EM rating, which is judged on both quantitative and qualitative measures, and would open the market to a wider range of investors. In an email exchange, Edison said he expected Romania’s privatisation programme to continue through the bourse, raising liquidity and following several successful initial public offerings by state-owned companies. He added:Criteria for emerging-market status set out by MSCI include, among other things: firstly, a minimum of three relatively big companies; secondly, a high degree of openness to foreign ownership; and thirdly, ease of capital inflows and outflows. The BVB is expected to achieve compliance with all the requirements in 2016.One of the most promising companies being lined up for an IPO on the exchange is Hidroelectrica, as its name suggests a hydroelectric operator. On November 12, it said it expected profits to reach a record 1.1bn lei ($310m) this year. The company is undergoing a restructuring programme and is expected to exit insolvency next year.Edison again:To-date there has been significant progress made in implementing the Government’s privatisation programme based on the current agreement with the IMF under which there have been some of the largest IPOs of state owned companies, including Electrica in 2014 (€444m), and Romgaz (€380m) and Nuclearelectrica (€63m), both in 2013.These transactions have positively impacted market capitalisation and liquidity, and are expected to be followed with the planned IPO of a number of other state owned companies, the largest of which may be Hidroelectrica. With the IPO process improved, we hope to see more listings in the years to come and we will be looking into ways to support them.Lucian Albulescu, equity analyst at Wood & Co, a regional investment bank, said Hidroelectrica would probably be listed in 2016. Another leading candidate for an IPO was CE Oltenia, an electricity generating company, he added, while the government may look to sell further stakes in part-privatised companies already on the exchange.More offers may come from Fondul Proprietatea, a fund set up to compensate those who lost property under communism, which is itself listed on the BVB, and potentially from closed-end funds selling their stakes on the open market.“Fondul’s administrator Franklin Templeton is very active in lobbying with the government to restructure more companies from the fund’s portfolio and list them,” says Albulescu.Last month, Wood & Co wrote in a note that Romania was still some way from achieving the criteria for MSCI EM status.Only one listed stock, of gas company Romgaz, meets all the requirements to be classified as “relatively big”, to use Edison’s term. Two more are needed, though a number of other companies are close: OMV subsidiary Petrom (an oil and gas company); Banca Transilvania and Société Générale subsidiary BRD (both banks); and Electrica, the country’s leading power distributor.Electrica’s IPO in June was the biggest in Romanian history, raising 1.95bn lei on the BVB and the London Stock Exchange.However, most of these companies are either state listings or were owned by the state before being bought by foreign investors and listed. There are fewer IPOs of big private companies. Attracting more will be important in boosting liquidity. RCS & RDS, one of the region’s biggest cable and telecommunications operators, is thought to be one private company considering listing.Achieving emerging market status will also require qualitative changes to improve investor access to the exchange. Edison said the EBRD would help the bourse lower transaction costs and establish a central clearing counterparty (CCP). Currently some Romanian companies list in Luxembourg rather than Bucharest; lower costs would encourage both local listings and greater foreign participation.The CCP could be of “systematic importance for the capital markets by facilitating better risk management and leading to less complex exposures between market participants through the netting process,” according to Edison.A law is in the works that would improve investor access, address transparency issues and enhance dividend distribution. It would also raise the holding limit in the BVB from 4.99 per cent to 20 per cent, which could streamline management decision-making.After the EBRD deal, Ludwik Sobolewski, the stock exchange’s CEO, said he wanted the BVB “to become the financial hub for southern and eastern Europe, a new centre for business and innovation, and thus to enrich the investment landscape of the region.”Given the puzzling lack of interest that businesses in the western Balkans show in Romania – the region’s largest market – becoming a true centre for the region may involve a new approach to marketing as well.But the BVB is headed by a former CEO of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which has become the largest bourse in Central Europe, overtaking Vienna, so there is a track record of success.“We are hoping to follow the Polish model in Romania with second pillar pension funds growing fast, state privatizing via the stock exchange and encouraging the overall development of the financial market,” says Albulescu.Back to beyondbrics"
327;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-20T12:22:54Z;How to play Putin: fund managers disagree;;"A fascinating note has arrived in our inbox from Steven Holden of Copley Fund Research, which tracks the investments of 100 big global EM equity funds with about $285bn of assets under management.Readers may remember a recent piece based on his monthly report in October, showing that big fund managers were predominantly underweight in China compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets index, and overweight in India. An analysis of data from his November report shows that, on average, managers are in line with the MSCI regarding Russia – but that, individually, they diverge greatly from the index, in ways that suggest contrasting views on the crisis in Ukraine and how to play it as an investor.Here’s his chart:It shows that there is almost no difference between the MSCI weighting and the average weightings of his universe. But very few of his managers are in line with the MSCI: almost half are overweight and almost half are underweight.Here’s what Holden makes of that:The managers with the highest Russian allocations, including GMO, Lazard and USAA share common holdings in the traditional Russian bellwethers of Sberbank, Lukoil and Gazprom, whilst those with the lowest allocations, if holding anything at all have tended towards internet stocks Yandex and Mail.ru. This appears to imply that the higher weighted funds are those who favour a top down approach by investing in the largest index constituents rather than trying to capture the performance of individual companies.Managers, then, are split between those who think that, at a macro level, Russia is due for a comeback within their investment horizon; and those who think that Russia is largely in trouble but that if you pick your stocks carefully on a value basis, there is still upside to be had.Here’s his table of the biggest overweight and underweight funds in Russia:Holden also looks at how investors have repositioned in Russia since the onset of the crisis in Ukraine. Managers such as Mark Mobius at Templeton and Justin Leverenz at Oppenheimer, he notes, have seen the crisis as an opportunity to pick up high-quality companies at bargain prices:For Mr Leverenz, that means Yandex, Magnit and Novatek and for Mr Mobius, Yandex, Gazprom and Mail.ru.But he adds:Yet for other managers those same stocks have been used to reduce exposure to Russia with the EM funds of Pictet, Schroders and Skagen having all decreased holdings in Gazprom as a means to lighten overall exposure to Russia.Here is his table of the biggest changes made by fund managers between mid March and mid October:He notes:In total, 37% of funds increased Russia positions over the period and 59% decreased, figures borne out by the price action but hardly ones that suggest a mass exodus. Those funds doing the buying are clearly banking on a resolution to the conflict and a return to more normalised valuations, but the longer the conflict draws on the increased likelihood that more EM funds will place their overweight bets on more stable countries and regions, a scenario which will only put further downward pressure on prices.The total holdings of Copley’s 100 funds in Russia amount to about $14bn, compared with about $38bn in China, $34bn in India and $30bn in Brazil. Russia is already a lot smaller in this universe than its Bric peers and has a similar weighting to Taiwan, South Africa and Mexico. Holden comments:As we have seen with China, EM funds are not averse to running significant and long standing country underweight positions, so until we see visible progress towards a resolution we would expect more funds to scale back their Russian allocations. Those looking to profiteer from low prices and trough valuations may have to endure stormier times before they get their day in the sun.Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

328;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-18T18:12:21Z;IPD launches infrastructure index;Founders say index will measure return performance against other competing asset classes;"An index to track the performance of investments in infrastructure, irrespective of the investment vehicle structure, has been launched by IPD, a subsidiary of MSCI that provides real estate benchmarking.The IPD Global Infrastructure Direct Asset Index includes 132 investments around the globe with an enterprise value of $49bn.Its founders claim the index represents a significant milestone for the infrastructure sector as it provides a robust measure of return performance that can be compared with competing asset classes and used to benchmark performance across investments.“Infrastructure has long since been a favoured asset class for many Australian and Canadian investors, and there is a broadening of interest from many other investors globally,” said Peter Hobbs, managing director and head of IPD Research.“A critical requirement for these investors is objective data and insight into the performance and risk of the asset class, and the index represents a major step in the right direction.”The geographical profile of the index has large investment exposures in Australia (44 per cent) and Continental Europe/UK (43 per cent) with smaller exposure in North America (8 per cent).The current sector exposure of the index is focused on the transport sector, which has a 47 per cent share; power has 24 per cent; and water, 22 per cent.The index’s returns are calculated in local currency to remove exchange rate effects. Results show that investment in a pool of underlying infrastructure investments delivered an annualised return of 14.7 per cent, as at June 2014, which IPD said compared favourably with the average annualised return over the past five years of 13.4 per cent.Annual return performance across sector streams also differed. As at June 2014, annual total return for global transport stood at 16.8 per cent while return for power stood at 18.3 per cent.Return performance also differed across investment style. Over the past five years to June, low risk investments delivered an annualised return of 14 per cent; moderate risk investments delivered 13.9 per cent; and high risk investment 5.2 per cent.Anthony De Francesco, executive director and head of IPD Infrastructure Products said the index was “a significant information tool for the infrastructure asset class as it will aid the sector in the areas of investment market cycles and trends, asset pricing, benchmarking analysis, attribution analysis and risk modelling”.He said: “The index is deemed important as its release coincides with a period of increased demand for investment return transparency from the global investment community as global asset owners are seeking to increase asset allocation to infrastructure.”"
329;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-16T05:28:12Z;Record growth sees new alliances;Banks offload data services as independent providers undergo consolidation;One of the crown jewels of the indexing industry is up for sale. This is the latest of a series of strategic deals bringing change of ownership for some of the most important benchmarks in global financial markets.Barclays is considering the sale of its Index, Portfolio and Risk Solutions (IPRS) unit, which provides benchmarks for billions of dollars of assets in derivatives, structured products, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.Barclays is also the world’s leading provider of fixed income indices, and the sale of IPRS is expected to raise up to $500m. Two contenders – S&P Dow Jones Indices and Markit – have emerged as the favourites to acquire IPRS.Buying Barclays’ indexing business would help S&P Dow Jones Indices extend its reach into bond markets, building on its already considerable presence as a provider of equity and commodity benchmarks.Markit is arguably best known as a provider of benchmarks used in derivative contracts such as credit default swaps, but it also provides cash bond indices for which the Barclays indexing business would appear to be a natural fit.Index providers collect fees based on assets under management tied to their benchmarks. Record inflows in 2014 into fixed income exchange traded funds (ETFs) provide an illustration of the strategic importance of IPRS to a potential buyer.Vanguard’s Total Bond Market ETF has pulled in $5.8bn so far this year, while the BlackRock iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF has garnered $5.4bn. Both these ETFs track Barclays’ indices.However, inflows into those two ETFs are just part of a much broader shift into index-linked investments. Assets held in index tracking funds and mandates are forecast to reach $22.7tn by 2020, up from $7.3tn in 2012, according to a projection from the consultancy PwC.Asset growth on such an enormous scale is one of the key drivers behind the new alliances being forged between index providers and stock exchange operators, as the fortunes of these two sectors become ever more intertwined.Earlier this year, the London Stock Exchange Group bought Russell Investments, index compiler and asset manager, for $2.7bn from US insurer Northwestern Mutual.The LSE will combine Russell’s indexing business, which has $5.2tn of benchmarked assets, with its existing FTSE International operations, with $4tn of assets.The deal, which is the LSE’s biggest to date, will significantly increase the exchange’s presence in the US, where Russell’s equity indices are widely used in tracker funds and as benchmarks.In October 2012, Nasdaq OMX bought the margent family of dividend indices. As well as expanding its indexing operations, the deal should allow Nasdaq to offer a fuller range of services beyond trading and listings, areas where exchange operators’ revenues have been under pressure.In 2011, the exchange operator CME Group and McGraw Hill, the owner of S&P Indices, united their indexing businesses in a joint venture. The deal brought together under one roof the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index, the two most widely followed US equity benchmarks.More deals seem likely as other banks exit from their indexing businesses amid pressure from regulators who would prefer to see indices supplied by independent providers that do not sell financial products based on their proprietary benchmarks.In April, Bloomberg – which is building a presence in the indexing industry – acquired a family of Australian bond indices from UBS, and also assumed responsibility for the governance, calculation, distribution and licensing of the UBS commodity indices.But critics question whether end users are seeing real benefits from consolidation in the indexing industry, arguing that it is stifling competition and hindering innovation.In response, Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, says consolidation in the indexing industry has brought “a lot of benefits” to end users.“Unifying the indexing operations of S&P and Dow Jones as a single provider has helped us develop new indices and to be more efficient in providing services to clients,” he says.But Christos Costandinides, a long-time industry analyst now working as an independent consultant, says that consolidation is giving more power to fewer players.He notes that end users are increasingly questioning the fees they have to pay, illustrated by Vanguard’s decision in 2012 to switch from using MSCI benchmarks to cheaper FTSE and CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) indices.“There is growing discussion as to what the level of compensation should be for using an index and how much an index provider’s proprietary intellectual property is worth, especially for equity indices where a lot of the information is already available for free,” says Mr Costandinides.He believes there is broad consensus among investors supporting the need for reform, while adding that it is unclear which steps will best improve transparency and competitiveness.The large index providers that are attached to exchange operators and data providers will continue to be able to defend their current levels of fees and charges unless more is done to make the provision of data used in benchmarks more competitive, says Mr Costandinides.This is even more true for fixed income indices as the asset class trades over-the-counter, and therefore pricing information availability can be more limited.“A handful of players that often have exclusivity in access to certain asset prices gives disproportionate power to certain index providers, and makes it very difficult for anybody else to enter the space,” he says.But Mr Matturri of S&P Dow Jones Indices rejects this argument. “We have extensive relationships with exchange operators. But that does not preclude exchange operators from selling data to our competitors, such as MSCI and FTSE,” he says.
330;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-16T05:28:12Z;Smart beta comes into its own after smart marketing;Aim is to provide a cross between passive and active approach;"Smart beta has been one of the most heavily marketed investment strategies in recent years with an explosion in the number of available products. The appeal of these alternative indices is they offer investors a halfway house between classic passive and active funds.Marketing along these lines has paid off. These products, which use a systematic, rules-based approach that tilts a portfolio towards a particular investment factor, are clearly in vogue.MSCI’s smart beta indices have attracted assets of more than $100bn, with half coming Europe, according to Deborah Yang, head of the index business in Emea and South Asia at MSCI.Although that is still a drop in the ocean compared with the $9.5tn following MSCI’s total indices, Ms Yang adds that the assets allocated to the category are growing fast – with a high rate of adoption by new institutional mandates.The success of smart beta products is not confined to index providers – it has bled into the exchange-traded product universe. By November, there were more than 5,300 exchange-trade products and around 896 equity smart beta products.This proliferation in the number of equity smart beta products is testament to their popularity as it has only become recently available in the form of an exchange-traded product (ETP).Ursula Marchioni, head of iShares Emea equity strategy & ETP research at iShares says: “While global smart beta ETPs make up 16.5 per cent of the total assets under management of equity ETPs, nearly 30 per cent of year-to-date new equity inflows have been into smart beta products, as of end of October.”Yet only a small number of products have strong asset inflow.“While there are hundreds of products available, new mandates have been concentrated into a relatively small number of strategies,” says John Belgrove, senior partner at consultancy Aon Hewitt.There are two particular product areas that are attracting most of the asset inflows from UK pension schemes. Most of these mandates are either for more fundamentally-based products, which are more value and small-cap oriented, or for low volatility, says Mr Belgrove.Fundamental smart beta strategies are popular with investors because they are familiar with both value-oriented funds and the small-cap premium; active managers have been running these types of investment strategies for decades.And both these strategies have been shown to deliver higher returns than the market over the long-term.While there is a large variety of fundamental indices available, Research Affiliates’ RAFI indices have proved the most popular, says Mr Belgrove.Phil True, head of equity fund manager research at Aon Hewitt, says: “This index is a combination of four different factors that offers the advantage of being a cheap and transparent way of capturing the value and size premium.” RAFI has also heavily marketed its products, he adds.Low volatility strategies are appealing as they offer investors a way to reduce the risk of investing in equities – high on institutional investors’ agenda since the financial crisis.Mr Belgrove says: “Following a good run in equity markets in recent years, many schemes are looking at ways of further reducing the risks in their growth portfolios.Low volatility strategies allow them to stay in equities but with a 20 per cent to 30 per cent reduction in risk.”The dominant low volatility index provider is MSCI, says Mr True. It launched its World Minimum Volatility Index in April 2008, just before the financial crisis wreaked its worst on the value of equity portfolios.While RAFI’s and MSCI’s alternative indices are among the most popular to track, to follow these strategies investors need a product provider to produce the investment funds.The largest providers of alternative strategies in the UK are Legal & General, BlackRock, State Street and Invesco, says Robert Holford, senior consultant at Spence Johnson.Although fundamental and low volatility strategies are popular among UK pension schemes, different strategies are successful in other parts of the market. Mr Holford says: “More complex, risk-focused quant-type strategies have been popular with the UK retail investor but not institutional investors.” In Europe, risk-focused products are more popular among Dutch and French pension funds while fundamental products are favoured by Nordic institutions, he adds.As expected, it is institutional investors who are using these products in the most sophisticated way. Rather than simply choosing one strategy, they are now using multiple strategies to sit alongside a market-cap weighted index to form the equity allocation of a pension scheme’s portfolio.Ana Paula Harris, portfolio strategist for global equity beta solutions at State Street Global Advisors, says: “As investors become familiar with these products and realise they perform differently in particular market conditions, they are starting to combine strategies to provide diversification and smoother returns.”Indeed, a survey published in May by Russell Investments, one of the largest providers of smart-beta strategies, of 131 US and European asset owners found that three-quarters of respondents not currently using smart beta strategies said they were considering making allocations."
331;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-16T05:28:01Z;Low carbon becomes a high priority;Investors have a range of tools to gain exposure to environmental change;There has long been a certain class of investor that has paid close attention to the risks posed to their investments by climate change but they have been very much in the minority and have had few tools to help them.Help is now at hand. MSCI, the index provider, has launched a range of low-carbon indices, and other providers such as Standard & Poor’s are reporting increased interest in more established low-carbon products. Companies such as Amundi are creating investment products based on the indices.This is a sign of things to come, says Jane Goodland, co-head of sustainable investment at Towers Watson. “Investors have been looking for some time for ways to express their views around climate change risks. Low-carbon indices provide investors with an efficient, low-cost and transparent way of doing so.”One of the most emphatic signs of this came at the UN climate summit in New York in September, where investors representing more than $24tn in assets released a statement saying that “stronger political leadership and more ambitious policies are needed in order for us to scale up our investments”.The signatories, who included some of the world’s biggest investors including BlackRock, Calpers, Calstrs, PGGM and Allianz, added that they would play their part and “identify and evaluate low carbon investment opportunities …consider investment vehicles that invest in low carbon assets …and develop our capacity to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and climate policy to our investment portfolios, and integrate, where appropriate, this information into our investment decisions.”These are not niche players, says Remy Briand, global head of index and ESG research at MSCI. “You can see that investors are getting serious about climate change and its impact on future capital flows.”Indices will be crucial to this effort. For a long while, ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors did not have a benchmark, says Alka Banerjee, managing director of Global Equities at Standard & Poor’s, which launched a carbon-efficient US index as far back as 2009. “They hoped for higher returns but there was no guarantee that they would not lose money by making climate-friendly investments.”S&P was ahead of its time in launching the index, Ms Banerjee says, because there was at the time still a lot of scepticism about climate change, which was not helped by the disastrous Copenhagen climate conference at the end of that the index’s launch year. “Now there is no controversy about climate change and people realise we have to do something about it.”MSCI, too, was discussing low-carbon indices six years ago, says Mr Briand. What has changed, he says, is that “people recognise that the problem is a bit more immediate than they initially thought and the debate has focused a lot more on the idea of stranded assets such as coal or other fossil fuel reserves, or power stations owned by utilities. If these assets cannot be fully used, they will have to be written off, which we have seen happening in Europe with companies such as Eon and GDF Suez. These write-offs are happening now, not in 10 years’ time.”The other reason for growing interest is that there have been advances in the indexing world, he says. “We have solutions that are more sophisticated. Innovation in creating factor indices has grown and we understand much more how to create indices that create a tilt towards the desired factor – in this case low carbon intensity – but manage other dimensions such as tracking error. Asset owners already have factor allocation to minimise issues such as volatility so there is a greater level of comfort.”There are a number of variants of the low-carbon investing approach, from total exclusion of fossil fuels at one end to under- and overweighting of indices at the other, says Ms Goodland. “I am pleasantly surprised by the fact that there is a range of approaches to choose from. Investors have different needs, so we need all these different products.”One of the benefits of indices is that they can be set up to provide market-like returns. “This means investors are getting market-like returns now but over the longer term, as climate policies start having a real impact, these indices are well-placed to provide outperformance relative to the benchmark. It’s good for investors because they don’t have to take much risk,” says Ms Goodland.“Some investors are very much about divesting from fossil fuels while others want to build a portfolio that reflects the risks of increasing regulation of emissions. For some investors, it’s about making more money while some want to protect themselves from downside risks. However, many investors who start in the risk space quickly see there an upside potential.”This is important, says Matthew Fitzmaurice, chief executive at EcoAlpha, because “to achieve the intended aims of low carbon indexing – using capital to combat climate change – the necessary action involves more than simply denying money to companies that are part of the problem. It requires allocating investment dollars to companies that are providing a solution.“Compared with investing in solutions, low carbon indexing is a less effective tool to combat a very real problem. Threats such as climate change require action, not just reaction. Investors looking to move the needle on carbon are realising that to maximise impact, they must direct the power of their capital not just away from fossil fuels, but also towards the solutions.”
332;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
333;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The promise offered by last great frontier;Absence from global rankings centres on ease of access for investors;China is one of the world’s largest economies and its equity market, combining listings in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, is second only in value to the US. Yet the country remains notably absent from global indices.China makes up only about three per cent of the MSCI AC World Index, for example, despite having the world’s second-largest economy. “China is the last great frontier. It is an incredibly large, diverse market and it will be important and impactful when it begins to be added to global benchmarks,” says Mat Lystra, director of international indexes methodology at Russell Indexes.But a greater presence for China in indices is far from simple. This year, both FTSE and MSCI ruled out including A-shares, stocks incorporated in mainland China and denominated in renminbi.Although the A-shares market is both “large and important”, investors have big concerns about its potential inclusion, says Chin-Ping Chia, head of Asia-Pacific research at MSCI.Chief among these is access to Chinese securities. Hong Kong offers a way in to offshore stocks, but foreign firms currently have to invest in A-shares and Chinese corporate bonds through quota-based systems known as QFII and RQFII.The number of QFII and RQFII licences granted to foreign investors has risen sharply in recent years, jumping by 33 per cent in the year to February 2014 alone, according to FTSE. However, fund firms applying for licences still face tough restrictions, including a minimum level of assets under management.The current restrictions and the quota-based system mean many asset managers are unable to access the market, says Mr Chia. “The quota is restricted. Some investors are not allocated quotas or do not get sufficient quotas, so they do not have a meaningful exposure,” he says.“If you were to put a significant portion of A-shares into the index, the asset manager would not be able to replicate the position in many cases.”Eddie Pong, director of research analysis at FTSE, says: “If you cannot access [the Chinese market], it doesn’t matter how big it is.”As well as obstacles such as these, Mr Chia says MSCI has concerns around capital mobility rules, including a requirement to invest within six months of being granted a quota.The new Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect programme, which allows investors to buy some A-shares via Hong Kong, will address some of the access issues. However, Mr Chia says the scheme is “not perfect”, especially as investors will still not be able to acquire stocks on the Shenzhen exchange.Index providers also bemoan the settlement process in China, which currently differs from conventional standards, and the lack of clarity around capital gains tax.Yet, despite the difficulties, the day when Chinese stocks appear on global indices is edging closer, says Mr Chia. “It is only a matter of time before China A-shares are included.”Mr Pong agrees: “The timeframe we are talking about is probably five years.”With this in mind, index providers are now grappling with the weighting they should give to Chinese securities in benchmarks.Shan Lan, head of global equity index change and ETF research at Deutsche Bank, says: “It will be very difficult if not completely impossible for fund managers to replicate the indices, given the constraints that currently exist in accessing China’s domestic equity markets. However, we support the idea of an inclusion starting with a small weight.”This is already happening on the fixed income side, says Sui Chung, managing director of Euromoney Indices. The HSBC Asian Local Bond Index, for example, includes onshore RMB dominated bonds, but not at the Chinese market’s full weighing.Mr Chung says: “From an index construction point of view, you want the index to represent as accurately as possible any given market.”This means that for China’s very large market to be represented accurately, “you should include lots of Chinese bonds. But to balance that, you have to have an eye on accessibility. Yes, it is very large, but can investors actually access it?”On the equities side, Mr Lystra at Russell Indexes says providers are likely to start off with China A-shares accounting for about 10 per cent of an index, with this rising gradually. Earlier this year, FTSE launched its global RQFII and QFII index series.Other index providers are likely to offer similar products, as well as providing customised benchmarks for asset managers that already have access to the A-shares market.These benchmarks will help investors to prepare for the future possible inclusion of China in global indices, an event Mr Lystra says will be similar to including “another USA”.
334;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Index launched for green bond growth;Barclays and MSCI create new market measure;A new green bond index family, measuring the global market of fixed income securities issued to fund projects with direct environmental benefits, has been launched by Barclays and MSCI.Some $30bn-$40bn of green bonds will be issued this year, increasing to about $100bn next year, according to Climate Bonds Initiative, a not-for profit organisation that seeks to mobilise the debt capital markets for climate change.Barclays said that in just three years the labelled “green” market had gone from modest issuance by a handful of development bank and supranational issuers to a thriving new asset class with an increasingly diverse investor base, including dedicated “green” investors and other broad-based investors who considered these new bonds part of their expanding investment choice set.“The green bond market has grown enormously in recent years,” said Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds Initiative.“The availability of market standard indices is important in establishing clear, broadly accepted guidelines for the new issuers rapidly entering the market. The stature of Barclays and MSCI will help to bring attention to green bonds.”Barclays said in September that it would invest more than £1bn into investment grade green bonds by November 2015, while Swiss insurer Zurich Insurance has pledged to invest up to $2bn.At the recent UN climate summit, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said governments, banks and businesses had committed to finding $200bn to finance low carbon and climate-resilient development.Eligibility for the new index family is based on an independent and objective assessment of securities along four dimensions closely tracked by green bond investors: use of proceeds, project evaluation, management of proceeds and reporting.To be classified as a green bond by the new index, a security’s use of proceeds must first fall within at least one of five eligible environmental categories: alternative energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water, and green building.General purpose bonds are eligible if 90 per cent of the issuer’s revenues fall within one or more of the eligible MSCI environmental categories.Brian Upbin, head of benchmark index research at Barclays, said: “The Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index family should prove to be an extremely useful tool for issuers and institutional investors, and its introduction marks an important step in the evolution, transparency, and standardisation of the green bond market.”
335;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Index moves stoke risk of real estate bubble;Money will move on back of classification changes;Indexers hold great power. As detailed often in this column, the world’s “active” fund managers take all their cues from the compilers of benchmarks. Indices frame their decisions and therefore in effect guide capital.That means that when the world’s two biggest index providers, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indexes, decide to change their index classifications for the first time in decades, money will move on the back of it. And that means everyone – as again detailed before in this column – should look at real estate.This week the two big indexers announced a change to the Global Industry Classification System, formally introduced in 1999, which divides all companies across the world into 10 industries. The system is almost universally used, and has been found by academics to do a great job of explaining differences in performance between stocks. It frames perception of the world’s stocks. But those 10 industries are going to become 11.Real estate, the indexers announced, has become its own asset class. The growth in real estate investment trusts (Reits) has created far more quoted equity vehicles for holding real estate. And so real estate will split from financial services to form its own GICS sector, worth 2.5 per cent of the total value of the S&P.Exchange traded funds will inevitably follow, while the mere use of the classification will force active managers who use MSCI or S&P benchmarks to think more carefully about real estate. This change, almost inevitably, will mean more interest, more buying and hence at first improved performance for real estate. The 11th sector will not come into force until 2016, so there is plenty of time to get ready for it.They were almost certainly right to do this. MSCI and S&P said feedback from investors had “confirmed that real estate is now viewed as a distinct asset class and is increasingly being incorporated separately into strategic asset allocation”. Investors also told the indexers there were significant differences between public real estate and financial companies: real estate is largely bought for its yield and its status as a real asset, while banks are a more volatile and cyclical investment.But even if the indexers are right to make this change, they are contributing to what is already a real risk of a bubble in real estate.For the duration of the post-crisis rally, which started in March 2009, real estate would have been the third-strongest performer of the 11 GICS sectors in the developed markets, behind only information technology and consumer discretionary, according to MSCI. The story in the emerging markets is very different, with real estate slightly underperforming MSCI’s main benchmark for the post-crisis period.So indexers’ correct recognition that listed real estate has become an asset class could help propel that asset class into a bubbleIn the US, according to S&P, listed real estate has quadrupled (up 310 per cent) since the post-crisis nadir, while the S&P 500 has tripled.The momentum behind real estate has come from institutions. According to the eVestment Alliance, investment in US Reits has quadrupled in the past five years. A recent report from Greenwich Associates found that close to half of pension consultants – which, like index providers, find themselves with implausible power in today’s markets – are recommending their clients raise their weighting in listed real estate.And their reasons go beyond any desire to join the crowds. Most large institutions say they want to diversify, and also that real estate will give them some inflation protection. The change in index definitions could encourage more money into listed real estate, because many institutions regard it as an “alternative” investment. Moving it further into the mainstream can only help.Is real estate’s attraction overdone? It looks like it, if normal valuation yardsticks are any use. MSCI quotes the price/earnings multiple of its global real estate index at 25.4, higher than any other sector. Its yield, critical to real estate’s appeal, is a strong 3.25 per cent – but utilities and telecoms yield more.So indexers’ correct recognition that listed real estate has become an asset class could help propel that asset class into a bubble. It looks great for the short run, but a tad alarming for the longer run.john.authers@ft.com
336;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-12T17:01:45Z;Morocco equities market downgraded to frontier market status;;More bad news for Morocco this week, after it was banished from the Africa Cup for pushing to delay the football tournament out of Ebola fears. S&P Dow Jones has downgraded the equities market one of north Africa’s most stable and promising countries from its index of emerging markets to its frontier market index.Alone among Arab countries, Morocco managed to weather the political tumult of the Arab Spring, even forging an unprecedented compromise with moderate Islamists that maintained stability without resorting to widespread state violence and helped the country maintain an average annual GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent since 2011.But in a press release on Wednesday, S&P Dow Jones announced that the phosphate-rich north African equities’ market had been moved from its emerging to frontier index after a review of feedback from investors:The lack of liquidity in Moroccan equity markets is a significant issue for market participants. The declining trend in market liquidity over the last several years does not align with other emerging markets, making it more appropriate to be classified as a frontier market.Meanwhile, the equities market of Egypt, struggling to emerge from several years of severe political turmoil, a bloody coup and a smouldering insurgency by a group pledging fealty to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, retained its status as an emerging market.The classification will not scare off investors familiar with the Moroccan market, one of the most open and modern in the Arab world. The Casablanca bourse (pictured above) is considered one of the most sleek in the region. UK trade envoy Lord Colin Sharman on Monday visited the Moroccan capital with a delegation of business leaders seeking potential deals in the country’s booming alternative energy sector.A recent report by the Oxford Business Group touted Morocco’s decade of economic growth and reforms, including anti-poverty measures which reduced the number of people living on less than $2 a day by two thirds.But the reclassification may scare off new investors and potential investors and underscore Morocco’s shortcomings, including an inability to expand its equities market. Market capitalisation at the Casablanca bourse stands at $57bn, lower than the $75bn peak it achieved in 2007, before the global financial meltdown. MSCI, another index provider, moved Morocco from its emerging to frontier markets index in June 2013.A analysis of that move by the World Federation of Exchanges suggested it would actually help Moroccan equities by giving the companies that qualify a higher profile:Morocco will have a much higher weighting and an increased number of representative stocks after reclassification as a ‘frontier market’. Morocco’s inclusion will automatically generate increased interest in Moroccan stocks and additional capital flows in the short term and on an on-going basis.With a market capitalisation of more than $11bn, Moroccan phone giant Maroc Telecom will became the largest holding in the MSCI index. The S&P Dow Jones reclassification won’t come into effect until next year – when perhaps Morocco will be permitted to take part in the Africa Cup again.Back to beyondbrics
337;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-11-11T11:17:55Z;Guest post: Stock Connect brings Chinese equities onto global stage;;"By Christina Ma of Goldman SachsChina is about to set another milestone in its long journey of financial market liberalisation. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, to be launched on November 17, will for the first time allow international investors to trade shares directly in China’s stock market without applying for an individual quota.Although the programme will initially cover select stocks listed on the Shanghai exchange, its implications are significant. By providing direct access to the Chinese market, it essentially knocks a hole in the Great Wall that has historically separated shares for domestic investors and shares made available to international investors. More importantly, Stock Connect paves the way for China’s stock market to debut on the stage of international relevance, something that has eluded it despite its massive $4.8tn market capitalisation.Locally listed stocks quoted in renminbi, or A shares, may soon be included in key global indices, which means foreign investors will be able to gain direct exposure to China’s growth story through direct ownership. Equity fund flows into the world’s second-largest economy will receive a sizeable boost.Since the early days of China’s monumental growth story, global investors eager to tap the China theme have done so through Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong and other markets. Some have access to domestic A shares through programmes for qualified foreign institutional investors, which have set limited quotas.Since 2002, China has granted numerous quotas totalling a combined $112bn to foreign investors under the QFII and RQFII programmes but that represents only 5 per cent of the A share market capitalisation in free float (tradable on the exchange as opposed to locked up by majority shareholders). The QFII and RQFII programmes have both expanded in size and scope in the past few years.Accessibility issues have precluded the inclusion of A shares into global indices. In June, MSCI announced that, following consultations with investors, A shares would not be added to its emerging markets benchmark, highlighting constraints linked to the quota systems. China’s share of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, at about 19 per cent, comprises stocks listed in Hong Kong, or those listed in China but denominated in US or Hong Kong dollars.To prepare market participants for the future inclusion of A shares in standard indices, FTSE launched in June its Global R/QFII Series to provide access to Chinese shares in the transition period, noting that China has made efforts in further liberalising its market.Stock Connect will take access to the A share market to another level. At its launch, foreign investors will be able to trade 568 Shanghai-listed A shares with a combined market value of $2.6tn through Hong Kong brokers. Even though a quota is in place, the financial industry expects the program to be expanded – like QFII and RQFII – after the initial phase, boosting investment choices available to overseas investors.With Stock Connect in place, it is only a matter of time before A shares become a mainstream investment opportunity for global investors. Based on the experience of Korea and Taiwan, A shares are not that far from being included in global benchmarks, given the progress China has made in financial market liberalisation. The announcement could happen as soon as next year.The long-term implications for the Chinese market are tremendous. Foreign ownership of A shares, which stands at less than 5 per cent of free float through the current quota systems, will increase as these stocks are added to global equity indices.There will also be changes to fund allocations, as China is under-represented in global equity benchmarks. It contributes more than 12 per cent of global GDP and a similar share of world trade, but has a weighting of just over 2 per cent in the MSCI All Country World Index. The inclusion of A shares in global equity benchmarks could trigger as much as $21bn of incremental fund allocations to China by 2016.In the long term, Stock Connect will integrate A shares with Hong Kong shares to create the world’s second-largest market by value. Size aside, it is a market of increased relevance to global investors who are seeking more exposure to China. The integration of A shares into global indices will allow investors to capture China’s growth more broadly and access opportunities that are only available in domestic markets at present. It will also allow international investors to refine their exposure from large-cap oil, telecom and banks towards sectors offering more focused exposure to domestic consumption such as health care and media.Stock Connect is a big step forwards in further liberalising China’s A share market, creating unprecedented opportunities for investors worldwide. It is also an important component of China’s market reforms including renminbi internationalisation, which will elevate the country’s standing in the global economy.Christina Ma is managing director, Asia equities, at Goldman Sachs.Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

339;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-10-29T08:01:54Z;Farewell QE3, but what’s next?;;In the years since the financial crisis, emerging markets have been awash with free-flowing global liquidity. Easy money from western central banks – notably the Fed – has driven up equity markets and currencies, and slashed borrowing costs.On Wednesday, the QE punchbowl is finally set for the dishwasher. So will investors in emerging markets call it a night?Evidence so far suggests not just yet. For one, the end of tapering has long been priced in. More importantly, US interest rates are expected to stay where they are – which is to say at rock bottom – for the foreseeable. Some even speculate that the punchbowl may get dusted off again if inflation remains weak and growth stalls.“We’ve known about the end of tapering for months, but the chances of a US rate hike in the next few months have been pushed back”, says Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. “There are even whispers of QE4. There is still the chance that the Fed may throw another log on the fire.”Looking at the equity markets, it’s hard to spot discernible signs of any EM panic. Some markets have struggled to vault above their 2013 peaks, but remain within striking distance. Indonesian, Thai and Philippines stocks all remain less than 5 per cent off the pre-tapering highs. Modi-fied India has soared by a third, while even unloved Brazil regained its vigour, at least until Dilma Rousseff secured a second term as president. The MSCI emerging markets index as a whole is currently just 5 per cent below its May 2013 level (when tapering was first mooted).Currency markets, tell a different tale. The real and the rupiah have both lost a quarter of their value against the dollar since the first mention of the taper. Even as the Sensex has soared, the rupee has remained weak. And don’t forget about the relentless sell-off in the rouble.So how to square the divergence? One answer might lie in Beijing. While the taper may have garnered more attention in the west, the slowdown in China is a key issue for emerging markets.Adrian Mowat, head of EM equity research at JPMorgan, says that the over-riding story for global EMs in recent years has not been QE, but rather the hangover caused by excess stimulus in 2009 (i.e. in China).In the go-go years of Chinese growth, commodity-rich countries like Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia boomed on the back of raw material exports. As China has slowed, those halcyon days have ended (at least for now), leading to sharp falls in commodity prices and feeding through to lower economic growth. The terms of trade for many suppliers to China’s once-ravenous economy have worsened, giving bond market investors pause for thought – something not necessarily shared by their equity market cousins.But if an economic slowdown (thanks to China) is about to be compounding by an end to super-easy money (from the Fed) is the perfect storm for EMs on the horizon? Not necessarily.True, commodity producers might suffer even more. But commodity-hungry economies, like India, are set to benefit. Lower energy prices could also make it easier for Indonesia’s new broom to push through reforms.What’s more, the taper has finished for a reason – US growth is improving. A recovery in the world’s largest economy should be good news for many EMs, especially those that supply it with consumer goods, like Mexico and South Korea. As Mowat puts it: “The fact that the patient needs less treatment – let’s see that as a bullish thing.”So what to make of it all? EMs remain vulnerable to any increase in US rates, and highly susceptible to bouts of volatility when expectations about rates wax and wane. Meanwhile China’s slowdown will continue to put pressure on commodity prices and those that dig things out of the ground.But EMs are a diverse bunch. They might all get drenched in a storm, but some could yet prosper in the sunshine.
340;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-10-16T10:52:02Z;Think you’re underweight in China? You’re not as underweight as you think;;With GDP growth in China slumping to a five-year low, it’s unsurprising that many fund managers have cut their positions in Chinese equities to less than the weighting suggested by the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets index.But if you are an active fund manager, how strong a position have you taken by going underweight if all the other fund managers are underweight, too?Number crunching by Steven Holden of Copley Fund Research shows that, of the 100 EM equity fund managers he tracks, with $280bn of assets under management, 79 are underweight China, making this a pretty crowded position.China fund holding distribution, %The chart shows the weights of individual funds (the blue vertical lines) compared with the MSCI weighting of 19.3 per cent (the red line). Holden says the average weighing among his 100 funds is 14.8 per cent (the pale blue line). As the chart also shows, extreme underweight positions are much more extreme than the overweight ones: of Holden’s funds, the biggest investment in China is equal to 24.6 per cent of total funds, while the most bearish fund manager is allocating just 1.9 per cent of assets to Chinese equities.India fund holding distribution, %Compare that with fund mangers’ attitudes to India – the current darling of EM investors. In this case, being overweight is not as strong a position as managers may think. Here, 84 out of 100 funds are overweight, leaving just 16 taking a truly contrarian position.Even among big active managers, then, herd behaviour predominates.As the FT’s John Authers and others have noted, such behaviour is an increasing cause of concern. Authers quoted a recent report by the Bank of International Settlements which found that:the concentrated use of benchmarks and the directional co-movement of investor flows can generate correlated investment patterns that may create one-sided markets and exacerbate price fluctuations.Those concerns apply to actively-managed funds, too.Back to beyondbrics
341;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-10-10T19:32:20Z;Guest post: frontier market multinationals propel growth;;By Tomás Guerrero, ESADE Business SchoolDuring 2013, frontier markets’ performance was well above emerging markets. The reference index for emerging economies, the MSCI EM, ended 2013 falling by 2.6 per cent, while the benchmark for funds operating in frontier markets, the MSCI FM, gained 26.3 per cent. The BRICS’ stock markets experienced significant declines, with the exception of China, whereas frontier markets became the most profitable in the world.In the cases of Bulgaria, UAE, Argentina and Kenya gains were above 50 per cent. Currently, this trend continues. So far this year, the MSCI FM has increased 18.5 per cent, while the MSCI EM has posted only a 5.1 per cent increase.These results are not merely a matter of chance. Behind the returns reaped by frontier markets are a group of multinationals which, propelled by improvements in the fundamentals of their domestic economies, are leading the growth of this diverse set of countries and therefore their stock markets. They are Frontier Markets Multinationals (FMMs).If we scan the FMMs that constitute the Top 10 by weight in major indices by industry (including the newly created FTSE Frontier Index Series), companies in the financial sector – such as the Nigerian Guaranty Trust Bank and the National Bank of Kuwait – and in the oil & gas industry – such as Argentina YPF or Kazakh KazMunaiGas – continue to dominate the top positions.But it’s not all about commodities and banks. In recent years, FMMs focusing on other sectors, such as telecommunications, industry and consumer goods,have begun to attract the attention of large investors and gain greater weight within the major benchmarks for frontier markets.This new trend is the result of the effort that some frontier markets are undertaking in order to move from commodity-oriented growth to economies that emphasise innovation and knowledge. Examples of this phenomenon are the rise of Saudi chemical company Basics, Nigerian brewing company Nigerian Breweries and Moroccan telecommunication company Maroc Telecom.Such multinationals, unlike most companies from developed markets, display several features that are benefiting their growth and expansion:First, they are often ready to take on risk. Being born and developed in countries with quasi-permanent political, economic and social instability can enable such companies to penetrate markets with a similar or higher country risk than that of their home markets.A clear example of this internationalization pattern is found in FMMs such as Nigerian cement firm Dangote – which has in recent years invested $4bn to open new plants in Senegal, Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Republic of Congo, Gabon and Benin. Other examples include the Kuwaiti telecommunications company Zain – which has a market share of 49 per cent in Iraq (16m customers) and 41 per cent in Sudan (11m customers) – and the Vietnamese oil major Petrovietnam – which operates several oil blocks in Cuba and Venezuela, where it has decided to temporally suspend its operations as a result of the rampant inflation plaguing the country.Second, the close relationship that FMMs enjoy with their home country governments facilitates funding. In many cases, FMMs are wholly owned by their home governments, allowing funding at advantageous rates.This phenomenon, which is the result of the governments’ desire to create “national champions” in order to establish strategic sectors, is more common in FMMs owned by governments, such as Moroccan multinational Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) or the oil & gas company Saudi Aramco, than in listed FMMs.Third, government diplomacy sometimes assists FMMs in their commercial aims. The presence of senior administration officials in the FMMs board, in many cases ministers or government-linked figures, allows companies to define and deploy a government strategy to facilitate its internationalisation, asset acquisition and the achievement of certain objectives within their domestic markets.The most obvious cases are found in the Middle East FMMs, where members of different royal families are responsible for directing, protecting and promoting these companies inside and outside their countries. Obviously, such facets can backfire against FMMs if investment decisions are swayed by extraneous considerations or rent seeking and poor management result from such associations with powerful bureaucrats. For now, though, it appears that many such companies are doing well.Tomás Guerrero is Researcher at ESADE geo-Center for Global Economy and Geopolitics of ESADE Business School and SovereigNET Research Affiliate at Tufts University’s Fletcher School.

342;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-09-29T23:08:29Z;China’s large forex reserves constitute both a blessing and a curse;Safety and liquidity largely come at the expense of yield;Chinese foreign-exchange reserves are viewed as a sign of national strength and a buffer against global financial turmoil, but as the forex pile grows ever larger, it is becoming an albatross around the neck of the financial authorities.As the country began running large trade surpluses, forex reserves grew from $610bn at the end of 2006 to $4tn by June 2014. It came through the 1998 Asian financial crisis largely unscathed, but policy makers observed the capital flight and exchange-rate devaluation that afflicted such neighbours as Korea and Indonesia.They resolved that large forex reserves, along with controls on cross-border capital flows, were essential to avoid a similar fate.But managing China’s reserves has become more difficult. Their composition is officially a state secret, but outside analysts broadly agree that about two-thirds are held in US dollars, a quarter in euros, and the rest in Japanese yen and British pounds.That means the renminbi-denominated value of the reserves is vulnerable to a depreciation in the greenback.Much like its counterparts in other countries, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (Safe) defines the goals of its reserves management policy as safety, liquidity and yield. Yet achieving the first two goals comes largely at the expense of the third.In terms of assets, nearly all of China’s official reserves are held in government and agency debt, as well as money-market assets, analysts believe. This conservative portfolio has kept returns low. It also exposes the portfolio to mark-to-market losses if dollar interest-rates rise, a likely outcome as the Federal Reserve ends quantitative easing. Apart from the US Treasury market, few financial markets are deep enough to absorb large inflows without driving up prices. Stock markets in the US and Europe would be one exception, but Chinese reserve managers have so far been unwilling to accept the added risk.That is due in large part to the political pressure on China’s reserve managers, who would come in for criticism if they were seen taking losses on their reserves.In 2007, China launched a sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation that operates independently from Safe, to raise returns on a portion of the reserves. But poor results from CIC’s initial investments led to a backlash that still weighs on both CIC and Safe.Eswar Prasad, a renminbi expert at Cornell University, says: “The problem is that they are evaluated not only on long-term returns but short-term as well, so they are concerned about taking on too much volatility.”That means Safe is likely to continue ploughing money into US and euro debt, while CIC cautiously invests in equities, commodities and property.——————————————-Domestic financial reform: Finally, a bite of the appleThe coming wave of financial deregulation in China promises foreign asset managers unprecedented access to capital markets, but the reforms may do little to improve the fortunes of western financial institutions inside the country.Deregulation is at the core of a landmark reform blueprint approved by China’s Communist Party leaders last year, granting market forces a “decisive” role in resource allocation. That means unlocking domestic interest rates and loosening capital controls.This interactive graphic shows changes in the value of the renminbiThe moves will offer foreign portfolio investors new channels into the country’s stock and bond markets and could pave the way for China’s domestic A-share market to be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. MSCI rejected that change last year because of restrictions on investability but will reassess its decision next year.A new opening would be welcome news to foreigners, given the limitations of the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, the main channel through which foreign asset managers currently access China’s onshore capital markets.Launched in 2002, QFII requires lengthy approvals from two agencies. Once funds are invested in the Chinese market, repatriating them is difficult. The Renminbi QFII programme, which allows fund managers to invest onshore renminbi funds raised offshore, is only slightly more flexible. The foreign-exchange regulator has so far granted only Rmb645bn ($105bn) in combined quotas under the two programmes – a tiny fraction of Rmb33tn in domestic bonds outstanding and the combined market capitalisation of Rmb27tn for the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Regulators have said a programme to allow mainland and Hong Kong investors access to one another’s stock exchanges will be launched in October. Though subject to quotas and limited to large-cap shares, the programme will not require each investor to seek separate approvals.Prospects for foreign banks, brokerages and fund houses operating in China are bleaker. Foreign banks have struggled to gain approval to open branches or fund themselves through their foreign parents. They control a meagre 1.7 per cent of bank assets. In securities and fund management, foreign investors must operate through joint ventures in which their stake is capped at 49 per cent. And many Sino-foreign securities joint ventures have been unable to win secondary-market trading licences.“The framework has been set, if not against [foreigners], then with very little concern about whether or not they’re involved,” says Fraser Howie, director at Newedge Singapore and co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise.
343;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-09-25T02:00:34Z;China’s historic stock opening to recast global investing;;"If proxy indicators are to be trusted, investors will welcome a key further opening of China’s Shanghai stock market to foreigners next month with a bang. More important, though, are the ways in which the partial integration of the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges promise to recast the global investor landscape.Several portents of a rousing reception await the launch of the “Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect”, which is set to offer Hong Kong and foreign investors with offshore renminbi (CNH) the most unfettered access yet to the Shanghai market.Investors availing themselves of CNH have helped drive the currency’s three-month interbank rate to a 2014 high of over 3 per cent in recent days, up from 1.5 per cent in June. The price gap between the Hong Kong-listed and Shanghai-listed shares of mainland companies with dual listings has narrowed sharply (see chart), as arbitrage intensifies. And some financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank, have had to shut Chinese exchange traded funds (ETFs) to new investment because of capacity constraints.The chart below shows a narrowing gap between the share prices of the 47 mainland companies with listings in both Shanghai and Hong Kong. An index value of 100 denotes parity in pricing; at Wednesday’s close it stood at 97.Chen and several others have observed strong interest from investors around the world in the scheme, which is expected to be launched in October although Beijing has yet to fix a firm date. “We do expect the daily quota (on investment inflows) is likely to be fully taken up in the first few days and weeks,” Chen said.Foreign and Hong Kong investors will be permitted to buy a net Rmb13bn ($2.1bn) in 568 selected Shanghai-listed stocks a day, up to an overall quota of Rmb300bn. Unlike previous partial openings of China’s domestic stock markets (the so-called QFII and RQFII schemes), there will be no lengthy “lock in” periods, allowing investors to sell their holdings without delay.Changing the global investor landscape
But beyond the immediate prospects for Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks, the scheme creates pressures to reorganise global investing. A glance at the size of the two exchanges suggests that their linkage – which moves to create the third largest exchange in the world – could reverberate for years to come.One pressure it exerts is upon the vendors of global stock indices, such as MSCI, which face a choice between diluting their influence if they do not accept A-shares into their indices and diluting their standards if they do.MSCI has announced that it will continue to exclude A-shares from its emerging markets index, but it has acknowledged that it will review this decision in 2015, potentially opting for a phased inclusion schedule that prioritises better-run companies.Turning the offshore renminbi into a portfolio currency
Another force to be unleashed by the Shanghai-Hong Kong link is for the further internationalisation of the offshore renminbi. The biggest inhibiting factor in the redback’s march toward acceptance as a global currency has been the paucity of investment opportunities.Jonathan Anderson, economist at the Emerging Advisors Group, has estimated that in mid-2013, total capital market assets freely available to international investors in US dollars were worth $55tn; in euros, $29tn; in yen, $17tn; and, in sterling, $9tn. The renminbi offered a mere $250bn. “That is about 0.1 per cent of the global market, putting the renminbi on a par with the Philippine peso and just a bit higher than the Peruvian nuevo sol,” Anderson noted.This could change significantly if, as is planned, the A-share market opens in stages to portfolio investors holding offshore renminbi. Chen said it is possible that within a few years the overall quota could rise from the current Rmb300bn to around Rmb1tn.Chen also sees the potential for a stock connect scheme to be extended to markets other than Hong Kong, perhaps including Singapore and London. “But there needs to be close co-operation between the two regulators . You need a strong political will,” Chen said.Financing Chinese companies with offshore money
The speed of China’s opening to offshore portfolio flows is accelerating. It took the QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) scheme, through which selected financial institutions are permitted to invest in mainland assets under strict guidelines, over 12 years to reach its current quota of $150bn. The RQFII scheme, which sets out investment opportunities to approved foreign financial institutions as long as they own offshore renminbi, was launched three years ago and has a total quota of Rmb480bn.By contrast the stock connect scheme is starting with an Rmb300bn quota, which analysts expect to be increased quickly in line with official policies on boosting the renminbi’s internationalisation and reforming China’s capital account.At least as important as the size of the quota, though, are the investible assets under the scheme. Chen thinks that the scope is set to be broadened to include not only bonds issued by China’s finance ministry but also stocks listed on the Shenzhen stock market and equity derivatives.Such moves, if they transpire, are set to increase pressure for corporate transparency and clear accounting, also elements of Beijing’s reform agenda.Back to beyondbrics"

These are unwelcome trends unless, perhaps, you happen to be an investor in EM healthcare stocks.A proliferation in ailments, rising incomes and growing government support for healthcare in EM countries are bolstering the portfolios of Sectoral Asset Management, a fund company with about $3.5bn under management. In March this year, it publicly launched a fund invested solely in EM healthcare companies.The fund, which it had managed privately for an institutional client since mid-2011, has returned an average annualised 12.7 per cent and a cumulative 44.7 per cent (see chart), outperforming both the MSCI EM index and the MSCI EM Healthcare Index.The fund’s approach is to invest only in EM healthcare companies (not their Western multinational counterparts) involved in pharmaceuticals, medical services and medical technology. In terms of geography, the fund’s portfolio is weighted 25.1 per cent to China, 24 per cent to India, 11.8 per cent to South Africa, 6 per cent to Indonesia and 31.1 per cent to other countries including Brazil, Jordan, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Thailand, Hungary, South Korea and Taiwan.Ageing, wealthier, ailing populations
The main opportunity comes, says Marc-Andre Marcotte, a managing director at Sectoral, from the confluence of several factors. As EM populations get older, wealthier and less healthy, their spending on healthcare rises exponentially.“People over 65 spend three times more on healthcare than people between 18 and 44,” says Marcotte. “In China alone, the number of people over 65 is set to nearly double from 111m in 2010 to 195m in 2025.”Demographics also impart a following wind to other EM countries. In India, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and (to a lesser extent) Indonesia, between 2010 and 2025, the over 65 age group is expected to increase by nearly 80 per cent, rising from a combined 86m to 152m people. In Brazil, the number will surge from 13.5m in 2010 to 24.4m in 2025.“As such, demographic shifts will provide very long-term tailwinds for healthcare demand and expenditures in EMs by increasing the prevalence of many chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension,” says Marcotte.In per capita terms some of the biggest projected increases in healthcare spending between 2011 and 2018 are set to come in China (from $274 in 2011 to $640 in 2018), India (from $60 to $118), Indonesia (from $95 to $184) and other countries (see chart above).Cheap scientific expertise helps EM pharma
Angus Russell, formerly the CEO of pharma company Shire Plc and now an advisor to Sectoral, said that one of the advantages that EM healthcare companies enjoy over the “big pharma” companies in the West is that they can source cheaper scientific talent to develop drugs.“The cost of hiring a fully trained chemist in India is between around $15,000 to $20,000 a year, against around $150,000 a year in the US,” said Russell. This reduces their development costs just as many of the patents on blockbuster Western drugs lapse, creating opportunities for EM companies to create generic and branded generic drugs at low costs.Such companies figure in Sectoral’s top 10 holdings (see table). Lupin, for instance, is an Indian generic drug maker that is looking to expand further beyond its domestic market. In a different category is Sihuan Pharma, a leading Chinese manufacturer of cardio-cerebral vascular drugs. Bangkok Dusit is Thailand’s largest private hospital chain.Back to beyondbrics"
345;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-09-09T15:16:05Z;Shares in Nairobi exchange surge 83% on debut;Flotation of Kenyan bourse boosted by bull run;Shares in Nairobi Securities Exchange, the operator of Kenya’s stock market, nearly doubled at their debut on Tuesday, boosted by the recent bull run in east Africa’s hub economy.The shares had doubled at one point, and eventually closed up 83 per cent with 3.8m shares traded. The exchange floated 66m of its shares at Ks9.5 each and they were 6.6 times oversubscribed, the highest in the stock market’s 60-year history according to chairman Eddy Njoroge.“This is the type of price action you want – it’s a very small bite-size IPO priced to clear, which is why we’ve had a nice pop and people got behind it,” said Aly-Khan Satchu, an investment adviser who attended the launch.“It probably represents an ‘open sesame’ moment,” he added. He expects more offerings after a long period of inaction.Although the number of new listings in the market of 60 or so stocks has dwindled to nought in recent years, bourse officials say a handful of other IPOs and new infrastructure bonds are expected this year.Kenya’s $25bn NSE All Share index has soared 120 per cent in the past three years while foreign investment has risen to about 60 per cent of its market capitalisation, due to appealing rates of growth in Africa.Kenya’s consumption-based $40bn economy is growing at about 5 per cent a year, and because of a statistical re-evaluation by the National Bureau of Statistics it is likely to be reclassified as a $50bn-plus middle-income country by the World Bank later this month.The MSCI this year nearly doubled Kenya’s allocation in its Frontier Index, increasing the exposure of foreign investors. Last year, MSCI ranked the NSE as the world’s fourth-best performing stock market index, with a return of 44 per cent, while this year the index has gained about 17 per cent, reaching record highs earlier this month.Hartland-Peel Africa Equity Research, a UK-based boutique that has tracked the continent’s stocks for the past 24 years, said Kenya’s blue-chips were outperforming many of their big-hitting African brethren.Blue-chip companies in the Nairobi stock market such as Safaricom, the telecoms company behind the popular M-Pesa money transfer system, top consumer group East African Breweries and Kenya Commercial Bank have attracted millions of US dollars in investments from local and foreign investors, boosting trading volumes.Christopher Hartland-Peel, founder, said that while earnings from the 22 major companies he monitors from Nigeria, Ghana and Zimbabwe were all down in the first six months, earnings of the eight blue-chips he follows in Kenya were up 8 per cent to $309 million. Six of the 30 top African equities by market capitalisation (excluding South Africa) are Kenyan, and together the top-30 is up 5.4 per cent this year, with a market cap of $96.8bn.He said the market has been buoyed not only by western buyers, but also by local pensions cash and regional money, adding that Kenyan banks were expanding their loan books and maintaining margins. The country was also developing what he terms “regional multinationals” in everything from banks to hotel groups, and advertisers to supermarkets.“When you look at the return on equity of the [top] companies, they all have a 20-25 per cent return on equity and it’s these high returns which are justifying the valuations together with the dividend payouts – they’re doing very well,” he said. “You also have to put a strong word in for the central bank because it has created stability.”After heavy depreciation in the Kenyan shilling in 2011, the central bank has steered the currency to stability, offloading dollars earlier this year to keep it within the band of Ks90 to the dollar.
346;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-09-07T05:50:39Z;MSCI removes Russia from the equation;More indices may decide to exclude the country;At the end of July, MSCI launched new composite indices that exclude Russia, including new versions of its all-country index and its emerging market index.As passive investors have become an increasingly powerful force in equity markets, this decision throws up a potential problem for the Russian’s equity markets ability to attract external capital.Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, says: “We launched these indices in July, after clients came to us with their concerns about the impact of sanctions imposed by the EU and US on Russian companies.”The decision will make it much easier for passive investors to avoid investing in the world’s largest country. It could also have serious implications for Russia’s equity markets.George Hoguet, global investment strategist in the Investment Solutions Group at State Street Global Advisors, says: “If clients seek to adopt indices that exclude Russia, this will restrict flows into Russia and potentially precipitate flows out.”Mr Lieblich adds: “Our clients were looking for investment tools that would enable them to avoid any exposure to Russian securities.”In the past, an index that allowed investors to bypass a particular market would have had little impact, as there were insufficient assets allocated to products that tracked these indices. But that is changing rapidly. According to BlackRock, cumulative asset inflows into equity ETP products were $248bn in 2013 and $171bn in 2012.More recently, investor interest in emerging markets passive products has increased. According to BlackRock’s latest exchange traded products report, August was the fifth month in a row of asset inflows into emerging market equities. Inflows this year to the end of August were $11.6bn.This contrasts with mutual fund flows in emerging markets, which were negative, with a total of $14.6bn being withdrawn, according to BlackRock.These trends mean the role of ETP investors is becoming increasingly im­portant in emerging markets and concerns of these investors have a greater ability to affect the performance of individual markets.MSCI says there is client demand for indices that avoid the Russian market. Mr Lieblich says: “Since the launch, we’ve seen a number of requests for the indices.”MSCI is not the only index provider to have considered how investors might react to the imposition of sanctions by the US and the EU. But other index providers have not gone as far as producing indices that specifically exclude Russia.David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones, says: “We decided that simply excluding all Russian companies from our indices was not the correct response to the imposition of sanctions, as they will not have a direct effect on investors unless the sanctioned companies try to raise capital.”Instead, S&P DJ decided to carry on monitoring the situation and if a company named under sanctions decides to raise capital, it would then remove that company from the index.Mr Blitzer says: “It is a very simple process for us to exclude Russia from a particular index, if the demand were to arise.”For ETF investors, however, it is one thing for an index provider to decide to exclude a particular country from an index, but that does not make it an investment option. That will only happen when the ETF providers decided to launch a product that tracks the new ex-Russia index.MSCI has not as yet seen interest from ETF providers.Mr Lieblich says: “We have continuing discussions about all our indices with ETF providers, but we have not yet received any new requests from ETF providers to license these indices.”Nor is there any appetite from ETF providers to change existing products.Mr Blitzer says: “Our ETF clients are reluctant to start excluding either individual companies or countries from existing indices, as the transaction costs involved would be punitive. They would rather monitor the situation.” There are also concerns that if existing indices started to exclude an entire country, then it would cause such a reaction in the Russian market that it could create even more uncertainty. “They would really rather not see further turmoil in the markets,” says Mr Blitzer.The decision by S&P Dow Jones not to follow MSCI’s lead and the lack of interest from ETF providers in providing products that track these new ex-Russia indices would indicate that investor interest is not widespread.However, it would be unwise to dismiss MSCI’s decision to issue ex-Russia indices.Mr Hoguet says: “Clearly, the posture of the index providers will influence capital flows into Russia.“In addition, the situation in Russia is far from stable. If it were to deteriorate, it is likely that capital would flow out of Russia and investor demand for products that exclude Russia would increase,” he adds.
347;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-09-07T05:50:05Z;Rumblings fail to shift foundations of top index providers;New entrants try for a foothold in the booming index business;"In October 2012, the announcement that asset manager Vanguard was switching benchmarks for 22 of its equity exchange traded funds sent index firm MSCI’s share price down 27 per cent in one day.Vanguard said it was replacing MSCI indices by benchmarks from FTSE and the University of Chicago’s Centre for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) to save millions of dollars in annual licensing fees.A year earlier, BlackRock, the dominant player in the ETF business, applied to the US securities market regulator for permission to develop and manage its own indices. However, BlackRock’s move was widely interpreted as a negotiating ploy in its own discussions over licensing fees.Surprisingly perhaps, despite these moves, the competitive position of the leading index firms now appears more, rather than less entrenched.Vanguard’s 2012 benchmark switch has had no large-scale
imitators, while BlackRock’s application is still apparently in the SEC’s inbox. Privately, the firm plays down its interest in pursuing the matter.MSCI’s 2013 annual accounts show its recurring revenues from asset-based fees on index products rising at 25 per cent a year, despite the loss of the Vanguard contract, while the index firm’s share price has nearly doubled from its October 2012 low.June 2014 brought a vote of confidence for the long-term prospects of the index business when the London Stock Exchange Group agreed a $2.7bn takeover of Russell Investments. The deal combines $5.2tn of assets benchmarked to Russell’s indices with the $4tn benchmarked to indices run by FTSE, LSE’s subsidiary.The Russell acquisition positions the LSE “strongly” for the “ changing dynamics in the global indices market”, the LSE’s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, said when announcing the deal.According to consultant ETFGI and based on end-2013 data, the top three index providers (S&P Dow Jones, MSCI, and FTSE/
Russell) calculate the underlying benchmarks for 70 per cent of the equity funds in the fast-growing, $2.6tn global ETF market.Some market participants question what index users are actually paying for, particularly when it comes to easy-to-construct, capitalisation-weighted equity indices.“There’s not a lot of intellectual property in the construction of many indices,” says Mark Hemsley, chief executive of equity exchange BATS Chi-X. “Users of index products are paying for the index provider’s brand.”But Hemsley concedes that few firms will seek to follow Vanguard in switching benchmarks for existing products. “It’s difficult to change a successful ETF’s underlying index midcourse. The index providers have a strong pricing position.”Many larger investors’ client mandates dictate the use of particular indices, notes Matthieu Guignard, head of product development at asset manager Amundi.“The index brand is important for institutional investors in particular. As institutions are the main investors in European ETFs, we haven’t seen many changes in the benchmarks tracked by funds,” says Guignard.Despite this apparent inertia, many investors still grumble about index costs, says a recent market entrant.Carl Bacon, founder of the Freedom Index, a not-for-profit company funded by investment firms, says: “Asset managers tell me that their fees are going up and that they are being charged in multiple ways for different uses of the same index information.”Another benchmark provider says exchanges wish to raise data-related earnings streams, including index fees, to compensate for a drop in transaction income.Steffen Scheuble, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based index firm Solactive, says: “Exchanges facing lower trading revenues are looking to generate earnings from other sources. Trying to increase the income from the sale of market data is an obvious option,”Despite the strong competitive position of the largest index firms, they may still face challenges from newcomers, say market participants.In the traditional, capitalisation-weighted index business, “only 20 index benchmarks worldwide have real brand value,” says Mr Scheuble.“Providers of other indices compete primarily on their efficiency as technology companies.” This represents an opportunity for companies from outside the financial sector, such as Google and Yahoo, says Scott Stark, former head of indices at Russell and now an independent consultant.“The substantial growth in index-related revenue over the past 10 years will probably bring in new providers, especially those that already have some type of content distribution,” says Mr Stark. “Technology companies could easily move into indexing, for example developing their own index-related content to drive news stories.”And in the fast-developing “smart beta” index market, competitive positions appear far less entrenched. “ Smart beta is an open playing field. It comes down to the thought leadership that goes into the index design,” says Ted Hood, chief executive of ETF issuer Source.Noël Amenc, chief executive of Edhec Scientific Beta, predicts: “The quality of the research underlying these new types of index, and thus the robustness of their records, will probably be the central issue in terms of competition within smart beta.”According to MSCI’s head of index business, Baer Pettit, prospects for a benchmark price war should not be overstated.“Overall, index fees represent a tiny amount of the total cost framework,” says Mr Pettit. “If assets cease to grow or if pricing pressure becomes acute, then we may see some changes. But to date, it’s been a relatively benign environment for firms operating in an expanding market.”"
348;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-08-31T17:03:06Z;Emaar Properties lines up Dubai IPO as confidence returns;;Emaar Properties, owner of one of the world’s biggest shopping centres, has set the initial public offering of its malls business in Dubai for October, in what could be the largest share sale in the United Arab Emirates since the financial crisis, underscoring the region’s revival.The sale reflects a resurgence of investor interest in Dubai on the back of a revival of its property and tourism sectors. Amid political uncertainty in the Middle East, the UAE has emerged as the safest location in the region and has attracted substantial investment.A successful IPO on the Dubai Financial Market could encourage others to follow and would be a further boon for the UAE, which in June was upgraded by the MSCI index from the investor category of frontier market to emerging market.Emaar Properties, whose developments include The Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, said on Sunday that it expected to list at least 15 per cent of its malls business in the offering, which was first announced in May.The bookbuilding will begin later this month.The malls business is one of Emaar’s high-performing subsidiaries and recorded revenues of $340m during the first six months of this year, an increase of 13 per cent from the previous year.Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Emaar Properties, which is about a third owned by Dubai’s government, said: “The IPO of EMG is a milestone for the development of the UAE capital markets as, for the first time, it combines institutional and retail shareholders in the same offering.”Seventy per cent of the offering will be made available to institutional investors, with the remaining 30 per cent targeting individual investors. Emaar did not state a valuation for the IPO but said it had earmarked about $1.44bn from the IPO proceeds to be paid as a dividend.The emirate has been investing heavily into its airports and aircraft, public transport and hotels to attract tourists to the region. Dubai’s tourist numbers rose 10 per cent to 11m in 2013, and this year its economy is expected to grow about 5 per cent, according to the Dubai Statistics Centre.The listing is a boost to the Dubai Financial Market, which lost out to London for the listings of other regional companies including Dubai developer Damac and Abu Dhabi-based oil services provider Gulf Marine Services.Emaar Properties had initially suggested that it might choose London for the listing, but it received a regulatory waiver allowing it to list a minority stake in Dubai.
349;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;‘Brutal’ sector rotation squeezes mutual funds;Performance of actively managed US funds matches worst days of the global financial crisis;Actively managed US mutual funds suffered one of their worst periods of performance in the past 10 years in March and April despite market volatility remaining low.The fear is that disappointing returns could force many active managers to adopt more risky strategies in the second half of 2014 in order to make up for the poor performance.Managers of large-cap US mutual funds fell below their benchmarks by an average of 175 basis points between the start of March and the end of April, according to MSCI, the index provider.This poor result was only matched during four other periods of exceptionally weak performance over the past decade, including the worst days of the global financial crisis in 2008 and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis in 2012.Mehmet Bayraktar, head of equity analytics research at MSCI, said: “[The returns] stand out as one of the worst over the past 10 years.”Growth-orientated fund managers endured a particularly tough time. Those benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Growth index underperformed by 290 basis points on average in March and April.Mr Bayraktar said the worst-performing funds tended to have more exposure to more-volatile high-beta stocks, momentum stocks that had done well over the previous 12 months, and growth-orientated equities.“Brutal” sector rotation presented huge difficulties for both long-only and hedge fund managers in March and April even though the S&P 500 traded within a narrow 75 point range and equity volatility also remained subdued, according to Nick Nelson, global equity strategist at UBS.Tech stocks, a momentum trade over the previous six months, registered a sharp correction in March.“Winners suddenly turned into losers. Any stockpicker, regardless of their exposure by region or asset class, found it extremely difficult to outperform,” said Mr Nelson, who added that this would leave many managers “playing catch-up”.The MSCI figures come after research from S&P Dow Jones Indices for the UK found that almost 90 per cent of UK active equity fund managers beat the UK stock market last year.The performance of UK managers was in marked contrast to their European rivals, where more than 60 per cent underperformed their benchmarks in 2013.Records over three and five years were also significantly better for UK active managers than for their European counterparts.Aye Soe, director of global research and design for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the results for UK fund managers stood out. Almost 68 per cent of French fund managers and 63 per cent of German managers underperformed their benchmarks in 2013.“However, it would be wrong to assume that UK active managers are the shining stars of the fund management industry,” said Ms Soe.As the five largest companies in the FTSE 100 account for more than a quarter (27.5 per cent) of the market capitalisation of the blue-chip index, it was relatively easy for UK managers to beat the benchmark by tilting their portfolio away from these stocks, she said.
350;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-08-05T12:26:49Z;Guest post: the Saudi stock market cracks open;;By Faisal Ghori, author of “The Final Frontier: The World’s Last Markets”Saudi Arabia underwent a sea change last week, one largely unnoticed outside of the Gulf. The nation’s stock market regulator, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) announced that for the first time in the country’s history, foreign investors will be allowed to directly invest in its stock market as early as the “first half of 2015, God willing.”In typically understated Saudi fashion, the announcement was made with no fanfare through the CMA’s website and the announcement, to date, is still available in Arabic only. But contrary to the announcement’s relative obscurity, its relevance and potential impact for global investors could not be larger.The Saudi Arabian stock market, known as the Tadawul, is the Middle East’s largest and most liquid market. The 167 companies currently listed on the Tadawul have a combined market capitalisation of $531bn, roughly $40bn less than Apple. While foreign investors have been able to invest in Saudi Arabia since as early as 2008, they were limited to various synthetic instruments that did not allow them to directly own the underlying equity.This meant that most institutional investors could not invest in the Saudi market. But under these new guidelines foreign investors will now be able to directly invest in companies such as Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East’s largest non-oil company and one of the world’s largest petrochemical companies, Almarai, the world’s largest integrated dairy company and Al Rajhi Bank, the world’s largest Islamic bank.This is to say nothing of the slew of mid and small sized companies that offer greater returns. New investors may pounce on the opportunities that the opening of the Saudi market represents, stoking the enthusiasm of existing investors. Mark Mobius, who oversees $40bn in assets at Templeton, has publicly stated that if he were allowed to directly invest, he would double or triple the size of his investments in Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia is unique amongst its emerging and frontier market peers in terms of its wealth, both above and underground. As the world’s largest exporter of oil, supported by its production of 11.6m barrels of oil per day and a healthy oil price, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the country to grow its GDP by 4.2 per cent in 2015. Moreover, with a population of nearly 30m, of which close to 50 per cent are under the age of 25, Saudi Arabia is the most populous nation in the Gulf.Despite Saudi Arabia’s attractive demographics and economic profile, its entry to global markets is closely controlled by MSCI’s indices. As the index provider of record to global investors, MSCI controls when the Tadawul will be permitted to exit its current “off-benchmark” status. MSCI will determine when and in what index the Tadawul is to be added. MSCI’s Sebastien Lieblich was recently quoted as indicating that if Saudi Arabia were to be added to its Frontier Markets Index, it would constitute a whopping 63 per cent of the weighting, and were it added to the Emerging Markets Index it would constitute 4 per cent, similar to Mexico and Russia.Lieblich hinted that that there is no guideline that Saudi Arabia must first be added to its Frontier Markets Index and then graduate to Emerging status. However, he clarified that if the CMA follows in the footsteps of China’s Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor program, the Tadawul “would likely be a standalone index.” The CMA’s original announcement makes explicit mention of “qualified foreign financial institutions” lending some likelihood that it will follow the China model. However, the announcement further adds that it will “solicit feedback and suggestions on these regulations” from the investment community.While a standalone Saudi index would lift the market from its current obscurity, it would not give it the same prominence were it a full-fledged “emerging” market, since $190bn follows the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in passive funds alone (to say nothing of active managers), according to HSBC.For all of the promise that the Tadawul holds for global investors there are also some very real risks. Perhaps most important among them is political instability in the country. As the events of the Arab Spring have shown investors, macroeconomic trends and oil wealth can belie deep undercurrents of social upheaval. Unemployment in Saudi Arabia remains a key driver of social unrest Although official government statistics indicate that unemployment is at 11.5% per cent, with 32 per cent of females unemployed, unofficial statistics are believed to be far greater.Moreover, for the first time in the nation’s history the succession of the king has now become an issue. With the current monarch, King Abdullah, at 90, and the Crown Prince 78 years old and believed to be suffering from Alzheimers disease, for the first time in history the rule of the kingdom is likely to pass to someone who is not a direct son of King Abdulaziz al-Saud, the eponymous founder of the nation. As such, if the current Crown Prince is no longer a viable option, succession will skip a generation to an unknown.Despite these challenges, the potential opportunity far outweighs the risk of sitting on the sidelines. Since the graduation of Qatar and the UAE from MSCI’s Frontier index to its Emerging index, the opening of Saudi Arabia would be the single most meaningful change for global EM investors, many of whom have been waiting and eagerly building their positions in the Tadawul since 2008. Unfortunately, they may have to wait somewhat longer since the MSCI estimates that the “the earliest Saudi Arabia could enter either frontier market or emerging market would be mid-2017.”Faisal Ghori is the author of the forthcoming The Final Frontier: The World’s Last Markets.

351;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-07-06T15:39:48Z;easyJet: stand by;Love is in the air but analysts on the ground now fret about its profits;"UK air travellers may have noted the appearance of unidentified flying objects in recent years: low-cost airlines that care. One of these is easyJet. Its shares have far outperformed the other main UK-listed lower cost carriers – Ryanair and Flybe – up 311 per cent over the past three years, partly due to this shift towards the customer. Compare that with just 85 per cent for the MSCI Euro Airlines index. This year, for the first time, Ryanair also appeared on radar screens, with lots of promises of good service.Love is in the air but some analysts on the ground now fret about easyJet’s profits. In recent years, the company’s shareholders became accustomed to positive earnings surprises and upward revisions to forecasts. Meanwhile, the former sector leader Ryanair – in the midst of rising costs and intensifying competition – had ignored service for too long. It lost its way. During 2012-14, easyJet’s operating profits leapt over 80 per cent; Ryanair’s held flat.But the wind has changed. EasyJet is growing its capacity by 7 per cent in the second half of this year – competitors are only growing by 3 per cent. One-third of easyJet’s added capacity comes via last year’s purchase of FlyBe’s 25 Gatwick slots, a rare opportunity. Bank of America believes all the extra capacity will hit the company’s pricing power, which in turn will push profits down. The stall in the steady climb of consensus earnings estimates for the company suggests other analysts have similar concerns.Nevertheless, despite noting this added capacity, easyJet does expect price improvement later this year; a mark of confidence in the underlying strength of air travel demand. Not surprising given healthy UK GDP growth this year. Its shares – down a quarter from the April peak – have discounted much of the supply concern. Enough waiting at the gate for bad news.

352;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;When to underweight US equities;;The US seems expensive relative to other major stock markets. As it is probable that cheaper markets will give better returns, this implies that investors should underweight US equities. This conclusion applies, however, only over the longer term. Timing matters and this involves other considerations.Chart one illustrates that G5 stock markets are strongly correlated with the US and so, to a large extent, markets go up and down together. The chart also shows that this tendency has been strengthening over time.Another important characteristic of major non-US equities is that they are more volatile. If the US stock market goes down, therefore, other markets are likely to go down even more in the short-term. I illustrate this characteristic in chart two, which not only shows the volatility of other G5 markets, but also shows the volatility of a portfolio which was equally weighted between the four non-US stock markets at the end of 1969 (labelled G4), which is the start of the period for the MSCI monthly data.Chart three shows that correlations have tended to converge, but that even over the past 20 years the US has been less volatile than the other equity markets and less volatile even than the portfolio which is diversified between the other markets.This combination of high volatility and strong correlation implies that investors should not time an underweighting of the US market just before it falls.Chart three shows the US market set out on a logarithmic scale. (I use this so that rises and falls of the same proportion appear to be of similar size.) The chart shows that there have been three periods since the end of 1969 during which the US market fell particularly sharply. I set out the relevant data for these three periods in tables one and two. These show that the correlations have been particularly strong during periods of large falls and that, as a general rule, other markets have fallen more than the US.Unfortunately the poor performance of non-US markets during severe bear markets does not have a nicely symmetrical balance with their behaviour during strong bull markets. In several periods of strong returns from US equities, non-US markets have tended to provide relatively poor returns and this was, for example, the case from the end of February 2009 to the end of May this year. Over this period US equities gave, in US dollars, a 23 per cent return compared with 18 per cent from an average of other G5 countries.The best time to underweight US equities thus seems to be at the start of periods when they are neither falling nor particularly strong. As I suggested in a recent blogpost about US profit margins, it seems to me that these are just the conditions that we might reasonably expect. I should emphasise, however, that this is a shorter term assessment. The US stock market is extremely expensive and so a large fall seems due. I assume that this will occur some time within the next two or three years. Investors who have then underweighted the US may find themselves underperforming in their equity portfolios and will then need to be protected by being diversified into cash as well as internationally.
353;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Finding bargains will be tough after QE;The approach to asset management will have to change;"Three market trends in recent years seem to be close to exhaustion. First, since March 2009 the MSCI world index (including dividends) for developed markets has increased 194 per cent, an annualised return of 21.5 per cent.Second, since November 2008 credit spreads have rallied, with the Markit CDX investment-grade index at 56 basis points, compared with the widest spread of 279bp. The equivalent spread compression in high-yield markets has been from 1,895bp to the current low level of 294bp.Third, since September 2012 there has been significant spread compression in the eurozone, with 10-year Spanish yields falling from 6 per cent to close to 2.5 per cent, 10-year Greek yields declining from more than 20 per cent to less than 6 per cent, and with all eurozone yields at or close to their lowest levels. Bond yields move inversely to prices.The question in fixed income markets is whether there is evidence of mispricing, while in equity markets it is how the rally of the past five-plus years will evolve and whether investment strategies should be changed to reflect different potential market circumstances.From 1992 until 1998, and then from 2003 to 2007, corporate bond markets experienced periods of stability with spreads relative to government bonds as low as those in current markets.Markets are discounting a historically low level of corporate defaults, but strong corporate cash flows, high levels of excess corporate liquidity and low leverage in the corporate sector should keep spreads tight. The most likely scenario is a period, similar to the 1990s, of spreads trading sideways near current levels. Although stable credit spreads are supportive for equities, the low probability of spreads narrowing further removes one catalyst for a further advance in stocks.Patterns of equity market performance have changed in 2014, with high levels of divergence between markets.James Mackintosh on the counter-intuitive effects of QEIn Europe the highest-performing markets have been those where there has been significant yield-spread compression. The Italian, Spanish and Portuguese markets are all up more than 10 per cent. But where yield declines have largely been completed, market performance, as shown in Ireland and Greece, has been less impressive. Despite easing by the European Central Bank, it is difficult to forecast further yield compression in the eurozone, and therefore a further catalyst for market gains in the outperforming markets has been removed.In Asia the market divergence has been extreme, with Japan down close to 6 per cent in the year to date, the Shanghai Composite declining nearly 4 per cent, and the Indian market up close to 20 per cent. Thai, Indonesian and Philippine markets have had returns well above 10 per cent. All these markets are showing stretched valuations and are vulnerable to profit-taking.In the US it is reasonably clear that quantitative easing will end in October. Although the Federal Reserve has not changed its inflation forecasts, growth and inflation data suggest a high probability of the Fed raising rates in the first half of 2015, and it is reasonable to forecast a Fed funds rate of 1 per cent by the end of 2015.Three supports for the US equity market – QE, a minimal funds rate and low US Treasury yields – will therefore be removed in the next year, at a time when valuations with a price/earnings ratio of close to 16 are starting to look stretched.So while the positive outlook for economic and earnings growth suggests a minimal probability of a return to negative equity market conditions, several factors suggest that returns over a series of years could be modest. There is a reasonable probability that, after the current positive market move, which may last a further three months, stagnation will follow.A more challenging environment will put increased pressure on asset managers to generate performance and switch from the top-down, “risk on/risk off” approach that has worked for five years.Ideas for performance generation would include: cheaper markets correlated with the US, such as Taiwan and Korea; markets correlated with the improving German economy, such as central Europe; and deeply undervalued markets, which are arguably discounting too negative an outlook, such as Russia and China.Others are: the European small and mid-cap sectors, which should benefit from the ECB’s easing; the under-owned Japanese market; which should benefit from further QE and a weaker yen; cheap cyclical sectors, such as IT, capital goods and materials, relative to expensive defensives; and companies or sectors with excessive levels of liquidity.What is clear is that the approach to asset management will have to change where a number of the catalysts that have spurred market rallies are dissipating.Robert Parker is senior adviser to Credit Suisse"
354;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-30T07:48:25Z;A better way to invest in overseas markets;Companies must disclose more information on regional exposure;With the US economy settled in a fitful, sluggish recovery, it seems increasingly likely its natural growth rate is lower than in the past.Maybe the twin drags of financial sector deleveraging and an ageing population will make US investors do what years of exhorting by their financial advisers failed to achieve: to reconsider the domestic bias of their portfolios and look to the developing world.It is worth pausing, however, to ask: are we investing the right way in overseas markets? The answer may be no.“Essentially nobody is getting what they think they are investing in,” says Rob Lovelace, manager of the $24bn New World fund at American Funds, and he is right. Traditional emerging markets investing, based on separating companies by country of origin, does not necessarily get at the reasons investors are excited about the developing world growth story.Rising living standards in China and elsewhere are leading to strong demand for luxury goods and consumer brands, many of which are developed by western companies. Emerging market stock markets, meanwhile, skew heavily to older domestic companies, often heavily regulated, many state owned.Investors who bought the MSCI China index at inception in 1992 are sitting on a gut-wrenching 48 per cent loss, even though the country’s GDP is up 1,780 per cent. China is an extreme case, skewed by technical factors. But among the 10 largest countries in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, the average correlation of stock market performance to GDP growth is only 0.73, where 1 would be perfect correlation, according to a BlackRock analysis.“If you really want to get at the emerging markets opportunity, it is a strange limitation to only invest in companies that are listed in these countries,” Mr Lovelace says. “I want to be able to invest in the Nestlés of the world. About 40 per cent of Nestlé’s revenue comes from emerging markets.”Developed market stock markets also suffer mislabelling. An estimated 47 per cent of revenues at S&P 500 companies are generated outside the US. Investors betting on the eurozone recovery are finding a poor proxy in European stock markets, whose companies generate a similar proportion of sales elsewhere.The solution appears to be a new class of indices that aim to reflect their members’ economic exposure to different regions and countries, rather than where a company has listed its shares or screwed a brass plaque to a door.MSCI, Russell and Stoxx have all developed regional or country-by-country indices whose members get large proportions of their revenue from a geography. Morningstar is considering launching a similar product. Ultimately there could be exchange traded funds tracking these indices, while active EM managers could use them as benchmarks.As well as a “does what it says on the tin” justification, investing by economic exposure could open EMs to investors with caps on investing outside their home market, depending on how these new index families are sliced and diced.Above all, economic exposure indices could damp the volatility of emerging markets investing. EM stock markets tend to get bid up by foreigners during times of euphoria, and swing wildly to the downside when foreign capital threatens to flee, especially if countries have a history of imposing capital controls.The threat of such volatility appears to be elevated at the moment. EM stock markets are one of the asset classes puffed up on cheap money from western central banks’ quantitative easing programmes.At the nadir of the EM swoon in February, after the US Federal Reserve began tapering QE, the traditional domestic company-only MSCI Emerging Markets index was down 8.4 per cent from the start of the year. The new economic exposure EM index, which includes multinational companies, was down a more muted 6.6 per cent. MSCI China was down 10.2 per cent in the same period, versus a fall of 5 per cent in MSCI’s Chinese economic exposure index.As emerging market companies shop around internationally for welcoming stock markets on which to list – as China’s Alibaba has done – and the boundaries between developing and developed markets blur, the attractions of economic exposure investing ought to become more obvious.There is some distance to go before it can become a reality, however, and the new benchmarks first have to be improved. Index providers are scrabbling to assemble revenue breakdowns from clues scattered across earnings reports and investor relations slideshows.And for every Nestlé, which gives a revenue figure for its 11 most important countries, there are scores of companies that provide only cursory regional breakdowns, leaving MSCI and others guesstimating the numbers based on relative GDPs.What is needed is for investors to push for more disclosure from multinational companies. That ought to be in companies’ interests, because it throws a spotlight on their EM growth credentials and potentially attracts a new class of shareholder. It is certainly in the interests of investors, who deserve to get something a little closer to what they think they are buying.stephen.foley@ft.comTwitter: @stephenfoley
355;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-26T15:20:56Z;Reliance Industries: love and hate;Indian energy company may be worth a look;"Energy companies in emerging markets are hostage to their governments. You hate that; everyone hates that. Investors pay just 7 times forward earnings to paddle around the free float of the MSCI EM Energy Index. The float’s market capitalisation is $470bn.When the Brazilian government announces that Petrobras will pay it $7bn for rights to oilfields, this just reinforces the hatred. Petrobras’ board was reportedly the last to hear it.But you love reform. A little sunbeam flickers over Chinese oil firms. If state-owned Sinopec plans to allow private investors into a listing of its upstream retail and marketing operations in the near future – these are almost three-quarters of the company’s free cash flow – that counts for something, surely. Perhaps more cash returned to investors; perhaps a portent of downstream reform. Either way, Sinopec is on 9.5 times.India’s Reliance Industries may look dearer on the same reformist measure. Reliance shares trade at 12 times its forward earnings. They dropped 3 per cent on Thursday, after the government of Narendra Modi delayed a rise in retail gas prices. Without the increase, an investment by Reliance in offshore gasfields may not proceed. Natural gas is one-10th of Indian energy use. The global average is a quarter. India has to develop domestic resources for increasing consumption. A third of its gas is imported.Should the state get in the way (again), investors might prefer to nurse their hatred and stay away. But Reliance’s earnings rely more on refining than exploring. It is, after all, a conglomerate – and one increasingly spending to build a telecoms business too.

356;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

358;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-22T22:46:43Z;Oil price volatility hits European airlines;;European airline shares have fallen sharply as growing violence in Iraq marks the end of an unprecedented period of low volatility in oil prices.Brent crude hit a nine-month high of $115 a barrel on Thursday and has risen more than 5 per cent since militants entered the Iraqi towns of Mosul and Tikrit on June 10. Although jet fuel prices have not risen as much, airline shares have responded by falling sharply. European airline shares are down 13 per cent in the same period, according to MSCI, the index provider.Fuel costs account for a high proportion of European airlines’ costs. Although the region’s airlines typically hedge their costs more aggressively than their Asian and US counterparts – with some having hedged as much as 70 per cent of their 2014 fuel needs – several will be caught out by the oil price rise.HSBC analysts estimate that a $5 a barrel increase in the spot crude price will reduce operating profits for European airlines this year by between 1 and 52 per cent.Norwegian Air Shuttle, Europe’s third-largest low-cost carrier after Ryanair and easyJet, does not hedge any of its fuel requirements. Ryanair dismissed the prospects of a long-term rise in oil prices on Friday.“This short-term thing happens all the time,” said Howard Millar, chief financial officer. “It was Ukraine, now it’s Iraq, it will be something else. Every week that goes by in the fuel markets there is an event, this is just one in a long sequence.”Ryanair has hedged 90 per cent of its fuel requirements for this financial year at about $96 a barrel, which it says has generated savings of roughly €70m compared with the previous year.The Irish low-cost carrier notoriously erred in its fuel hedging policy in 2008, making a series of missteps that cost it €102m, prompting a public admission from chief executive Michael O’Leary that it “screwed up”.For Ryanair, this time the toast has landed butter-side up“For Ryanair, this time the toast has landed butter-side up,” said Andrew Lobbenberg, airlines analyst at HSBC.The oil price rise puts an end to a long period of low volatility in the market, with Brent crude trading in a narrow range of about $104 to $110 a barrel over the past year.An end to low volatility in oil prices would have an impact on all airlines, since it has tended to reduce the cost of hedging as well as create a more stable environment for investment decisions.“Obviously hedging does have a price, so low volatility tends to lower that price,” said Mr Lobbenberg.Chris Monro, vice-president treasurer at Southwest Airlines in the US, added: “The last several years of relative [oil] price stability has allowed us to plan and execute with more assurance.”Thorsten Luft, head of fuel management at Lufthansa, which typically hedges 85 per cent of its fuel requirement six months in advance, said the recent jump in the oil price had silenced those calling for a review of the airline’s hedging policies.“There were people who were saying the market is flat and we’re still paying millions of euros for the premium for the [fuel] hedges, why are we still spending money on this,” he said. “But now those voices have gone quiet.”Additional reporting by Robert Wright and Gregory Meyer in New York
359;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-16T16:32:52Z;Gazprom: heat is off;Cutting Ukraine’s gas supplies is aggressive – but reflects desperation;Russia has won back Crimea. In the economic fight over gas, it is faring much worse. Gazprom’s minority shareholders – who have enjoyed a 23 per cent rally since March – are still in danger of being squeezed between the Kremlin and the west.Gazprom’s move to cut gas supplies to Ukraine after Kiev failed to pay its $4.5bn debt is aggressive, but reflects desperation. Time is on Ukraine’s side. Its gas stocks are up to 14bn cubic metres – roughly six months’ worth. Lower energy consumption due to a weak economy and decent weather have helped relieve the pressure. Aleksey Miller, Gazprom’s chief executive, is aware of his weakness. That is why he is eager to enlist European sympathies, suggesting that Ukraine could siphon off EU-bound gas. Given Kiev’s gas stock, the suggestion is overblown.The EU is also looking comfortable. Its gas stocks are high – 64 per cent full – and with the threat of sanctions in the air, EU companies have some leverage with Gazprom to extract better conditions. A recent deal between Eni and Gazprom, for example, allows the Italian company to buy gas at market prices rather than at a rate linked to the oil price. Brussels can also disrupt the South Stream pipeline – Gazprom’s project to bypass Ukraine by moving gas through the Black Sea – with bureaucratic stalling. It has already started to do so in Bulgaria.Gazprom shares – along with those of the Micex as a whole – fell sharply as the Ukrainian crisis was unfolding. The recent period of relative calm has prompted the recovery. So Gazprom shareholders should be hoping not just that the calm persists, but that President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko can sign a new gas deal. Such an agreement might finally help Gazprom shares trade at something more than 3 times forward earnings.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
360;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-16T16:22:02Z;Guest post: the great EM divide – China-centred east Asia vs the rest;;"By Michael Power of Investec Asset ManagementMSCI has moved in mysterious ways, its wonders to perform… and again left Chinese stocks out of its global benchmark indices. At the same time, we learn that, after three years in index limbo, it will not add South Korea and Taiwan to the family of developed markets. These decisions have happened despite the fact that all three nations are among the world’s top 25 economies: China at number 2, Korea at 15 and Taiwan at 25.As always, MSCI justified its decisions with reference to technical reasons relating to capital controls, market accessibility and tradability. Yet one cannot help but think that there are – deep down – other factors at work. Indeed, it is hard not to conclude that, like so many multilateral organisations that are located in and have grown out of the West, the likes of the MCSI are having difficulty coming to terms with admitting the leading lights of the emerging world – and especially China and east Asia – into their developed world clubs. Think of how distorted the IMF voting quotas remain: Belgium has 1.86 per cent (with a population of 11m and a GDP of $535bn) against South Korea with 1.37 per cent (50m and $1.27tn respectively), while the UK has a voting quota of 4.29 per cent (64m and $2.8tn respectively) versus China with 3.81 per cent (1.35bn and $9.2tn respectively.)For us investors, determining just how to deal with these Asian “pretenders” to developed market status has highlighted an even deeper issue of classification that is increasingly dividing emerging markets: there is a growing recognition that there are effectively two sub-categories – call them clubs – within the EM asset class. In one club, there is China-centred east Asia: China, Korea, Taiwan and Asean; in the other club, there is everyone else in the emerging fraternity: Latin America, Africa, eastern Europe and the Indian sub-continent.Who belongs to which club is not simply a matter of geography; economic practice also plays a part. With isolated qualifications, the former category tends to run structural current account surpluses (Indonesia being the only exception) while the latter group tends to run structural deficits (with the oil exporters being the main exceptions). In economic size, China-centred east Asia outranks the rest of the emerging world combined; indeed as a single economic unit, it now outranks North America as well as Europe. Even excluding China, this group would rank as the world’s fourth largest economy, after the US, China and Japan.Even though EM is still the asset class that attracts most investor interest, investors are starting to appreciate that there is something ‘special’ about China-centred east Asia. As a result, some – the smart money sovereign wealth funds in particular – are seeking a more focussed exposure to this region, in all asset classes: fixed income, equities, property and even cash. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund recently sold European bonds to fund an increased exposure to Asian bonds, whilst the Azeri sovereign wealth fund is seeking to add the Chinese renminbi to its cash holdings.There are a number of distinct economic advantages that tend to set the countries of China-centred east Asia apart from their EM peers. Typically they operate managed currency regimes that give rise to their current account surpluses, with the result that their external account is buffered with significant foreign exchange reserves and, selectively, sovereign wealth funds; these cushions help reduce their downside currency risk. Their exchange rate policies also allow their monetary authorities a degree of independence when it comes to setting interest rates and so determining the duration and shape of their credit cycles; such independence arises from not being reliant on external liquidity to fund current account deficits and so, by extension, not being exposed to the capricious behaviour of Western monetary authorities in the operation of the latter’s various quantitative easing programmes. The resulting lower volatility in the east Asian bloc’s credit cycles helps underwrite less volatile investment cycles and so generate smoother GDP growth trajectories. Furthermore, being a region that is generating capital surpluses means their investment cycle and with it their capital markets are not so exposed to the ebb and flow of foreign-funded debt and equity investment.For now, current account deficit running Indonesia is the east Asian exception that proves this normal rule. Thus far, it has not followed standard China-centred east Asia practice; indeed it has even been designated one of the fragile five emerging markets along with Brasil, South Africa, Turkey and India. However, investors are now wondering whether this 240m-strong archipelago nation will, especially if Joko Widodo is elected the next president, do a Malaysia and continue to diversify its export profile away from natural resources towards manufactured exports. If so, it could move across to the more-normal-for-an-east-Asian-nation structural current account surplus camp. (A perhaps even more intriguing prospect might be whether, in the wake of Narendra Modi’s comprehensive electoral victory in India, South Asia’s giant might similarly do a Bangladesh, pursue a policy of export-led growth and move away from the current account deficit camp.)Combined, the economic characteristics detailed above tend to reduce the risk profile of all the asset classes of China-centred east Asia in that they tend to create a less volatile economic environment. For investors, this means more capital protection on the downside and, yes, a lower likelihood of outsized capital gains on the upside. On balance, over time, the net effect of market movements when measured in US dollars has tended to yield better risk-adjusted returns, particularly for fixed income, property and cash spaces.Given that many investors are tied to the way MSCI defines the emerging world, the option of going materially overweight say east Asia is simply not available to them. MSCI defines who is a member of which club and most investors are obliged to live within this straitjacket whether they like it or not and whether it fits with changing global economic realities or not. By 2025, China will probably have the world’s largest GDP; but do not be surprised if, even then, it is still classified as emerging!Groucho Marx once quipped he would not want to be a member of any club that would have him as a member. So when the time eventually comes that MSCI can no longer come up with yet another reason to say ‘no’ to China, Korea and Taiwan and deigns to accept them as members to the developed market club, the latter may yet feel the same way as the more amusing Marx. Looking at the sclerotic growth prospects – both economic and demographic – facing the West and Japan today, one would sympathise with such east Asian reticence at the prospects of being admitted to what has recently been described as an “old age people’s home”. This may also explain why the Asian region has decided to set up its own club: the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. And who can blame them?Michael Power joined Investec Asset Management as a strategist in December 2002.

361;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-15T02:46:10Z;Frontier Asia market explorers should take care;A broad portfolio approach is a way of minimising political risk;An interesting dichotomy is developing in investor attitudes towards mainstream emerging markets and their frontier counterparts. According to BlackRock’s April exchange-traded product report, while fund flows are starting to return to the emerging markets, flows into China remain modest. In contrast, there is strong investor interest in frontier markets.The MSCI Frontier Markets 100 Index rose 11 per cent in 2013, says the BlackRock report. Year-to-date asset flows into this category are equally impressive – $0.3bn for a category with total assets under management of $1bn.Frontier markets represent a long-term investment opportunity. Allan Conway, head of emerging market equities at Schroders, says: “The economic opportunities in frontier markets lie either with those that have a young, cheap labour force or significant natural resources.”Most frontier markets also have a very low ratio of market capitalisation relative to the size of their economies. Mr Conway says: “As these economies grow, there will be a re-rating of these markets which will benefit investors.”An investment in frontier markets also provides diversification benefits. David Wickham, director of global emerging & frontier market equity strategy at HSBC, says: “These markets tend to be dominated by local retail investors, which means they behave differently from more mainstream emerging markets and so their performance is less correlated.”Comparing the lukewarm investor interest in China with the strong attraction of frontier markets raises the interesting question: are there greater opportunities to be had in Asia’s frontier markets than in China? To understand why focusing on just the Asian frontier markets is not a viable investment option it is worth taking a closer look at the differences in liquidity between major and smaller Asian emerging markets along with frontier markets.Now that the MSCI emerging markets index has been reconstituted to include Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which graduated from the frontier index, Asia contributes around 62 per cent to the total value of the index.If the large Asian markets – China, India, South Korea and Taiwan – are removed, then the remaining smaller Asian markets contribute just 10 per cent to the index. The four most important smaller countries are Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.But the overall size of the emerging market index means this is still a sizeable opportunity. Kemal Ahmed, portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management, says: “As a rough rule of thumb, that 10 per cent of the MSCI emerging market index is approximately equivalent to around $390bn.”In contrast, the frontier universe is several degrees of magnitude smaller. Asian frontier markets contribute around 18 per cent to the total index and include Pakistan, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. “But the total value of the index is only $100bn so the Asian markets are only worth approximately $19bn,” says Mr Ahmed.“Focusing on frontier markets in Asia alone is so much more illiquid and much narrower an opportunity set than the smaller Asian emerging markets,” he adds.Some argue the best way to access Asian frontier markets is as part of a global frontier market portfolio. Mr Wickham says: “We believe the most effective way to achieve good returns with relatively low risk is to invest across many disconnected frontier countries.”A broad approach to the entire global frontier market universe along with a cap on how much the fund can hold in one particular country helps to minimise the amount of political risk.“The correlation between different frontier markets around the globe is very low, which results in surprisingly low levels of volatility for the frontier markets asset class,” says Mr Wickham.However, these diversification benefits would not exist if an investor were to focus on a particular region. “All of the Asian frontier markets are in close proximity to China so it’s likely their economies will be influenced by that large economy, with stock market performance potentially being somewhat correlated. That’s a riskier investment strategy than a globally diverse one,” says Mr Wickham.A global frontier portfolio is not the only option: Asian frontier markets can be combined with emerging markets.“If investors want to invest in Asian markets but want to exclude either China or the other major emerging markets, the only option available to investors is a combination of smaller emerging and frontier markets,” says Mr Ahmed.There is good reason to believe that both smaller emerging and frontier Asian markets will experience strong growth over the long-term. “One of the key drivers of growth . . . is the plethora of new infrastructure projects in the Mekong region which we cannot even factor into our models today,” says Mr Ahmed.Stuart Gray, senior investment consultant at Towers Watson, says: “There is merit in choosing to invest either in smaller and frontier Asian markets or opting for a global frontier market fund.”But if an investor chooses the Asian route they should choose an unconstrained fund manager who has the freedom to look across all Asian markets.
362;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-12T16:06:05Z;Shortcomings of Shanghai trading exposed;Widening gap in dual-listings may indicate investor doubts;What do Chinese investors know that global investors do not?Shares of Chinese companies dual-listed in Hong Kong have put on a spurt in recent months and are up more than 13 per cent since March. These stocks are freely tradable by foreigners, who have responded warmly to a recent pick-up in inflation, improving exports, and a move by the central bank to free up lending to small businesses.But the equivalent shares listed in Shanghai – mostly off-limits to non-Chinese – have barely budged. For most of the past few years, these so-called A shares have traded at a premium to the H shares in Hong Kong. But since last November – when China set out on a new, more moderate growth path – the Shanghai shares have generally traded more cheaply. This week the A share discount reached its widest level in eight years.The gap partly reflects the shortcomings of trading in Shanghai, pointed up this week by MSCI as it backed away from plans to include A shares in its global indices. The world’s fifth-biggest equity market prevents traders buying and selling the same stock in one day and limits investors to using a single broker.But the widening H share/A share gap since November may also say something about domestic investors’ doubts over China’s economic transformation. Several brokers track what they call a “Li Keqiang index”, showing that by the Chinese premier’s three preferred indicators – electricity consumption, the volume of railway transportation and the balance of new medium and long-term loans – China’s recent downturn has been deeper than headline data would suggest.It is worth noting that as China apparently chugs along at a growth rate of more than 7 per cent, there is very little exuberance anywhere in the market. Just five of 945 stocks on the broad Shanghai Composite index are within 5 per cent of their all-time highs. On the S&P 500, the figure is more than one in three.ben.mclannahan@ft.com

364;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-11T04:43:48Z;South Korea’s status: clarity at last;;The years of periodic “will-they-won’t-they” chatter about South Korea’s potential upgrade to developed market status are over, at least for now. Index compiler MSCI has finally thrown in the towel.But rather than bump up Korea (and Taiwan), it has instead decided to boot them off its upgrade watch list. Regardless of your view on the underlying debate, the clarity such a move offers should be welcomed.The reasons for not getting the upgrade are familiar enough – a rigid ID system for traders, and problems with currency convertibility have long been the main sticking points. Nothing has been done to fix them, suggesting that both Korea and Taiwan may actually be rather happy where they are.As MSCI’s EM index now stands, South Korea and Taiwan are the second and fourth most important markets respectively. Korea accounts for 16 per cent of the index, and Taiwan just over 11 per cent.An upgrade would have seen Korea go from big fish in a small pond to minnow in an ocean – making up less than 3 per cent of the developed market index. That would have concentrated demand even further in only a handful of stocks, worsening an acute problem in a country where Samsung Electronics alone accounts for 20 per cent of the listed market.The capital inflows caused by an upgrade would also have put further upward pressure on the South Korean won – already at a 6-year high – at a time when export rivals Japan and China are seeing currency weakness.And many global bond investors are already treating Korea as a developed market. Borrowing costs, both at the sovereign and corporate level, are in line with those in a number of DMs. Korea pays 3.3 per cent to borrow over 10 years, slightly more than Israel, the same as Portugal, and less than Australia and New Zealand.So the benefits of staying an EM would appear to outweigh those of an upgrade. But it doesn’t hide the fact that Korea is – on many counts – a well-established developed economy.Korea’s GDP per capita is $30,800, according to the OECD, higher than Portugal ($25,300) and Israel ($29,800) and only just shy of that in Spain ($32,000), and Italy ($33,000).While Korea has well-flagged corporate governance issues, it still ranks higher than Italy on Transparency International’s corruption index. At 81, South Koreans also have a longer life expectancy than the US (79) and the same as the UK, while infant mortality rates are even lower than in France.The South Korean education system is seen as one of the world’s best, beating all of Europe and North America in the most recent survey of performance in maths, science and reading. And the number of full-time researchers engaged in R&D is also more than double that in Italy and 50 per cent higher than in Germany, helping it become a global leader in areas like electronics, autos, and high-tech engineering.But all that – and Korea’s deep, liquid markets – was not enough to sway MSCI, in contrast to rival FTSE, which upgraded the country years ago.By ditching the watch list altogether, MSCI has at least removed the annual period of speculation that bubbles up in the market at this time of year. It also puts the ball firmly back in South Korea’s court by affirming that the criteria will not be moulded to fit the market. Clarity, if nothing else, got an upgrade.CORRECTION: This article previously said that Portugal’s GDP per capita was $33,000. It is actually $25,300. Sorry about that.
365;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-10T23:44:23Z;MSCI leaves Chinese stocks out of indices;;MSCI has chosen not to press ahead with a controversial plan to add mainland Chinese equities to its global benchmark indices, while South Korea and Taiwan will no longer be considered for a developed markets ranking.The inclusion of mainland Chinese equities in global benchmarks would have been a major milestone in the opening up of China’s financial markets.However, the proposal, which MSCI sent out for consultation in March, met with significant opposition from some global investors – including BlackRock – who complained that China’s strict market controls made the plan unworkable.Chinese markets are still largely closed to outside capital – with access restricted to two licensing systems that often require months to gain final approval. Of the nearly $240bn of quota available to international investors under current regulations, only a third has been granted. Due to those limits, foreign funds own less than 3 per cent of the mainland Chinese stock market.“Feedback from investors through this consultation is that they are generally supportive of an inclusion into the index over time, but the current quota [system] is still too constraining to warrant an inclusion in the mainstream index right now,” said Remy Briand, MSCI’s head of index research.Under the initial plan, more than 200 stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen – known as A shares – would have been added to the MSCI China index, which is currently made up only of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong and New York.As a result, A shares would also be included in MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan and global emerging markets indices. Taken together, the three benchmarks track $3.4tn in funds across the world. However, the suggested weighting of 0.6 per cent for A shares in the EM index was a modest starting point – online gaming company Tencent alone accounts for 1.8 per cent of the EM index.China – through its Hong Kong listings – is already the biggest component of the emerging markets index at around 19 per cent.Attention will now shift to the development of a new link between the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, due to begin in October, which should provide global funds with far freer access to mainland equities. MSCI said the programme appeared to provide an “open playing field” for investors looking to access China, and that it would still consider including China’s so-called A shares in its 2015 review.In the meantime, MSCI will introduce a China A International Index that will not be included in the emerging market index, but will serve as a benchmark for global investors in Chinese A shares. Rival index provider FTSE announced the launch of a new set of China-related index products last week.MSCI also said in its review that Korea and Taiwan were no longer on watch for potential reclassification to developed market status due to a lack of significant progress in recent years in key areas affecting accessibility. Both had been under review for the past five years. MSCI said its decision to remove both markets would help bring more transparency to the process.
366;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-09T11:22:08Z;EM equities rise to 12-month high;South Korea won hits strongest versus dollar in nearly six years;With global investors having got over their Federal Reserve “taper tantrum”, and as data suggest that the US and China are past their slowdowns, emerging market assets are in favour.The MSCI EM equity index started the week at a 12-month high.Take South Korea. Foreigners were net buyers in Seoul’s Kospi index for the 18th consecutive session on Monday.The won hit its strongest versus the US dollar in nearly six years, looking to trade sub the Won1,000 level for the first time since the global financial crisis clobbered EM currencies in 2008.It is thought that South Korea’s equity market, and thus the won, benefits from having such a large weighting in the MSCI EM.But Citi reports clients fretting that MSCI may, after several years’ consideration, upgrade Korea to “developed” status at its annual review on Tuesday. This, clearly, may open up Korean assets to other investors, but the concern is that EM outflows may be destabilising.Citi thinks the upgrade unlikely because various structural improvements have still not been met, and that “together with Korea’s strong current account surplus and the EM-friendly global backdrop, the KRW will outperform in the weeks ahead”.
367;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-06-04T09:52:23Z;Nigeria stock exchange flies in spite of Boko Haram, with help from MSCI;;"Nigeria is receiving a large influx in foreign portfolio flows in spite of investors’ unease following the terror campaign of Boko Haram, after a closely-tracked index provider increased significantly the weighing of Africa’s largest economy.MSCI, whose indices are followed by billions of US dollars from institutional investors, has lifted the weight of Nigeria’s equity market on its popular MSCI Frontier markets to about 19 per cent, up from 12 per cent previously.The increase is channelling about $200m in fresh foreign flows on top of further domestic flows, driving the Lagos-based stock market to a four-month high.Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, is one of the most liquid frontier markets, attracting billions of dollars in foreign portfolio flows into its local equity and bond market. But investors have recently been put off by growing insecurity and the suspension earlier this year of the country’s well-regarded central bank governor, Lamido Sanusi. Analysts estimate that foreign holdings of Nigerian equities and local-currency T-bonds and T-bills fell this year 25 per cent to $17.bn.The re-weighting appears to have reversed the outflows. The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index hit a four-month high this week, reversing all the losses triggered by the Boko Haram’s attacks and Sanusi’s suspension. Boko Haram gained international notoriety with the abduction of more than 200 teenage schoolgirls in April. Over a five-year insurgency, its attacks have killed 12,000 people.The MSCI-inspired gains have left the Nigerian main equity index roughly flat since January, following a 45.6 per cent gain in 2013 and a 37.3 per cent rise in 2012.The biggest gains had been for Forte Oil, a local energy group, and Ecobank Transnational, one of the biggest pan-African lenders. Both had been included for the first time in the MSCI frontier index. Forte Oil rallied 85.9 per cent in May, while Ecobank rose 26 per cent. Nigerian blue-chips, including Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigerian Breweries and Zenith Bank, have risen strongly over the last month as investors bought them in anticipation of the MSCI re-weighting.The annual re-balancing of the index – triggered after the United Arab Emirates and Qatar were upgraded from “frontier” to “emerging market” status – has sharply increased trading volumes in Lagos, with shares worth more than $70m changing hands on the exchange on Friday, triple the usual level, brokers said.The fresh foreign portfolio flows will help the Nigerian central bank to stabilise the exchange rate of the local currency, the naira, against the dollar. The currency suffered earlier this year after the suspension of Sanusi, forcing the bank to intervene heavily in the market. Hard currency reserves had fallen from about $50bn in mid-2013 to roughly $37bn recently as the central bank intervened.Following the re-weighing, Nigeria is the second largest constituent in the MSCI frontier index after Kuwait. The index is tracked by $6bn in institutional money. Besides Nigeria, Kenya will also benefit from the MSCI re-weighting, with the Nairobi Securities Exchange accounting for nearly 5 per cent of the index, up from 3 per cent.Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

368;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-05-27T23:01:26Z;QE and the Japanese stock market (part one);;"As I pointed out at the start of this year, the US stock market was about 70 per cent overvalued but, I thought, more likely to rise than fall. My reasons were “the strong buying of shares by companies and the impact of quantitative easing”.Behind this comment is the old adage that it is only in the longer term that the market is driven by value. In the shorter term who has money, who buys and why are usually more important. QE continues in Japan and is being slowly reined in by the US Federal Reserve. Recently, however, the two markets have diverged and this post, and my next, are my attempt to assess why.When a central bank buys government bonds, the liquidity of the sellers rises. In the absence of changes in liquidity preference, this will drive the sellers to buy other assets, in particular non-government bonds and equities. Unless the supply of the alternative assets increases, the buying will push up their prices.As chart one shows, the total assets of the Bank of Japan and the US Fed had fluctuated in similar ways relative to their country’s respective GDPs, but the impact on their stock markets appears, recently at least, to have been markedly weaker in the case of Japan. So far this year (to May 23), Tokyo is down 6.6 per cent in yen terms and Wall Street is up 4.6 per cent in dollars, using the MSCI indices.There are, I think, three key differences between the two countries that appear to explain the markets’ diverse behaviour: first, companies; second, foreigners; and third, banks.In this blog I aim to discuss the impact of companies and foreigners; in the next, I look at the impact of banks and look ahead to the market implication of these analyses.In chart two I show the way different sectors have been buying shares in Japan, and in chart three I show the same data for the US.Companies have been persistent buyers in the US, dominating all other sectors, which have in aggregate been net sellers in all quarters since Q4 2009. In Japan companies have been persistent sellers, albeit in a small way. (The corporate data in both countries include issues made in the primary market as well as net buying in the secondary market.)The key influence of corporate buying on the US stock market is illustrated in chart four. This contrasts with the impact of such buying in Japan, which is shown in chart five.In the US companies spend more money on share purchases when prices are high, which is perverse from the viewpoint of long-term shareholders, but rational as it accords with the interests of management. (The US stock market has been seriously overvalued for most of the time since 1996. Corporate share-buying has therefore destroyed value by buying assets at more than their worth and the process has been accentuated as buying has increased as prices rise.)Japanese companies have usually been sellers, with fluctuations that seem to have had little relationship to the level of the market. Selling increased after the stock market fell in 2008, but declined well before share prices rose in 2013.As foreign buying has been so important, it might be thought that the key to the Japanese stock market is forecasting foreigners’ next moves. This will depend, however, on a number of things. For example, foreign buying may be unforecastable, either because it is random or because it depends on economic developments that cannot be forecast, such as changes in the exchange rate.It may also be that the foreign buying is momentum-based and thus likely to amplify rather than lead changes in the market’s direction. Chart six, which shows foreign buying and market movements, simply shows that the two have moved together, but there is strong anecdotal evidence that momentum buying is prevalent among international investors.If foreigners’ activities are unpredictable or momentum-based and thus likely to reinforce rather than offset any change in the market that is initiated by other investors, it seems sensible to look next at the way other investors behave."
369;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-05-22T09:43:36Z;Guest post: frontier markets – more profitable, less volatile;;By Tomás Guerrero, ESADE Business SchoolIn the last months, some isolated events such as the suspension of the Nigerian Central Bank governor, Lamido Sanusi, and the outbreak of the Ukrainian conflict, have set the alarm bells ringing. Frontier markets could be a bubble about to explode.Though, the reality in this diverse set of countries is far away from the forecasts of the doomsayers. In the case of Ukraine, whose weight in the MSCI FM – the frontier market index – is negligible (0.1%), the stress prompted by the Russian occupation has not shaken investor confidence. The PFTS Index, the benchmark index of the Ukrainian stock exchange, has gained a 36.3 per cent since the beginning of the year and a 39.1 per cent since May 2013.In the case of the largest African economy, whose weight in the MSCI FM is close to 15 per cent, the story is pretty much the same. Despite Sanusi’s suspension, widespread corruption and some recent restrictive decisions by the Nigerian Central Bank, the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NSE ASI) – has risen by 11.7 per cent since May 2013, despite having fallen by 6.7 per cent this year.These examples challenge a sense that frontier markets are necessarily more risky and volatile than their bigger and more liquid cousins, the emerging markets. According to the widely-followed MSCI classification, there are 21 emerging markets and 34 frontier markets, though Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are set to graduate from frontier to emerging status late this month.During 2013, frontier markets outperformed emerging markets. The MSCI EM, ended 2013 falling a 2.6 per cent, while the benchmark of funds operating in the frontier markets, the MSCI FM, gained a 26.3 per cent. Overall, the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, China, India) experienced significant declines, though Chinese share prices bucked the trend.Frontier markets outperformed other categories, with Bulgaria, UAE, Argentina and Kenya each seeing share price appreciation above the 50 per cent. And last year’s trend has carried over into this year. So far this year, the MSCI FM has risen 12.3 per cent, higher than the 0.43 per cent climb of the MSCI EM.The frontier markets have become something of a haven. Though it may seem counter-intuitive, these economies display features that make them less vulnerable in the current climate than emerging ones. Firstly, they appear less sensitive to developed economy shifts in fortune, as well as to each other – insulating them from external shocks. The low correlation in market movements between frontier and developed markets also increases the utility of frontier markets as a diversification strategy.Secondly, frontier markets’ low liquidity, frequently cited as one associated with frontier investing, has significantly contributed to stability. The US Federal Reserve’s announcement last May that it would “taper” its monetary stimulus has hit emerging markets but left frontier markets relatively unscathed. Fund managers find it more difficult to liquidate holdings in frontier markets, leading them to focus on selling off the more liquid positions in their EM portfolios.The shallow liquidity of these markets has also acted to crimp inflows, thus limiting volatility on the upside as well as the downside. In 2013, MSCI FM’s volatility (measured as the average difference between the year high and the low over the preceding five-year period) was 18.5 per cent, compared to 22.6 per cent for the MSCI EM and the 15.3 per cent of the S&P 500.By the moment, frontier markets shine more than emerging ones. The rumors of their demise are premature.Tomás Guerrero is a Researcher at ESADEgeo-Center for Global Economy and Geopolitics at ESADE Business School and SovereigNET Research Affiliate at Tufts University’s Fletcher School. He specializes in frontier markets, sovereign wealth funds, halal industry and entrepreneurship.
370;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-05-19T23:36:42Z;LSE nears $3bn Russell deal;;The London Stock Exchange Group has entered exclusive talks to buy Russell Investments, the index compiler and asset manager, that is expected to fetch about $3bn, said people familiar with the discussions.A deal at that size would be the biggest in the LSE’s 213-year history and mark its boldest push into the US where Russell is best known for its equity benchmarks such as the Russell 2000.One person close to the situation cautioned that talks may still fall apart and no outcome is expected for at least a couple of weeks.The development comes a week after the LSE confirmed it was in late-stage talks for Russell, which is being spun out by its parent company, Northwestern Mutual, in an auction.At the time, other bidders including MSCI, a leader in securities indexing, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which is looking to expand its footprint into the US, were also said to be in the running. The auction has also attracted interest from private equity groups, but they are believed to have lost ground to strategic buyers as talks progressed this month. Goldman Sachs, which is working on behalf of Russell, declined to comment.Owning the Russell index and its affiliated products would be a transformational leap for the LSE. It would be part of a bold push into the US market where the Russell name is prominent among traders and fund managers.A purchase would also allow the exchange to unite the index business with FTSE International, which it owns outright after purchasing the 50 per cent it did not own from Pearson, the parent company of the Financial Times, for £450m in 2011.Russell’s business also comprises consulting and asset management, with about $260bn in assets under management. A deal for Russell would be part funded through an equity raising, the LSE said last week.The combination would allow the LSE to take on leaders in the indexing business – MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices– in a sector that has also seen Nasdaq OMX, Markit and Bloomberg further their interest and ambitions in recent years.The LSE’s move is the latest indication of how rival exchanges and financial data companies have sought to tighten their grip on market data compilers as fund managers demand more index-based products, value-added data and analytical tools.
371;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-05-02T17:45:22Z;Frontier markets ahead as Qatar and UAE ‘promoted’;;"Emerging markets have had a torrid time since the US Federal Reserve hinted at reducing monetary stimulus a year ago. But companies in frontier markets have enjoyed quite different fortunes, and a rejig of the key indices this month provides investors with an opportunity to take stock.Frontier markets are less developed than emerging markets, and include countries such as Kenya and Jordan. Over the past year, the MSCI Frontier Markets index is up 25 per cent compared with a 2.8 per cent drop in the MSCI Emerging Markets and beating most developed markets too.Tom Becket, chief investment officer at PSigma Investment Management, said the index was playing catch-up after being badly mauled following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Many frontier funds buckled with the financial crisis in 2008. It was death by a thousand cuts – frontier markets fell a long way,” he said.The MSCI Frontier Markets index peaked in 2008 at about 1,115 before plummeting to 350 a year later.Aside from the compelling growth opportunity in these fledgling markets, other investors point to the benefits of diversification, through the relative lack of correlation with many other countries and asset classes.“Some might think frontier markets are only suitable for a ‘growth’ portfolio, but they are lowly correlated to the US and other developed markets,” said Caroline Shaw, a fund manager at wealth management firm Courtiers. She believes investing a small amount in frontier markets carries less risk than increasing exposure to the US market.However, frontier markets no longer look particularly cheap, trading at a price to earnings ratio of about 16, compared to 11.7 for emerging markets.“There’s now more value in the emerging markets, especially as the global recovery continues,” said Mr Becket.Frontier markets are also volatile and illiquid; Jason Hollands at Bestinvest points out that the capitalisation of all the markets in the MSCI Frontier Markets index is about the same as the Danish stock market.Two frontier countries, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, have grown to such a degree they are being “promoted” into the emerging markets index this month as part of index provider MSCI’s annual review of indices.Ms Shaw said that the changes might seem insignificant – Qatar and UAE combined will represent just 0.7 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Market index – but reflect the growth opportunities among the frontier countries.Some far-flung economies have turned in a more robust investment performance than the more established emerging marketsMr Hollands said that estimates of the potential benefit in fund flows to the two markets range from $800m to $1.1bn. “The downside is that capital flows can go both ways, and sentiment towards emerging markets as an asset class is going to be heavily driven by its big constituents such as China, Russia, Brazil and India.”He cautioned that the outlook for Russia is deteriorating while the deceleration of China and its expanding credit bubble is also a serious concern.“Of the major EM economies, perhaps India alone offers some potential near-term cheer if the election results in a clear mandate for Narendra Modi, who is seen as an economic reformer,” added Mr Hollands.Bigger changes could soon be afoot in the emerging markets index. Both Taiwan and South Korea, representing nearly 28 per cent of the index, have been under review for promotion to developed market status for two years. The impact would be significant for emerging market fund managers who use the MSCI index as a benchmark. They are often subject to limitations on where they can invest outside the index.Nicholas Field, an emerging markets fund manager at Schroders, believes it is unlikely the duo will be moved, due to issues over market accessibility and, in Taiwan’s case, currency trading.“If it did happen, we would have to think very carefully about what we would do,” he added, noting that both countries have a bias towards technology hardware and software companies such as Samsung and Acer, which helps balance the weightings to resources stocks and banks.MSCI is also considering allowing domestic Chinese A-shares into the index. The 18.9 per cent allocation to China is currently made up of Chinese shares trading in Hong Kong. Admitting A-shares, which could happen from next year, would increase the weighting to China still further. However, foreign access to the A-share market is still tightly controlled by the Chinese authorities via a quota system."
372;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-04-21T15:00:41Z;Arm Holdings: a leg up;Chip designer looks to power network equipment;No company has the smarts for phones like Arm Holdings, the UK-based chip designer. The smartphone market has burgeoned into a $13bn sector, says IDC, for which Arm provides almost all of processor design. But smartphone market growth has already slowed, leaving Arm vulnerable. Concern over this issue might explain Arm’s pedestrian share performance: up just 8 per cent in the past year versus 19 per cent for the MSCI World Semiconductor index. So step forward enterprise networking with its myriad routers, switches and small servers, all of which require microprocessors.Mobile networks depend on these systems to create a path for smartphones to connect to the internet. Without a fast connection to the internet – known as backhaul – a 4G phone offers no advantages to consumers. Bottlenecks can develop. Thus equipment makers want the fastest processing with the lowest power consumption. This market is also the same size as for smartphones and mobile computing. Arm expects networking can grow as fast as smartphones over the next five years or so, roughly 9 per cent annually. The company has less than 5 per cent share here, according to RBC.That footprint should soon widen, markedly. Freescale, the world leader in chipmaking for the networking market, has begun to use Arm’s designs. Arm’s management, famously conservative in their forecasts, believe it can control 30 per cent of this market by 2018. That could add $150m to royalty revenues, reckons RBC, all of which translates directly into operating profits. Royalties today are half of its $1.1bn in revenues.If any company needs a booster shot, Arm does. Given its perennially high valuation – currently 30 times next year’s earnings – any deterioration in revenue growth would quickly turn the shares into a value play. With first-quarter earnings due out on Wednesday, the market will listen keenly for smart new growth steps from Arm’s executives.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Simple, Japanese corporations need to improve corporate governance. Returns on capital have lagged behind for too long. Consider that return on equity in Japan (6.5 per cent, on MSCI data) during the past decade has averaged about half that of Korea’s (12.5).The painful adjustment away from a manufacturing export led economy has required big changes in recent years, some of which driven by foreign management. The vanguard for revolution was Nissan, which formed an alliance with Renault in 1999, appointing Carlos Ghosn as chief operating officer. A 30 per cent weaker yen during the next two years amplified the effect of his restructuring efforts. Since then the surprise factor from foreign management changes has faded. Arguably, Japanese companies that do bring in senior foreign executives now only do so because of a large proportion of overseas revenue, such as Takeda Chemical, with about 57 per cent of sales.Rather than just appointing foreigners, the focus has rightly shifted to improving corporate governance overall. The Japanese Diet plans to amend the Companies Act this year, strongly encouraging the use of external directors and audit committees more typical of western companies. A new JPX-Nikkei 400 share index, comprising Japanese companies that combine higher returns on equity and good corporate governance, launched in January. A good start, but according to Nomura data only 24 of the constituent companies have a majority of external directors on their boards – examples include Hoya and Fast Retailing.Japanese corporates have begun to change but not due to foreign management per se. It’s not the hype but the type of management that will improve returns for investors.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
374;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-04-13T16:08:34Z;iShares chief scorns global listing plan for Chinese equities;;The head of iShares – the world’s top provider of exchange traded funds – has poured cold water on plans from MSCI and FTSE to include mainland Chinese equities on their global indices, which are tracked by trillions of dollars of assets.Mark Wiedman, iShares global chief and a member of BlackRock’s executive committee, told the Financial Times that without a significant opening of China’s capital account, adding Shanghai-listed shares – known as A shares – to widely followed indices would be effectively unworkable.“The index has to be executable for it to be effective for clients, and that is the big issue when people talk about A-share inclusion. Not until you have capital account liberalisation does it make any sense for our clients,” said Mr Wiedman. “A-share inclusion feels like [it is] not on the very near-term horizon.”MSCI last month launched a consultation with investors over its plans to include a small slice of mainland-listed shares in both its China index and its emerging markets index, which is tracked by funds worth about $1.5tn.At the time, MSCI highlighted “very significant developments” as Chinese regulators took steps to improve international access to domestic markets.However, Chinese equities remain largely off-limits to global investors, who can access them only through a quota system managed by mainland regulators.Although the total amount of foreign investment permitted under existing rules is more than $200bn, just $83bn worth of licences have been granted to date.Even so, New York-based MSCI hopes to begin A-share inclusion from May next year, although it has yet to make a final decision on whether to proceed. FTSE Group, MSCI’s British rival, also wants to add domestic Chinese shares to its global indices.Mr Wiedman is not the first to express doubts about China’s potential addition to global indices. Mark Mobius, chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets, has described the MSCI plan as a “very bad idea”.Mr Wiedman’s comments follow an initiative to provide mutual market connectivity the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, which has the potential to dramatically open up mainland markets.Chinese and Hong Kong regulators last week revealed plans to allow investors on both exchanges access to hundreds of stocks in each other’s markets, effectively adding a new, simpler route into mainland China for global investors. iShares’ flagship Asian product is an exchange-traded fund tracking China’s A50 index, which includes both direct exposure to Chinese assets and synthetic exposure through derivatives.At more than $8.5bn, the A50 ETF – known locally simply by the stock code “2823” – is the largest in Asia, and one of the most traded securities on the Hong Kong exchange.Mr Wiedman said that mutual market connectivity was unlikely to pose a serious threat to the A50 ETF’s success as it would still offer “simplicity and liquidity” for investors seeking China exposure, and that there were many unanswered questions about how the exchange link would work.Regulators hope to have the Hong Kong-Shanghai connection up and running in six months’ time.
375;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-04-11T16:32:18Z;Why buy Brics when you can have Mugs?;Emerging markets have been a huge disappointment;"Perhaps the most dangerous investment concept is the “no brainer”. Take emerging markets equities as an example. They should surely have much better returns than those in developed economies, as they mostly have better demographics with young, fast-growing populations; higher GDP growth; and they didn’t suffer the meltdown from the collapse of their banking systems that plagued the US and Europe.How to play this theme? Most would buy an actively-managed emerging markets equity fund. If you did so in the past few years you have almost certainly suffered disappointment.Over the past five years, the average return for the funds in the Investment Management Association’s Global Emerging Markets sector was 65.7 per cent. They underperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which rose by 69 per cent over the same period.Nothing new here, you might well think – the average active manager underperforms the benchmark, often owning so many shares that the fund becomes a “closet index tracker”, replicating the performance of the index but with the added drag of fees and dealing costs. Far from being a surprise, underperformance is a near-certainty.You could avoid it by investing in an index fund instead. Had you bought a fund that tracked the MSCI EM Index you would indeed have fared better over the past few years.But you would still have done significantly worse than if you had bought a fund that tracks a developed-world benchmark; the FTSE 100 is up by 102 per cent and the S&P 500 by 124 per cent over the same period. Faced with this experience, it must be tempting for investors to conclude that the assumption of superior returns from emerging markets is just plain wrong.But the peak of disappointment would be if you had bought into one of the most popular themes of emerging market investing over the past decade and put money into a Bric fund. The acronym Bric was coined by Jim O’Neill, then an economist at Goldman Sachs, in 2001 and stands for Brazil, Russia, India and China. It was supposed to identify the four economic powerhouses of the future, and plenty of passive and active products have been constructed and promoted around it.Surely few EM investments can have performed better than a Bric fund? Wrong again. Over the past five years, the MSCI Bric Index is up just 44 per cent, underperforming both emerging markets generally and developed markets such as the US and UK. Needless to say, the average Bric active fund has also underperformed the Bric Index too.A big reason for this disappointment lies in what makes up these indices. The largest companies, which dominate the EM Index, are Asian consumer electronics companies, Chinese banks and internet companies, phone companies and Russian energy companies. I would regard all of these companies as uninvestable. In the case of the banks in particular, their risk exposure is opaque. I wouldn’t invest in a bank in the UK, so what would possess anyone to trust the accounts of a Chinese bank? Yet the largest sector by far in the EM Index – representing over a quarter of it – is financials.The companies that I would regard as most investable are consumer staples. These represent just 8 per cent of the EM Index.Latest emerging markets news and commentSo it is no surprise to me that the EM Index, its tracker funds and the closet trackers among the active funds who secretly track it too have performed badly.Investing in an index of the Brics is a leap of faith for another reason. The Heritage Foundation, a US think-tank, publishes an annual report using a factor model, which attempts to rank countries in an Index of Economic Freedom.The index assesses how attractive they are for business and investment based on data on a series of factors including property rights, corruption, size of government, regulation, flexibility of labour and liberality of markets.Places such as Singapore, Switzerland and Hong Kong rank near the top. The highest-ranked Bric is Brazil at number 114 (out of 186), followed by India at 120, China at 137 and Russia down in 140th position.If you were willing to invest on the basis of a snappy acronym with no regard for the economic and political characteristics of the countries, perhaps you should have subscribed for a fund investing in a group of countries which each rank a little ahead of the Brics in terms of Economic Freedom. Forget the Mints or the Civets – how about Moldova (110), Uganda (91), Greece (119) and Suriname (130)? These I have christened the Mugs, a pretty good description of anyone who would invest on this basis.Terry Smith is chief executive of Fundsmith, which will launch an emerging markets investment trust later this year"
376;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-04-07T15:51:10Z;Nigeria: Size matters;Investors must balance the growth potential with economic stability;Bigger is better. And in Africa the biggest is now Nigeria after the government nearly doubledthe estimate of the country’s gross domestic product to $509bn. The jump comes due to a different reckoning of the size of its services sector, now more than half of output. Despite the lift, Nigeria’s per capita output (roughly $5,300) still sits at less than half of South Africa’s of $11,500 – in constant US dollar purchasing parity terms.Nigeria has revisited its base of calculation, from 1990 to 2010, which has given more weight to recently successful service sectors, such as banks. Investors in Nigeria’s stock market have focused on these sectors representing 70 per cent of the MSCI Nigeria index, itself up 57 per cent in dollar terms over the past three years. Emerging (down 9 per cent) and world (up 29 per cent) markets trail this gain by some margin. Note that Nigeria’s stock market is still less than a tenth that of South Africa’s in dollar terms.And yet doubts persist. Standard & Poor’s last month put the sovereign rating under negative watch and the GDP revision has not changed that view. Potential disruption ahead of nationwide elections next year has S&P concerned. Bank of America has noted the growing discount of the Nigerian naira versus the dollar on the black market (versus the interbank rate), now nearly 5 per cent from parity last summer.Yes, size matters to national pride but it is growth that investors admire. Estimated earnings growth for the MSCI constituents is in the low teens, supporting a price to forward earnings multiple of 10 times – the three-year average. However, given the new, higher base for GDP, investors could find that the growth rate necessarily slows. As with most frontier markets, the big issue for investors in Nigeria will be balancing the growth potential with economic stability.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
377;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-04-04T15:51:59Z;Stars in their eyes;Star fund managers are the galacticos of finance;Is there really such a phenomenon as a star fund manager, the financial equivalent of a creative or inspirational footballer who drives a team to new heights to produce sublime or outstanding performance?This question has grown in relevance in recent years as active long-only fund managers struggled to beat increasingly efficient markets and justify their fees. Technology and more readily available data have helped investors price in good and bad news themselves, while passive managers have cut their fees to the bone.Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, Bill Gross at Pimco, Neil Woodford at Invesco Perpetual and Anthony Bolton at Fidelity have all been given the star label at various times in their careers. But all of them have struggled at times to produce world-beating returns over the past few years.Mr Bolton, who retired this week after more than 30 years at Fidelity, is an example of a fund manager who produced outstanding returns of more than double his benchmark with investments in cheap, small companies at the height of his career in the UK. But he suffered when he tried the same formula in China, although his performance picked up last year and he left Fidelity with the China Special Situations trust well ahead of its benchmark.Mr Buffett has only performed in line with the market in the past 10 years, while Mr Woodford and Mr Gross have both suffered recent setbacks as their styles have not fitted the changing times.——————————————-Cult of the managerThe very idea that there is such an animal as a star manager, an exceptional person with the X-factor to produce top returns, is relatively new. Mr Buffett was one of the first to gain this special status back in the 1960s. The “star manager” concept then became popular with salespeople as a way to sell funds and products in boom years, just as Real Madrid uses galacticos such as Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale to help sell club merchandise.But for some, there is no such thing as a star fund manager, particularly in the wake of the extreme volatility after the crash of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Even the top investors are reluctant to label themselves as stars.Mr Bolton says: “I think performing well is more about working as a team and investing in something that you understand. It is not about one star person.”“You can beat the market if you invest for the long term. But it is much more competitive today than it was 30 years ago. Technology means everyone has the same information, so you need to offer something different.”Another investor attributed star status by some is Hugh Young, global head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management. He has produced consistently high returns in Asian equities from his Singapore base over the past 25 years.“I would love to lay claim to be a great star fund manager, but it is more complicated than that,” he says. “It is about the culture of the investment group, process and conviction rather than one person, and one bad year can pull down performance. The only thing a fund manager can guarantee is that they will have a bad year.”Financial advisers such as Patrick Connolly at Chase de Vere say successful active funds typically have a talented manager in charge, but producing consistently high or market-beating returns is down to a combination of factors.Interview: Mark Barnett has succeeded Neil Woodford as head of UK equities at Invesco PerpetualThese include the process involved in the build-up to a decision to buy or sell, and having the discipline to stick to that process. The culture of the firm is key, as it provides the environment and backdrop that enables individuals to flourish. Rigorous analysis and a long-term investment strategy, which must be adaptable to changes in the market, are also important. This often means the need for a strong back-up staff, sales team and research force.Finally, a decisive chief executive with a clear strategy should not be underestimated as one of the requirements for delivering top-notch returns.——————————————-Digging into performanceAnalysing the performance and styles of six managers widely regarded to have the X-factor, or star quality, provides some revealing insights.The six – Mr Bolton, Mr Buffett, Richard Buxton, who left Schroders for Old Mutual last year, Mr Gross, Mr Young and Mr Woodford, who departs Invesco to launch his own fund management group at the end of this month – have strong long-term track records.On the acid test of performance over 10 years (a time span deemed long enough to judge skill, as opposed to luck) Mr Buffett and Mr Young have only performed in line with the markets, while the others have comfortably outperformed, according to Morningstar data. But over 20 or more years, all six have easily beaten their benchmarks.The top performer was Mr Bolton, who delivered a 14.6 per cent annualised 10-year return between January 1998 and December 2007 for the Fidelity Special Situations Fund compared with his FTSE All Share benchmark, which delivered 6.2 per cent.He stepped down and then launched another special situations fund in China in April 2010. After a rocky start, the Chinese fund has delivered a cumulative return of 5.25 per cent compared with its MSCI China benchmark of -3.05 per cent, says Morningstar.Mr Buxton is the next best performer, delivering an annualised 10-year return of 11.1 per cent between 2003 and 2013 for Schroders, compared with the FTSE All Share’s 8.69 per cent. He has also delivered 16.56 per cent since joining Old Mutual in June, compared with the benchmark’s 11.8 per cent.——————————————-Style mattersMr Bolton and Mr Buxton, like their contemporaries, stress the importance of investing in companies that they understand. For this reason, the five equity investors have tended to shun technology companies with high valuations based on future performance.They also typically hold on to companies for a long time. Mr Buffett says the ideal length of time to hold on to a company is forever, a view Mr Woodford has backed at Invesco, holding BAE Systems off and on since he started managing money there in 1988.Stock preferences are usually solid blue-chips that produce everyday goods, such as Coca-Cola and Walmart in the case of Mr Buffett, or British American Tobacco and Reckitt Benckiser in the case of Mr Woodford.Mr Woodford and Mr Young are both considered safe or defensive investors, stressing that a company must have a solid balance sheet, generous dividend payments and strong growth prospects.Use the FT’s investment fund screener to search for funds by risk, performance and star ratingMr Buxton and Mr Bolton are more aggressive. Both place a lot of store on value as a guide to selection. They come from what Mr Buffett termed the “Graham-Doddsville” school of investing, which maintains it is essential to work out the intrinsic value of a stock before you buy it. This might explain their better performances, as value investors tend to outperform investors who place more emphasis on growth.Although not outright contrarians, who choose out-of-favour companies that are typically close to bankruptcy but with the potential for turning round, both Mr Buxton and Mr Bolton have often gone against the grain and taken bigger risks than their rivals. Mr Bolton has also done well as an investor in smaller companies, which have historically outperformed mid-caps and large-caps.This bottom-up value approach contrasts with the greater weight Mr Woodford puts on the macro environment. Some blame this for his underperformance in recent years as the economic landscape has changed in a world of quantitative easing and aggressive central bank intervention.Mr Gross, the odd one out of the six as a bond investor, has also arguably suffered in the so-called new normal environment. This week, it was revealed his Total Return bond fund was beaten by 94 per cent of other fund managers. Some say Mr Gross is a classical investor, who has pinned his reputation on his ability to make the right calls based on his macro view. A notable error was to sell Gilts four years ago, saying the market was “sitting on a bed of nitroglycerine” because of high public debt levels. Yields subsequently fell to record lows, as prices rose further. However, he has still outperformed over the longer term.——————————————-Size mattersFor Mr Woodford, though, some critics are more concerned about the size of his funds, which underperformed as they grew larger. Invesco’s High Income and Income funds, in effect the same fund, had £23bn under management at the end of last year. Both have underperformed the market in the past five years, a far cry from a close to 80 per cent outperformance at the end of 2004, when they were roughly a sixth of the size.Terry Smith, the multimillionaire businessman who launched his own asset manager, Fundsmith, in November 2010, says funds should not grow too big. More importantly, he says a fund should be concentrated with a maximum of 25 stocks, otherwise it is difficult to keep abreast of all your companies. The Invesco High Income Fund has 120 stocks. Many other funds have more than 100 stocks too, as managers like to diversify their portfolios.Mr Smith dismisses the diversification argument, repeating the view held by Mr Buffett, who says managers only need “ di-worsification” if they do not know what they are doing. Fundsmith has delivered cumulative returns of 64 per cent since its launch, compared with the 22.9 per cent by its benchmark the MSCI World Index.Others warn against using past performance as a guide to future returns.Tom Becket, chief investment officer at PSigma Investment Management, says: “There is no link to a manager’s ability to outperform in the future based on looking in the rear view mirror. Past performance can be totally misleading.”He says a manager should be judged on philosophy, such as whether they are a growth or value investor, process, whether they are disciplined enough to stick with their plan and strategy, and positioning, which involves adapting to the markets, either on the macro front or in terms of how different companies and sectors might perform as their industry changes or develops.Assessing whether a manager meets these criteria is not easy, prompting some highly successful active managers to advocate a passive approach. Mr Buffett recently revealed that his will advises his wife to invest her legacy in a tracker fund.Mr Smith agrees. “My advice to most people is to go passive. They are cheaper and offer better returns over the long run. There are certain managers who are stars, who do make a difference and do beat the market, but they are very, very rare indeed – and they are difficult to find. Forget the stars and go with the market.”——————————————-Stars of the futureWho are the current stars of fund management, the investors you would want in your fantasy fund management team?Looking at the tables for cumulative returns over the past five years, there is an array of talent on display.The equivalent of the star striker would be Ed Legget. He has delivered 353 per cent for the Standard Life UK Equity Unconstrained Fund in the UK All Companies sector. This is unsurpassed in any other sector in the UK market.Mark Slater’s MFM Slater Growth Fund, in second place in the UK All Companies sector, with 319 per cent is also eye-catching, putting him in a fantasy team, alongside Mr Legget.Samantha McLemore, who manages the Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Fund, has produced cumulative returns of 249 per cent to top the North American sector – a difficult area to outperform – while Adrian Bignell, who runs the Invesco Perpetual European Opportunities Fund, has delivered 237.4 per cent to finish in first place in Europe (excluding UK).Top ten fund management rankings for UK All Companies, North America, Europe (ex UK), Asia Pacific (ex Japan), Strategic BondThe Asian equities team that runs the Aberdeen Global Asian Smaller Companies Fund has topped the table with cumulative returns of 167 per cent.In the strategic bonds sector, Eric Holt has delivered cumulative returns of 158 per cent, putting him in first place as manager of the Royal London Sterling Extra Yield Bond Fund.However, while these fund managers would make the fantasy team after their current batch of results, investors should be aware that some of them may be highly ranked because of the extra level of risk they take.Patrick Connolly, financial planner at Chase de Vere, says: “The funds at the top of the tables tend to take more risk, which is fine if that is what an investor wants. But if you want a safer portfolio, you might want to look elsewhere.”Indeed, the ideal fantasy fund manager is perhaps not the striker, but the tireless midfielder or the rock-solid centre-back. They might not make the top 10 of the rankings, but they will make consistently good returns year in, year out.
378;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
379;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-03-31T05:00:48Z;Reports of death of EM are exaggerated;Volatility is par for the course with emerging markets;In the space of three years, emerging markets have seen a dramatic fall from grace. Once thought to be a key strategic asset class, favoured by many investors, now they are essentially persona non grata.As of mid-March, emerging market equity funds had experienced 21 straight weeks of outflows. Political turmoil in Turkey and Ukraine, coupled with devaluation by Argentina, has only added to investor angst.But to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the death of emerging markets have been exaggerated. True, there are concerns about the near-term outlook, but it is important to remember a few key facts.Volatility is par for the course when it comes to emerging markets. Many investors are being scared off by the recent volatility but it is not abnormal. In fact, it is more characteristic of emerging market investing than the unusually placid period of the past several years.Since 1995 the annualised volatility on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has been roughly 25 per cent, in contrast to about 15 per cent for the MSCI World Index of developed countries. However, the extraordinary monetary liquidity from the US Federal Reserve, and increasingly the Bank of Japan, has damped volatility as investors have been forced into riskier asset classes in their hunt for yield.According to World Bank estimates, massive asset purchase programmes from large, developed country central banks were responsible for 60 per cent of the capital flows into emerging market assets between 2009 and 2013. With quantitative easing now coming to an end, at least in the US, we are returning to a more normal environment.Emerging markets have a tendency to go through dramatic and often prolonged busts, but over the long term they have outperformed developed markets by an average of 1.5 per cent annually since 1950.Why? Much has been written about the emerging market growth story, but whether you buy into that or not, there is a more fundamental reason for emerging market outperformance: the higher volatility makes it a riskier asset class. Investors should be compensated for taking risk, and with emerging markets they have been over the long term.Because of the risk, they are not for everyone. For more conservative investors, emerging market assets, particularly stocks, should have only a small weight in a portfolio. Regardless of their relative value, for conservative investors the asset class is simply too volatile.However, for investors with sufficient risk tolerance, emerging markets can have some role to play. Allocations should be modest even for moderate or aggressive portfolios, but they provide some diversification – they still enjoy lower correlations to developed markets, although less so than in the past – and generally are additive.So what about the opposite argument, that this is a terrific time to buy emerging markets because they are so cheap? Equities are inexpensive, but not yet at the bargain basement prices that have marked previous lows.Emerging market stocks are trading at about 11 times earnings. This is below the long-term average, but they traded as low as 7 to 8 times trailing earnings back at the lows in 2008 and 1997-98.However, the recent indiscriminate selling has created some opportunities. While consumer discretionary, internet plays and particularly banks look expensive, anything linked to resources appears cheap. The challenge is that while there are some genuine bargains, investors need the flexibility to pick through the rubble.At some point in the next several years, emerging market assets are likely to come back into fashion. Many of the reasons investors were first drawn to the asset class still hold true. Developing countries are likely to grow faster over the long term, probably much faster than developed countries. On many metrics, from foreign exchange reserves to sovereign debt levels, developing countries have improved significantly, and in some cases, look better than many developed markets.To some extent the current challenges stem from lost opportunity. Many emerging markets failed to seize the window of opportunity afforded by loose central bank monetary conditions and institute necessary structural reforms. While a few have been trying lately – Mexico is a notable standout – many large developing countries from India to Brazil are still facing significant headwinds.The good news for investors is that many of the challenges described above are increasingly reflected in the price. In short, when it comes to emerging markets, investors should exercise caution, not abstinence.Russ Koesterich is global chief investment strategist at BlackRock
380;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-03-30T06:59:48Z;Don’t buy funds, buy fund houses;Investing in asset managers may provide better returns than other shares;"Canny investors have long wondered whether they should consign the fund industry’s ever-multiplying mounds of glossy marketing material to the bin, and simply invest in the shares of asset managers instead.Research by a small UK-based fund house may have gone some way to answering this question for good.Figures collated by Guinness Asset Management show that, since 1990, an equally weighted portfolio of global asset management stocks has returned 17.9 per cent a year, amounting to a healthy 5,053 per cent in aggregate. This comfortably beats the 6.5 per cent (356 per cent in total) mustered by the MSCI World index, which in turn will have outperformed virtually every equity fund.Cynics will rightly point out that the 1990s was a decade of extraordinarily strong market returns; asset managers, as geared plays on the market, could hardly go wrong.But even in the period since 2000, an era pockmarked by two nasty stock market crashes, asset managers have soared above the fray, returning 9.1 per cent a year, compared with the 5 per cent of the MSCI World index.Asset managers outperformed the MSCI in 20 of the 24 calendar years between 1990 and 2013, as well as trumping the MSCI World Financials index in 16 of the 18 years since the latter’s creation in 1996.But the asset management sector has proved more volatile than the wider market, with quarterly volatility of 13.2 per cent since 1990, against 8.6 per cent for equities at large. Moreover the sector’s beta has averaged out at 1.35, meaning it typically rises (or falls) 35 per cent more than the underlying market.However, using perhaps more meaningful measures of risk, investors may not have had to take a particularly large gamble at all in order to achieve these outsize returns.Following the 2000 stock market crash, the asset management sector suffered a maximum drawdown (peak to trough fall) of 42.9 per cent, compared with the 46.2 per cent of the MSCI World. It returned to its previous peak within 12 quarters, half the time it took the wider market to recover.The maximum drawdown was admittedly a little higher after the 2007 market crash (55.8 per cent versus 48.4 per cent for the wider market), but asset managers still returned to their previous peak a fraction faster.“On a rolling three-year period, we cannot find a period where the asset management sector underperformed equities,” says Will Riley, co-manager of the Guinness Global Money Managers fund, set up to exploit this apparent anomaly.“That is something that quite surprises people. I think people have this idea in their mind that it is a fair-weather sector.”And while it is early days, the concept of investing in the industry’s shares also appears to work in practice.The Global Money Managers fund – believed to be the only vehicle of its kind worldwide, although there are a number of broader “financials” funds – endured a poor launch year in 2011, losing 18.7 per cent.But in 2012 it came first out of 234 funds in the IMA Global fund sector, and in 2013 it was third out of 245. Despite its difficult first year, it is third out of 215 funds in the sector during the first three years of its life, returning 64.7 per cent, compared with the 41 per cent of the MSCI World.The fund has proved a little more volatile than the market at large, but its Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, is 0.55, compared with 0.31 for the MSCI World.Star performers have included Polar Capital, which delivered a total return of 313 per cent during 2011-13, Azimut (238 per cent), Liontrust (217 per cent), Affiliated Managers Group (119 per cent) and Waddell & Reed (106 per cent), although Artio Global Investors did its best to upset the apple cart, slumping 80 per cent before being rescued by Aberdeen Asset Management in May 2013.But is there a logical reason to believe any sector can consistently outperform the wider market? In the case of asset managers, Mr Riley and Tim Guinness, founder and chief investment officer of Guinness AM and co-manager of the fund, believe so.First, they point to the industry’s unusually high returns on capital, partly a reflection of its ability to scale up with relatively little additional investment. According to Guinness, asset managers with a market capitalisation above $500m enjoyed a median cash flow return on investment of 16.7 per cent a year between 1991 and 2013, compared with 7.6 per cent for the market as a whole.The duo also argue that asset management, like the luxury goods sector, is a “special” industry that can grow at a higher rate than the global economy for multiple decades.Since 1990, rising household wealth has seen the industry’s assets under management rise by 700 per cent, dwarfing the 150 per cent return on global equities.“The amount of private wealth is going from one times gross domestic product to four or five times over a 70 to 80-year period,” says Mr Guinness, who argues such an asset pile is needed to fund retirements.“Absent a war or two, it will carry on growing. [Investing in the asset management industry] is like putting your canoe in the fastest-moving part of the stream,” adds Mr Guinness, who previously built the £13bn AUM Guinness Flight Hambro business, bought by Investec in 1998.The managers also point to the asset management industry’s ability to raise revenues without adding new customers when equity markets rise (although this is a negative when markets fall).And despite its strong run, the sector does not appear to be unduly expensive, trading on 14.2 times consensus 2014 earnings forecasts, a fraction below the 14.6 times of the S&P 500 index.Tom Brown, global head of investment management at KPMG, the professional services firm, is unsurprised by the findings. He says “the profitability and share prices of fund managers will outperform the funds themselves in a rising market”, as asset-based revenues increase faster than the relatively fixed cost base of a business.Rob Mellor, asset management partner at PwC, the consultancy, says some people did invest in asset managers as a proxy for their funds, particularly where funds may be closed to new investors.But he cautions that the industry faced a “battle” to maintain its current level of profitability, given the incursions by low-cost passive funds. Despite this, he believes asset managers should be able to increase their market share at the expense of competitors such as insurance companies.The Guinness fund remains small, but with a three-year record under their belts, the managers are keen to begin marketing it in earnest. However, one obvious downside remains.Given the equal-weighted nature of the fund, and its specialist remit, Mr Riley and Mr Guinness believe they can only run a maximum of $250m in the strategy, a tiny fraction of the sum invested in funds worldwide.Moreover, investors cannot sidestep this limit by investing in Guinness itself, as it remains owned by Mr Guinness and his staff."

382;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-03-12T11:58:13Z;MSCI eyes listing of China A-shares next year;;MSCI hopes to include Chinese A-shares in its flagship emerging markets index as early as next year, the latest sign of the increasing openness of mainland markets to global investors.The New York-based index provider has launched a consultation on the inclusion of A-shares – which are listed in mainland China and denominated in renminbi – in its emerging markets index from May 2015. Such a move would come much earlier than many analysts had been expecting.The proposed addition of mainland-listed equities to the index, which is tracked by international funds worth about $1.5tn, follows wide-ranging moves by Chinese authorities to increase overseas participation in its markets.Although access to onshore equity and bond markets is still controlled by a quota system, mainland regulators have loosened restrictions on what foreigners can buy once granted a licence, and promised to speed up the waiting times for those hoping to invest.The amount of quota available under current regulations stands at $216bn, roughly 7-8 per cent of the market capitalisation of the Shanghai equity market. However, so far only $82bn of that total has actually been allocated to investors, something MSCI is confident will change.“We think there have been very significant developments, and the regulators continue to open up the market,” said Chin Ping Chia, MSCI’s head of index research for Asia. “It’s important for us to reflect our assessment.”The initial step put forward by MSCI would lead to A-shares accounting for just 0.6 per cent of the emerging markets index. By comparison, Indonesia makes up 2.4 per cent of the index, and Thailand 2.6 per cent – both markets far smaller than China.The MSCI road map includes a scenario where China’s portion of the index rises to as much as 10.2 per cent, although that would require the total abolition of the current investment restrictions and a full liberalisation of the capital account – both still distant prospects.The proposals would also result in a drastic overhaul of the MSCI China index, which would have its constituents increased from 136 to 385.Emerging markets: News and comment from more than 40 emerging economiesMark Makepeace, FTSE chief executive, told the Financial Times that investors needed to be making concrete plans for how to manage China’s inclusion in index products in the coming years.Analysts said the move was positive for the Chinese market, but would have limited short-term effects.“The inclusion points to a positive direction for A-share internationalisation and the promotion of the China capital markets globally,” wrote Ben Bei, China equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in a report. “However, we expect the real tangible impact to A-shares may be muted at the initial stage due to the subdued weight proposed.”MSCI will now seek the opinions of investors, with a view to making a final decision on the proposals in June.
383;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-03-11T14:39:59Z;Investing in Iran: not such a far frontier;;"Last week this blog looked at the investment case for Iraq under the headline: “A frontier too far?” So we were struck by a new report today on neighbouring Iran with the opening line: “Iran is beyond the final frontier for portfolio investors.”One can quibble about which frontier is further but in truth investment in Iran is not so outlandish. The nuclear deal struck between Iran and several world powers in November prompted a renewed look at the investment case for Iran, as has been the case for other markets that have come in from the cold after international isolation, most recently Burma. But in fact, even in isolation, Iran’s capital markets have grown just fine.Tuesday’s report from Renaissance Capital’s main visionary thinker Charles Robertson follows a research visit there that led him to believe Iran will become investable, at least to frontier funds, within the next six to 18 months. This is a country, Robertson says, whose well-educated 78m-strong population is roughly the same size as Turkey’s, “with official per capita GDP of around $5,600, but which feels to us like $8,000-10,000. Tehran feels like Ankara did in 2004.”Iran not only has a broad manufacturing base but 9 per cent of the world’s oil reserves (the Iranian & Foreign Joint Venture Investment Association reckons 11 per cent) and a large current account surplus. “Most interesting of all, there is a dynamic reform team now in charge of the government and central bank, which is undertaking the classic monetary and fiscal reforms EM investors usually like. This looks to us like a potential re-rating play that could – in an investable scenario – attract those investors who have recently invested in Saudi Arabia, like those who invested in Turkey after 2001 and Russia since the 1990s.”When it does become investable – which will involve a combination of the removal of US sanctions and a growth in investor confidence around repatriation of funds – investors will find a mature market waiting for them. The market cap of the country’s stock markets at $170bn is, as Robertson says, similar to Poland’s, following privatisations over the past decade. The free float is around $30bn, more than the MSCI free floats of Kuwait and Nigeria, so if it were to enter the MSCI frontier index, it would account for about a quarter of it if all companies qualified for inclusion. Its daily trading volumes of around $150m are about five times those of Nigeria last year, Robertson says.Others point to Iran’s favourable location between the Middle East, Asia and Europe, a staging point for the growing Central Asia/Caucuses region of 300m people and a lot of natural resources.So, what’s the case against? First, there’s getting access in the first place. Robertson says there is a consensus in Iran that a deal on sanctions will take place with the US, possibly even later this year.Once in, investors will not find everything to their liking: Robertson compares the banking sector to Russia’s in the 1990s. “We doubt the official NPL ratio of around 18 per cent is telling us the whole story.” The bond market is somewhat weird, with securities able to be sold back to the guaranteeing bank at any time and trading, if trading is the right word, at par. And many companies are owned by quasi-government funds or the Revolutionary Guard.There are ethical questions around treatment of women, attitudes to Israel and general human rights – though there is a strong case to be made that Iran does better than Saudi Arabia on at least two of these metrics – and questions about the environment for legal redress, through there is new investment legislation in place intended to protect foreigners. A natural question arises about safety but many who go there frequently report no problem.Some are in there already. Canton Hermidas Private Equity has launched a technology start-up private equity fund for Iran. Swicorp, a private equity and investment banking group headquartered in Switzerland, launched an open ended private equity fund focused on Iran, Algeria and Sudan back in 2005.There are many steps to take before Iran can be considered fully linked back into the global economy and its portfolio flows, but when those steps are taken, investment in Iran is not going to look any more peculiar than many other countries that today receive frontier funds. As Robertson says, “if the situation with sanctions is resolved, it could be a serious market to consider in the coming years.”Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

384;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-03-10T19:31:09Z;EM consumer stocks hit as retail dream fades;Impact of higher interest rates set to be protracted;The emerging market consumer, so the narrative went, would dazzle the global investor as they indulged their retail dreams, buying everything from designer T-shirts in Brazil to convenience store goods in Russia and cars in China made by a company known as BYD, which stands for “Build Your Dreams”.Investors who rode such aspirations have seen stellar returns. The MSCI Emerging Markets Consumer Discretionary index, which aggregates the share prices of leading EM consumer companies, has risen 250 per cent since its 2009 trough. By contrast, the broader MSCI emerging markets index has risen only 69.61 per cent in the same period.Now, however, one of the most successful investor narratives since the 2008 financial crisis is coming back down to earth, according to consumer surveys in several emerging markets, investment bank analysts and some fund managers.“There isn’t much fundamental reason in the near term to be optimistic about consumer spending in emerging markets,” says David Lubin, head of emerging markets economics at Citi.A spreading dynamic, Mr Lubin says, is responsible for the more sober outlook. Central banks have hiked interest rates to defend their depreciating currencies, reducing the willingness of consumers to borrow to buy consumer goods. That, in turn, has hit consumer stocks.Michael Power, strategist at Investec Asset Management, says the impact of higher interest rates is likely to be most pronounced and protracted in countries that run current account deficits and are vulnerable to the slacker global demand for commodities that is flowing from China’s economic slowdown.These countries include Brazil and Turkey, which have seen their respective consumer stock indices fall 6.4 per cent and 12.3 per cent so far this year. “In Turkey consumer credit growth seems poised for a very sharp slowdown in the wake of the January rate hike,” says Mr Lubin.South Africa, which also falls into this category, has performed somewhat better – with its consumer stocks rising 5.4 per cent – partly because the rebound in the rand’s value against the dollar has helped shore up sentiment.Russia, where the consumer stock index has fallen 26.6 per cent so far this year, is the worst EM performer. Investor sentiment has, of course, been rattled by geopolitical nervousness over the future of Ukraine, but economic issues are also contributing to the sell-off in Russian equities. A sharp hike in interest rates to defend the rouble is seen as likely to hit consumer spending in coming weeks, fund managers say.Indonesia, which runs a current account deficit and has exposure to the Chinese economy, has bucked the trend this year, with its consumer goods index rising 14.2 per cent so far this year. One reason, analysts say, is that its central bank – encouraged by an improving current account picture – has held rates steady this year.According to survey of consumers in Indonesia by Asean Confidential, a research service at the Financial Times, consumer sentiment in Indonesia is holding up. Asean Confidential’s discretionary spending index for Indonesia went to 88.3 in February, up from 87.9 in December – marking a break with the wider Asean region, which saw a slight easing in consumer sentiment. Malaysia and Thailand look particularly reluctant to maintain the high pitch of credit-fuelled spending of the past few years.China, too, shows signs of slowing consumer credit absorption. A China Confidential survey showed a fall in its future discretionary spending index in February to 74.8, down from 75.5 in January, signifying a moderation in spending plans. The consumer borrowing index also eased to 72.5 in February from 75.9 in January, suggesting households are increasingly cautious over consumer credit.This may account for some of the souring sentiment around Chinese car companies, many of which are among the poorest performing stocks in the MSCI consumer index this year. Geely cars is down 27 per cent and Great Wall cars is down 23 per cent.Fiona Manning, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, urges caution in looking ahead. “Investors now seem much less focused on fundamentals and more on newsflow, and they are really quite nervous,” she says.In her view the emerging consumer story is a long-range, structural shift, which is not going to be thrown off course by cyclical issues that the market is currently encountering.
385;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-03-02T03:41:20Z;Shareholders beware when the majority stakes are high;Companies controlled by one large shareholder can be risky investments;"Minority investors in Essar Energy, an India-focused but London-listed oil refiner and power generator, have had a crash course in corporate governance in recent weeks.With shares in the one-time FTSE 100 company down 84 per cent from their April 2010 flotation price, several minority shareholders criticised the perceived stinginess of a bid by Essar Global Fund Limited, the investment fund of the billionaire Ruia family, for the 22 per cent of the company it does not own.David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, Essar’s third-largest institutional shareholder, described the move as “cynical opportunism“ and “a calculated attempt to deprive minority shareholders of the substantial future upside in Essar Energy’s valuation”.An independent committee appointed by Essar Energy last week rejected the bid, which it said “clearly undervalues the company”.But if the saga does end in tears, how much responsibility should sophisticated institutional investors take for their own plight? After all, they freely chose to invest in a company they knew was controlled by a powerful majority shareholder. Should caveat emptor not apply?The travails of Essar Energy are not unique. Investors have in the recent past also had their fingers burnt by Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation– which was taken private by Kazakh investors with a majority stake even after their bid was rejected as too low by independent directors – and Bumi, two other London-listed companies with powerful family shareholders.“It is caveat emptor,” says David Lis, head of equities at Aviva Investors. “You go into these things with your eyes open. We didn’t think [Essar] was investable. The governance standards did not pass our tests.”Yet few institutional investors are willing to enforce a blanket boycott on companies with overpowering owners.Research conducted by S&P Capital IQ for FTfm provides ammunition for those who might take either side of this argument.S&P’s database contains almost 8,000 listed companies globally where a single investor holds more than 50 per cent of the stock.The median of such stock has significantly underperformed markets at large, returning 3 per cent over the past year, against 18.4 per cent for the MSCI World Index; -5.4 per cent over three years, compared with a gain of 25.1 per cent for the MSCI; and 60 per cent over five years, about half of the 116.2 per cent of the MSCI.However, the mean performance of majority-owned companies, which can be distorted by outsize gains by a handful of erstwhile penny stocks, has outstripped that of the MSCI index over each of these time periods.Stripping out stocks with a share price below $1, the mean return once again undershoots that of the wider market, at least over three and five years, at 13.6 per cent and 99.1 per cent respectively.A more liberal interpretation of “family-owned” appears to deliver clearer results. SYZ Asset Management, a division of SYZ, the Swiss banking group, operates a successful investment strategy targeting companies where the founding family retains a significant stake.According to SYZ’s data, a basket of the 174 Euro Stoxx 600 companies in which a family or family foundation retained at least a 20 per cent stake returned 352 per cent between 2003 and 2013, against 106 per cent for the Euro Stoxx 600 itself. A similar trend also appears to be at play in the US.Eric Bendahan, European equities fund manager at SYZ, attributes this to the ability of managers to take a long-term view, rather than chasing short-term returns, safe in the knowledge that their largest shareholder is in it for the long haul.Mr Lis concurs. “Family-owned businesses can and often do take longer-term views. It is not necessarily a disadvantage to be a minority shareholder. In Europe it is fairly common to have companies dominated by families and they do make good investments as a whole.”Mr Lis cites the Daily Mail and General Trust, more than 20 per cent owned by the Harmsworth family, and Progressive Digital Media, two-thirds owned by founder Mike Danson, who previously built Datamonitor, the market research group, as successful examples. Mr Lis believes “there is a strong enough independent director presence on the board” at these companies.But Mr Bendahan, who owned a stake in Essar in the past, but no longer does, adds: “Interestingly the only region where [investment in family-owned companies] does not work is Asia, so maybe Essar Energy qualifies more as an Asian company.”This point may be relevant.“The problem is with the ENRCs and Essars of this world, because their governance standards are different,” says Mr Lis. “If they are going to have a quote on the London market, [it should be a case of] when in Rome do as the Romans do. They should conform to best practice in corporate governance, particularly companies with a majority shareholder.”While active fund managers have the power to sidestep companies with dubious owners and ropey corporate governance, passive funds have no choice but to hold such stocks if they are a constituent of the index they track.David Patt, corporate governance analyst at Legal & General Investment Management, a large manager of passive funds, says he is not “dead against” companies with a majority shareholder listing in markets such as the UK, as some may turn out to be high-quality companies.But Mr Patt says LGIM has “concerns that there is not a lot of protection for shareholders”, when things go wrong.To help address these concerns, LGIM is pushing the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority to introduce a “mandatory relationship agreement”, which would impose “standard behaviour” and enable minority shareholders to take action if a controlling shareholder was not acting in their best interests.LGIM also wants the FCA to enhance the voting power of minorities where a controlling shareholder wants to cancel a premium listing and to introduce measures to improve the disclosure of related party transactions.LGIM, like other passive managers, could of course create bespoke indices that strip out majority-owned companies from their underlying index, and track these instead.Mr Patt says it does customise its products for large investors but he says not a single investor has yet asked for a product free from majority-owned companies."
386;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-02-26T16:19:14Z;Stocks join in Europe’s periphery revival;;Recovering bond markets in the eurozone’s periphery nations have been much hailed in the past year. Far less remarked upon – yet equally remarkable – has been the robust equity market performance of countries such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Italy.At the height of the eurozone crisis, yields on peripheral nations’ government bonds, which move inversely to prices, soared on fears of Europe’s monetary union breaking up. Greece’s 10-year bond yields peaked at more than 28 per cent in 2012 but have now fallen to 7.23 per cent. Similar Irish bonds, which peaked at 14 per cent, are now at 3.15 per cent.In the past year, however, periphery equity markets have also made striking progress. While the MSCI Europe index has risen over the past year by 14.5 per cent, on a total return basis, the MSCI index for Ireland is up by 48.2 per cent, Greece is up 38 per cent, Spain by 31.4 per cent and Italy by 27.3 per cent. Portugal is the only laggard, having risen by just 8.7 per cent.Andrew Parry, chief executive of Hermes Sourcecap, says this equity market recovery, which shows there has been a dramatic shift in sentiment towards the peripheral countries, started with the recovery in bond markets, which allowed the equity risk premium to fall.Analysts also agree a key factor behind the rally has been the decrease in concerns about macroeconomic risk since Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, pledged in July 2012 to do “ whatever it takes” to save the euro.A more recent spur to share prices has been increasing confidence about growing economic momentum in many parts of Europe.Stephanie Flanders, chief market strategist for UK and Europe at JPMorgan Asset Management, says it is early days yet for the eurozone recovery: unemployment is still high and business lending continues to contract.“But there is, now, some good news coming from crisis economies as well as countries like Germany, where growth is more established,” she says.“The numbers coming out of Spain, for example, have been consistently surprising on the upside. Ireland is also doing well. And in Greece, the January PMI [purchasing managers’ index] survey hit the 50 level associated with economic expansion for the first time in more than four years.”Mr Parry says all of the past year’s growth in European shares markets came from a re-rating of prospects by investors: there was no earnings growth, it was very much based on optimism.“But we are now beginning to see some of the PMIs and consumer confidence surveys confirm that there is a recovery,” he says. “The question is: how much of a recovery?”Eurozone growth this year is currently forecast by the European Commission at 1.2 per cent. Analysts says that though this is welcome after several years of recession, such recoveries normally involve growth of 3 to 4 per cent – so 1 to 1.5 per cent is anaemic by comparison.Mr Parry says: “The silver lining of austerity is it forces change on countries and companies – Ireland and Spain have both substantially decreased their unit labour costs, and even France is being forced to address these issues.”Nothing better shows the turnround in sentiment towards the peripheral countries than the fact that during January’s sell-off in shares, countries such as Spain and Portugal were the defensive stocks – with shares from “core” countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands showing bigger falls.Kerry Craig, global market strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management, says: “One reason that core countries may have suffered more is because big companies such as German exporters were seen as more exposed to emerging market turmoil and possible slower Chinese growth.”Mr Parry remains generally upbeat about the outlook for European shares. “As compared with cash, bonds and the US stock market, Europe still looks attractively priced,” he says. “ So investing in Europe is still the default option for many fund mangers: where else do you invest your money?”Mr Craig believes European shares are now in line with their average valuation since 1999 based on forward price to earnings ratios – “not expensive, probably close to fair value”.However, Mr Parry is sceptical about some valuations, given how much recovery has already been priced in by investors.“Absolute values are now looking quite high, so it will be more important to focus on the strength and weaknesses of individual companies,” he says. “As we go into 2014, investors will have to be selective: this is not going to be a recovery that will float all boats.”
387;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-02-25T16:40:23Z;Are frontier markets overvalued?;;"The fondness felt by investors towards frontier markets has not dissipated since turmoil struck their emerging market cousins in October last year. In fact, feelings have climbed to a new pitch of devotion.But the chart below raises an obvious question – has the ardour been overdone? Only rarely in the recent past have FM equity valuations traded at such a generous premium to EM counterparts.FM equities are trading at an average price earnings ratio of 13.6 times and a price to book ratio of 1.8 times, representing a premium of 18 per cent and 28 per cent respectively to valuations on EM markets, according to MSCI. All ratios are calculated on a trailing basis, using company earnings over the latest available 12 month period.The 26 markets in the MSCI frontier index have often traded at a discount to those in the MSCI emerging index, reflecting the view that economies at the extremities of global capitalism are likely to be more risky and more vulnerable to sudden reversals than the more established EM asset class.However, during the EM turmoil since October last year, the outlier status of FM markets was parlayed into a virtue. Sequestered by their remoteness from the tides of international liquidity, FM economies are also seen as less vulnerable to the withdrawal of liquidity as central banks around the world unwind their monetary stimulus programmes.But Andrew Howell at Citi Global Markets in New York is worried that if a sharp FM correction was to occur, investors could face difficulty selling their holdings.“If I look through the ranks of widely-held stocks by FM funds — the likes of Bank of Georgia, or Nostrum Oil & Gas, or Nigerian Breweries — I am struck at how illiquid they still are,” Howell said.“To illustrate my point: those three stocks combined trade less in a day than Sberbank’s GDR trades in 10 minutes. That’s not a major problem now, with flows still trickling in… but if there is a move to the exit, that door will suddenly feel very small.”There are grounds, however, to think that the FM rally may not have run its course. For one thing, countries in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), especially the UAE and Qatar – which are due to graduate from the FM to the EM index later this year – are performing strongly, driving up the aggregate valuation of FM equities (see chart).Nick Wilson, Chairman of the London-listed Qatar Investment Fund, noted that Qatari government spending is set to increase 11.6 per cent in 2014 as the government boosts infrastructure upgrades ahead of the 2022 Fifa World Cup. He says this helps make Qatar attractive relative to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, partly because Qatar’s stock market is trading at 11.6 times prospective earnings compared to 16 times for Kuwait and 14.5 for Saudi Arabia.Vietnam and Bangladesh are other frontier markets which have seen significant stock price surges backed by generally improving economic prospects.On the other hand, the news from several key frontier markets has been turning steadily more negative. Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan last week suspended the internationally respected central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, creating grave concerns among investors over the trajectory of governance.Ukraine is poised in the uncertain aftermath of a revolution. Argentina’s peso is down 22 per cent this year on the back of capital flight, rampant inflation and adverse reactions to the country’s economic fragility. Kazakhstan devalued its currency by 18 per cent this year and the Ghanaian cedi is also sharply lower. Venezuela appears to be slipping deeper into financial distress as its currency, the bolívar, trades at 87.7 on the black market, nearly 14 times the official rate.Back to beyondbricsRelated reading:

388;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Qatar stocks: IQ test;Foreign inflows head for Gulf state, so hello, Industries Qatar;Half a percentage point does not, on its own, sound like very much. But it is how many investors will look at Qatar’s stock market this year. The question is whether (as with many things about the small, but awfully rich Gulf state) there is something here punching above weight.In this instance – 0.5 per cent of the one trillion US dollar value MSCI Emerging Markets index. Qatar, which has 2m inhabitants, is joining this index in May. Thus the stock market should see about $5bn inflows, if anticipated. Incidentally, the Philippines – population 97m – gets a 1 per cent weighting.So Qatar is looking bigger than it might appear in terms of potential foreign money flowing in. But what kind of company will greet the inflow? The paradigmatic Qatari investments are real estate and banks, given the construction boom that will greet the 2022 World Cup.But investors might also ponder Industries Qatar. It will be hard to miss: the conglomerate is the biggest member of the domestic index. Joint ventures in petrochemicals and fertilisers, plus a fully owned steel operation – all relatively cheap to make with Qatar’s natural gas – have helped the shares return 300 per cent in the past half decade, in Qatari riyal terms. The local real estate index managed 150 per cent.Cash returns loom large here: QAR28bn ($7.7bn) returned since listing in 2003. Not to mention QAR6.7bn that should follow in a generous dividend pay out on net profits last year of QAR8bn. This is despite a tough year for pricing in global fertiliser markets, as results showed on Monday.Isn’t all that punching above weight? Definitely. Just note IQ’s majority owner – the Qatari state. Small but active Qatar isn’t shy of using its investments as part of its building of regional influence. All this should benefit the political weighting of one’s investment, too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
389;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Investors warned over real estate risks;;Real estate investors are pouring into property assets around the world but do not properly understand the risks of doing so, according to new research.Investors in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia do not have sufficiently strong risk management procedures and have not integrated their real estate teams into their wider asset allocation systems, the report by property data specialists IPD/MSCI found.Investors do not appreciate the complexity of real estate as an asset class or the limitations of available performance benchmarking data, while many of those who do attempt to measure the performance of their property investments are using the wrong benchmarking comparisons, according to the report.In particular, many investors do not fully understand the diversity of real estate assets and the changing nature of risk in the sector through the property cycle.Peter Hobbs, IPD managing director, said: “The risk people don’t understand real estate and the real estate people don’t understand quantitative [risk] models. At the multi-asset level, real estate needs to be linked up on a par with other asset classes.”The problem is escalating as real estate becomes increasingly popular among investors searching for higher yields than bonds and less volatility than equities. “Money is pouring in, [investors] are allocating more of their portfolio to real estate, and [risk] is becoming a big issue,” Mr Hobbs said.The demand for property assets is pushing investors into riskier behaviour, he added – particularly by putting money into development because of a shortage of already-built assets to buy.Roger Urwin, global head of investment content at risk management consultancy Towers Watson, said: “The investment world has begun to take up investment into real estate, but hasn’t yet got the governance processes in place to do it well. At the board level there isn’t sufficient clarity about real estate assets’ contribution to the overall risk mix.”The investment world has begun to take up investment into real estate, but hasn’t yet got the governance processes in place to do it wellTwo groups of investors in particular are running greater risks than they realise, Mr Hobbs said. The first are new entrants to the property market from Asia and the Middle East who are eager to spend and do not have a sufficiently sophisticated understanding of property markets around the world.The second group of investors at risk are large, sophisticated companies that believe they are correctly assessing risk but are using the wrong models and comparisons to do so, Mr Hobbs said. In particular, US-based investors are using domestically focused benchmarking data to assess their performance, despite a substantial proportion of their investments now being overseas. Canadian and Nordic investors are making the same mistake, the report found.In total about 80 per cent of those surveyed by IPD/MSCI are using misaligned benchmarks.
390;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-02-06T14:37:26Z;KKR earnings surge on IPOs;;KKR declared its highest annual dividend on soaring fourth-quarter earnings, as the New York-based private equity group continued to diversify away from its core buyout operations and expand its credit, property and other businesses.KKR’s dividend of $1.40 per unit came after it more than doubled its net economic income to $790m and reported a 25 per cent increase in assets under management to $94.3bn for the last quarter of 2013.The results reflected the surge in equity markets. The fortunes of the private groups have also been lifted by the constraints federal and global regulators have imposed on banks in the wake of the global financial crisis.KKR closed its latest North American buyout fund with $9bn under management. In addition, it finished fundraising for a $1.5bn real estate fund for North America and a new $2bn global special situations fund which will provide rescue finance to cash-strapped companies around the world and will also invest in distressed debt.The big listed private equity groups are beginning to pursue differentiated strategies. KKR has been using its balance sheet more aggressively than many peers as it develops new business lines and builds a record before raising money from investors.It sold out of Dollar General, the retail chain on which it made five times its money, and continues to sell down holdings of companies such as HCA and Nielsen. However, some of its most lucrative exits, such as its sale of Oriental Brewery, will not show up until later this year when the deal closes.But the appreciation of its portfolio, up 20.5 per cent for the year, was less than the 27 per cent rise in the MSCI global index, to which it compares its results. Still, for the last quarter, KKR’s portfolio rose 8.4 per cent, while the index rose a slightly more modest 8.1 per cent.KKR’s return on equity in 2013 was 27.4 per cent. By contrast Goldman Sachs’ return on equity last year was just 11 per cent, in part because of new regulatory limits. Virtually none of KKR’s peers calculate return on equity.On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), KKR’s income rose to $277.9m for the quarter from $96.7m for the year ago period. ENI, the favoured earnings metric of the large listed private equity groups, excludes certain costs associated with listing and other technical factors.KKR, like many of its rivals, took advantage of buoyant equity markets to list and do secondary sales of many of its portfolio companies. KKR invested $8bn in private markets over the year and returned $9bn to its investors, with $3bn of that in the last quarter as KKR further sold down stakes in companies including Dollar General and HCA.
391;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Turkish banks: how safe are they, really?;;"Turkey’s banks are having a bad time. The sector’s 16-bank MSCI index fell by as much as 15 per cent during the past month, hitting a price-to-book ratio of less than 1 for the first time in five years.Perhaps that isn’t surprising given that higher interest rates, slower growth and a cheaper lira are likely to persist, while credit expansion won’t sustain its rapid pace of the past decade. In 2013 alone the volume of loans rose by just shy of 30 per cent and the ratio of banks’ loans to deposits currently stands at 107.7 per cent, after breaching the 100 per cent level in 2013 for the first time in at least a decade.So, how well prepared is the financial system for the end of a world of easy money and abundant capital inflows?In its latest Financial Stability Report, the IMF labelled Turkey as the most vulnerable emerging market both domestically, because of this high credit growth, and externally due to its large current account deficit.Both credit growth and the current account deficit have been funded by hot money from abroad. The majority of Turkey’s short term external debt, which is debt that matures within the next year, is concentrated in the banking system – $96bn, out of just under $165bn.However, thanks in part to the reserve option mechanism, a government policy that allows banks to hold some of their required reserves in foreign exchange or gold rather than the Turkish lira, the banks are reasonably well-hedged against depreciation. In total the banking sector holds dollar reserves of $33.7bn under the scheme, according to figures released by the central bank just over a month ago.And the banks have managed to spread repayments on this debt, so they may avoid having to refinance during a particularly bad period for the currency. As Janine Dow, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, puts it, much of their syndicated funding, especially from European banks, is relationship borrowing and these relationships are quite strong.The main risk on the funding side isn’t that liquidity dries up but that a combination of a cheaper lira and higher interest rates – with banks now having to borrow from the central bank at 10 per cent – will lower the banks’ margins on interest and hit profits.“The banks are good at passing on increased funding costs to borrowers,” says Dow, “but there’s a time-lag. Deposits in Turkey are expensive and competition for them is fierce. So retail and wholesale deposit rates will go up but much of this lending is fixed rate. The repricing time lag varies from bank to bank, but could extend up to between 5 to 7 months.”Things are less clear-cut on the borrowing side. Currently the rate of non-performing loans (NPLs) is apparently low at just 2.66 per cent. But as banks pass on their increased costs and lower economic growth constrains borrowers’ ability to pay, the rate of NPLs will almost certainly increase. Moody’s Irakli Pipia sets out the problem:Unsecured consumer loans and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises are most at risk because of their short term and floating interest rates. In general, the system wide loan portfolio is fairly unseasoned and has almost doubled in the past three years – and this is its first test by interest rate shocks of such magnitude. Furthermore, tighter monetary policy increases the downside risks to our 3% economic growth forecast for 2014 and, hence, the operating environment for Turkish banks.Analysts reckon that for every percentage point that Turkey’s GDP growth falls below its long-term average of 4 per cent, and stays there, the rate of NPLs should increase by 20 to 40 basis points. However, this relationship is unlikely to be linear, with a harder landing leading to more bankruptcies.Capital Economics points out that whenever an emerging market has experienced credit growth as fast as Turkey’s, the boom has been followed by a bust in which about one in five loans has defaulted – although this would be a worst case scenario.In the event of a less dramatic slowdown, Turkey’s banks should be able to absorb some shocks. They are well capitalised, after all, with a capital adequacy ratio of 15.8 per cent.But things may not be as rosy as that suggests.Erik Neilsen, senior economist at Unicredit, notes that although provisions are 75 per cent of the volume of NPLs and:Provisions are very low in absolute terms… somewhat surprisingly their non-performing loans are extremely low as well, despite 3-4 years of strong credit growth. Now, as a positive interpretation, that might be so because of the aftermath of the banking crisis 13-14 years ago. A less constructive interpretation would be that they simply do not report NPLs.It may be that Turkey’s banks will prove discerning enough in their lending and robust enough in the precautions they’ve taken to avoid a credit crisis – both Fitch and Moody’s have their current ratings on a stable outlook – but they will almost certainly be making lower profits for the forseeable future. And there remains substantial uncertainty about just how easy it will be for Turkey’s credit boom to unwind.Related reading:

392;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-01-27T10:36:43Z;EM sell-off: whatever happened to differentiation?;;"For all the talk of differentiation, emerging markets are having a bad Monday. Major currencies, such as the Turkish lira and Indian rupee have been hit; equity and bond markets are falling. As Benoit Anne of Société Générale put it, “global emerging markets are now trading in full-blown panic mode”.But the recent message to investors from analysts was to look beyond emerging markets as a single asset class. “The real lesson from recent events is that the need for investors to discriminate between individual EMs has never been greater,” said Neil Shearing of Capital Economics. Clearly, the lessons are not being heeded.EM currencies are feeling the pinch across the board. The biggest faller is the Turkish lira, which has continued to slide. It is now at 2.37 lira to the dollar, another 2 per cent plus depreciation, and another record low. Other currencies that have been under recent pressure have fallen: the rand is down around 1 per cent to 11.2 to the dollar. The Indian rupee, which had a torrid 2013, is down 0.6 per cent to over 63 to the dollar, a 2-month low.The Russian ruble is also falling, at around 38.8 to the dollar, another 0.8 per cent depreciation. The Hungarian forint – down 0.7 per cent to the euro at 306.4, and the Polish zloty, down 0.96 per cent to the euro, are other eastern European currencies under pressure.In equities, it’s a similar story. The MSCI emerging markets index was down 1.78 per cent at 933. Regional markets in Asia are also falling. The standout is Indonesia, where the IDX Composite in Jakarta fell 2.58 per cent. That was followed by the S&P Sensex which fell 2.08 per cent on Monday, and the SET Index in Thailand, down 1.84 per cent. The Philippines major index was down 1.77 per cent.So what has happened to talk of differentiation? The crumbling of the Argentine peso at the end of last week was dramatic, certainly, and there are worries on a specific country-level, but there are also global-level worries. Analysts from Barclays said: “Although the global sell-off looks technical in nature, weak PMI data in China and currency devaluation in Argentina have emerged as the leading candidates causing the broad market correction”Neither though, are particularly new. The China PMI Flash data was out last Wednesday; the Argentine peso fell on Thursday. As Benoit Anne noted, “The way I see it, emerging markets are stuck between, on the one hand, bottom-up financial contagion — Turkey’s political mess, China’s headlines, and Argentina’s severe exchange rate adjustment, among others — and on the other hand, a major doubt on the part of global investors about the Fed’s dovish forward guidance.”The US Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to announce further tapering to its asset purchase programme, with analysts at Barclays expecting a further reduction at a pace of $10bn per meeting.The question, though, of contagion vs differentiation is easy in theory, hard in practice – there are trouble spots in all major regions: Ukraine, Thailand, Turkey, Argentina. No wonder investor confidence is taking a knock. And it may well last – Paulo Goldberg of HSBC identified four reasons:First, the current jitters reinforce the preference for developed over emerging markets. Second, potential short-term solutions may lead to longer-term problems. Third, foreign exchange depreciation leads to outflows from the local markets. Fourth, due to the decentralised nature of these shocks, there is no silver bullet that can restore appetite for risk, in our view.Related reading:

393;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-01-20T07:19:30Z;Emerging markets to gain little from positive US pull;Growth in developed markets will not be strong enough to support EMs;The year of the horse is approaching in China, which explains perhaps why there are not many bulls around Asia and other emerging markets.Last year, developed markets strongly outperformed emerging markets. The MSCI global index was up 24 per cent but emerging markets dragged down the index by a negative 5 per cent, while the high-yield index was up 7 per cent, with no thanks to emerging market bonds which were down 7 per cent.Today developed markets are expensive and emerging markets cheap. Many analysts believe, though, that emerging markets can become cheaper still and that the bull case is far stronger for developed markets. These analysts are advising investors to steer clear of emerging markets.Whether that is the right call depends still on correctly parsing the policies of the Federal Reserve. In fact, the Fed shows no signs of abandoning the easy money policies that have led to a 30 per cent surge in the US stock market last year. Indeed, the net effect of the statements accompanying the announcement of a reduction in asset purchases of $10bn in December was on the easing side with a promise to keep rates lower for longer.That is good news for the fortunate few who live in the Bernanke/Yellen economy as opposed to the rest of us who live in the real economy. And to be fair there are some promising signs of spring in the real economy as well as in financial asset prices.That in turn is feeding into growing confidence on the part of chief executives in the US, as shown by the sudden surge in mergers and acquisitions. Sadly, though, for the bulls, there could also be a bearish explanation for these deals. That is because the willingness of chief executives to use shares as currency suggests they believe that their shares are now fairly valued and that their earnings in 2014 may not be too robust.For the past few years, revenues have stemmed largely from cost cutting. But that slash and burn policy is coming to an end. Yet investment in plant and equipment remains minimal suggesting that executives do not see a big increase in demand to help lift earnings. Capacity utilisation remains well below 80 per cent, leaving little incentive for them to invest in anything other than their own shares.As the earnings season gets under way, industrial and technology behemoths including General Electric and Intel are reporting disappointing numbers and retailers such as Target are lowering their forecasts for the year. So, if corporate America wishes to increase earnings and support elevated valuations, the best way to do so is by buying earnings through acquisitions.In addition, executives also may feel a sense of urgency because they fear that at some point, the cheap debt to finance any purchase will come to an end, regardless of the Fed’s policies and intentions.Still, all this suggests that any recovery in developed markets will not be robust enough to lift emerging markets in their wake. November’s US trade numbers, showing a narrowing trade deficit, mean fewer dollars are going to the pockets of exporters elsewhere in the world. In addition, any positive pull from the US is likely to be offset by the negative of weaker demand from China. And the more yields rise in the US, the more bearish the case for emerging markets becomes.Equity outflows – what Mohamed El-Erian of Pimco refers to as “tourist dollars” – from emerging markets in 2013 were the greatest in 11 years according to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a research report entitled, “The Slow EM Bleed Continues”. Bric markets are down 54 per cent from their peak.Meanwhile, analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest that while yields have risen in the debt market, carry is not high enough to compensate investors for the risk and have a “reduce” call on emerging market credit and currencies.Real economic factors and financial factors suggest Asia and other emerging markets will continue to have a hard time. China had a surprisingly big surplus in recent months and added more than $500bn to its reserves last year. But that is not expected to continue.Moreover, the People’s Bank of China is one of the few large central banks that is actually trying to rein in credit growth and asset prices. That means the cost of capital will rise in China, leading to less money for its neighbours. Elsewhere in Asia, lower surpluses in some countries and deficits in others means fewer household savings overall to finance credit-led growth.In the first half of 2013, hedge fund managers who were prudent and sought to hedge their positions were made to feel like fools. This year, caution may prove wiser than it did in 2013 whether in developed or emerging markets.
394;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-01-19T13:59:50Z;Annual moment of truth at hand;Investors braced for boost in profits;"The annual moment of truth is at hand. Companies have embarked on publishing their figures for the complete year of 2013. These numbers tend to be more tightly audited than the quarterly updates that come during the year, so this earnings season arguably revolves more around the realities of life in the corporate sector, rather than a game between chief financial officers and their investors.This year, we should maybe brace for a moment of particularly inconvenient truth, after a year in which the US stock market has rallied by about a third, almost entirely on higher multiples. Forward earnings multiples for the S&P 500, based on consensus 2014 forecasts, are about 16 – well above the historical average, and above the pre-crisis peak in 2007 – suggesting that investors are braced for a significant boost in profits.The macro arguments for such a stance are respectable. The US economy may well be on the verge of a strong recovery, as it emerges from the “fiscal drag” caused by last year’s government spending cuts.But there are different ways to tally earnings across the corporate sector. They can be aggregated on an “as reported” basis, including all exceptional items; they can be collated on an operating or pro forma basis; or some judgment can be used on which exceptional items are relevant. Any of these versions might be useful. But differences between them can radically skew perceptions.For example, the S&P 500 takes a strict view, including almost all charges that appear in the official data. This means companies appear to earn less than on other measures, so that their shares look more expensive.But the version of earnings used in the most widely followed earnings estimates might be too generous. According to Thomson Reuters, corporate earnings in 2013 are on course to increase by 5.7 per cent compared with 2012. This incorporates earnings for the first three quarters, plus the current expectation that fourth-quarter profits will be up 7.0 per cent.But Andrew Lapthorne, the indefatigably contrarian quantitative equity strategist at Société Générale, points out that the picture is different if we use the earnings data provided by MSCI indices. MSCI makes a judgment call in its numbers, accepting earnings as reported but giving itself the right to exclude “unusual gains or losses that do not reflect the earnings potential of the company going forward” – such as sales of discontinued operations, restructuring charges, bankruptcy charges, or changes in accounting policy.The difference between these approaches grew clear during the extreme conditions of the profit slump in 2009, that followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. According to Mr Lapthorne, S&P core earnings fell 92 per cent, MSCI earnings dropped 55 per cent – and earnings as used by Thomson Reuters fell 36 per cent.For 2013, MSCI earnings growth is barely above zero. On an Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) basis, excluding the effect of depreciation, Mr Lapthorne finds that US profits have indeed been flat for two years now. So the “growth” achieved over the past year appears to be the product of accounting manoeuvres and little else.Meanwhile, companies are talking down their prospects. They always do this before results season, to give themselves a better chance of beating expectations. But the fourth quarter tends to be the time for broader discussions with shareholders. And in any case, the scale of talking down over the past few weeks is unprecedented.According to Thomson Reuters, 113 companies have so far given the market warning that their results will be lower than expected, against only 14 positive guidances. This ratio of negative pre-announcements is the highest on record.And while earnings season is yet young, companies so far are finding it harder than usual to meet the low expectations they have set for themselves. Only 49 per cent of the 45 companies to report so far have beaten their forecasts, compared with a long-term average of 66 per cent.Meanwhile, estimated year-on-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter, on Thomson Reuters data, is only 0.5 per cent.Mr Lapthorne crunches balance sheets to draw more bearish conclusions. When measured as a share of sales, capital expenditure is nearly 7 per cent, well above average for the last two decades. Meanwhile, US cash piles look less impressive when viewed in the context of companies’ debt. Net debt (debt minus cash) has risen 15 per cent since the crisis. That debt has largely gone towards buying back shares, a move that directly raises earnings per share.None of this is necessarily that alarming as the companies and the economy try to gain traction in the difficult years following an epic financial crisis. But this take on earnings makes 2013’s remarkable expansion in earnings multiples look ever more hopeful, and ever more alarming. Is a moment of truth at hand?john.authers@ft.com"
395;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-01-08T14:40:02Z;Classic cars, watches and art beat shares;So-called passion investments return 77 per cent since 2005;Classic cars, watches and art have all produced higher returns than traditional stock markets since 2005, according to research by Coutts, the private bank.The first edition of The Coutts Index: Objects of Desire, developed in conjunction with Fathom Consulting, captures the price return in local currency of 15 assets across two broad categories: trophy property and alternative investments. Alternative investments can be further broken down into fine art, collectables and precious items.Overall these so-called “passion investments” returned 77 per cent in local currency terms – or 82 per cent in US dollar terms – while the MSCI All Country Index rose 53 per cent over the same time period.Of all the alternative investments Coutts examined for the Index, classic cars have returned the most since 2005, rising 257 per cent, outpacing all other investments by more than 80 percentage points over the seven-and-a-half-year timeframe.Collectable watches returned 176 per cent from 2005 to June 30 2013, while jewels returned 146 per cent and Chinese works of arts rose 163 per cent.The Coutts Index also includes trophy properties, comprising “billionaire” residential homes in 10 prime global city locations and “leisure” properties in the world’s most desirable leisure destinations associated with these cities. This sector lost value in the run-up to the global recession, but billionaire property values have risen strongly since, rising 100 per cent from 2005 to June 30 2013.“The Coutts Index has been created to measure passion assets, or objects of desire, in terms of performance, cost of storage and currency,” said Mohammad Kamal Syed, head of strategic solutions at the bank, which offers services to individuals with at least £1m in investable assets.“But while many alternatives have provided spectacular returns, there is more to investing in these assets than price appreciation. For many people, profit is furthest from their mind,” he said.He added that for many wealthy individuals, it is less about investing and more about purchasing – purchasing assets driven by their emotions.
396;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2014-01-05T03:21:39Z;Hedge fund survey: Record so far;Tracking the performance of selected funds from previous years;When we started this annual review of hedge funds several years ago, it was our contention that refined research and due diligence can help investors realise superior and operationally less risky returns versus not only the average hedge fund, but possibly versus the market as well.After reviewing the performance of our first five funds over a two-year period, we have been proved correct about the former, and have seen a split decision about the latter.Several years of performance is required to make a fair assessment of our thesis. But in the same way a fund of funds manager is mindful of trends in their underlying holdings, we will share what we have experienced so far.[Note: Unlike a fund of funds, the funds in our concentrated group were not selected for the appropriateness of strategy given the current place in the market cycle, and we have weighted each fund equally in our assessment, ignoring superior convictions we may have had towards one fund versus another.]In our first year, we outperformed the average hedge fund and the related market strategies in which we are invested. And we did so with lower volatility. We outperformed the MSCI EAFE, the non-US developed market index, but underperformed the S&P 500.With a second year under our belts, those five original funds selected in 2011 have almost doubled the performance of the average hedge fund, rising an average of 5.2 per cent a year versus the BarclayHedge Fund Index, which was up an annualised rate of 2.64 per cent.Our top-performing funds were the Harvest Small-Cap [long/short equity] strategy (+10.65 per cent per year) and the Steelhead Pathfinder convertible arbitrage fund (+8.21 per cent per year). Our worst and only cumulatively negative performing fund from 2011 was the Forum Global Opportunities [macro] fund (-2.99 per cent per year).Forum’s performance over the past year through June 2013 was especially disappointing on a relative basis, underperforming the average global macro fund by nearly 9 per cent. The primary cause was a high-conviction short position of emerging market credits. Ray Bakhramov, the manager, thinks the credits are still likely to deteriorate due to fundamental imbalances. Nevertheless, demand for yield has compressed their spreads so far.Overall, our initial five funds outperformed the MSCI EAFE index, which was up 1.58 per cent. We underperformed the S&P 500, which was up an average of 12.77 per cent.Three of the five funds we selected in 2012 have performed very well, both relative to their strategies and in absolute terms, over the past 12 months through June 2013. GAM Talentum Emerging Long/Short Equity fund paced the way, rising more than 15 per cent, followed by the Parus [long/short equity] fund, which was up more than 12 per cent.Talentum’s gains were founded in the fund’s predominantly long posture. Spread across a variety of industries, it ranges from a Turkish tractor and diesel engine producer to industrial and mining interests in Mexico and a Brazilian educational services group. Potentially damaging currency exposure was hedged effectively.Performance of the developed-market focused Parus fund was also driven by its bullish bottom-up stance, especially in financials, which accounted for 70 per cent of its performance.Two funds that did not do well were hurt by their defensive exposure. LJM Preservation and Growth, an options strategy fund, had an extremely consistent record throughout its six-year history. It floundered, down 7.70 per cent, mainly due to its performance in May 2013 when it lost an extraordinary 9 per cent. As we mentioned last year, in seeking to protect against tail risk, the fund’s Achilles heel is a consistently rising market with low volatility, which characterised the first half of 2013. The fund’s increasingly defensive position – in expectation of a slowing rise in the S&P 500 – triggered the loss as the market continued to soar.Likewise, Omni Macro fund’s conviction that quantitative easing was setting up a bearish scenario for a richly priced market proved costly as stocks continued to rally, generating a loss of nearly 6 per cent over the trailing year.The magnitude of underperformance by these two funds negated much of our strong gains and contributed to our underperforming the hedge fund index and the market.Our experience affirms the challenges of finding hedge fund managers that can consistently beat the market, especially in an ultra-low interest rate environment that has suffered significantly from aggressive central bank intervention.Some managers opt to rotate in and out of the most promising funds regularly to enhance performance. For our annual exercise, we will let our selections ride to see if managers we deem operationally and investment savvy can indeed prove to be good enduring investments.
397;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-12-23T15:41:28Z;Contrarian investors hope for better times in 2014;;In the topsy-turvy world of contrarian investing, market rallies are generally a bad thing and volatility is good. Betting against the conventional wisdom yielded big gains for contrarians during the dotcom crash of 2000 and financial crisis in 2009. Not so the past 12 months.“Contrarian strategies have had one of the worst ever years,” says Beata Manthey, global equities strategist at Citi. “While simple contrarian strategies often perform very well at big macro turning points, they tend to underperform the rest of the time. An extension of a two-year 40 per cent rally and re-rating in global equities has made this one of the biggest momentum years since 1998.”Like the cool kid at school whose long hair and skinny jeans are copied by peers, contrarian trades of the past two years – such as going long on Europe – have gone mainstream.At the same time big contrarian bets, like emerging market equities, which underperformed their developed world counterparts by 20 per cent according to the MSCI All Countries index, have fared poorly.Part of the problem for frustrated contrarians is the sheer volume of easy money being pumped into the financial system by the world’s major central banks.Tightening interest rate spreads have forced many investors to buy further down the credit hierarchy – and assume more risk – to achieve a decent yield. As a result, 2013 was a bumper year for junk bonds – which returned an average of 8.8 per cent according to the iBoxx corporate bond index – and subordinated bank debt.So what is a volatility-starved contrarian to do in the new year?One potential opportunity is commodities, traditionally fertile contrarian terrain.The MSCI Commodity Producers Index underperformed the World Index by more than 15 percentage points this year as miners were plagued by cost overruns and subdued commodity prices.Evy Hambro, head of BlackRock’s natural resources equities team, says the market could have seen the bottom, with more miners taking steps to improve cost discipline after seeing their shares shunned by investors.“Our checklist is definitely moving from the red zone into amber and there are a few green lights in there as well – that’s what we’re looking for as we go into 2014,” he says.Another possibility – with the eurozone out of recession and US tapering having begun – lies within the broadly optimistic economic consensus for 2014.Adrian Docherty, head of banking advisory at BNP Paribas, says longer-term risks of a new banking crisis, brought about by growing levels of loan forbearance and rising interest rates, could materialise sooner than some expect.“2014 could be like 2004,” says Mr Docherty. “We think everything is fine, confidence is higher than merited and therefore asset bubbles continue to develop . . . these are long-term risks but there is a chance they could materialise during the year.”Prevailing market tranquillity could also be knocked out of sync by two big “known unknowns”, to borrow the terminology coined by Donald Rumsfeld, the former US defence secretary. These are the end of quantitative easing and the eurozone crisis.“The fact that we have so much excess liquidity keeps the market calm,” says Armin Peter, head of European debt syndicate at UBS. “If central banks were to walk away from that there will be a lot more volatility.”In Europe, 2013 could be remembered as the year when existential fears of a euro break-up finally subsided in the wake of Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the single-currency union.Since then foreign, especially American and Asian, investors have rushed back into euro-denominated assets and increased their lending to banks in core countries.But flighty investors could pack their bags once more, like they did in 2011, if the European Central Bank’s review of banks’ balance sheets and subsequent stress tests rattles investor confidence.In addition, fractious local politics, particularly in Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal, could provide contrarian openings for short trades.”There are a number of possible adverse political events that themselves may represent profitable short trades in Europe,” says Saul Greenberg, co-founder of SCIO Capital, a Europe-based asset manager. “Consider trades around Catalonia’s desire for independence from Spain and the significant market upheaval that would result if they were to declare independence, such as shorting Catalan banks.”‪Nevertheless Alberto Gallo, head of European macro credit research at Royal Bank of Scotland, argues next year is the recession-battered periphery’s turn to shine.Mr Gallo says investors should concentrate their bets on assets with exposure to recoveries in Italy, Spain and Portugal. German debt investors, by contrast will lose out as the gap between the core and periphery yields increasingly narrows.“Long sangria and panettone vs sauerkraut,” he says.A true contrarian might conclude the opposite.
398;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-12-22T13:15:26Z;Markets reflect recovery of developed world’s economies;;Global stock markets have reflected the recovery of the developed world’s economies this year, particularly those of “peripheral” eurozone countries, but the latest performance figures also show it has been a torrid year for many emerging markets.Greece has been the best performing equity market, according to the MSCI regional indices, with a 45 per cent gain this year in dollar terms, with Ireland in second place, thanks to a 35 per cent gain.Greece’s strong stock market returns follow its reclassification as an emerging market by MSCI in June, having been deemed a developed market by the index provider since 2001.Nick Nelson, global equity strategist with UBS, attributed some of the returns in Greece to the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme.Bankers added that the resurgence of peripheral eurozone stock markets was partly driven by renewed interest from US investors, who have been keen to rebuild their exposure to Europe since the eurozone crisis abated.Earlier this month, the Greek parliament approved the country’s 2014 budget by a slim majority. It assumes the economy will grow by 0.6 per cent after six straight years of recession and aims to deliver a €2.96bn surplus in 2014, equal to 1.6 per cent of national output, before repayments of debt, with €3bn of spending cuts.In Ireland, share prices have recovered alongside a genuine improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop, Mr Nelson said.Of the major western equity markets, measured by the MSCI, the US was the best performer, with a gain of 27 per cent, while Germany was up 23 per cent. Finland, which showed a gain of 35 per cent, was more of a special situation, analysts said, given the strong performance of Nokia.“The US has been driven by a recovery in the domestic economy, a pickup in housing and a new credit cycle,” observed Mr Nelson. “Germany, while part of the core of Europe, is also the second most cyclical market in Europe and has benefited from an improvement in the European and global macroeconomic backdrop.”At the other end of the league table, all the worst underperformers were emerging markets, with Latin America to the fore. Emerging markets as a whole have underperformed the MSCI World index by 21 percentage points in 2013.Mr Nelson said: “The other common factor for the vast majority of the largest underperformers is that almost all have current account deficits that need to be financed by inflows. 2013 has been a difficult year for emerging markets with need of capital inflows. Some are also commodity producers and their poor performance echoes that of global metals and mining stocks.”
399;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investment styles that outlive fashion;Expect value or momentum approaches to come good eventually;Investment styles seem to be out of fashion. The US stock rally has delivered returns of 30 per cent from large companies in 12 months, including dividends. Put a value slant on a portfolio by picking companies which look cheap on measures such as price to book value, and an investor would also have received 30 per cent, from the US MSCI Value index. Focus instead on momentum – “cut your losses and let your winners run”, as market wisdom has it – and investors could make …30 per cent (as measured by MSCI).MSCI is not the last word in measuring these returns. But MSCI data is up to date, and in markets, timeliness is next to godliness. The benchmark comes from academic Ken French, and shows a long-short momentum approach outperforming by 5 per cent in the 12 months to end-October, while a value long-short portfolio was 1 per cent ahead.Both might have been expected to have done far better as shares soared. Value stocks should benefit as a rising market lifts even the leakiest companies, while momentum should thrive in a market which has risen pretty much in a straight line.Value, a long-term strategy based on fundamentals, is often seen opposed to momentum, a short-term approach based on price. But it is far from unknown for both to beat (or lag behind) the market.Both have looked poor since the 2008 crisis, according to Prof French’s data. After this year’s gain a pure momentum approach would have delivered nothing since 2001, while a long-short value strategy is just back up to 2006 levels.Are these investment styles going the way of shoulder pads and flares? Probably not. It is true that more money is trying to exploit them, which should reduce available returns. But both have been out of fashion for years in the past before staging stunning returns. Investors should not invest in either without being braced for years of underperformance – but should expect them to come good eventually.james.mackintosh@ft.com
400;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-29T13:04:49Z;The rich get less rich… but only in eight countries;;"Research company Wealth-X has released its annual report on “ultra high net worth individuals”. (For those prefer plain English, they mean the stinking rich.)The super wealthy in the west have got even richer over the past year. In fact the super rich have got richer just about everywhere – bar in eight emerging and frontier countries including China, Brazil and Syria.Wealth-X looks only at rich folk with net assets exceeding $30m, and records the change in their wealth from 2012 to 2013. The well-to-do of Syria have seen their money drain away over the past year, but plutocrats in other countries have fared even worse (see below).Half of these countries are in Latin America. The most notorious tycoon to fall in 2013 was Eike Batista, whose oil company OGX filed for bankruptcy in August. His net wealth has dropped from more than $30bn last year to $200m, according to estimates by Bloomberg.President Xi Jinping, who wants to reign in corruption and conspicuous consumption among China’s elite, might be comforted by the report. But a closer look shows that the number of billionaires has actually increased over the past year. The club of people with $500m-$1bn net wealth has swelled by over a tenth. The overall fall in riches comes from those at the (affluent) bottom:Why have these eight countries squeezed the rich? It may not be the result of concerted policy. The countries have recorded some of the biggest falls in equity markets over the year. The below chart shows the five worst performing MSCI stock indices of all emerging and frontier markets (the indices are in $ terms). Peru, Ukraine, Chile and Colombia are all there.The thinning out of China’s fat cats may reflect an outflow of wealth, rather than anyone getting poorer. The rich have moved their cash overseas, Wealth-X writes:Faced with [slower growth and a credit crunch] in their home country, many wealthy Chinese from mainland China are diversifying and moving their assets to Hong Kong, where the city has witnessed an increase in… wealth.The riches of Hong Kong’s super wealthy have risen by about 13 per cent over the year.Not much solace for Occupy after all, then.Related reading:

401;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-25T14:31:20Z;Frontier markets on a tear – but can it last?;;"Frontier markets have come out of 2013 a lot better than emerging ones, as the FT’s Robin Wigglesworth noted.The MSCI Frontier Markets index has risen more than 17 per cent this year, compared with a 2.9 per cent loss for the bigger MSCI Emerging Markets index.EM stock prices dipped after the Fed dropped hints in May that it would taper its loose monetary policy; FM stock has been less perturbed. Bond yields too have risen in key EMs since the start of the year, while there has been less of a discernible trend in FM bond yield movements.This is partly explained by the fact that frontier markets are more illiquid. Spooked investors have pulled out of EM assets, which are easier to dispose of. As Fed policy pushes Treasury yields up, US Treasuries will be more attractive relative than (less safe) EM sovereign bonds with similar yields and fund managers can be expected to swap EM assets for US government debt. (Indeed, some analysts think investors have already priced in the effects of US rate rises.) High-yield FM debt is thought to be less subject to these sorts of substitution effects.Which EM stock indices have moved the most since the start of this year? The chart is below. Equities in Peru, Chile and Indonesia have dropped the furthest in value. China and South Korean stocks have risen, by contrast.(Note that beyondbrics has used standard MSCI indices for all emerging and frontier markets. These are in dollar terms, to avoid the problems caused by comparing movements in local stock exchanges. The Bovespa, for example, has dropped by 23 per cent in the year to date, but this partly reflects the Brazilian real’s plummet.)By contrast, most FMs have recorded huge stock market gains in the year to date. Pakistan has outperformed India; Nigeria has outperformed South Africa; Vietnam has outpaced even China (see chart below). Bulgaria, Argentina, the UAE and Kenya have most excelled, recording equity index gains of 50 per cent or higher this year.These FMs are partly making up for past losses. Frontier market stock indices remain almost 50 per cent below their pre-credit crunch peak, while emerging markets are down less than a fifth.During this year, the big emerging markets have seen the yields of their sovereign debt rise. Developments in Brazil and Indonesia have most spooked bond buyers. In big frontier markets, the picture is a mixed one: some yields have risen; others have actually fallen. It is hard to conclude that hints of tapering have had much effect on FM bond yields.The below chart shows the change in 10-year government bond yields since January.This is not to say FMs are in better shape overall than EMs. They are “frontier” for a reason. Indeed, on Nomura’s index of countries most at risk of a currency crisis (below), FMs join EMs at the top of the ranking. Serbia, Bulgaria and Lithuania were about as doddery as Turkey on the latest count.As of the second quarter of this year, Ukraine (a frontier market according to MSCI) gave out the most warning signs of being close to a currency crisis. It would not surprise beyondbrics if Ukraine was closer to a crisis today. The country’s big current account deficit – and its close trade ties to Russia – explain why its leader had second thoughts about abandoning Russia for an EU trade pact.Related reading:

402;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;China’s A shares poised to go global;Beijing gradually opening capital markets to foreign investors;"China has made significant strides in opening up its capital markets to foreign investors, but several key challenges need to be addressed before the mainland equity market can feature in broader equity benchmark indices.Mainland-listed equities traded in the renminbi, also known as A shares, are currently excluded from global indices as they are not freely accessible by the global investing public. The existing China representation within those indices is largely via H shares, which are Chinese securities listed in Hong Kong.With a sizeable market capitalisation of just under $4tn, the China A shares market could substantially alter the global investing landscape if it were to be incorporated into various broader indices, industry participants say.Chia Chin-Ping, who is head of equity research for Asia Pacific at MSCI, says
A shares could account for up to 13 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets index if China were to be “completely opened up”. Together with the existing weighting of 16.8 per cent, China as a whole could represent close to 30 per cent of the index.However, Mr Chia stresses that would be under a “very hypothetical” scenario, as there are still a number of hurdles that need to be overcome, such as quota allocation, capital mobility and taxation on capital gains.When MSCI announced in June that it had started reviewing A shares for potential inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, it emphasised that the consultation did not imply that A shares had achieved emerging markets status in terms of market accessibility criteria.Mr Chia counts the quota system and limited capital mobility as the biggest reasons holding back A shares from going global.To access China’s capital market, foreign investors must rely on the qualified foreign institutional investor or the renminbi-qualified foreign institutional investor schemes.Mr Chia says that, while the overall quota of the schemes is “fairly significant”, the issue is more about the alignment of that quota with the size of
investors.“We’ve seen some sovereign wealth funds getting quotas beyond $1.5bn but they are a lot larger than that, $1.5bn is probably still a small amount,” he says. “More importantly, the majority of the QFII investors, who are sizeable investors and managers, are still waiting for more quotas to be awarded, so that process needs to take place.”So far, only three QFII participants – the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Norway’s Norges Bank and Singapore’s Temasek Fullerton Alpha – have been granted allotments above $1bn.Capital mobility restrictions are also a major impediment to China’s inclusion in global indices. In terms of repatriation of capital, the procedure is particularly stringent under the QFII scheme, which requires a one-month wait, although weekly repatriation is possible with dedicated open-ended China funds. In the RQFII scheme, daily repatriation is allowed.For asset managers, it is crucial that these two particular issues are addressed, says Kevin Hardy, head of beta strategies for Asia Pacific and country head for Singapore at BlackRock.“There are a few other things as well but these two are very critical for the indexing space because if we can’t freely access or have a limited amount we can access, there’s no way we can track an index,” he says.While Mr Chia and Mr Hardy are optimistic that the issues will eventually be resolved, they stop short of giving a timeframe for when they believe the
inclusion could become a reality.Meanwhile, Jessie Pak, managing director for Asia at FTSE Group, says she predicts China A shares will be able to migrate to global indices as soon as
“a few years’ time”.Ms Pak says China’s opening up of its capital market in recent years has gathered pace and that the developments are “getting more and more positive”. She cites the expansion of the RQFII scheme as an example.Indeed, the past 18 months saw a number of positive regulatory moves by Beijing in an attempt to further open up the A shares market under the QFII and RQFII programmes.On the QFII side, the overall quota was lifted in April 2012 from $30bn to $80bn, then was almost doubled in July to US$150bn. The foreign ownership limit has been increased from 20-30 per cent and the application process for a QFII licence has been streamlined.On the RQFII side, not only has the overall quota been significantly increased from RMB70bn to RMB270bn, but the programme has also been expanded beyond Hong Kong to Taiwan, London and Singapore.Nonetheless, Ms Pak acknowledges that it all boils down to whether the key issues of quotas and capital mobility will be resolved for China A shares to be included in the broader indices.In the meantime, says Mr Chia. index providers and asset managers should maintain active communication with regulators as well as step up efforts to educate investors about China investing, because participating in the market will take time and it is uncertain precisely when A shares will be included in global indices.“Of course, we are not going to rush through the process but, if tomorrow, the Chinese government decides to abolish some of these restrictions to make things easier, there’s no reason we should not see the inclusion happen,” he says."
403;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
404;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-15T18:26:40Z;A rise of passives, a rise of scrutiny;Index-based investing expandis rapidly across financial markets;Index-based investing is expanding rapidly across global financial markets in a shift that offers big rewards to providers of popular benchmarks. It is also, however, attracting growing scrutiny from regulators.The most visible evidence for the rise of index-based investing comes from growth in the exchange traded funds industry which now commands assets of $2.3tn. Trillions of dollars more are held in index-based portfolios by pension and sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors.Indices are also widely used for pricing in both structured products, where issuance is recovering, and also in the derivatives markets, where the outstanding value of contracts contines to rise.The expanding role of indices in financial markets has led regulators to re-examine the rules governing financial benchmarks.Both the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the European Securities and Markets Authority have published guidelines intended to strength investor protection through improved standards of transparency and disclosures.Providers of financial indices felt that their own standards and practices already went beyond these guidelines and banded together in 2012 to create an association to better respond to regulators’ concerns.But the industry has found itself under another regulatory spotlight with the European Commission in September proposing stricter rules for all index providers following the Libor scandal.Providers of financial indices are furious that their products, which are based on verifiable transactions and transparent methodologies, have been conflated by regulators with the interbank lending market that was manipulated by traders for profit.However, Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for financial services, has made it clear that the proposed rules will “ensure for the first time that all benchmark providers have to be authorised and supervised”.Baer Pettit, head of the index business at MSCI, says regulators are “off-target”, adding that financial indices “have added greatly to transparency standards” in capital markets.There is no record of any abuse or scandal involving financial indices, he adds.Hartmut Graf, chief executive of Stoxx, questions whether further regulation is necessary as index-based investing has worked well, “without manipulation or distortion”.He worries that “over-regulation” is likely, driving costs higher by requiring more external auditing and potentially constraining access to more innovative products for ordinary investors.Mr Pettit says index-based investing offers “hope for progress” in financial markets, adding that retail investors, who typically hold just a small proportion of their assets in passive funds, should embrace indexing as they often lack the resources to choose the best active managers.Repeated studies have demonstrated that active managers in both equities and bonds on average fail to deliver consistent outperformance, strengthening the case for passive investment strategies.Mr Graf says those areas of active management that fail to provide added value for investors will come under more pressure and be replaced by index-based strategies.A US study published in July demonstrated the potential value of such a shift. Two think-tanks based in Maryland found that US public employee pension funds could save $6bn a year in fees and make better returns if they used low-cost index funds instead of employing active managers.Active managers look likely to come under even more pressure as index-based investing becomes increasingly sophisticated, with more asset classes being linked to alternative index strategies, otherwise known as “smart beta”.One of the smart beta pioneers, Research Affiliates, recently saw assets linked to its fundamentally weighted indices race past the $100bn milestone to reach $107bn.“Investors have realised that market-cap weighting is not optimal and are interested in viable [indexing] alternatives to more costly active management,” says Rob Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates.Ian Ashment, global head of structured beta and indexing at UBS Global Asset Management, says institutional clients have been quick to see the benefits that alternative indices can offer and are “far bolder” in making allocations than expected.“Almost all clients want to talk about smart beta and how to incorporate alternative indexing into their overall approach, whether as part of a buy and hold strategy or for more tactical applications,” says Mr Ashment.Ron Bundy, chief executive of Russell’s index business, says smart beta indices are a “great complement” to both passive strategies and active management.Smart beta indices can help investors achieve “more precise” exposures to particular drivers of risk and return.Mr Bundy says conversations between Russell and its investors frequently focus on questions about portfolio construction and how traditional market cap-weighted indices, smart beta strategies and active management can best be combined to suit a client.Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, believes smart beta has “a place” in portfolios but he cautions that it cannot replace the role of cap- weighted indices as the primary benchmarks for clients’ assets and as the most widely accepted performance benchmark for different asset classes.Ursula Marchioni, a director in the European investment strategy team at iShares, the ETF arm of BlackRock, says investors are becoming more “ active with their passive” as they blend index-linked investment vehicles and different types of betas in their portfolios.She says the trend for blending index-based vehicles and strategies is also increasing the need for investors to perform thorough due diligence.BlackRock describes due diligence for index investing as a three-step process which involves selecting the right benchmark, choosing the most appropriate investment vehicle and finding the best portfolio manager.“Index investing will continue to grow and play a key role in financial markets over the next 10 years and beyond. Investors who understand beta in depth and the evolution of index investing will be best positioned to harvest the benefits and avoid any potential pitfalls,” says Ms Marchioni.Her view is echoed by Mr Graf at Stoxx, who says growing numbers of investors realise that going passive can bring huge benefits, not just in terms of lower costs.He notes that concerns about risks became much more prominent in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The crisis prompted many investors to seek a different balance between risks and returns, requiring a more granular analysis of the drivers of their portfolios. Mr Graf says financial indices can help investors position their exposures much more precisely, making it easier to put together the appropriate building blocks to achieve their desired portfolio.But he also says it is important for investors to strike a balance between cutting-edge research and understanding their objectives, adding that index providers usually have different discussions when dealing with sophisticated institutions and retail clients.Mr Pettit at MSCI says strategy indices provide a “codification” of factors such as value, size and momentum that have been identified as drivers of risk and return in portfolios.However, he says employing these factors also requires a rigorous analytical framework, otherwise it is easy to become distracted by noise or data sampling.“One can debate the nuances or technical issues relating to factor indices but the bigger point is that they offer new ways of expressing a range of investment views,” says Mr Pettit, adding that MSCI’s discussions with institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and banks focus on these drivers of risks and returns as well as overall portfolio risks.Thus, the indexing industry appears set for further growth, promising a bright future for providers that can successfully deliver reliable benchmarks to satisfy both regulators and investors
405;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-15T18:26:40Z;If you cannot beat them, track them;Pension funds urged to adopt index strategies;Pension funds on both sides of the Atlantic have increasingly been adopting the same mantra when it comes to the investment markets: if you cannot beat them, track them.A continuous trickle of research papers shows that the majority of active managers consistently fail to beat index-tracking funds when their higher fees are taken into account. And pension funds are taking notice.In September, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) – the second-largest US pension plan and sixth largest in the world, according to Towers Watson – made an announcement with little fanfare that many observers have claimed is a boon for passive fund management and an alarm bell for poor performing active managers.In a document entitled Calpers Investment Beliefs, the $260bn pension plan outlined a set of guiding principles that would form the basis of all future investment strategy decisions. Number seven on the list was a commitment to “take risk only when we have a strong belief we will be rewarded for it”.As part of this statement, the Calpers board said it would use index strategies where it lacked conviction or demonstrable evidence that it could add value through active management. It said it would also use passive indices as a reference to measure whether active managers were performing well and providing value for their higher fees.For a pension fund with 64 per cent of its portfolio dedicated to active management, the endorsement of index funds is widely seen as highly significant. Calpers had already switched its $1.6bn defined contribution plans to passive management earlier this year and a slow march towards passive funds is now expected in its defined benefit plans.Other public pension plans are being urged to follow Calpers’ lead. A damning report from the Maryland Public Policy Institute and Maryland Tax Education Foundation released this summer argued US public pension plans could wipe out $80bn in unfunded liabilities by simply switching from active management to passive.An analysis of the 46 state pension funds for which the report’s authors were able to get data showed there was a direct correlation between higher management charges and lower returns, net of fees. The 10 pension plans paying the highest fund management fees – which averaged 60 basis points – achieved average returns of 0.34 per cent. For 10 states paying the lowest fees – which averaged 22 bps – the average return was 2.38 per cent.The paper argued that if all the 46 funds switched to passive management, they would save a combined $6bn a year in fees and have better or at least comparable performance.UK pension funds, meanwhile, attracted criticism in October from Prince Charles for “becoming increasingly unfit for purpose”, while former City minister Paul Myners accused the industry of “turning gold into lead”. At the same time, UK pension funds were accused by investment manager Evercore Pan-Asset of wasting more than £6bn a year investing in active funds rather than in better performing passive equivalents.While Calpers may be one of the largest plans to have explicitly outlined the case for passive management, others have already set about increasing their passive exposure and making use of different strategies.“An increasing number of pension funds in the US as well as the UK are looking to focus active management in areas of greatest opportunity while utilising index-based strategies in areas where it can complement, ultimately providing them with greater control over their investment outcomes,” says Jamie Forbes, director at Russell Indexes in Europe.One area of passive management that pension funds are making more and more use of are strategies called smart beta or alternatively weighted indices. These are indices that are constructed in a way that allow the investor to take an active position on how assets with certain characteristics will perform, but without having to choose the individual securities.For example, a low-volatility index fund would favour stocks that provide more predictable returns, and therefore the fund’s performance overall will be less choppy.“They fit nicely between an active and a pure passive approach,” says Simon Midgen, head of index funds strategy at Legal & General Investment Management. “We are removing the manager risk and they are cheaper than active funds, but [investors] are still making decisions.”Such strategies often cost more than traditional market-cap-weighted index funds because there is usually more trading involved. But they are cheaper than active management and have been increasingly adopted by pension plans around the world. “Initially we saw more interest from European pension plans. But we were surprised in 2012 by how fast US plans started to adopt these indexes,” says Diana Tidd, head of the MSCI index business in the Americas.“Europe is ahead still, but the rate of adoption in the US has surprised us,” she adds.
406;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-11T00:01:06Z;Capital Group questions how indices are used;Mismeasurement of performance worries originator of MSCI;The rise of the multinational has transformed the corporate landscape in the past half-century. Now, the inventor of the most widely-used global stock market indices thinks the measurement of equity performance needs to change too – and with it the dynamics of investing.Capital Group – which, as Capital International, was the originator of the MSCI index range – is concerned that the standard national, or even regional, benchmarks used by fund managers no longer measure what they set out to measure. This problem has been evident in the FTSE 100 index for a decade or more, as less than a quarter of the revenues of companies in the Footsie come from the UK, and many of their dividends are paid in dollars or euros.But London’s best-known index is a bit of a special case, and not much money tracks it. Capital’s concern is that apparently more sensible and broader measures – such as the S&P 500, Euro Stoxx 600 or the MSCI country and regional indices – are also suffering significantly from mismeasurement.“The world has changed but the industry hasn’t really kept up with it,” says Rob Lovelace, a director and portfolio manager at Capital, and grandson of its founder. “People don’t really know what they own in their portfolio or the risk that they’re taking.”As befits a group that has used the same research-driven approach since it was founded in the Great Depression, Capital is not rushing to make changes. Initially, it plans to give customers a breakdown of their portfolios by location of revenue, as well as by location of listing or domicile.However, Capital is right to question the indices used both as benchmarks for active fund managers (Capital runs the largest active mutual fund in the US) and as investments in their own right by passive groups. The Footsie may seem particularly egregious with its Kazakh and South African miners, but consider these anomalies:● A third of the revenues for constituents of the broadest MSCI All-Country World index come from emerging markets, while only around a tenth of the index is made up of emerging market-based companies, by market value.● Only one-fifth of the revenues of France’s Cac-40 and a little more of Germany’s Dax are local. Both have more revenues from emerging markets than they do locally.● Even for the S&P 500, only about two-thirds of revenues come from the US.Yet almost all investors still divvy up their equity portfolios according to where companies are based, with a heavy bias towards their home countries. Can this be justified?There are a couple of reasons why it might make sense. First, corporate governance. This is set by the local stock exchange and local law, with additional limits set by index compilers. Investors buying British companies know they cannot be diluted without permission, and that takeovers will be properly policed. US corporate governance is more reliant on litigation, but far more shareholder-friendly than in continental Europe or Japan, let alone the wilds of emerging markets.While picking only stocks listed in London or New York may be limiting, it at least provides some reassurance that shareholder interests are represented.Second, convenience. It is easier to get to know a company based in the same country, whether for language, timezone or travel reasons. Instead, investors typically focus on the economy or region they want to hold, often based on the (dodgy) belief that faster economic growth will lead to higher returns to shareholders.Currency risk is also treated as important, even though currency risk merely reappears through the company’s revenue line, instead of in the denomination of the shares.But investors cannot ignore the existing system. Indices are so important to asset allocation that they have become self-fulfilling – as was demonstrated by the wholesale dumping of emerging market equities earlier this year. It took much longer for the shares of western companies with emerging market exposure to be hit.Revenue-based indices offer the potential for better regional benchmarks. But they present their own problems, too. Truly global brands such as Coca-Cola would have a weighting in all regional indices, for example. Index weightings would also change more quickly than at present, as sales patterns shifted.Still, it is a step forward for investors to know where their portfolios’ revenues come from. They need to stop kidding themselves that an allocation to a country or regional index gives them exposure solely – or even mainly – to those places.James Mackintosh is the FT’s investment editor.

407;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Should South Korea still be an emerging market?;;"The MSCI, the US company from which beyondbrics gets its definition of an emerging market, today issued revisions to its EM equity index.Three Greek banks have been added to the index; two Moroccan banks and Maroc Telecom have been removed. (As of November, Greece is classed as an emerging market, and former EM Morocco is a frontier market.)One big change hasn’t happened though – which will puzzle some commentators. South Korea is still deemed an emerging market.For those unfamiliar with the MSCI’s work, here are a list of current EMs. Delete Morocco, and note that Qatar and the UAE will join in May 2014.Why is South Korea in the not-developed club? Its 2012 GDP per capita was $22,600. Portugal, a developed market by MSCI’s definition, had a GDP per head of $20,200 the same year. In the OECD’s education rankings, South Korea came third for youth literacy, fifth for youth numeracy. The nation is seventh in the world when it comes to the ease of doing business, above the UK and Germany.But the country may still have a little way to go. Ha-Joon Chang, a South Korean economist, says: “It is genuinely a border-line case… my judgement is that it is still not quite there.” The state still has some influence in the way business is run, he says.Corruption is viewed to be relatively high. South Korea comes 45th in the world on Transparency International’s corruption perception index (the least corrupt is first). Alexandre Flanigan of Trusted Sources, an EM consultancy, says the country’s exporting sector – encompassing Samsung, Hyundai and LG – may look like a developed market, but limited competition and predatory behaviour by chaebols in the domestic sector is similar to that found in EM peers.The MSCI looks at a bunch of other criteria when classifying EMs. The details are below:In brief, to be a developed market, the country has to:South Korea is rich enough and has enough big businesses. Foreign ownership is not a problem. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the only drawback is the lack of “ease of currency trading”. In a country review in June, MSCI says investors dislike the controls on offshore currency markets:[If Korea were a developed market,] the limited convertibility of the Korean Won in the offshore currency market would be a significant issue… Instead of having full flexibility in timing and executing their currency trades, DM investors would be forced to trade the Korean Won during Korean business hours and using local counterparties.The second hitch is access to Korean equity markets, MSCI adds:The rigidity of the ID system that makes in‐kind transfers and off‐exchange transactions prohibitive is of particular concern to large institutions managing thousands of fundsShould South Korea open up a little? Ha-Joon says that the country “needs [a more flexible currency market] like it needs a hole in the head”. If investors decide to pull out of South Korea, controls on capital reduce the severity of any resultant currency crisis. What is good for investors may not be in the interests of the country, he says.But MSCI’s classification system has some sway. Its EM equity index is the basis for many derivatives, exchange traded funds and mutual funds. “The Korean government complains of [investors] undervaluing financial assets because of an unwanted label slapped on it,” says Ha-Joon.If the MSCI rescinds South Korea’s EM status, firms may quickly withdraw their EM investments from the country. Some may judge the nation more harshly against its DM neighbours. Others may see the re-designation as a seal of approval.The dispute is more than than academic.Related reading:

408;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-06T11:52:38Z;Guest post: the pitfalls of Russia’s privatisation programme;;"By Pavel Morozov of State SolutionsRussia’s heavily trailed privatisation programme, the scale of which has not been seen since the controversial loans-for-shares privatisations of the 1990s, has so far not delivered on expectations. Assets worth $13bn were set to be sold in this year alone, but now it looks like the Federal Treasury will be receiving $1bn at most. And according to treasury figures, just 4 per cent of privatisations planned for the first half of 2013 were implemented, with only $500m in assets sold.Officials have blamed recent global market conditions. But the reality is more complex.Launching a major privatisation plan during a market downturn is of course counter-intuitive. But the Russian markets have actually fallen by less than the MSCI emerging markets index. Russian stocks have traded on a multiple of four times forward earnings, compared with nine for the emerging markets as a whole, for some time. It seems likely that investors’ underwhelming appetite for taking stakes in Russia’s corporate crown jewels has as much to do with structural challenges such as transparency and the regulatory environment, as it has with broader macro-economic trends .But with major stakes in state giants and key infrastructure companies up for grabs – including parts of VTB Bank, Russian Railways, Aeroflot, Rosneft, Sovcomflot, RusHydro, as well as Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo airports, all set to be sold before 2017 – there is a renewed effort from Russian officials to breathe life into the programme.The key questions, however, are ones of risk calculation, the ownership of the process and how it is managed.State Solutions LLP, a political and lobbying advisory firm, together with the Moscow-based Institute of Lobbying, has launched a new study into privatisation opportunities. It finds that some investors are approaching the invest decision myopically: while financial market indicators are vital, political and contextual insights must play an equally large role in the decision-making process.Understanding this complex mix is especially difficult with an environment that is highly partisan at best, and clan-like at worst. The much-vaunted privatisation programme was a flagship project for then President Dmitry Medvedev – a symbol of his more liberal economic agenda. The business-minded liberals or “new oligarchs” who coalesced around him are the potential beneficiaries of the programme. On the other side sit the influential “clans” involved in managing state companies, who are closely linked to Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and have the most to lose from a genuine privatisation process.However, according to the experts and people close to the Kremlin administration, a wholesale ‘reset’ of privatisation may be on the horizon. In a move reminiscent of Putin’s second term (2004-2008), the ‘political’ prime minister Medvedev may be replaced by a ‘technical’ prime minister (the role played in 2004-2007 by Mikhail Fradkov, the current head of the Foreign Intelligence Service), while the political decisions would be taken by the Kremlin.Understanding these dynamics must play heavily on the investment decision-making process and should be balanced against the government’s warm public-facing words about the involvement of international investors in privatisation. The Russian political and legal environment and recent experiences of foreign players still play heavily on the minds of international investors.This is especially true for stakes in publicly traded companies large enough to influence corporate governance. These represent the riskiest acquisitions for a foreign investor. The most attractive deals will be those that do not infringe on the interests of the most powerful figures in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, which – although far reaching – still leaves space for opportunity.While these risks and a challenging economic climate may put off all but the boldest investors, they also make it possible to buy Russian assets at a considerable discount.The margins may not be great as the privatisations of the 1990s but, for the investors both foreign and domestic who can navigate the risks, the return on investment will be far higher than in comparable emerging markets. Factor in the political and contextual features of Russia’s economy, and as the privatisation programme gains momentum again, significant returns can be realised.Pavel Morozov is founder and managing partner, State Solutions LLP (London)Related reading:

409;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-11-05T22:37:38Z;EM equities: coming out of the doghouse;;"Emerging market stocks are feeling the love again.Investors who have led the summer stampede out of EM equities are slowly making their way back into once-battered markets like India, Indonesia and South Africa – lured by cheaper asset prices, the delay in Fed tapering and signs of improving EM growth fundamentals.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, having plunged by as much as 16.7 per cent between the first week of May and the end of June, has recovered nearly all its losses from this summer.At 1082.68, the index is down only 2.7 per cent for the year to date and is actually UP 2.7 per cent over a 12 month period.Even more remarkably perhaps is that within this, some markets – including those from members of the so-called Fragile Five (EMs with high current account deficits) – are actually now back in the black again.Stock markets in India and South Africa have not only recovered from this summer’s sell-off but the two have marched on to hit new record highs this month.The Sensex hit 21,239.36 in a special trading session on Sunday and the index is up 9.6 per cent this year in local currency terms. Ditto for South Africa’s benchmark Top-40 index, which closed at a fresh high of 40,929.70 on Tuesday, taking its gains for the year to over 21 per cent.Elsewhere for the year to date, the Jakarta Stock Exchange is up 4.4 per cent, Russia’s Micex index is up 6.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index is up 5.3 per cent.Brazil stocks have been the noted laggards, still down 11.5 per cent this year. Mexico’s IPC index are off 6 per cent while Turkey’s Borsa Istanbul are down 4.4 per cent.While the surprise delay in Fed taper is a big reason for the rally, dirt cheap valuations have also helped.As Julie Dickson, head of equities at Ashmore told beyondbrics:Valuations in emerging markets are too cheap to ignore – especially in cyclical areas of market. Emerging market equities are trading at 40% discount to developed markets.The view was echoed by JP Morgan Asset Management, which noted in a recent report:EM valuations are at historically attractive levels based on price-to-book (P/B) ratios…Current valuations remain in the lower end of a 1.5x–1.8x P/B range, or what we view as an “accumulate” level of valuation for the asset class.But for the rally to continue, growth will be key. And on this front, signs are looking positive.“Economic outlook in emerging markets is not as bad as markets thought this summer,” said Dickson from Ashmore. “Earnings are surprising on the positive side in India, Latin America; economic outlook in Korea and China is stronger than expected. Currencies have played a big role too and in some cases account for about 40-50% of rally when measured in USD terms.”The guys over at Société Générale also think things are looking up for EM growth:The latest round of manufacturing PMIs sent a reassuring message that EM growth is picking up. We will of course await confirmation with the hard data, but at least the leading indicators are pointing in the right direction. Only 3 countries in our sample produced a monthly decline of the PMI, namely Mexico, Hungary and Turkey. Meanwhile, the strongest improvement was registered in Russia, which is good news, although we still have concerns about the growth fundamentals there. If the stronger outlook for EM growth continues to improve, this will ultimately help support risk appetite to GEM, in our view.Related reading:

411;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Greece: back in the EM class;;"When index provider MSCI reclassified Greece as an EM back in June, there were a mixture of jokes doing the round about “submerging” rather than “emerging”.Fair enough. On Thursday, S&P Dow Jones Indices agreed, moving Greece down to EM as well. But what’s the actual implication? What stocks will be included?S&P Dow Jones said in its statement:The general consensus among participants is that emerging market status is a more appropriate classification due to the following reasons:Like a kid asked to stay back a year in school, Greece may actually benefit from being in the lower class, at least as far as some of its stocks are concerned. (However, being put in an EM index isn’t going to do anything to the country’s fiscal position.)As Deutsche Bank said in a recent note, which examined the effects of the MSCI change (with our emphasis):There are currently only two Greek stocks in any relevant MSCI index – OTE Hellenic Telecom and OPAP. However, demotion to emerging status gives the opportunity for smaller and less liquid stocks in Greece to join the MSCI universe, having failed to meet the more stringent criteria for inclusion whilst Greece was classified as a developed market. This means that the number of constituent Greek stocks could rise from the current level of two to a maximum of eleven. The clearest implication of this is that although Greece will still be a small constituent of the EM universe (up to 0.419% weighting), its prominence in this space will still be far higher than it is under its current classification as a developed market (0.020% weighting).So which are the stocks? Deutsche reckons a working list could be:But despite the fact that Greece doesn’t formally go back to the EM group until November, the market has already got to work. From Deutsche again:The subset of 11 Greek stocks which could potentially join the MSCI EM index have seen a rally of +50.7% in absolute USD terms since the first announcement of Greece’s demotion was made on 11 June 2013. This period marks the biggest and most sustained rally seen in Greek equities so far this year.But for all the talk of submerging markets, Deutsche points out that Greece was really an EM all along – it only joined the DM list in 2001, and that it has really reverted to its original state.Welcome home, Greece. There’s room in the EM classroom for you. Just don’t slip down to the frontier section.Related reading:

414;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-10-17T08:21:59Z;Debt ceiling and EM: time to fill your boots?;;"Is the “resolution” of the US debt ceiling drama a trigger to pile into EM? Benoit Anne at Société Générale thinks so. In a note on Thursday morning he told clients it created room for a sizeable rally in global emerging markets.But hasn’t that already happened?Here is Anne’s argument:All stars are aligned in our view, including signals that the Fed QE tapering is at risk of being further delayed, the improvement in EM technicals, the strengthening of EM growth fundamentals and more attractive valuation. In the near term, what we are going to watch closely is real-money investor behaviour, as we believe that they remain massively under-invested. Most of them were waiting for a trigger and the resolution of the US debt ceiling issue may now pave the way for a buying spree in GEM.Makes sense, especially the bit about QE tapering. The shutdown of the US government put data collection on hold, so it is inevitably going to be some time before the Fed has enough numbers to crunch in order to make any conclusion either way about whatever indicator may now be driving its decision making.But haven’t we known that for weeks?MSCI Emerging Markets index, May 1 to October 16“Real money investors have not been sitting on their hands,” says Bartosz Pawlowski, head of EM strategy at BNP Paribas in London. He says the daily returns published by the funds he tracks showed they were severely underperforming the index during the recent sell-off and in a big part of the September rally. “But in the past few weeks their returns began to resemble the index very closely, so the idea that people are very short risk is no longer valid.” He says this is borne out by conversations with real money managers.Indeed, the reaction in those EMs that were open when the news from DC came out on Wednesday was muted. The Brazilian real – a nice big, liquid market to pile into should you want to – weakened a bit against the dollar, closing at R$2.18 from its open of R$2.177.Not that real money will pile out of EM in “buy the rumour, sell the fact” fashion. While investors are not about to swing from underweight to overweight, says Pawlowski, they could well move from invested to a bit more invested in selected markets.Which markets are they? That, as they say, is another story – and not one directly related to the debt ceiling drama in Washington DC.Related reading:

415;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-10-08T17:29:29Z;ETF inflows rebound in September;Renewed interest in emerging markets ETFs;Inflows in exchange traded funds rebounded strongly in September after the US Federal Reserve surprised investors with its decision to continue with its extra-ordinary support measures for financial markets.ETFs (funds and products) attracted global net inflows of $35bn last month, a sharp recovery from July when investors withdrew $16.8bn, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends.Uncertainty about the outlook for US monetary policy has led to increased volatility in ETF flows since May when the Fed was first expected to signal its willingness to scale back or “taper” its $85bn a month bond buying programme.Raj Seshadri, head of ETP Insights at BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, said that the Fed’s surprise “no-taper” announcement in September had taken some pressure off interest rate sensitive assets and reduced the threat of volatility rising.As a result, investors moved heavily back into ETFs linked to the US and Canadian equity markets which attracted inflows of around $14.3bn last month.But Ms Seshadri also cautioned that volatility across asset markets was likely to pick up in October as investors’ attention focused on progress of the US debt ceiling and budget debates in Congress.Analysts at Société Générale warned that a correction for the US equity market was increasingly likely following its strong run since March 2009. The US stock market has delivered a total return (including dividends) of around 170 per cent since its post crisis low in March 2009. However, valuations have also recovered and the US stock market is now among the most expensive globally.“US equities are a crowded asset [class], corporate profitability is close to peak levels, while the number of companies disappointing on the earnings front is increasing”, said Roland Kaloyan of SocGen.Investors also showed renewed enthusiasm for ETFs linked to emerging market equities which gathered $6bn in September, their first substantial inflows since January.Ms Seshadri said valuations for emerging market equities were favourable compared with developed markets and that September’s ETF flows might signal the start of a shift back into this riskier asset class.Global fund managers remain heavily underweight in emerging markets, reflecting concerns about deteriorating current account and fiscal deficits in many countries.Markus Rosgen, an equity strategist at Citi, described sentiment towards emerging markets as “universally negative” so investors’ expectations were low.But he also noted that corporate operating margins were higher in emerging markets than for developed equities while valuations were lower.Mr Rosgen is forecasting that the MSCI emerging markets index could rise 20 per cent from its current level by the end of 2014.
416;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-09-30T19:06:49Z;Italian investors have escaped lightly;Even so, Italian shares do not look like a bargain;"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Italians might feel condemned to poor governance, with another government teetering on the brink of collapse thanks to Silvio Berlusconi. Italian shareholders should consider investment history, and be grateful.Italian shares, as measured by MSCI, are lower than they were in 1986, both in nominal terms and after adjusting for inflation and dividends. Losing money over 27 years might look painful; but it is nothing compared to the losses endured by Italians who bought shares in 1905. Academics Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton calculate this investment did not break even, after inflation and dividends, until 1977.Compared to this investors got off lightly yesterday. Italian shares dropped 1.2 per cent after Mr Berlusconi pulled his ministers from the coalition government, but the drop was not that much more than elsewhere, after poor Asian economic data and the threat of government shutdown in the US (Mr Berlusconi would be right at home in the US House of Representatives). Bond yields rose, but only by a couple of basis points – hardly a sign of a loss of faith.There are two obvious things going on. First, the surprise isn’t that the government might collapse, as that it was formed in the first place. Investors have low expectations of Italian politics: shares have lagged behind even austerity-hit Portugal this year, and returns have been well behind Spain, Ireland and Greece.Second, investors have learnt to ignore threats. There is still a chance the coalition scrapes together support from rogue members of Mr Berlusconi’s party and the opposition, or that Mr Berlusconi changes his mind again.Even taking this into account, Italian shares do not look like a bargain. Falling profits have pushed up the price-to-earnings multiple to the smallest discount to Germany since before the eurozone crisis began at the end of 2009."
417;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-09-27T17:50:55Z;QI is an option when good buys are scarce;Index is worth watching for clues about equities outlook;Even the world’s greatest stockpicker thinks there’s not much good value to be had. “We’re having a hard time finding things to buy,” admitted Warren Buffett recently. The Sage of Omaha is not alone, either.A four-and-a-half year long bull market fuelled by cheap money has swelled the valuations of assets across the board. And it’s not just the more speculative and downright trashy stuff that has been puffed, either. Shares in blue-chip firms with good dividend yields have also been snapped up by income-starved investors.The benefits of owning higher-yielding stocks are well known. In the long run, the lion’s share of equity returns come from the effect of re-investing dividends from them. Higher-yield stocks can also be prone to superior price performance, thereby giving us more bang for our buck.One of the best ways to track the fortunes of top-notch dividend-payers is with Société Générale’s Global Quality Income (QI) index, which is investible through a London-listed tracker fund.Currently, this index is made up of high-yielding blue-chips from four continents, and includes the likes of British American Tobacco, Roche and Lockheed Martin.QI’s performance over time speaks for itself. A €100 investment in Global QI in 1989 would have become €1,324 (£1,114) by the end of August 2013, after reinvesting dividends. The same €100 tied up in the MSCI World index would have become only €401.Even if it doesn’t grab you as an investment proposition, the index is still worth watching. That’s because a feast or famine of QI opportunities can give us important clues about the outlook for equities more generally.And now, the news isn’t great.Fewer than 2.2 per cent of stocks from the available universe made the cut for QI at the start of September. That’s towards the bottom end of the historic range. If history is any guide, developed market stocks – as measured by the MSCI World index – have roughly a two-thirds chance of falling over the coming year.The lack of opportunities isn’t good news for the QI index itself. The odds of it delivering a positive total return in the next year may only be about 50-50. That may be better than the outlook for developed world stocks as a whole, but neither rate as a fantastic buy.QI’s valuation, compared to stocks in general, underlines how investors have been scrambling to buy up assets with a good income. The index’s yield was recently about 4.7 per cent. Although that’s 1.8 times greater than that of the MSCI World index, it is also fairly low by past standards. When the difference is greater than 2, by contrast, the case for high income becomes more compelling.Still, none of this necessarily means we are heading for poor returns in equities. While neither has the edge over the other right now, both QI and the MSCI World index could easily post at least modest gains over the next 12 months, based on past valuations.If I am wrong about this, however, there is a clearer case for being invested in QI than developed world stocks more generally. During each of the last seven bear markets, QI has reliably done much better than the MSCI World Index. In the carnage of 2007-09, for example, it outperformed by 17 per cent, albeit by falling less.That said, I’m the first to admit that the prospects for equities are still too heavily reliant on further central bank largesse. The Federal Reserve’s decision last week to keep its money-printing drive going at the same intensity for now is good news in the short term. The longer this goes on though, the scarcer good-quality higher-yield assets will become – and the less protection they will then offer on the downside.Dominic Picarda CFA is associate editor of Investors Chronicle and author of its Market Tactics report
418;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-09-26T09:00:18Z;S Korea: top of the pay league by 2030?;;"Will South Koreans earn higher wages than the French, Germans, Americans and Brits in twenty years or so? Perhaps, according to a study published on Thursday by professional services firm PwC.The report forecasts that South Korea, which is still classed as an emerging market by the MSCI, will have the highest average wage in 2030, out of a group of 21 countries. The east Asian nation will profit from a declining population, the main driver of the rise in salaries.Compare this with 2011 wages and you see China rocketing up the chart, as Chinese workers gain more spending power. Mexico stays put relative to other countries, meaning that it could come to replace China as a cheap goods exporter to the US. (China’s average wage will exceed Brazil’s and come close to double Mexico’s average wage.)India and the Philippines may gain the attention of multinationals looking to invest low-wage economies in twenty years or so, says PwC’s chief UK economist John Hawksworth, but this is contingent on the countries pushing forward sensible reforms. The countries rank 132nd and 138th respectively on the World Bank’s ease of doing business index. Indonesia and Vietnam were not included in the study because of unreliable data, but Hawksworth says he expects them to play a similar role in the global economy in 2030.Of course, there are a number of important caveats. Unknown unknowns like wars, political turnarounds and setbacks cannot be predicted. And the model does not factor in future changes in commodity prices or the effects of a tightening US monetary policy, among other things.Nevertheless the model does take into account the fundamentals. First, wages in emerging markets will rise as labour productivity increases. Second, exchange rates are expected to get closer to purchasing power parity (PPP) as countries develop. This accounts for about half of the wage growth in India and cuts the level of wage rises for countries like Canada. As a final step, labour productivity is adjusted to account for the fact that wage rises historically lag behind labour productivity growth in advanced economies. (South Korea is counted as an advanced economy in the study.)India has the greatest percentage wage growth, owing to its low base. In China, much of the pay increase comes from productivity improvements. The surprise, Hawksworth says, is the extent to which the wages of emerging countries converge. Wage competition between emerging economies should fade away, if the model is correct.The chart is of course straighter than the reality. The interesting thing will be the bumps along the way.Related reading:

420;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-09-18T20:00:55Z;EM shorts: hammered;;By Arash MassoudiThe two largest emerging market exchange traded funds soared after the US Federal Reserve said it would continue its massive $85bn a month bond buying programme unchecked. The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF, which has a market cap of $53bn, gained 4 per cent and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with a $41bn market cap, rose 4.2 per cent.While news that the era of cheap money will continue is certainly one reason for the rally, beyondbrics also smelled plenty of burnt fingers.“People were betting on the Fed to taper and they didn’t so now they (investors) have to re-weight their investments. If you were short emerging markets or interest rates, this news will force you…to adjust,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group.Indeed, the word among traders on Wednesday is that EM shortsellers are getting hammered and the need for short cover is another factor that has been driving up prices for EM assets.Short sellers, typically hedge funds, borrow the stock from existing shareholders in a bet that they will be able to buy it back cheaper in the future. But they are notoriously vulnerable to a so-called short squeeze when a big, surprise announcement such as Wednesday’s Fed no tapering news breaks. ETFs have emerged in recent years a popular way for traders to play emerging markets.
421;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-09-17T15:30:21Z;The EM sell-off: buying opportunity?;;"EM investors appear to be polarising, between those who think the sell-off since May is a mere taster of the great unwinding still to come, and those who think it is a buying opportunity. Richard Titherington, chief investment officer for emerging market equities at JPMorgan Asset Management, is among the latter. He has made this call before and, so far, he has been right.Back in July, Titherington told beyondbrics that the sell-off in EM equities had been overdone and that at some point they would stage a recovery. It turns out the recovery was already under way. Since June 24, the MSCI Emerging Markets index has gained 13.4 per cent, rather better than the 7.9 per cent return on the S&P 500 (see chart above).This from our report in July:Since nobody can say when precisely [a] market recovery will come, investors have to buy in advance of the rally – or risk being left behind. And the best time to buy is when valuations are low, as they are today. Titherington told beyondbrics: “There’s a lot of things to worry about. Currencies and equities are under pressure and economic prospects are uncertain. But valuations are low.”In a note to clients due out this week, Titherington returns to that point about valuations. History, he writes, shows that investors should buy on pessimism:Optimism among international investors (as reflected in valuations) rises as earnings and profitability improve and declines as they fall. Consequently, at market peaks, emerging market equities appear to be low risk with high return on equity (ROE) and strong earnings growth. At market troughs, the reverse is true: ROE falls, earnings disappoint and pessimism abounds.Here is Titherington’s chart showing the relationship between the price-to-book ratio of EM equities on a sliding scale of sentiment:Crucial to Titherington’s case is the idea that what we see above is a cycle that will be repeated, and EM equities will continue to gain in value as they have for the past two and a half months.Why should one believe that? After all, with an unwinding of QE3 in the offing, couldn’t the low valuations of EM equities represent a new normal? (Remember, even after their recent recovery, the MSCI EM index is still 25 per cent below its peak in 2007.)Titherington thinks not. “I think the EM story is still relatively immature,” he told beyondbrics. “Most emerging markets have a long way to develop and we’re not at the end of that process at all. There have been a lot of road blocks during the past 20 years and nothing has brought their development to an end.”Titherington also rejects any idea that the emerging world could be on the brink of a crisis similar to those that destroyed so much value in the 1990s. “Currencies are more freely floating now than then,” he says. It’s not pleasant if your currency devalues, but it’s a lot better than the consequences of trying to hold it to a peg.So are today’s valuations an entry point? “It’s interesting that EM equities started going up a couple of months ago in spite of all the negative headlines. I feel we have already turned the corner.”Related reading:

423;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Emerging markets: fight or flight;Are investors who are withdrawing money getting carried away?;The Canadian snooker player Bill Werbeniuk was famed for consuming up to 50 pints of lager to calm his nerves for a big game. Emerging market investors may want to consider their own strategy for dealing with recent market jitters. Ever since the US Federal Reserve hinted that it would start to taper its quantitative easing programme, capital flight from emerging markets has sent stocks tumbling. The MSCI Emerging Market index is down almost a sixth since May. Are investors getting carried away?After all, not every emerging market has taken a fall. Just look at Argentina, Vietnam, Nigeria and Macedonia as examples. The Buenos Aires main index is up almost a quarter in dollar terms since the start of the year. And in spite of the hysteria over Brazil’s real, the Bovespa stock market index has been rallying since July, as has Russia’s benchmark index. Both are up 8 per cent over the past two months alone. Granted, equity markets in Turkey and Indonesia have fallen by more than a quarter since their peaks this year, but they are at levels seen many times during the past five years. India’s Nifty index has only slipped to its 200-day moving average, where it has been seven times in the past four years.In any case, as far as price is concerned, emerging market equity valuations are no longer exorbitant. Russia’s Micex index trades on five times expected earnings. It has hovered at this level for the past two years, but remains 25 per cent below its long-term average. The multiple for Brazil’s Bovespa index is 15 times – above its five-year average of 12 times, but it has been to 18 times twice over that period. And with India’s Nifty index trading on 13 times expected earnings it may not be a screaming buy – it fell to 8 times in 2008 – but it is still only half as expensive as it was back in March 2010.Sure, all bets are off if interest rates in the developed world start rising quickly. The flood of liquidity has been a big driver of emerging market equities since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. But these funds must go somewhere. Asia still has a current account surplus. And the US and Europe remain fragile.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
424;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-08-15T16:34:59Z;Tobacco – volume and value;Sector gets used to dealing with stricter regulation;"Like smoke from Frank Sinatra’s cigarette the global tobacco sector has climbed 40 per cent over the past two years. That is half as much again as the MSCI world index – hardly what investors might have expected given ever tighter regulation. Yet tobacco companies, especially those geared towards emerging markets, continue to perform well and regulation does not yet spell the end for the industry.Consider Imperial Tobacco. With two-thirds of operating profits coming from developed markets it is hugely exposed to the challenges facing tobacco groups. In its nine-month trading update on Thursday, the company reported volumes that were down by 7 per cent. But sales only fell 3 per cent. Price increases in Europe helped to offset declining demand. Higher taxes and regulation are not hurting revenues to the same extent as volumes.A good example of this is the UK, one of the most heavily regulated and taxed tobacco markets. From 1996 to last year Imperial’s cigarette volumes dropped from 31bn to 19bn. Revenues after duty, however, have increased by 50 per cent to almost £1bn, notes Goldman Sachs. Profits have grown even faster; Imperial’s UK operating margin of 67 per cent is now the highest in the industry.Still, even harsher regulation may limit pricing power in the future. Australia started enforcing plain cigarette packaging last December. If consumers cannot differentiate between brands, they may focus instead on price. So far, reports on the impact of this regulation have been mixed – and Australia remains an exception. Tobacco companies are scrambling for other sources of growth nevertheless. Both British American Tobacco and Imperial have been investing in electronic cigarettes, for example. It is thought that 1m of the UK’s 10m smokers are now inhaling them.Overall, the emerging world still has the best prospects. That favours BAT, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris. Tobacco prices in these markets remain well below those in mature countries, which means big potential whatever risks lie ahead.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

He follows chief executive Ester Levanon, who quit a week ago over lack of backing by the board and Mr Bronfeld for her plans to revive falling liquidity at the exchange.The exchange suffered a blow in June when MSCI, the index compiler, chose not include Israel in its Europe index. It was a setback to the exchange, which had lobbied to be included to help it remain in portfolio investors’ sights and lure up to $2bn in capital into the market. Ms Levanon had sought to encourage greater investment in the market by asking the ISA to relax limits on Israeli investors’ ability to invest more in their market and was increasingly going public in her stance.Mr Bronfeld, who has been at the exchange for nearly 30 years, said he had to quit his role because of “hostile” control by the ISA.“The authority blames the bourse for all the damages done to the capital markets by disproportional regulation,” he said in his resignation letter.He also accused the authority of “intervening beyond reason in the executive management of the bourse and impaired proper management.”Mr Bronfeld was chief executive from 1991-2006 before moving up to chairman. His resignation comes a day after the ISA wrote a letter to the TASE saying Mr Bronfeld had failed in his job.Shmuel Hauser, chairman of the ISA, said in a statement that the Tel Aviv bourse would “emerge from these latest developments strengthened”.

As long as China is groping towards a new growth model, investors are likely to take bad data badly.That was the case on Wednesday, when a muted Chinese purchasing managers’ survey rubbed out some of Tuesday’s gains. Efforts to prop up currencies in India, Indonesia and Turkey will also keep nerves on edge.Valuations seem tempting. But some of the sheen comes off if investors take account of abnormally large weightings in sectors under pressure.In the MSCI China index, for example, 60 per cent of net profits last year came from the banks.However, banks’ margins should now be squeezed by Beijing’s decision to scrap floors on loan rates while keeping caps on deposit rates.Re-adjust China’s sectors so that they are the same as those in the MSCI World index, and its companies’ forward price/earnings ratio climbs from 7.6 times to 9.7 times, on HSBC calculations. It is a similar story in Brazil, with the miners.Against this, the world’s biggest equity market in the US does not look too bad. Growth is holding up, the central bank is still committed to stimulus and valuations remain around the long-run average.Amid a summer lull – no Fed official is scheduled to say anything this week – it has seemed as good a place as any to shelter. Hence the widening gap between the prices of exchange traded funds tracking the S&P 500 and the MSCI EM indices, which hit a record high this week.It looks like a familiarity premium.
428;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
429;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-07-21T03:39:18Z;Frontier markets are not for the faint-hearted;Despite delivering good results, fund managers remain cautious of risky frontiers;Investors with strong stomachs and an appetite for exotic countries such as Vietnam, Kazakhstan or Tanzania have been rewarded with good news.Some of these far-flung economies, known as frontier markets, have turned in a more robust investment performance than the more established emerging markets. In the first six months of the year, the MSCI Emerging Markets index fell 4.4 per cent, while the MSCI Frontier Markets index rose 14.3 per cent.The outperformance is partly attributable to a “lower correlation between frontier markets and the MSCI World and the S&P World [indices]. Frontiers have not reacted to Bernanke’s comments,” says Emily Fletcher, co-fund manager of BlackRock’s Frontiers Investment Trust, which invests in companies across 21 frontier markets.Comments by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in May regarding an easing back of the US emergency bond-buying programme made many investors jittery, triggering a sharp exit from equity and bond markets.Frontier markets, however, are mostly driven by local investors with a different and often more domestic investment perspective, argues Ms Fletcher.The fillip in frontier markets is certainly a boost for those exposed to the asset class. However, it poses the question of whether investor appetite extends to transition countries such as Myanmar, which is moving from an authoritarian military system to a more democratic form of government, and from a closed economy to a market-orientated one.Although international companies have been flocking to the southeast Asian country to get a foot in the door, fund managers are much more cautious, saying it is still early days.“Myanmar is getting a lot of attention but it is not investable, although we think it will be interesting in the future, like Cambodia and Algeria,” says Slim Feriani, chief executive and chief investment officer at Advance Emerging Capital.At the moment, Myanmar still lacks a stock exchange, limiting the range of asset classes available to investors. “There is no universe to invest on the public side,” says Zin Bekkali, chief executive of Silk Invest, another emerging market specialist, who also believes the country has “inherent instability, politically and economically”.Fund managers point to the beginnings of private equity investment in Myanmar, but even gaining exposure to this is limited and difficult, they say.Much of the excitement about the country opening up has also led to valuations becoming too high. “Myanmar is expensive and this is another downside,” according to Mr Bekkali.He prefers neighbouring Bangladesh. There are more investable companies and opportunities, and valuations are cheaper.Investment in frontier countries involves a large slice of risk for companies, particularly those who are outsourcing, and for investors. This was highlighted by a disaster in Bangladesh in April, when Rana Plaza, a building in Dhaka housing several clothing factories, collapsed, resulting in the death of more than 1,100 workers.Garment industries are often the first ones moving into transition countries and they struggle at first, so risk is always a factor for early arrivals, points out Mark Robertson, a spokesman at the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange, which focuses on responsible and ethical business practices within global supply chains.He sees “huge potential in Myanmar, but corruption and a lack of transparent, responsive and accountable business practices mean the inherent risks of doing business in the country are high.”“Given the high-risk profile of transition economies it is important that decisions are risk informed,” he says.Experience from other countries in the region, such as Cambodia and Vietnam, shows that mechanisms to track, monitor and report risks are vital, he adds.Iraq, another transition country, offers better opportunities for investors than Myanmar at present, and is uncorrelated to other markets, says Geoffrey Batt, manager of the Euphrates Iraq fund.Described as a hedge fund but investing solely in the stocks of companies based or operating in Iraq, the fund has about $61m of assets under management, returning 47 per cent in the 12 months to the end of June, according to Bloomberg.Investments focus on consumer stocks such as Baghdad Soft Drinks, and sectors such as real estate, construction and hotels, an exposure for which investors pay a 2 per cent annual management charge and a 20 per cent performance fee. The fund launched in 2010.Iraq is not for the fainthearted and few investors have exposure in their portfolios, says Mr Batt, but there are good opportunities and valuations are cheap.Investors are largely retail, including wealthy individuals, but many pension funds are still constrained by Iraq’s custody arrangements.Mr Batt believes it will be “a long time before there will be a capital market for foreign investors in Myanmar, one of the last frontier markets in Asia with scale”.Other changes are taking place in frontier markets. MSCI, the index provider, has announced plans to upgrade the United Arab Emirates and Qatar from frontier to emerging market status next May.The two countries, attractive to frontier specialists such as Ms Fletcher, will lose some of their appeal when they move up to emerging market status. Ms Fletcher is already planning an exit over the coming months.Investors in frontier markets are always hunting for the next opportunity, but most fund managers agree the valuations and timing must also be right.“The time will come for countries such as Myanmar but we don’t think the risk/return trade-off is there yet. It is the same for Iran and Iraq,” says Mr Feriani.
430;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-07-12T16:44:27Z;How to choose the right ETF;Navigating your way through the jungle;"In the US, exchange traded funds (ETFs) have revolutionised investment and are now widely owned by ordinary investors. Over the past decade, a quiet revolution has overtaken the world of European fund management, too. ETFs are based on the “passive” tracking of an index rather than paying a fund manager to pick securities, which means they are much cheaper to run. They are traded on stock exchanges like a share and offer access to a wide variety of asset classes. But the growth of the industry has created challenges. We offer advice about how to choose the right ETF.Investigate your indexIndices tracking key stocks or bonds listed on a financial market have been around for at least a hundred years, but until recently they were largely used as a reference point for investors and fund managers.An actively managed fund, for instance, might compare its performance to that of a well-known index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or more modern variations such as the FTSE 100 in the UK. Some active funds benchmark against inflation or interest rates. But index tracking funds take a different approach; they actually copy the constituents of an index as closely as possible. The logic, backed up by a huge weight of academic evidence, is that it’s largely pointless actively to pick stocks or bonds and most managers that end up underperforming the index over longer periods. Better to just copy what the rest of the market is buying by investing in all the components of an index.But index tracking as an approach does require the investor to really understand what is in the index. If you buy a FTSE 100 tracker, for instance, are you aware that it’s dominated by mining and oil and gas shares, thanks to the weights of Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and others? If you buy a product that tracks the MSCI emerging markets index, you are buying a big chunk of exposure to South Korea, which many now consider a developed market. Three companies dominate the market for index provision: MSCI and Standard & Poor’s in the US, and FTSE International in London. Their websites provide more detail on how indices are weighted and calculated. Many ETFs track “total return” indices, where dividends or coupons are reinvested in more securities rather than paid out as income.www.ftse.comwww.mscibarra.com——————————————-Consider the structureTracking or copying the constituents of an index can be more complicated than it sounds. The fund manager must change the portfolio mix dynamically and the replication of the index constituents must be as accurate as possible.That can be a problem when the index has a lot of constituents. Some fund management groups, notably Deutsche Bank and SocGen, have responded to this by using “synthetic” replication. This involves a large investment bank writing an IOU promising to pay the ETF provider the exact return from an index, backed up by an option called a swap. The provider deposits collateral that can be sold in an emergency – typically the collateral is blue-chip shares, government bonds or money-market funds that can be sold quickly. This synthetic approach minimises tracking error and can reduce costs but introduces counterparty risk – the issuer of the IOU could go bust.The alternative approach is called physical tracking, iShares is the main player here, and involves buying shares (or bonds) in an index and holding them in the fund. This reduces counterparty risk but tracking error could increase and trading costs certainly will. It doesn’t eliminate counterparty risk altogether, because physical ETFs often lend stock to reduce their costs – and the counterparty in that transaction could in turn go bust.
www.etf.db.com/uk
uk.ishares.com——————————————-Look beyond the TERMany of the most powerful advocates of index tracking funds emphasise the lower costs of these investments compared to actively managed funds – total expense ratios (TERs) can be as low as 0.10 per cent. But lower fund costs aren’t the only story. Tracking error is also hugely important – it describes how closely the fund tracks the underlying index, and should ideally be as low as possible. Another issue to consider is the spread, the difference between buying and selling prices of ETFs. On large ETFs, the spread is likely to be very small. But because these funds trade on a stock exchange, the bid-ask spread can vary enormously, especially for smaller funds where the spread is controlled by market makers and is often in excess of 1 per cent.www.indexuniverse.eu——————————————-Remember the risksCounterparty risk for synthetic ETFs and stock lending risk for physical ETFs aren’t the only issues to watch out for. Look at how much money is managed in the fund and be careful about investing in an ETF where the assets under management are under £10m. This fund might struggle to make a profit and there’s a chance the fund could eventually be closed. Investors in ETFs which track bond indices (very popular in recent years) also need to be mindful of the fact that they’re essentially weighting their investment towards bond issuers who borrow the most – not the issuers with the lowest credit risk. Remember that most indices weight the constituents by market capitalisation of their constituents, rewarding the biggest companies by market value (for shares) and the biggest debt issuers (for bonds). But biggest is not always best. ETFs give quick and cheap access to overseas markets, but this may introduce exchange rate risk – even if the fund’s units are priced in sterling. Finally, be aware that “short” and “leveraged” ETFs are only really suitable for those trading over very short periods (meaning a few days). The way ETF returns compound means that tracking quickly breaks down over longer periods.——————————————-Taxation and regulationETFs are covered by pan-European “Ucits” (undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities) legislation, which requires a degree of diversification and minimum levels of collateral. Most ETFs are listed on different exchanges across Europe, but many are domiciled in places such as Dublin or Luxembourg – usually so that income can be received into the fund free of local taxation at source. Because ETFs are exchange-traded, there is no Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection if the fund goes bust.Most ETFs can be held within most tax wrappers such as individual savings accounts and self-invested personal pensions, where capital gains and any income will not be taxed. ETFs are also exempt from the 0.5 per cent stamp duty that shares attract. ETFs may be “capitalising” (meaning the dividends are reinvested) or “distributing” (meaning they are paid out). Many higher-rate taxpayers prefer capitalising ETFs as all gains are taxed as capital, whereas the dividends from distributing ETFs are treated as income."

433;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-07-02T21:53:25Z;Bovespa: when will the sliding stop?;;"One day Brazilian stocks are going to get cheap enough to lure the bargain hunters back in en masse. Alas Tuesday was not to be the day.The Bovespa index suffered its steepest one day drop in nearly two years – closing down 4.2 per cent at 45,228.95, its lowest level since April 2009. This takes the bourse’s losses this year to 25.8 per cent, making it the worst performer among the the major markets.The losses suffered by the Bovespa far outpaced those seen in the wider market. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1 per cent to 932.12 while the S&P 500 ended the day almost unchanged at 1,614.08. Mexico’s IPC index snapped a five-day rally with a 0.84 per cent fall and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.7 per cent.“Everyone seems to be trying to stay as far as possible from anything Brazilian, from equities to currency,” Fausto Gouveia, a fund manager at Legan Administracao de Recursos, told Bloomberg.Tuesday’s poor industrial production numbers did little to help sentiments. Output shrunk 2 per cent in May compared to April. The market had been expecting a 1.1 per cent month-on-month decline. In a note to clients, Nomura said Brazil may fall into a recession in Q4 this year as tighter monetary policy in the U.S. curbs capital flows to Latin America.The real weakened 1 per cent to 2.2507 per dollar.Adding further fuel to the sell-off is the ongoing crisis at Eike Batista’s EBX group of companies. Shares of OGX, Batista’s flagship oil company, fell another 20 per cent to R$0.45, while MMX Mineracao e Metalicos and LLX Logistica SA, dropped 15.8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.After Tuesday’s fall, the Bovespa is now trading on 11.52 times 2013 estimated earnings. compared with 10.22 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets index and 16.5 times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to Bloomberg data.“Brazil has gotten cheaper but investors are sitting on the sidelines because they think the stocks can fall further still,” one EM fund manager told beyondbrics, citing the weakening macro outlook as well as the mass public protests that have shaken the country in recent weeks.Yet as the FT’s Joe Leahy pointed out, the latter could offer a silver lining to some Brazilian stocks.On the one hand, there is the chance that Brazil’s biggest demonstrations in more than two decades could deliver a potential “protest dividend” for listed companies, as demands for better public services leads the government to pour more money into education, infrastructure and public health.And indeed, shares in Brazil’s education companies have easily outperformed the wider Bovespa index over the past 12 months.But as Leahy added:On the other, however, the government could become more averse to passing on price increases to consumers, leading private sector operators of utilities stuck with the bill.Related reading:

434;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-27T14:45:45Z;Russia privatisation: don’t bet on it;;"To nobody’s great surprise, Russia on Thursday revealed that it was cutting in half its target for privatisation revenues for 2014-16.The government blamed the financial markets. But the truth is that Russian assets are hard to sell at the best of times. The country needs the economic reforms that president Vladimir Putin has often spoken about, including at the recent St Petersburg Economic Forum, but has so far largely failed to deliver.As Reuters reported, the State Property Agency slashed its 2014 privatisation revenue forecast to Rbs180bn ($5.5bn), down from around Rbs350bn, with similar cuts in 2015 and 2016. The revisions came with an estimate that this year’s privatisation revenues are likely to reach just Rbs60bn, or 14 per cent of their original target.“The current state of financial markets is such that it would, with rare exceptions, be impossible to avoid lasting damage from selling stakes in these companies,” Olga Dergunova, head of the property agency, said, according to Reuters.Dergunova has been preparing the ground. As long ago as the beginning of April she was warning that the Cyprus crisis could have Moscow delaying this year’ planned sales from spring/summer to the autumn. And that was before the US Federal Reserve put markets into a spin.But, as the chart shows, the Russian markets has actually fallen by less than the MSCI emerging markets index. The fact is that investors have a list of Russia-specific concerns which Putin has not addressed, mostly to do with corruption, a lack of transparency and the weakness of the rule of law.The Russian stock market trades on a multiple of just 4 times forward earnings, compared with 9 for the emerging markets as a whole. And this discount has changed little in recent years. It has little to do with financial market blips and a lot to do with Russia’s structural challenges.Privatisation has been pursued half-heartedly at best. Since Putin returned to the Kremlin for his third term in May last year, the biggest business deal in Russia has been a de facto nationalisation – state-run Rosneft’s $55bn acquisition of the Anglo-Russian oil venture TNK-BP, where the sellers were BP, a listed company, and a group of Russian oligarchs.The state did sell a chunk of Sberbank, the bank, for $5bn, last year. For next year, the key proposal is to privatise Rostelecom, the telecoms operator, with a slice of VTB, the bank, in 2015, and the privatisation of Russian Railways in 2016.Acknowledging the Putin administration’s preference for keeping control of assets, Dergunova proposed selling stakes in Russian Railways and state oil pipeline monopoly Transneft either to state-controlled pensions or welfare funds.There was no mention of the oil giant Rosneft, where the state owns 69.5 per cent. It is more saleable than most of the assets on the government’s books and the administration’s small band of economic liberals have occasionally proposed sales plans. But its powerful managers and their political boss Igor Sechin aren’t keen.Ivan Tchakarov of Renaissance Capital says the latest developments are part of a disappointing pattern:When former President [Dmitry] Medvedev unveiled [his] 5-year grand vision for privatization in the summer of 2010, the market was buzzing with anticipation that the Russian government has finally decided to reduce its participation in the economy as a way to streamline efficiency and stopgap diminishing oil revenues in the budget.The original plan was calling for USD10-15bn of annual state asset sales starting from 2010. However, not in a single year has Russia been able to meet these already modest objectives, with the most annual revenues reaching only USD7bn. The usual explanation has been that unfavorable market conditions have militated against the objective of state disinvestment.However, with the economy struggling to grow and probably hitting the middle-income trap, a more vibrant private sector is critical to nourishing the proper environment that would be conducive to stimulating growth. In that sense, the MinEcon proposal does not exactly illicit bright visions about medium-term sustainable economic development in the country.It is this last point that is, ultimately, the most important. Russia may be able to do with out the revenues from privatisation. But it cannot do without the economic modernisation that privatisation has brought to other countries.Related reading:

435;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EM sell-off: where are the bottom-fishers?;;"Those hoping that bargain hunters would bring some respite to the sell-off in emerging market assets were left disappointed on Monday.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell for the fifth consecutive day, dropping 1.7 per cent to 885.39 – a 12-month low.Chinese stocks led the way in losses. The CSI 300 – an index of shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen – lost 6.3 per cent, and has now fallen 21 per cent from its February peak, putting it into bear market territory. The Hang Seng China enterprises index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong dropped 3 per cent to its lowest since April 2009.Latin America was also hit by another bout of selling. Brazil’s Bovespa fell 2.3 per cent to 45,965.05, taking its losses this year to 24.6 per cent. Mexico’s IPC index also retreated, dropping 1.4 per cent to 37,517.36. Chile’s IPSA index closed down 0.5 per cent while Peru’s IGBVL index dropped 2.4 per cent.Russia was the notable exception. The Micex index closed up 0.16 per cent at 1,292.37. Turkey’s Borsa Istanbul was down 3.4 per cent at 70,640.50.“The wave of public protests across EMs have been reinforcing the negative sentiments in the markets,” Jason Press, a director of global markets at Eurasia Group, told beyondbrics.While news that the US Federal Reserve could start scaling back its massive bond buying programme this year helped spark the sell-off last week, China’s credit crunch and the ongoing public protests in Brazil and Turkey appeared to have further shaken investors’ appetite for emerging markets assets.“It’s hard to say when the selling will bottom out,” said Press. “Valuations might be falling but there is still too much uncertainty, particularly in the political realm, to entice bargain hunters just yet.”Emerging market bonds have not been spared from the selling. Yields on Brazil’s USD 10-year sovereign are now at 4.65 per cent compared to a recent low of 2.59 per cent on May 1. Meanwhile, spreads on Brazil’s 5-year USD credit default swaps have risen to 211bps, up over 100bps compared to 106bps on May 2 and 150bps as recent as June 14, before the protests.Yields for JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Diversified Index, which tracks dollar debt, closed at 6.674 per cent on Monday – a 131bps increase from just a little over a month ago. Yields on the GBI EM Global Diversified Index, which tracks local currency bonds, hit 5.901 per cent last Friday, compared to 4.674 per cent on May 22.Higher borrowing costs could have a further knock-on effect on the ability of big emerging markets to revive their sluggish economies. Brazil has already seen its outlook cut to negative by Standard & Poor’s while India is in danger of losing its investment grade rating.As Benoit Anne, strategist at Société Générale, put it in a note to clients on Monday, all-in-all it’s “a nightmarish global emerging markets backdrop”:There are many more risks surfacing now, which leads me to think that GEM are attacked on all fronts. Moving East, there are reasons to be seriously concerned about China, given the financial stability and growth issues that the latest developments have raised…What this does in the near term is to add fuel to the fire, not only in Asia but across all EM, as an additional source of risk to investor sentiment…Meanwhile, it looks like the backdrop in the eurozone is once again deteriorating sharply. Greece makes the headlines with its perpetual financing hole…And to make this worse, the fundamentals in EM are under pressure, especially when it comes to the social picture in a few large countries (Brazil and Turkey, of course).I am trying hard to find something to say but I miserably fail at this point. A nightmarish GEM backdrop. Now at some point, valuations in EM will start looking particularly good, but this consideration is quite premature for now.Related reading:

436;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-23T03:30:36Z;Vanguard’s $500bn ETF gamble is already showing signs of paying off;Analysts expected investors to flee the company but they remained loyal;Vanguard’s evangelisation of the low-cost model for investing is legendary, and the company is not afraid to make bold moves to further its efforts. It will do so even when its actions cause big shockwaves in the US mutual fund industry – as the asset manager’s chief executive, William McNabb, found out six months ago.When the index fund company decided to move more than $500bn in 22 mutual funds and exchange traded funds from the well-known MSCI benchmarks to lesser-known indices last autumn, the potential cost savings were the driver.“For me it was actually pretty simple. This is a great thing to do in the long run for the shareholder,” says Mr McNabb.“We fully recognised there might be negative consequences from a commercial standpoint in the short run. But the math was really compelling and, as it turns out, I think the timing was great.”Analysts expected institutional investors benchmarked to MSCI indices to flee Vanguard. Several large exchange traded fund (ETF) users publicly questioned the moves to indices run by FTSE and the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). And Vanguard’s largest ETF competitor, BlackRock, claimed to see improved flows as a result of the index changes.But, so far, Mr McNabb’s gamble appears to be paying off. Since the October bombshell, sales of all but a handful of the company’s affected funds and ETFs have continued at about the same pace as before the announcement.The index swap is just the most recent example of the firm’s tradition of shaking up the retail fund industry, with its gospel of low-cost, diversified and largely passive investing. The message was not always well received, but 35 years on, the company has grown to $2tn in assets under management, and is the largest mutual fund manager in the US. Vanguard’s corporate identity is inextricably tied to low costs, including its shareholder-owned corporate structure, which Vanguard says enables the funds to charge only their operating costs. But that model did not catch on for some time among investors enamoured by star fund managers.The first turning point in the company’s efforts to make low-cost, largely passive investing stick was in the 1990s, when investors began looking at costs in a different light.The other inflection point, in Mr McNabb’s eyes, was the development of the low-cost exchange traded fund.Vanguard was late to the ETF game. When it launched the Vipers in 2001 – now branded as Vanguard ETFs – the company watched State Street Global Advisors and iShares, now a part of BlackRock, dominate the market for index funds traded on the stock exchange.In the mid-2000s, Vanguard began to see the power of the ETF, particularly among financial advisers, but the financial crisis halted any efforts to capitalise on it. Mr McNabb himself took over the chief executive role from John Brennan a few weeks before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, triggered the financial crisis.But the market’s stabilisation in 2009 gave Vanguard the bandwidth to explore a more aggressive ETF strategy. “We really needed to step back and ask ourselves, ‘What do we want to look like going forward?’ It was really at that time that we began a very differentiated approach to how we were going to talk about ETFs, and how we were going to work with advisers.”“It wasn’t like flipping a switch, but I would say we hit the accelerator pretty hard,” says Mr McNabb.Vanguard’s embrace of the ETF coincides with rapid asset growth at the company. Since 2008, it has roughly doubled its assets under management, with ETFs making up $285bn of those assets, as of April.The introduction of larger and more aggressive players into the ETF market – including Charles Schwab in 2009 – and corresponding new products in the same asset classes, placed even greater emphasis on cost.Schwab introduced the commission-free brokerage concept to ETFs, which was followed by Vanguard as well as iShares in a relationship with Fidelity’s brokerage business.Last year brought the fee debate on ETFs to a new level. In September, Charles Schwab slashed fees on its 15 ETFs, undercutting Vanguard in many cases, to offer the lowest-cost option in its category.The following month, iShares rolled out its core line-up of lower-cost ETFs targeted at the long-term investor – an area that had been Vanguard’s primary domain.Vanguard says it had projected out the costs associated with the licensing fees for its indices, and had begun exploring other business models to reduce those costs relative to the costs of the funds. But Mr McNabb insists that switching index providers was not planned at the outset.“We didn’t know what we were going to do, but we felt the resistance. We didn’t think there would be an appetite to really change the business model dramatically from our other providers,” says Mr McNabb.Vanguard had worked on other index funds with FTSE, best known for its index of the largest companies trading on the London Stock Exchange. But its relationship with the CRSP – which is part of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business – had been primarily a research and academic partnership.Mr McNabb says the commercial partnership with the CRSP on many of its domestic equity index ETFs will give investors lower costs and an improved index on which to invest.The most controversial index change was in Vanguard’s emerging markets index fund and ETF. While MSCI characterises South Korea as an emerging market, and makes up about 15 per cent of the Emerging Markets Index, FTSE considers the country to be a developed market with no exposure in the FTSE Emerging Index.It was a bitter pill for some advisers and institutional investors to swallow. Vanguard followed up the October announcement with webinars and face-to-face meetings with large investors to explain the decision.Nonetheless, the company’s sales took a temporary hit. In November, the emerging markets ETF posted an $887m outflow, compared with inflows of $2.3bn for its rival, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to data from Morningstar. Vanguard’s net sales lagged behind iShares’ main emerging markets product to the end of 2012 into 2013.Vanguard’s rivals were quick to claim victory. “We are seeing flows into our existing products because of the changes in index providers with our competitor,” said BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink in an October earnings call. He said institutional investors wanted to use the MSCI indices.Mr McNabb admits there was a contingent within Vanguard that questioned the timing of the index swap, given the rapid sales growth and market share gains. He says he understands why, particularly in the emerging markets product, it took investors some time to process the impact of the changes. But he argues that many investors have placed their faith in the company.“There is a trust factor that has been earned over the past 30-odd years, in a sense that, ‘Why would Vanguard make this change if it wasn’t good for us?’ I think they got that message,” Mr McNabb says.As for when investors will begin to feel the savings, Mr McNabb says the company cannot project costs, but expense ratios should shrink every reporting period. The savings will be substantial, he says.“When you add it all up, it is billions over the lifetime of a contract,” he says.
437;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-21T17:00:27Z;ETF providers reject ‘stress’ reports;Price discovery function intact in times of market stress;BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors have rejected reports that recent asset market volatility caused “stress” in their exchange traded funds operations.ETFs have seen significant outflows during June with investors pulling money from funds linked to emerging markets.BlackRock’s iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, known as EEM, had its busiest trading session of the year on Thursday. During Thursday’s session, the market price of EEM also moved to a large discount to the net asset value of its underlying index.ETFs are designed to track closely their underlying NAV so the 6.5 per cent discount which opened up was unusual.But Leland Clemons, head of capital markets for iShares in Europe, said EEM had “performed efficiently as a vehicle for real-time price discovery” during Thursday’s session.Mr Clemons pointed out that several emerging markets were already closed during European and US trading hours which meant that the NAV estimate for EEM calculated at the close of trading on Wednesday was “stale”.Arbitrageurs use prices from US futures and currency markets to calculate more timely NAV estimates for ETFs during the hours when local trading in emerging markets is closed.One senior ETF trader said that a more realistic estimate of EEM’s discount on Thursday was around 1 per cent.Mr Clemons pointed out that ETFs in other asset classes had also move to large discounts to their underlying net asset value in previous times of market stress.A notable example was the behaviour of Japanese ETFs in US and European trading hours during the tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis which affected Japan in 2011.ETFs tracking credit markets also moved to large discounts during the financial crisis when some of their underlying holdings became illiquid.“Risks have to be priced in by ETF market participants,” said Mr Clemons.He argued that investors in EEM had an advantage in knowing the accurate value of their holdings over those investors that had bought locally listed securities in emerging markets and which had to wait until trading in those regions restarted on Friday.A trading volume of $5.7bn was registered for EEM on Thursday with 151m units of the ETF changing hands, according to preliminary data from ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends. ETF trades can take several days to settle so final values for Thursday’s trading could be even higher. However, net investor outflows from EEM were relatively modest at just $34m.The direct rival to EEM, the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF, known as VWO, also saw heavy trading on Thursday with trades worth just over $3bn and around 79m units changing hands.Also during Thursday’s session, State Street stopped accepting cash redemption orders for municipal bond ETFs from dealers.The $3.7tn US municipal bond market is notoriously illiquid with many bonds trading infrequently or rarely which makes intra-day valuations difficult, particularly in times of increased market volatilityEleanor Hope-Bell, head of SSgA’s UK intermediaries business group, said the standard procedure for the creation and redemptions of ETF units was an “in-kind” transaction.This involves swapping an agreed basket of securities that match the underlying index for an ETF unit or the opposite during a redemption transaction.Ms Hope-Bell said SSgA usually allowed ETF units to be traded for cash (rather than in-kind) but this facility was at the discretion of the portfolio manager.SSgA had decided on Thursday to remove that cash trading facility to protect existing investors in its muni bond ETF range but in-kind creations and redemptions were unaffected, said Ms Hope-Bell.“ETFs have been very helpful in providing liquidity and aiding price discovery in the muni bond market,” she added.Citi issued a statement on Friday after it stopped accepting orders to redeem underlying assets from ETF issuers after one trading desk reached its allocated limits on Thursday.The bank said it employed self-imposed capital limits on its trading desks generally and the fact that it had reached its limit on the ETF desk on Thursday was “not related to any specific ETF or ETF issuer”.“We have a strong commitment to our ETF business, and are currently re-evaluating our limits to make sure that we are best serving all ETF market participants and supporting the continued growth and development of ETF markets,” said Citi.
438;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-21T15:12:38Z;EM sell-off: what about the frontier?;;"In all the general sell-off carnage of the last few days, EM investors might be forgiven for thinking, “what about the frontier?”Whether you look at the week, the sell-off since late May, or even year-to-date, frontier markets have outperformed emerging markets. Why?Since May 22, when the MSCI emerging markets index hit its recent peak and began to fall, the EM index has fallen over 13 per cent. The MSCI Frontier index has fallen, but by a more modest 8 per cent.For year to date, the EM index is down just shy of 14 per cent – whereas the Frontier is down just 3.7 per cent. Here is the YTD chart from S&P Capital IQ:What’s going on? Well, there are a couple of possible reasons.One is that frontier markets are less liquid than EMs, so it’s harder to get your money out, and so the sell-off is less pronounced. But that works the other way too: less liquid markets can be moved more dramatically.In an email to beyondbrics, Stuart Culverhouse of Exotix agreed that “the lagging is due in large part to lower liquidity”, but also noted that “There is also a heavy regional Middle East concentration in the frontier index, if I recall, and that might also explain some of its stickiness.”The Middle East is generally far less indebted than other parts of the EM world, and so is less prone to hot money in (and out) flows.Morgan Harting, a senior portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, told beyondbrics that frontier markets haven’t faced the same flows as emerging markets, with the resulting pressure on equities. “Frontier markets are like emerging markets 20 years ago: they are less correlated to global capital flows.”Harting suggested that the GCC-based companies are not the only factor. “Frontier Africa has done well, as has Asia.”Investors find themselves in the middle of extremely volatile markets, as the world adjusts to a new normal of monetary conditions. In which case, are frontier markets worth putting your money into?Harting notes that the smaller-cap frontier companies are worth considering. “They are less likely to be held by the big mutual funds, and they have the attributes that many investors are seeking out. Investors could still get a real benefit.”Right now though, it’s a brave portfolio manager who looks at the markets from this week and says: time for something more risky on the frontier.Related reading:

439;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bond market sell-off causes stress in $2tn ETF industry;;A wave of selling caused many exchange traded funds to tumble below the value of their underlying assets as a bond market sell-off caused stress in the $2tn ETF industry.ETFs track baskets of underlying assets, such as emerging-market stocks or municipal bonds, but discounts widened sharply on Thursday as dealers struggled to keep up with the sell orders.Emerging-markets ETFs were among the worst affected, as investors took fright that the end of Federal Reserve monetary easing would lead to outflows from developing countries.For example, the share price of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF fell to a 2.6 per cent discount to the underlying asset value.The selling also caused disruptions in the plumbing behind several ETFs. Citigroup stopped accepting orders to redeem underlying assets from ETF issuers, after one trading desk reached its allocated risk limits.One Citi trader emailed other market participants to say: “We are unable to take any more redemptions today . . . a very rare occurrence due to capital requirements we are maxed out on the amount of collateral we have out.”A person familiar with the situation said it was a temporary suspension affecting only some clients, caused by the significant amount of sell orders. Citi declined to comment.State Street said it would stop accepting cash redemption orders for municipal bond products from dealers.Tim Coyne, global head of ETF capital markets at State Street, said his company had contacted participants “to say we were not going to do any cash redemptions today”. But he added that redemptions “in kind” were still taking place.Market participants described the heavy volumes and losses on Thursday as a rare occurrence and said that it could translate into further selling on Friday or early next week.“The losses for ETFs today were far beyond what the most sophisticated financial risk models could have predicated for worst-case scenarios,” said Bryce James, president of Smart Portfolio, which provides ETF asset allocation models.He added: “The falls violated risk tolerance levels for many investors and if they were leveraged at all they are likely facing capital calls.”ETFs have been a boom product in recent years. They are bought and sold as an equity but can hold a variety of assets that are less liquid than exchange traded stocks.The heavy selling across global markets triggered the disruption in products that track less liquid assets such as municipals or securities in markets that are closed during parts of the US trading day.An earlier version of this article overstated the discount figure of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF by referencing a net asset value that had not been updated. This figure has since been corrected.

The peso, after a volatile day of trading, is down 0.7 per cent at 13.33 pesos to the dollar – its lowest level since last August. Chile’s IPSA index tumbled 3.1 per cent – its biggest one day drop in 20 months.Brazil’s Bovespa – which came under heavy selling pressure on Wednesday – was offered some minor relief. It closed up 0.7 per cent at 48,214.43.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slumped 4 per cent, the most since Sept. 22, 2011.EM currencies fell to a resurgent US dollar. The Brazilian real briefly weaked past the R$2.27 per USD mark before the central bank intervened. It closed down 1.5 per cent at R$2.25. The Mexican peso reached its lowest level against the dollar since last August, closing in Mexico City at MXN13.3320, according to Infosel, after reaching MXN13.4640 intraday. The peso closed at MXN13.1790 Wednesday.The sharp sell off in Mexican assets prompted the country’s finance minister Luis Videgaray to plea for calm.“It’s a matter of market over-reaction … we have plenty of liquidity in the currency market,” Videgaray told Mexican radio, according to Reuters.

442;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;A word of caution on Qatar and UAE status upgrade;;Last week’s upgrade of the Qatari and UAE stock markets to emerging market status by MSCI, the index provider, was a long time coming but is highly welcome nonetheless.The time taken to attain EM status reflects the rigour of the MSCI process and the importance which investors attach to the classification. It has been a long road for everyone – exchanges, regulators, custodians, brokers and asset managers. But, if it was easy, investors would not value it.The result is that institutional players are now looking at the Gulf again and in some cases are investing for the first time in five years. As a result of the upgrade, we expect that $430m will flow into Qatar and $370m into the UAE markets from passive index investors over the course of the next year.Amid the celebrations, however, perhaps a word of caution is in order. The upgrade does not mean that everyone can, or should, relax. In the first place, some of our biggest regional markets, Saudi Arabia most obviously, are not in the running for EM status. And, when it comes to Qatar and the UAE, activist emerging fund managers, who can still be overweight or underweight an index, need to be courted and retained.The $800m is our quantitative team’s estimate of the passive index funds which will be automatically allocated. We estimate that at least five times that figure – an additional $4bn in actively managed funds – could be available for investment in the Qatar and UAE markets alone. More needs to be done to attract and retain these funds.A large pool of institutional money pulled out of the GCC in the wake of the 2008-2009 crash. Yet institutions, critically, engender more stability in equity markets which are central to the widening and deepening of economies.In the primary sense, family companies looking to list and private equity operators looking to divest need buoyant, or at least rational, markets in which to sell their shares.We have observed cases where family businesses in the GCC which may otherwise have taken the plunge of listing have opted not to because local markets have historically been subject to extremes of euphoria or the depths of despair.The participation of institutions, which are long-term, fundamental investors, is thus a critical piece of equity market development.How to attract and retain them? In the first place, our markets are narrow. They are dominated by financial and real estate stocks with a smattering of telecoms. It would be great to see some more consumer shares listed, some more telecoms and hospitality and tourism shares on offer – perhaps even an airline.Secondly, foreign ownership limits which remain in place across the Gulf should be raised – perhaps gradually but raised nonetheless. In Qatar, only 25 per cent of most companies can be owned by foreigners. In the UAE it is 49 per cent.In Saudi Arabia, the market can be accessed by warrants but many funds are prohibited from investing via warrants.In the UAE, as things stand, companies looking to conduct an initial public offering must offer more than 50 per cent of the value of the company in new shares. That is high by any standard.In Kuwait, foreign investors are exposed to a 15 per cent withholding tax on dividends.When companies do list, investor relations can be rudimentary at best and, with the exception of blue-chips such as Emaar and DP World, are not proactive.Now, as the markets pick up, is the time for regulators and others to encourage institutional investors.Sceptical? Consider the fact that sentiment in the GCC markets has taken noticeably longer than elsewhere to return – despite high oil prices, attractive valuations and solid GDP growth numbers.In 2009 and 2010 other markets around the world started to stabilise and to re-rate. But that did not happen in the Middle East.Consider also the absence of IPOs.And then look at the immediate causes: low valuations, limited turnover, high volatility – and an absence of institutional investors.Mirza Beg is managing director, corporate finance, and Michael Bevan is managing director, equity capital markets, Middle East and Africa, HSBC Bank Middle East
443;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-19T20:32:53Z;EM sell-off: here we go again?;;"Emerging market assets suffered another bout of sell-off on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve said it could start reducing the pace of its bond buying programme this year and end it altogether around the middle of next year.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1.3 per cent to close at its lowest level since last September.With bourses in Asia and Europe closed by the time the Federal Open Market Committee issued its statement, Latin American stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off. Brazil’s Bovespa erased earlier gains to close down 3.2 per cent at 47,869.64, its lowest close since April 2009.Mexico was not spared. The IPC index fell more than 1 per cent, taking its losses this year to 10 per cent.“The market did not find much that was positive to take away from the FOMC statement,” Michael Cattano, head of LatAm Corporate Credit Trading at Barclays, told beyondbrics. “Tapering is still on schedule but the statement does not appear to have calmed people’s nerves. That’s why you are seeing the sell-off.“It’s likely that this prompts another round of selling,” he added. “EM is more vulnerable because a lot of money – some speculative – has come into EM globally over the past decade. That is reversing in part – you can see this playing out in the currency market. The Mexican peso and the Brazilian real have been under pressure.”Indeed, EM currencies, which have only started stablising this week after two weeks of intense sell-off, came under renewed attack on Wednesday. The real fell nearly 2 per cent against the dollar to close at R$2.2198, a four year low. The slide came despite moves by Brazil to remove key currency controls – including a financial transactions tax on fixed income investments and currency derivatives – to shore up the currency.The Mexican peso also weakened against the dollar, dropping 2.3 per cent to hit 13.19 pesos. It had traded 0.3 per cent higher prior to the FOMC statement.As for EM debt, Sebastian Azumendi, head of LatAm credit trading at Mizuho, told beyondbrics:All the Treasuries have fallen apart. The EM credit market is bidless. Spreads between EM bonds and US Treasury have widened by 7bps after the FOMC statement came out.While some EM fund managers have seen the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity, not everyone is convinced.Benoit Anne over at Société Générale thinks more pain could be on the way:We now know where the Fed stands, and I must say this is not particularly good news for global emerging markets (GEM). Yes, QE tapering is on the table, as was signalled before, and that means that the process of Fed policy repricing needs to move forward.The market implication is that UST yields may push higher, not only straight away but more importantly as a strategic theme, thereby triggering a stronger USD, weaker EM currencies, higher local rates and steeper EM curves in the process.In other words, the major change of top-down thematic is being reconfirmed today, and while the moves have already been severe in many markets, I would argue that today’s signals will kick off the second leg of the GEM sell-off.In short, considerably more pain on the way. This may come across as quite alarming for a number of EM investors, but at least, I would argue that the Fed manages the move towards the exit quite well. The Fed now has embraced its global market influence, and the risk of a surprise and brutal shift in US monetary policy is a thing of the remote past. So 1990s in fact. This is being well signalled, and expectations are fairly well managed. This to me suggests that while the big picture is quite obvious, the market moves in the period ahead may be more orderly than what we had observed over the past few weeks.Expect the sell-off to continue when markets in Asia open.Related reading:

444;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-19T08:50:34Z;China fund to invest in US property;;A top Chinese fund manager will launch the country’s first fund tracking a US real estate index to cater to Chinese investors who think the US property market will outperform their own.GF Fund Management, China’s sixth-biggest fund company by assets under management, said it would next month offer a fund that aims to match the performance of the MSCI US real estate investment trust index.US property has in recent years become a top investment choice for wealthy Chinese. Real estate developers from China have also started looking to the US, making several big acquisitions this year.But for smaller Chinese investors, options have been more limited. GF Fund said its new product, which will be available in units as small as Rmb1,000 ($163), would bring US property to a much wider Chinese investor base.“Ordinary Chinese people can see that US real estate has more investment potential than Chinese real estate,” said David Qiu, global investment portfolio manager for GF Fund.“The US economy and property are still recovering,” he said. “Relatively speaking, Chinese property is more of a bubble.”Regulations in China still bar the trading of real estate investment trusts, so the fund will track the MSCI index rather than actually function like a reit. GF Fund did not say how much money it was hoping to raise.The fund will be available in China as part of the country’s qualified domestic institutional investor programme, which grants quotas to Chinese investors to legally get around the country’s capital controls.QDII products have suffered from a lack of demand in the past because many were launched before the global financial crisis and their subsequent plunge damaged their reputation for Chinese investors.But over the past three years, overseas markets have outperformed Chinese markets by a big margin and QDII offerings have started to pick up.Lion Fund Management in 2011 launched China’s first fund for investing in global Reits. Penghua Fund, another leading Chinese money manager, launched a US real estate fund in late 2011 that invests in specific stocks.The Penghua Fund product has gained nearly 11 per cent since its inception. During that same time, the Shanghai Composite index, China’s main stock index, has fallen more than 10 per cent.Mr Qiu said GF Fund would look at launching similar Reit-backed products for Europe if the US fund is successful.The fund launches at a tricky time for the sector globally. Reits and other income-paying equity products enjoyed a stellar run over the past 18 months as international investors sought out higher yields.But since the Federal Reserve raised the prospect of a tapering of its asset purchases in May, yield and dividend-paying stocks have suffered a reversal of fortunes. The global Dow Jones Reit index has fallen 10 per cent in the past month, while in Hong Kong at least one sizeable new listing has been pulled.However, according to bankers, many Asian investors have turned their attention to the US housing market instead, targeting listed homebuilders and property-related exchange traded funds.Despite obstacles to getting money out of their country, Chinese nationals are already the second-biggest foreign buyers of US property, after Canadians. Chinese accounted for 11 per cent of foreign purchases of US property last year, up from 5 per cent in 2007, according to the US national association of realtors.Additional reporting by Josh Noble in Hong Kong
445;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Greece looks for salvation in EM status;MSCI downgrade could prove blessing in disguise;Greece has managed several unwelcome firsts as the eurozone crisis has unfolded. Last week, it set another precedent when MSCI, the influential index provider, relegated the country from its developed country index to emerging markets.The move was the first time MSCI downgraded a country from developed market status.While many investors had predicted MSCI’s review would end in a relegation, the move still contributed to a 3.2 per cent decline in the Athens Stock Exchange on the day.Yet, the downgrade could prove to be a blessing in disguise. Although hundreds of billions of dollars track MSCI’s developed market indices, Greece only had a small weighting and its companies are too small to be of much interest.Moreover, the type of investors that are benchmarked to developed market gauges tend to be risk-averse and shun stricken countries such as Greece.By contrast, in the EM index, Greece will have a higher weighting, which could more than override the effects of the downgrade. HSBC estimates that less than $200m of passive developed market index-tracking money will seep from Greece as a result, but the EM inflows could go above $1bn.More importantly, perhaps, the emerging markets gauge will in the longer run prove a more natural home for Greece, given that the investor base is more used to economic and political uncertainty.“Let’s face it, Greece is an emerging market and now it is classified as one,” says Achilles Risvas, manager of a Greece-focused hedge fund at Dromeus Capital.“With Greece being in the eurozone but classified as emerging markets, a number of the Greek corporates will have a relative edge to similar comparables in emerging markets.”Greece struggles on with drastic austerity as eurozone leaders continue to argue over how to help the country cope with its debt mountainIndeed, last week’s stock marker decline was only partly caused by the index relegation. Investors were spooked by the failure to privatise the government-owned gas monopoly, Depa, and political strife triggered by an abrupt shutdown of ERT, the public broadcasterBut some fund managers took advantage of the selling pressures from the index downgrade, and the market has climbed 6 per cent in the two days after the MSCI downgrade.“When all the index boys are forced sellers, you can pick up some great assets at very attractive prices,” one equity fund manager says. “For Greece the significance will be in the difference between the pool of forced seller versus the willing buyers on the emerging markets side.”After falling into a technical bear market – more than a 20 per cent drop since its March peak – some analysts argue that the Athens stock market is rich with opportunities.Although Greek equities are still up 93 per cent from the market’s trough last year, when fears of a eurozone exit were at their peak, the market is still worth only roughly a fifth of its pre-crisis total. Valuations are extremely low, and after surviving a domestic depression, many Greek companies are now relatively lean.Hedge funds have already made a lot of money betting on Greek bonds. But, with yields now climbing, hedge funds have started to weigh the opportunities on offer, not least in the recapitalisation of the domestic banking sector. Buttressing the banking sector will be a boon to the economy.“The recapitalisation of banks should restart credit flows, which will bring important oxygen into the economy,” says Paolo Batori, strategist at Morgan Stanley.“We believe that Greek economic growth is close to a turning point.”Nonetheless, much hinges on a return to economic growth, political stability and more clarity on the government’s finances. None of these factors can be taken for granted. Predictions of a Greek economic rebound have tended to disappoint, the ERT imbroglio highlighted the country’s political fragility and its debts are still ballooning.Greece is expected to receive a debt reprieve of some sort from its official sector lenders, but the extent of that will be politically sensitive. In the meantime, its bailout programme could easily veer off course. Athens will only get a debt write-off if it sticks closely to the targets – and privatisation is already wildly off-target.Local analysts worry some listed companies that have survived this far could still implode next year as banks are not expected to increase lending soon. Hedge funds have required very favourable terms to recapitalise Alpha Bank and will be wary of many other weaker lenders.For market-moving news and views 24 hours a day visit our new rolling news feed of bite-size stories and commentaryMoreover, doubts persist about when the economic recovery will start. The government is predicting growth will return midway through next year, but some local economists are already predicting a seventh year of recession in 2014.Emerging market investors may well be more comfortable with these kinds of risks, but few will yet be rushing to snap up Greek equities.Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins, Alexandra Stevenson and Christopher Thompson

Says it all really.
447;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-14T16:57:23Z;Lyxor appears shaken after chairman departure;Four senior executives have left the French asset manager in the past six months;"The future of Lyxor, the €75bn French asset manager owned by Société Générale, appears uncertain following the departure this week of its long-serving chairman, the fourth senior executive to leave within the past six months.After a decade as Lyxor’s chairman, Alain Dubois is leaving to join MSCI, amid rumours of disagreements over strategy with Inès de Dinechin, the chief executive who replaced Laurent Seyer in March 2012.“Alain and Laurent Seyer worked well together. They had a common vision but the relationship was never the same with Inès,” says one ex-Lyxor executive.Mr Dubois entirely rejects any suggestion that there were any difficulties in his working relationship with Ms Dinechin.However, ex-employees say that Mr Dubois had grown frustrated after being “constantly blocked” in his efforts to reposition Lyxor’s underperforming exchange traded funds business, which has seen outflows of more than €1bn so far this year.“Alain was not allowed to influence strategy in the way that he wanted but he had to take the blame for the ETF business underperforming,” adds the former Lyxor executive.Mr Dubois’ exit follows that of Simon Klein and Nizam Hamid, the head and deputy head of Lyxor’s ETF business in Europe, late last year. Mr Klein returned to Deutsche Bank, while Mr Hamid moved to FTSE group. Claus Hein is on gardening leave after stepping down earlier this month from his role as head of Lyxor ETFs for the UK, the Nordic region and Latin America.Lyxor has long been dogged by rumours that SocGen might consider selling the ETF arm, which has assets of €31.2bn.SocGen, however, said this week that “Lyxor is definitely not for sale”.But several ex-employees spoken to by the Financial Times said that buyers would come forward if SocGen decided to offload the ETF business.Observers suggest Amundi, a €746.2bn rival French fund manager that is part-owned by SocGen, as a potentially interested party. Amundi has a sub-scale ETF business with assets of €9.9bn.“Devising an ‘all-French’ solution makes sense, as it would allow Lyxor to make further cost savings and to be much more aggressive when in competition with BlackRock and Vanguard on pricing,” says another ex-Lyxor executive.Arnaud Llinas, who was appointed global head of Lyxor’s ETF and indexing business in December, maintains that the company can r egain its position as the number-two ETF company in Europe from Deutsche Bank.“Confidence in Lyxor’s ETF business is fully intact,” says Mr Llinas.“We are bringing out new products and actively recruiting. We have added three new European sales staff and expanded our marketing resources. We are aiming to grow our assets and are very committed to ETFs,” he says.Lyxor has made changes to improve the competitiveness of its ETF business.It has announced two rounds of fees cuts, reducing management charges on two more ETFs earlier this year. This follows reductions in fees on seven of its largest ETFs last year.It has also changed its business model by converting some of its derivative-linked “synthetic” ETFs to “physical” products that buy the constituents of the underlying index.Criticisms of synthetic ETFs by regulators have led to a marked decline in appetite for these vehicles among investors. However, physical ETFs generate less profit for their managers.Insiders say Mr Dubois wanted to move further and faster in repositioning
the ETF business and his departure leaves Lyxor’s future strategy looking uncertain."
448;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-14T16:38:02Z;MSCI rejigs indices;Greece becomes an emerging market, but Korea and Taiwan may be upgraded;In the week that emerging equity markets suffered big falls, index provider MSCI has unveiled changes to its benchmark indices, which serve as the basis for market classification worldwide.From November, Greece will officially become an emerging market, while Morocco is “demoted” from emerging to frontier market status. However, frontier markets Qatar and UAE will be reclassified as emerging from May 2014.Egypt may be excluded as an emerging markets index, while Korea and Taiwan are being considered for developed status. Domestic Chinese equities, known as A-shares, are also being reviewed for inclusion in the emerging markets index.
449;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-13T11:27:38Z;EM equities under fire;;"After bonds and currencies, equities are now in the firing line in the 2013 emerging markets duck shoot.Driven down by a sell-off in Asia, the MSCI emerging markets index plunged 1.5 per cent on Thursday, falling to its lowest level for nearly a year as investors fled for the safety of the Japanese yen.The biggest plunges hit markets which have recently been riding high – notably the Philippines (down 6.75 per cent) – as the hot money rushed out even faster than it went in.The driving force remains fear of the US Federal Reserve ending QE and so cutting off the supply of cheap funds that has fuelled global markets since 2008. While the Bank of Japan has pledged to boost its own money-creating policies, it’s nowhere as big as the Fed and may not move as fast as investors hoped when its strategy was announced in April.On Thursday, EM currencies were mixed, with the South Korean won (which has held up well in the general sell-off) weakening. But other EM currencies strengthened, supported, in some cases, by central bank intervention. Indonesia delivered a surprise interest rate hike; the Philippines decided against a widely-expected rate cut. The Indian finance minister talked up the rupee.In Europe, the Russian rouble was up 0.3 per cent against the dollar after its recent heavy falls. The Polish zloty and Czech koruna were stronger, as was the much-battered Turkish lira, which rose 0.4 per cent. Emerging Europe equities were weaker, but the drops were nothing like those in Asia since, except for Turkey, these markets didn’t go so high in the first place earlier in the year. Russia’s Micex was down by 1 per cent, Poland Wig by 0.4 per cent and the Istanbul 100 index by 0.75 per cent.With emerging market equities now down over 11 per cent on the year, investors will start sniffing buying opportunties, especially in markets which have been in the doldrums for some time, notably China. Even John-Paul Smith, Deutsche Bank’s uber-bearish EM equities strategist, says in a note that he is turning “less bearish”. But he warns that investors ignore “the broader political and social context [in EMs] at their peril.”Turkey, down 18 per cent from its May record high, is a case in point.Related reading

450;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T21:27:20Z;Greece really is a submerging market;MSCI reclassifies country to emerging status;MSCI has confirmed what everyone knew: Greece is a submerging market. The index provider formally reclassified Greece from developed to emerging status, and no one is likely to be pleased – except, perhaps, shareholders.The sales pitch for emerging markets was that they were better run, low-debt countries, in contrast to the west. Fund managers need a new spiel.In Greece, the combination of renewed political turmoil and ejection from the main world index went down badly with investors. Hellenic Telecom, one of two Greek members of MSCI World, fell 7 per cent, while the other, OPAP, dropped slightly. The overall Athens index ended down 3 per cent, off more than 20 per cent in four weeks, with 10-year bond yields back above 10 per cent.Political in-fighting aside, the index move ought to be good for Greece. Investors focused on advanced countries are upset by political collapse, sovereign default and riots, all part of the job for emerging market specialists.Furthermore, Greece’s higher weighting in the emerging index will force passive funds to put in more money than developed index trackers have to take out. HSBC estimates Greece will lose $194m, and gain just over $1bn, when the changes take effect in November. Unfortunately the sales are likely to take place first, so there could be more downward price pressure even as the country’s self-proclaimed “Greekovery” is doubted.Those passive purchases are likely to be questioned by active investors: if you want emerging markets, why buy Greece? It is only likely to get out of its hole to collect a new shovel. Passive funds are already dismissed by active managers as inappropriate for the under-researched emerging world, where markets are thought less efficient.But active managers are playing the same zero-sum game there as anywhere else. As Blackrock (which has active and passive funds) points out, the average active manager produces zero outperformance in emerging markets too.
451;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T16:44:22Z;MSCI moves: a trillion dollar decision?;;"As beyondbrics reported on Tuesday, index provider MSCI has rejigged its emerging market classifications. The headline grabber is that Greece has been put into the emerging market group. Up from frontier to emerging status come the UAE and Qatar. Morocco was relegated back to the frontier group.It’s embarrassing for Greece and an overdue vote for the UAE and Qatar. But how much of a difference will it make? Potentially, quite a lot, actually.Although there was a quick boost to local stock markets in the UAE and Qatar, the first thing to note is that the upgrades have been under review for a long time, so the decision is not a complete curveball. Also, the upgrade doesn’t take place until 2014 – plenty of time for discretionary asset managers to evaluate and shift funds over time.And for some investors, it won’t make a difference. BlackRock, one of the world’s biggest asset managers, pointed out that it had already increased its allocation in the UAE and Qatar. Sam Vecht, head of BlackRock’s emerging markets team said in an emailed statement regarding UAE and Qatar:While we welcome the move, it is unlikely to have any significant near-term impact on how we manage our client portfolios. We have been broadly positive on both of these countries for the last two years as the combination of economic restructuring post financial crisis, strong earnings growth, depressed valuations, and high dividend yields offers an attractive proposition.Not much change there then.However, that’s not the case everywhere. The Frontier Markets Strategy team at Citi was slightly taken aback, saying that “the decisions came as somewhat of a surprise to us”, but noted that both upgrades should provide a boost to both the UAE and Qatar, without putting a figure on it.Renaissance Capital noted that one of the bigger winners might well be Nigeria. Analyst Daniel Salter wrote in a note:The moves should be beneficial to liquidity and performance of Qatar and UAE as EM investors allocate to those countries nearer to the index inclusion date; both indices are opening strongly today. Morocco we see as not widely held by EM funds, and may be less impacted. Greece may be ignored by active GEMs investors (as the market will likely be similar to the Czech Republic in size). Nigeria may be a key beneficiary in the frontier space as frontier funds reallocate from Qatar and UAE in to other liquid frontier markets closer to the index rebalancing date (Qatar and UAE combined account for one quarter of the MSCI Frontier Market Index; their transition should boost Nigeria’s weight from 15% to near 20%).Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, head of EMEA & global frontier market equities at Baring Asset Management said: “Qatar and the UAE will initially only comprise a small part of the overall index – around 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively – although the announcement is clearly a major positive for both markets and will lead to significant capital inflows from international investors over time.” She noted that JPMorgan’s provisional estimate was for net inflows from the upgrade of around $570m for Qatar and $442m for the UAE.That’s a trillion dollars extra into the UAE and Qatar combined.Of course, Morocco was also reclassified – down to frontier. But perhaps that’s no bad thing. As William Jackson of Capital Economics put it:If anything, the country’s stock market could actually benefit from the move. By being classified as a frontier market, it will no longer be in direct competition with the likes of the BRIC economies for investment. Morocco’s weight in the FM Index (at 6.7%) will be much greater than it was in the EM Index (0.39%). As such, Morocco’s downgrade could actually open it up to a wider base of investors.Egypt was put on review – which alarmed a few investors, as beyondbrics has reported.And what of Greece? Currently, only two stocks from the country are included in the MSCI developed market index. Moving to the EM basket may allow for lower size and liquidity hurdles and therefore a few more stocks. As RenCap put it: “Meanwhile, EMEA economists are hastily dusting off their Greek spreadsheets.”Related reading:

452;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T15:14:02Z;Egyptian shares plunge on talk of removal from MSCI EM index;;"Egypt’s benchmark stock index fell 5.17 per cent on Wednesday after reports that Morgan Stanley would consider removing the economically battered nation from its basket of emerging market indices.It was the biggest daily drop in months and underlines the market’s nervousness since Egypt’s February 2011 revolution and subsequent economic malaise. The benchmark EGX30 index is down 15.8 per cent this year.Ten months ago, investors were gleeful about the performance of Egyptian equities, which had rebounded after the 2011 revolution on optimism generated by the country’s first-ever democratic election.Traders now voice gloom about the economic outlook. They blame political problems rather than market fundamentals for the bleakness.“Ethiopia’s Renaissance dam project, the disagreements over the constitution and the way the government is handling the country are all political issues effecting our economy,” said Nazmi Rizk, a stock trader in Cairo.“The stock market shows you the future of the country and as you can see, it is not promising,” he said. “In the last year the economy has been in a downward spiral. Investors can’t afford to lose more, and even the people who can afford to won’t.”Reuters reported on Wednesday that foreign investors had complained to Morgan Stanley Capital International about difficulties in repatriating cash out of Egypt, prompting the index compiler to consider excluding Egypt from its emerging market and adding it to its more risky frontier market index.With its gold and foreign cash reserves depleted since the revolution, central bank officials have imposed strict limits on converting local currency into dollars and euros. Egypt’s foreign currency reserves rose to $16bn at the end of May after scraping a decade low of $13.4bn in March. The reserves stood at a record $36bn just before the revolution.Egypt’s credit rating was cut to below junk status last month by Standard & Poor’s, one of the three big rating agencies. However, Capital Economics downplayed the impact of any further downgrades to Egypt’s status:Given the ongoing political unrest and persistent capital flight in Egypt, we doubt that – even if it is downgraded – there will be much of an impact on the markets or the economy. We suspect that today’s 5% fall in the Egyptian stock market has more to do with concerns over recent political protests than the prospect of a downgrade.Related reading:

453;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
454;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T13:31:09Z;MSCI ruling setback to Tel Aviv exchange;;MSCI will not include Israel in its Europe index, dealing a setback to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which had lobbied to be included to help it remain in portfolio investors’ sights as it battles to overcome falling liquidity.The decision comes ahead of an “Israel Opportunity” conference to be held in London on Thursday, to be attended by financial investors and the chief executives of several leading Israeli companies and Stanley Fischer, the outgoing governor of the Bank of Israel.MSCI, the index compiler, late on Tuesday said the international institutional investors it consulted in a review of its indices “are not supportive of an inclusion” of Israel in its Europe Index. The group’s rejig of its closely followed indices also included a controversial decision to reclassify Greece as an emerging market.MSCI reclassified Israel as a developed country in 2010, removing it from the screens of most emerging market investors.The investment advisory group then devised a “Europe + Middle East” index that includes Israel, but this is much less widely benchmarked than its core Europe product. Daily trading on the exchange has dropped from a peak of about 2bn shekels in 2010 to half that level now.“They invented an index and no one knows about it,” Ester Levanon, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange’s chief executive, told the Financial Times last week, before MSCI’s decision. “This means that we got lost. If someone wants to invest in a region, they can go to the Americas, Asia-Pacific or elsewhere, [but] no one wants to invest in ‘Europe/ Middle East’.The Tel Aviv exchange’s struggle is at odds with Israel’s relatively healthy 3 to 4 per cent GDP growth rate and roster of innovative companies, mostly better known to venture capital investors and the tech world than international portfolio managers.This week Google, the Silicon Valley search giant, paid upwards of $1bn for Waze, an Israeli company that developed a navigation app for smartphones that uses “crowdsourced” information on traffic.Israel escaped the eurozone crisis that devastated its Mediterranean neighbours, and its market has also proven impervious to the political risk in the Middle East. The TASE points out that its TA-25 index outperformed the FTSE 100, Germany’s Dax, France’s CAC 40, and the MSCI EM emerging-markets index since January 2012.In Ms Levanon’s pitch to make the exchange “part of Europe”, she said Israel belonged to European chapters of groups representing stock exchange regulators and central banks. “We are even part of the football club competitions in Europe,” she said.However, many Israeli portfolio investors and companies are avoiding the exchange too, complaining about excessive regulation. Mellanox Technologies, a semiconductor company that will take part in Thursday’s Israel roadshow, recently announced plans to delist from the Tel Aviv board, citing the regulatory burden it faced. It will keep its Nasdaq listing.
455;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T13:27:14Z;Lyxor hit by chairman’s departure;Alain Dubois leaves to join MSCI;Lyxor, the third-largest exchange traded funds provider in Europe, has been rocked by the departure of another two senior executives.Alain Dubois is leaving after a decade as chairman of the asset management group to join MSCI, the index provider, while Claus Hein is on gardening leave after stepping down last week from his role as head of Lyxor ETFs for the UK, the Nordic region and Latin America.Inès de Dinechin, Lyxor’s chief executive, is to become chairman while retaining her current duties as ceo.Mr Dubois is to take up the role of managing director and head of new business and product development for MSCI’s index business in August.His exit follows that of Simon Klein and Nizam Hamid, the head and deputy head of Lyxor’s ETF business in Europe, late last year. Mr Klein returned to Deutsche Bank while Mr Hamid moved to FTSE group.Lyxor’s ETF business has struggled for momentum in recent years. Net outflows in the first five months of 2013 were almost $1.7bn, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends.Last year, Lyxor managed to attract inflows of just $328m, a tepid recovery that followed a weak performance in 2011, when it registered outflows of almost $9.9bn.Assets under management at Lyxor’s ETF business stood at €31.2bn ($41.5bn) at the end of May.Société Générale, the parent group, is rumoured to have been looking for a buyer for the Lyxor ETF business as the French bank refocuses on its core areas of expertise.However, a spokesperson for SocGen dimissed the rumours.“Lyxor is definitely not for sale” said SocGen.Arnaud Llinas, who was appointed global head of Lyxor’s ETF and indexing business in December, has maintained that the company can regain its position as the number-two ETF player in Europe from Deutsche Bank.“Confidence in Lyxor’s ETF business is fully intact,” said Mr Llinas.“We are bringing out new products and actively recruiting. We have added three new European sales staff and expanded our marketing resources. We are aiming to grow our assets and are very committed to ETFs”.Other changes suggest that the business remains under pressure, however.Lyxor has announced two rounds of fees cuts, reducing management charges on two more ETFs earlier this year, following reductions in fees on seven of its largest ETFs last year.It has also changed its business model by converting some of its derivative-linked “synthetic” ETFs to “physical” products that buy the constituents of the underlying index. Criticisms of synthetic ETFs by regulators have led to a marked decline in appetite for these vehicles among investors.
456;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T12:02:50Z;Emerging Greece: a matter of perception;Redesignation as emerging market does not change the fundamentals;Here is news for Greeks deprived of their favourite TV station – you now live in an emerging market. As the government was shutting down the national broadcaster at midnight on Tuesday, index provider MSCI was shunting Greece out of developed-market status, for reasons of size and accessibility. The move is not entirely negative, but it shows how uncertain investment sentiment is towards Greece and adds context to the failure of a big privatisation in the past few days.The Athens stock market has tumbled more than 80 per cent from its high point in January 2008 and by half since the country was bailed out in May 2010. Ireland’s stock market, in contrast, is 50 per cent higher since that country’s bailout in late 2010. That illustrates the sharp difference in investor perceptions towards the two countries and their chances of recovery.Moreover, MSCI says the Athens stock market is not fit for purpose. Stock lending and short selling practices are not up to the standard of developed markets, for example. And it is too small. The capitalisation of the 60-stock ASE index on Wednesday was just €14bn, while Dublin’s 44-member ISEQ overall index was worth €54bn.Greece lacks many characteristics that make emerging markets appeal to investors, such as strong growth and a queue of companies looking to list. Its market is shrinking – Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling has moved its primary listing from Athens to London. Nor does Greece look inviting alongside South Korea, say.Yet there should be advantages to its redesignation. Despite this week’s volatility in emerging markets, fund flows in search of returns in riskier markets are likely to remain strong. Greek assets are unattractive, as last week’s failure to privatise the DEPA gas company showed. Redesignating them is not going to change their fundamentals. But it might just change investor perceptions.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
457;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-06-12T11:14:27Z;UAE and Qatar gain upgrade to EM status;Shares in both Gulf countries rally on news of the promotion;Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will be upgraded to emerging market status by a leading index provider, opening the countries’ exchanges to increased global investment flows.Shares in both Gulf countries, currently classified as frontier markets, rallied on news of the promotion by MSCI. Both have made unsuccessful bids for an upgrade in the past, but success for Qatar was less expected. Qatar’s stock market rose to its highest level in five years, while Abu Dhabi shares climbed to levels not seen since 2009, according to Bloomberg.Inclusion in MSCI’s Emerging Market Index could attract $800m of new inflows into the two countries’ markets, HSBC estimates, as more risk-averse investors start to consider them. Both the UAE and Qatar are competing to become financial hubs for the oil-rich Gulf region.“Today’s decision firmly establishes the region on the emerging markets growth map in the minds of global institutional investors,” said Georges Elhedery, HSBC’s head of global markets for the Middle East and North Africa.MSCI also announced that Greece will be downgraded from developed market to emerging market status in November, on account of its failure to meet requirements on short selling, securities borrowing and lending facilities and transferability.The upgrades – which will take effect in May 2014 - came as a result of operational improvements to securities markets by the two Gulf states. The MSCI also highlighted Qatar’s progress on foreign ownership limits, while urging the authorities to increase them further.Akber Khan, director of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha, said: “From a global investor perspective, the timing is very good as both countries are set to embark on tens of billions of dollars of spending over the next three to five years, offering tremendous opportunities.”Not all investors expect the announcement to affect their investment strategy. Sam Vecht, head of BlackRock’s emerging markets specialist team, said the announcement was unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the management of its client portfolios.“We have been broadly positive on both of these countries for the last two years,” said Mr Vecht, highlighting post-crisis restructuring, strong earnings growth and high dividend yields.HSBC estimates the two Gulf countries will have a combined weighting of 0.71 per cent in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, above Egypt, the Czech Republic and Hungary.Morocco will also be downgraded to a frontier market, MSCI said. The index provider also highlighted concerns over Egypt’s emerging market status, adding: “The recent shortage of foreign currency on the domestic foreign exchange market is of great concern to international investors.”

After putting Greece on review for a possible demotion to emerging markets status last year, MSCI went ahead and made it official on Tuesday.In its annual review of country classification, MSCI removed Greece from its developed markets index and reclassified it as an emerging market. The Athens Stock Exchange has shed nearly 83 per cent of its value since 2008.It was not the only country that suffered the indignity of a demotion. Morocco was relegated from an EM to a frontier market.The United Arab Emirates and Qatar – both of which have been under review for an upgrade from FM to EM for several years now – finally got their promotions. While the two bourses, among the best performing markets this year, are will account for just a tiny part of the MSCI EM index, their inclusion (beginning May 2014) should result in an uptick foreign capital inflows as fund managers tracking the index adjust their holdings accordingly.Elsewhere, disappointment once again for South Korea and Taiwan, which remain on review to attain developed-market status.And for the first time, China’s A-shares will be put on review for potential inclusion into the MSCI EM index.Read the full MSCI classification release here.Related reading:

460;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-05-26T18:00:34Z;On Monday: Check EM financial institutions before chasing yield;To be positive about EMs, we must be positive about internal institutions;"Investors in emerging market equities have developed a serious case of cold feet. Emerging markets have underperformed the developed world for almost three years now, according to the widely used MSCI indices. Once seen effectively as a leveraged bet on growth in the developed world, investors now plainly view them as risky.No such reticence applies to investors in emerging market debt. The JPMorgan Embi indices show that the sector is at record levels. On an absolute return basis, emerging market debt has kept up the pace of developed market stocks since the 2008 financial crisis. It has achieved this despite growth in capacity. Since 1998, after the Asian crisis, the entire emerging market debt universe has multiplied about tenfold, from about $1tn to $9.8tn, says a survey by the BlackRock Investment Institute. Meanwhile, investable debt – tied to benchmark indices, has increased fivefold in the past decade, to exceed $2.5tn.But it is not just a question of bond market investment. Cross-border flows from banks are also booming. One chart put together by BlackRock makes this point in an alarming fashion, using data from the Bank for International Settlements. Starting at 2003, foreign banks increased their lending to the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India and China), at exactly the same rate as they boosted their lending to four main peripheral Eurozone economies that would subsequently be hit by crisis – Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. By 2008, foreign lending to both blocs had increased by 250 per cent since 2008. But after the credit crisis hit, peripheral eurozone lending dropped back towards its 2003 level.But bank lending for the Brics, after a brief pullback, doubled once more, and now stands at more than four times its level from 2003. Lending to the Brics started from a lower base; percentage rises could be deceptive. But most emerging market crises fit a common template, in which some promising growth prompts excessive flows of foreign lending, followed by disaster when the flows reverse.Particularly at a point when the equity and commodities investors are losing confidence in EM growth, does this point to another accident in the future? Have the banks made the same mistake again?Perhaps not – although the question must be monitored closely. To be positive about emerging markets, we need to be positive about their internal institutions. Maybe they have emerged enough that the “EM” category is no longer meaningful.Rising debt can turn to disaster when it is denominated in a foreign currency. A rising dollar (as we have today) can make life difficult, while devaluation can then make debts suddenly unpayable. This easily happens when currencies have been pegged at an unrealistic level. Today’s emerging markets have floating currencies – with the huge exception of China, which has the reserves to manage its exchange rate. They are also conducting a growing share of their borrowing in local currency. In 1998, only 27 per cent of corporate issuance was in local currency. That has risen to 62 per cent, following a 1,700 per cent increase in local currency issuance.That has been achieved thanks to the growth of the institutions that a developed market needs. The disasters of the 1980s and 1990s, which repeatedly wiped out the savings of their populations, convinced many emerging governments, particularly in Latin America, to launch new pension programmes, usually modelled on Chile, where pension assets account for more than 50 per cent of its gross domestic product. In Peru, which has attracted great inflows thanks to the boom in copper, pension assets account for more than 17 per cent of the economy, which partially mitigates the alarming statistic that foreigners own 58 per cent of its debt.Pension assets have grown to take up more than 10 per cent of GDP in Mexico and Brazil as well. Other emerging markets, however, are far less well advanced in building pension schemes.These pools of capital are primarily intended for the social welfare of the domestic populations. But patient capital such as this also builds demand for local currency bonds, and helps to mitigate the risks of foreign capital flight.This is not to say there is nothing to worry about. The money flowing into emerging markets is being motivated by a hunt for yield, which may well be driven by artificially low US interest rates. The speed with which foreign lending has increased cannot be ignored.But the most important issue is not a question of whether countries have “emerged” in terms of wealth or economic growth, but rather in terms of their basic economic institutions. The evidence of the 2008 crisis, when many emerging market institutions wobbled perilously but did not crash, is encouraging – but the question investors should ask before chasing the yield on offer in a country is whether its local financial institutions have developed. Few are asking this at present.john.authers@ft.com"
461;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-05-23T18:03:36Z;EMs to Bernanke: *YAWN*;;"Rising US interest rates along with a China hard landing have long been cited as two of the biggest risks to emerging markets assets.So how did the markets react to the relatively hawkish comments made on Wednesday by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the sluggish manufacturing data that came out of China on Thursday?Pretty much with a shrug.Sure, a quick look at the EM global equities map would show a sea of red.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was among the biggest losers – down 2.5 per cent. But at 22,669.68, the index is still trading at a two year high.Ditto for South Korea’s stock market. The KOSPI, while down 1.24 per cent on Thursday and down 3 per cent since the start of the year at 1969.19, is still trading higher that it did two years ago.The Philippines and Thailand – two of the top performing emerging stock markets over the past two years – fell 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. But the Philippines PSE index is still up a whopping 26 per cent since the start of the year, while Thailand’s SETI index has returned 15.5 per cent so far this year.Mexico’s benchmark stock index, the IPC, which hit repeated new highs this year, rose 1 per cent. Brazil’s long-suffering Bovespa index closed down 0.1 per cent.The MSCI emerging markets index was also largely unchanged, closing at 1048.09 on Thursday.But EM equities only tell half the story. Like 2012, 2013 has seen a continued rush of money being poured into EM debt, helping to push yields on a number of key indices to record low.On this front, JP Alvarado, head of Latam credit trading at Barclays, told beyondbrics that there has been steady widening in spreads in the Latam credit markets over the last week, as US Treasury yields have been increasing.Following Bernanke’s comments, spreads have gone even wider and we’ve seen an increase in client risk reduction across most EM names. Most of the weakness has been in the tight spread names, which are much more sensitive to interest rate risk.While there have been some incremental increases in spreads, few are expecting yields to rise in the same spectacular fashion as their fall over the past two years.The average yield on the JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified index, which tracks “hard currency” debts denominated in currencies such as the dollar, rose from 4.659 per cent to 4.674 per cent on Wednesday. (Low was 4.325 per cent, which was achieved on January 3.)Similarly, the average yield on the JPMorgan GBI EM Global Diversified index, which tracks local currency debt, rose incrementally from 5.342 per cent to 5.369 per cent. (Low was 5.16 per cent which was achieved on May 9.)Elsewhere, the average yield on Barclays Emerging Corporate Bonds index, which tracks investment-grade emerging market bonds, inched up to 4.6 per cent on Wednesday after having hit a low of 4.34 per cent early this month on May 9.For now at least, it seems that EM bulls are still winning out against EM pessimists.As one private wealth manager who has been increasing his exposure to EM assets told beyondbrics:Investing in emerging markets is a strategic investment theme that will play out over the long term. If the basis for Bernanke to ease up on bond buying and raise interest rates is because of strong US domestic growth, then that’s still going to be good for emerging markets.Related reading:

462;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-04-22T17:27:21Z;Edhec to launch free smart beta indices;Plans to roll out 100 ‘smart beta’ indices for free;The Edhec-Risk Institute has unveiled plans to revolutionise index-based investing by offering sophisticated alternative benchmarks for free. The move will pitch the Nice-based research body into direct competition with commercial providers of financial indices.Edhec-Risk director Noël Amenc said he intends to become the leading alternative index provider within five years.“Our desire is to shake things up and to make sure that the smart beta index market becomes more transparent, that the risks of the strategies are better documented, and that investments are made in the best cost conditions,” said professor Amenc.Edhec started offering 30 “smart beta” indices for free on April 15 via a dedicated web platform as part of an initiative to promote transparency within index based investing.The institute intends to expand its offering to 100 free indices over the next 12 months covering a range of smart beta benchmarks.Tomas Franzén, chief investment strategist at AP2, the Swedish pension fund, said Edhec’s initiative would make an important contribution to the development of better constructed equity portfolios.“It is important to better understand the dynamics of different alternative weightings,” he said.Edhec is also offering investors the ability to customise smart beta indices to help them manage their exposures to potential risks such as illiquid stocks or smaller companies. Access to the customised indices and analytical services will cost €10,000 ($13,500) a year.Edhec has spent more than €6m developing the platform and it plans to double the 30 strong project team over the next two years.The research body has campaigned vigorously for greater transparency within indexing. This is in response to consultations by global regulators who are re-examining financial benchmarks as part of their investigations into the Libor scandal.The International Organization of Securities Commissions last week published a consultation paper that asked for comments on the principles governing benchmarks.The European Securities and Markets Authority, the regional regulator, is also considering responses to a consultation paper on benchmark indices.Edhec argues that commercial index providers do not provide adequate information about smart beta indices, making it difficult for investors to verify the track record of these benchmarks.Representatives of commercial index providers, however, disagree vehemently.In its response to Esma, the Index Industry Association, said that the intellectual property rights of index providers must be protected and not undermined by requirements to provide granular information, “particularly when an index’s methodology is transparent and observable market data are used in the calculation of an index”.Commercial index providers have been able to charge higher fees for smart beta indices which are being used increasingly by institutional investors as a cheap alternative to active management.Edhec’s initiative provides further evidence of how commercial index providers are finding their business models challenged by providers that have their roots in the academic world.Last year, Vanguard, the world’s fourth-largest fund manager, announced that it was adopting indices calculated by the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), part of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, as benchmarks for some of its largest index funds.Vanguard said at the time that it would save millions of dollars in index licensing fees over the long run by switching funds with assets of $537bn from MSCI indices to benchmarks from CRSP and FTSE Group.
463;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-04-16T02:45:29Z;Signs of life in Asian markets;;"Two swallows don’t make a summer, but there are already some small signs that Asian markets are heading for a better year in 2013.JPMorgan and Citigroup have both reported much improved first-quarter results in recent days and, while the lion’s share of their gains have come in higher margin US operations, Asian investment banking has lent a hand.The story is one of improving equity market activity so far this year and booming bond issuance. Although for Citi a big boost came from the closing of one big acquisition from last year – Cnooc’s $18bn deal for Nexen of Canada, which was instrumental in making 2012 a record year for outbound China M&A with volumes of $63bn according to Dealogic.For JPM net revenues of $1.1bn in Asian corporate and investment banking were up 5 per cent in the first quarter over the same period last year. For Citi, net revenues of $1.4bn in its Asian securities and banking were up 12 per cent year-on-year.Citi also saw net income for this business jump 43 per cent year-on-year to $446m. While that was dwarfed by the more than six-fold improvement in US securities and banking earnings to $1.2bn, it is still the best quarter for that business in any market outside the US since last year’s first quarter in Europe.However, Citi’s profits this time took a big bump from the closing of Cnooc’s deal for Nexen in February, where its gross fee for working with Cnooc might have been worth more than $100m, according to market chatter. That’s going to give a nice boost to the earnings of the other banks on the deal, too – the Bank of Montreal for Cnooc and Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Canada for Nexen.Beyond this, though, equities trading has been better in the first quarter – both the Hang Seng index and the MSCI Emerging Index are showing improved trading volumes in the first quarter versus the averages over 2012, although they are still lagging 2011 levels.Also, bond markets in Asia continue their bubble-like inflation with high-yield markets already setting records for issuance.Related reading:

464;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-04-09T13:05:33Z;Investors toast rise of the EM consumer;;Investors love a good story. And few are more enticing than the emergence of a large middle class in the developing world, whose spending buoys the shares of a wide array of retail groups.The thesis enjoys both robust fundamentals and a compelling narrative. HSBC estimates that almost 3bn people – mostly from developing countries – will become “middle-class” by 2050. By then they will make up two-thirds of the world’s consumption of goods and services.But Arjun Divecha, head of emerging market equities at investment manager GMO, points out that emerging markets already make up more than half of global car sales. “Emerging markets have benefited from a demographic dividend over the past 20 years and will continue to do so for another 20 years,” Mr Divecha predicts.The returns have already been buoyant. The MSCI Emerging Markets index has gained 122 per cent since its post-financial crisis trough, but the consumer discretionary sub-index has climbed 224 per cent. The consumer staples index has done even better, rallying 232 per cent since the post-crisis low.Some asset managers say future returns will dwarf even this. Didier Rabattu, manager of a Lombard Odier fund that focuses on emerging market consumption, argues that many investors still fail to appreciate the extent to which developing countries are shifting away from their export-led growth model of recent years and are instead nurturing consumer spending as a way to keep their economies expanding at a steady rate.“Emerging market policy makers realise that developed markets will be in trouble for the next 20 years, so they won’t be able to grow by exporting to them any more. So they want to encourage domestic consumption,” Mr Rabattu says.Indeed, some investors and analysts argue that the implications of this “revolution” go far beyond mere stock market returns. A smattering of bulls say the rise of a middle class in the developing world can play the same role that the post-second world war birth surge did in hauling western economies out of their funk and driving robust economic growth for decades afterwards.“Emerging market consumers are the big story,” says Jim Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. “They will be our new baby-boomer generation. It’s a generational thing, but we’re already starting to see signs of it.”Emerging markets: News and comment from more than 40 emerging economiesThe enthusiasm for emerging market consumption has also offered welcome support to western stock markets, where many listed companies are geared towards retail spending in the developing world.Luxury goods companies in Europe are particularly popular, given the predilection of wealthier Asian and Latin American for Bulgari jewellery or Burberry coats.Asia is now the biggest source of revenue for companies such as LVMH, the French conglomerate behind brands including Bulgari and Louis Vuitton, luxury tie-maker Hermès and the UK’s Burberry.The shares of all three have performed far better than their overall domestic exchanges, as buoyant demand in the developing world counteracts a slowdown in their traditional local markets.“As people get richer they care more about brand and less about price,” Mr Divecha says. “The sweet spot is when savings rates start to fall and consumption is on the rise.”Nonetheless, despite the undoubted economic potential of emerging market consumption, not everyone thinks it is an attractive investment opportunity. Their main concern is that the widespread optimism over the prospects of soaring retail spending in the developing world has already been factored fully into share prices.“The difference between a great story and something you should be buying is the price,” says Sam Vecht, managing director at BlackRock. “Technology and the internet did change our lives, but you wouldn’t have made very much money betting on it.”Valuation metrics for consumer stocks are certainly richer than for the broader gauges. The MSCI EM index is trading at a trailing price-to-earnings of 11.9 times, compared with 20.3 times for consumer staples. Even after a 7 per cent drop this year, the consumer discretionary sub-index is priced at just over 13 times trailing profits.For some favoured stocks – particularly in consumer staples such as food – the valuations look even punchier. Hindustan Unilever is trading at more than 36 times its trailing earnings, and Jollibee, a Philippines-based fast food company, is priced at 35 times. Several European luxury goods are trading at similar metrics. Hermès, for example, is currently priced at 37 times its trailing earnings.Their forward-looking earning metrics, which take into account the expectation of rising profits, make these companies look somewhat cheaper. Yet several of the European groups have had to issue profit warnings from time to time, as assumptions get too rosy.Mr Vecht concedes that he may be “in a minority of one” in his argument that consumer stocks are too expensive – and stresses that he does not doubt that the rising emerging market middle class will drive global spending for years to come. But he argues that as an investment thesis the story has already run its course.“The certainty with which so many people say that EM consumption is the biggest story means that it’s likely already in the price.”
465;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-04-07T03:16:26Z;Wallflowers at the Wall Street party;Weakness in emerging market bonds and equities since the start of the year could be a longer-term trend;"Wall Street’s S&P 500 index hit an all-time high (in nominal terms) last week, thanks to a 9.4 per cent rally so far this year.Developed markets outside North America have also been solid, with the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) index rising 4.4 per cent. But emerging markets have missed the party, falling 2.1 per cent.Investors in emerging market bonds have fared no better; the JPMorgan EMBI+ index was trading at 236 basis points over US Treasuries on January 2. By last week the spread had risen to 298bp.This represents something of an abrupt reversal in fortunes for both emerging market equities and bonds. Last year the MSCI equity index rose 15.1 per cent, while spreads over Treasuries fell by 129bp.Some commentators freely express surprise at this year’s reversal, particularly when it comes to equities.“It has been a bit of a conundrum. We would typically expect higher beta markets [such as emerging markets] to do well in an upswing,” says Michael Spinks, head of the UK multi-asset team at Investec Asset Management.Others are keen to put the, so far at least, small losses into context.“[The JPM EMBI+] has had over 20 years of absolutely fabulous returns, of around 11 per cent a year,” says Nick Smithie, strategist at UBS. “Minus 2 per cent is not an absolute disaster for that asset class. Investors have been slightly spoiled.”Every market and asset class will, of course, suffer periods of underperformance. Wise investors often use these as a buying opportunity, rather than heading for the hills at the first hint of trouble.Yet there is one intriguing theory emerging which, if true, would suggest the weakness seen in emerging market assets since the turn of the year could be the start of a longer-term trend.Since January there has been a perception that some members of the US Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee believe the costs of further quantitative easing may outweigh the benefits.Last month, Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said the central bank could start slowing its asset purchases of $85bn a month if progress was made on reducing unemployment.No one is expecting any dramatic policy change in the near future, but the comments have focused minds on the fact that QE will end at some point, quite possibly in 2014. The Fed will, presumably, start draining the excess liquidity it has pumped into the global economy sometime after that. Markets are unlikely to be unaffected by this shift.“The Fed’s accommodative policy has unleashed a hunt for yield and pushed up the prices of risky assets considerably, especially in emerging markets, [but] there is a growing realisation that QE is on borrowed time,” says John Higgins, senior markets economist at Capital Economics.“The assets that have benefited the most [from QE] are those that have the highest yields. If there is a relationship there, presumably those assets are going to come under pressure when the taps are turned off.“The substantial rally that we have seen in risky assets may have come and gone. We don’t need to see the Fed unwinding its assets to see that,” adds Mr Higgins. “US equity markets are up 10 per cent this year, and emerging markets, in local currency terms, are down a little. It’s not inconceivable that will continue.”Mr Smithie at UBS believes there is a “certain validity” to this argument. He notes that “a stronger dollar typically has been inauspicious for emerging market equities and commodities”.Talk of an impending end to QE, alongside higher hydrocarbons output and a strengthening economy, has also helped stiffen the greenback, a development that may have further to run.“Since the start of the Bretton Woods system [in 1971], we have had three dollar bear and two dollar bull markets. We are at the latter stages of a 10-year dollar bear market,” says Mr Smithie.“It’s possible we might be in the early stages of a dollar bull market along the lines of the 1990s. That would typically not bode well for emerging market equities, at least in relative terms.”Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, also has time for the end-of-QE argument, but believes the repercussions of a Fed policy shift would be negative for all risk assets, not just emerging markets.Mr Spinks at Investec is another in at least partial agreement. He says the stronger dollar, driven to some extent by the end-of-QE argument, has discouraged US investors from sending money abroad.Most of those FTfm spoke to point to further reasons for emerging markets’ recent weakness. Notably, valuations are no longer as attractive as they once were, and there is disappointment that economic growth has not led to higher corporate earnings growth.Providers of labour are seemingly grabbing a larger share of the spoils than providers of capital.Some reject the end-of-QE hypothesis in its entirety. Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities, argues that both economic growth and asset prices in developing economies remained robust during the Fed’s past two large tightening cycles.He notes that emerging market equities rose 25 per cent between February and September 1994, even as the Fed raised rates by 175bp – and 60 per cent between July 2004 and June 2006, when rates rose by 425bp.EM bond prices also rose during the second episode, although data are sketchier for the first period.Mr Bryson says it was the subsequent disasters – the Asian financial crises of 1997-98 and the global financial crisis of 2007-09 – that led to sell-offs.“We have no doubt that stock markets in most countries will drop on the expectation that Fed policy will cease to become more accommodative. We also believe that bond yields in most countries will rise on the news, and that emerging market currencies probably will weaken,” Mr Bryson says.“Given the extraordinary policy accommodation that has been put in place over the past few years, news that the easing cycle is coming to an end could provoke a more significant decline in asset prices than previous cycles of policy tightening have provoked. However, we also believe that the effects will not be long lasting.”"
466;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Mexico: where to put the dinero?;;"You have to read to the end of a JPMorgan report published this week to find out what the bank thinks are the most promising investment opportunities in Mexico over the coming months and years. But when you get there, it makes a lot of sense.The bottom line (literally, in this case) of the report is that investors should look to invest in new stock-market listings and non-dominant companies operating in areas that the new government wants to make more competitive.In Mexico, that undoubtedly means the energy sector, where the four-month-old administration of Enrique Peña Nieto, president for the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has promised to create a bigger role for the private sector alongside, or together with, Pemex, the state oil monopoly.But it also means sectors such as telecommunications, where the companies controlled by Carlos Slim, the world’s richest man, have long dominated but where the government is trying to introduce more competition and appears determined to attract foreign companies.Follow that line of thinking and other potentially promising sectors currently dominated by just one or two companies that could see more competition in the coming years include broadcasting, brewing and buildings supplies. The government’s plan to ramp up spending on infrastructure could also provide opportunities for companies and investors.But why not just invest in the index and sit back to watch your money grow? First, argues JPMorgan, because Mexico’s MSCI index is not nearly as diverse as, say, that of Brazil. The country’s banking sector, which is mainly in foreign hands, is underweighted (see chart above). As for the energy, utilities and healthcare sectors, there is no representation at all.Another reason is valuation. While emerging markets are trading at a discount to long-run averages, Mexico’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is at its highest level in two decades.“An improving outlook does not yet justify these multiples,” concludes the report. Investors take note.Related reading:

467;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-28T19:06:49Z;Emerging markets: Q1 blues;;"Emerging stocks are heading for their biggest first-quarter drop since 2008, weighed down by slowing economic growth, worries about profits, concerns about the Chinese property market and the general unease about the euro crisis.With some EM currencies also suffering as the US dollar has surged ahead since the start of the year, it hasn’t been a great three months for fixed income either.As Societe Generale said in a note on Thursday:A challenging environment. We think that in view of the challenging environment, it makes sense to establish defensive strategies in EM. As illustrated by our in-house risk sentiment indicator, the risk backdrop is rather poor at this point. In addition, there are little signs that the macro situation is actually improving across most EM.For the year to date, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was down 2.3 per cent, as of 7pm GMT on Thursday, at 1031, well short of its 2013 peak of 1083 on January 3. The worst performing major emerging market bourse has been South Africa’s with a 15.6 per cent fall in the JSE market index.Not far behind are a clutch of east European equity markets, with Poland down by 12.9 per cent, the Czech Republic by 12.4 per cent, and Budapest by 8.6 per cent.Emerging market stocks are now cheap in valuation terms, with the MSCI EM index trading at about 11 times 12-month projected earnings, compared with 14 for the MSCI World index.But investors aren’t tempted. Even though economic growth in emerging markets is good by developed market standards, it is not quite as good as expected. Barclays this month cut its 2013 global GDP growth forecast from 3.3 to 3.1 per cent, with a reduction for emerging markets from 5.5 to 5.3 per cent.Next, even though growth is slowing, policy makers in some countries, notably Brazil, have hinted at worries about inflation – and may have to raise rates. Also, while developed market growth has slowed – or in some cases gone into reverse – developed market companies have shown themselves better than emerging market rivals at generating cash and profits. Too many state-controlled companies, notably in China, have priorities other than satisfying their non-state shareholders.But most important has been investors’ appetite for the US dollar and US equities. Why take a punt on EM equities when the returns in America have been so good?Meanwhile, Asian export-oriented companies have been hit hard by the sharp drop in the Japanese yen, which will boost Japan’s competitiveness at rivals’ expense.Currency declines have hit both equity and bond investors in key EMs. Against the US dollar, the rand is down by 8.2 per cent for the quarter, the Hungarian forint by 7.4 per cent, the Polish zloty by 5.4 per cent and the South Korean won by 4.1 per cent.Admittedly, the Mexican peso (+5.2 per cent), the Brazilian real (+1.4 per cent) and the Indian rupee (+0.6 per cent) are on the other side of the ledger. But this doesn’t help local currency bond investors for whom the rand, the won and the zloty are big markets.Total returns on emerging market local currency bonds are close to zero for the quarter, according to data from JPMorgan which compiles the flagship GBI-EM global diversified index of domestic emerging debt. And it’s mostly the currencies that are responsible for the poor performance.Related reading:

468;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-25T09:15:34Z;Cyprus deal buoys emerging markets;;"Emerging market equites rose sharply on Monday lifted by the general relief at the 11th-hour Cyprus rescue deal.Even though key details still need to be decided, such as when the Cyprus banks actually re-open, investors judge that the settlement will be enough to reassure market participants – except, of course, for those wretched depositors who stand to lose a chunk of their savings.At 9am GMT, the $-based MSCI emerging market index was up 1 per cent, reflecting similar gains in the MSCI regional indices for Asia ex-Japan and eastern Europe.Russia’s $-based RTS index led the way in central and east Europe with a 1.2 per cent gain, setting the pace for Warsaw’s Wig20 (+1.0 per cent) and Budapest’s Bux (+1.4 per cent).The fairly mild reaction shows that investors probably never really believed that the European Union would let Cyprus go bust and leave the euro and that the main elements of this package have been under discussion for the past week. Crucially, the proposed levy on deposits under €100,000, which prompted the strongest public reaction to the original rescue plan, has been eliminated. A general levy has gone altogether.Instead, the charge will fall on the €100,000-plus depositors at the two weakest banks, Bank Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus. That’s bad news for them but good for most others. Investors also welcome the fact the new plan is a bank restructuring and so, unlike its predecessors, won’t need parliamentary approval.Barclays said in a note on Monday:The new terms of the programme are designed to safeguard all deposits below EUR100,000 “in accordance with EU principles”. This, in our view, will facilitate the implementation and should address the most unwelcome issue of the earlier proposed deals. With the new proposed deal, the large depositors, many of which are non-residents including from Russia, are set to bear a much higher burden. …Overall, this last-minute deal avoids the worst-scenario of a potential bank and sovereign default and Cyprus exiting the euro. ……we are of the view that the potential contagion to other banks in the eurozone is likely to be contained. …However, the decision to bail in senior bank debt and large depositors will likely have a price impact on equity and credit instruments of those euro area banks that are perceived as the weakest. The markets may expect that a similar template to the one used on Cyprus could be deployed should any of those weak banks need to be resolved going forward.So, the present crisis has probably been resolved. But the aftershocks will persist.Related reading

This compared to a total of 17 attempts in 2011.“Last year saw an increase in what is one of the more confrontational shareholder activist strategies to change the fortunes of a company, in removing a chief executive or specific director from the board,” said Kerry Pogue, managing director at Activist Insight.Among those that bowed out in 2012 were Scott Thompson, who resigned as chief executive at Yahoo, driven by New York activist hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb at Third Point, while Bill Ackman, founder of Pershing Square, swept a boardroom election at Canadian Pacific Railway.Pressure from investors last summer, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, succeeded in replacing Aubrey McClendon, chairman of Chesapeake Energy, with an independent chairman after concerns were raised over lax corporate governance.In 2013, so far there have been 36 new activist investments in global companies and a push for board representation in 25 ongoing activist campaigns, he added.The Activist Insight index, made up of 27 activist funds such as those of ValueAct Capital, Knight Vinke, Third Point Partner and Pershing Square, showed 13 funds tracked in 2012 outperformed the MSCI World Index, its benchmark, while 11 of those outperformed it by more than 5 percentage points.

471;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-19T14:18:43Z;Poland: BZ WBK bank gears up for record share issue on WSE;;"A big potential burst of liquidity for the Warsaw Stock Exchange this week following a decision by Belgium’s KBC and Spain’s Santander to sell large stakes in Bank Zachodni WBK, Poland’s third largest bank.The total transaction could be worth as much as 5.3bn zlotys ($1.69bn), in what would be a record share offering on the Warsaw bourse, according to Bloomberg.Book building for the sale, aimed at institutional investors, began on Monday and is expected to be completed by Thursday, with the price per shares expected in a range of 240 zlotys to 270 zlotys.KBC is selling its 16.2 per cent stake in BZ WBK, the result of an earlier transaction in which Santander bought the Belgian bank’s Polish subsidiary, Kredyt Bank, and merged it with its BZ WBK affiliate.Santander itself will sell 5.2 per cent of its Polish bank, although it will retain a 70 per cent stake in its affiliate.The move will increase BZ WBK’s free float to about 30 per cent, in line with recommendations by Polish regulators. If trading volume increases from its current anaemic levels, BZ WBK could be included in regional stock indices, which could increase demand for the stock.Wood & Co, an investment bank, noted:If the index committees follow the rules, depending on future volumes, BZ WBK could join the WIG20 as early as September 2013 (but December 2013 or March 2014 are more likely) and the MSCI [Poland] indices as early as December 2013, in our opinion. Potential inclusion into the [Vienna] CECE index is the most difficult to predict as there is a higher chance that the committee may include it earlier (June 2013), ignoring its past low volumes. Out of these three indices, the MSCI would have the biggest impact on share price as investors could expect around USD 253m of demand from active investors and around USD 34m from passive investors (assuming current prices and funds’ NAV).The bank is trading at a 7 per cent premium to the Polish banking sector, a premium Wood & Co said was justified “by above-average earnings growth in 2014-15E, driven by targeted cost synergies of PLN 340m (pre-tax).”Poland’s banks earned a record combined net profit last year of 16.2bn zlotys, 4 per cent more than in 2011. But this year is expected to be tougher as the economic crisis begins to bite. And there are questions over just how much appetite investors will have for Polish banking shares in the wake of the Cyprus crisis, which may see more risk aversion towards peripheral assets.The WSE has seen several large bank share offers recently: a $1.3bn sale of Pekao SA shares by its Italian parent UniCredit; a $1.4bn placement of shares in PKO BP, the country’s largest bank; and the $662m IPO of Alior bank.BZ WBK was up 1.4 per cent at 266.7 zlotys on the WSE on Tuesday morning, while the broader market was down 0.7 per cent. Santander was down 0.7 per cent at €5.79 in Madrid, while KBC was up 0.2 per cent at €28.90 in Brussels.Related reading:

472;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-13T16:01:30Z;Dubai to launch India futures contract;;Dubai is launching the first MSCI India equities futures contract as the Gulf emirate builds on its financial ties to India and offers a new offshore instrument to investors looking to hedge their risk or increase exposure to the market.The Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange said on Wednesday it had signed a licence with MSCI to launch the new dollar-based derivative that allows investors to trade the MSCI India index – which represents about 85 per cent of the market – at an agreed price in the future.The launch of the new futures contract is the latest example of Dubai trying to cement its position as the Gulf’s new financial hub. The exchange is also hoping to take advantage of its offshore status to attract smaller investors that struggle to access India’s tightly held stock market.“We’re looking to create an offshore emerging market centre here in Dubai,” said Gary Anderson, chief executive of the DGCX, the emirate’s electronic derivatives exchange that is launching the product. For the exchange, this futures contract marks its first step into equities, away from currencies and commodities.The DGCX launched the Indian rupee futures contract in 2007, which it says now accounts for just under a third of the global-traded value of Indian rupee futures. A large non-resident Indian population and close economic ties have helped to boost the rupee futures contract that brokers say has sometimes struggled in other markets.“We have this natural consumer base for these kind of products,” added Mr Anderson, a former executive director at Goldman Sachs.The new India MSCI futures contract is underpinned by the MSCI India index which includes 72 locally listed Indian companies, dominated by financial and information technology stocks.But to create a market for the new product, the exchange needs to attract different types of investors, from high frequency day traders to create liquidity, to institutional buyers, hedge funds and banks. In the past, small-scale speculative investors have typically dominated trading on the exchange.“As a speculative trader or a small to medium size business it’s very difficult to invest in Indian equity markets,” said Guarav Kashyap, the head of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre desk at Alpari ME, the Dubai-based brokerage. “This could be a very exciting product.”This new contract could appeal to the smaller clients, trading $100,000 or less, who have fewer options to invest in Indian equities than larger institutional clients who can invest directly in the stock market.While last year the MSCI India index outperformed emerging markets from a gross return perspective, in 2011, it vastly underperformed. That kind of volatility could lure more buyers to the new futures contract.“We’re trying to come up with products that help people mitigate their risk,” said Mr Anderson.The MSCI contract will have to compete with the CNX Nifty, known as the Nifty 50, which is the current benchmark index for the Indian equity market. It covers 22 sectors of the Indian economy and accounts for about 67.27 per cent of the free float capitalisation of stocks on the National Stock Exchange, as of September 2012.The competition however may also create arbitrage opportunities, brokers say, an element that may draw in the bigger proprietary trading desks. Other arbitrage opportunities may also be created between the index and individual stocks.
473;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;SGX eyes link with Korean exchange;;SGX, the Singapore exchange, is to explore processing off-exchange derivatives with the Korea Exchange amid signs that the largest financial centres in Asia are looking at partnerships to allow them to meet wide-ranging global new rules covering derivatives trading.The city-state bourse also on Tuesday unveiled a series of products and services designed to push its presence in Asia. SGX said it would explore developing derivatives products in the Philippines, launch Asian currency futures in the third quarter and extend a licensing agreement with MSCI, the global index provider, to include countries such as Thailand and the Philippines.The measures were unveiled at the derivative industry’s biggest annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida.The talks to explore ways to clear over-the-counter derivatives with the Korean exchange illustrate how operators of market infrastructure in Asia are looking at forging new partnerships in anticipation of sweeping incoming regulation.Regulators in the richest countries want more of the deals on the vast over-the-counter derivatives market, where products such as interest rate swaps and credit default swaps are traded, processed through clearing houses.A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, guaranteeing the trade in the event of a default. For many Asian countries, the move to clearing OTC derivatives has required building completely new infrastructure. Mandatory clearing for the most active users of off-exchange products like swaps began in the US on Monday but some Asian countries are also notching up their own milestones.Japan introduced mandatory clearing and storing of OTC trade information at the beginning of November while Singapore became the first country to implement standards for clearing houses that were compliant with principles agreed by international regulators. Korea is expected to begin clearing of OTC derivatives in the middle of this year.Magnus Böcker, chief executive of SGX, said the group was focusing on organic growth and had no plans to revive its attempt to buy ASX, the Australian exchange operator.“In the last year the focus was on risk and regulatory changes,” said Mr Böcker at the Futures Industry Association conference in Florida. The new products and services were about “a better allocation of capital”, he added.The newly created Japan Exchange Group last month also said it wished to pursue similar alliances to offset risk in OTC derivatives markets.SGX has cleared nearly $300bn in notional value of OTC financial derivatives while Korea is one of the largest markets in the world for equity derivatives. “This collaboration will explore possible synergies to better meet the needs of market participants, particularly in the Singapore and Korea markets,” said Ho-Chul Lee, chief operating officer of the Korea Exchange.SGX also said it planned to add foreign exchange futures for some of the most active Asian foreign currency in the third quarter, and bolster Singapore’s status at the fourth-largest hub in the world for currencies trading.It will initially offer four currency pairs: Australian dollar-US dollar, Australian dollar-Japanese yen, Indian rupee-US dollar and US dollar-Singapore dollar.“It’s about price discovery for Asian currencies in the Asian timezone. The eurodollar contract doesn’t apply in Asia in the way the rupee-dollar does,” said Michael Syn, head of derivatives at SGX.
474;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-07T12:34:01Z;China moves to make its markets credible;;Although gambling is illegal in China – except at the baccarat tables of Macau and Hong Kong’s twin horse tracks – there is one venue on the mainland where some say games of chance are officially sanctioned: the stock market.But that could be changing. There is a growing feeling among investors that China’s regulators are finally taking some of the necessary steps to transform the equity casino into a genuine international capital market.Mark Makepeace, the chief executive of FTSE, said this week that recent market reforms could make China eligible for inclusion into international indices within three to five years, a move that would have wide implications both for the market and for global asset allocators.Such a shift would be “very welcome by us as China fund managers . . . it would definitely help to diversify investor behaviour”, says Shumin Huang, Greater China investment manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. Better access to mainland equities – known as A-shares – would also enable investors to broaden their exposure into a wider range of sectors of the Chinese economy, such as consumer and healthcare stocks.The China Securities Regulatory Commission, under its chairman Guo Shuqing, has introduced measures to improve the functioning of mainland equities markets in the past year. Just this month, the CSRC has made it easier to short individual companies, increased the pool of available stock options and widened the group of investors allowed to invest onshore through its renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) scheme.The broader goal is to encourage more global funds into Chinese markets and to balance out the short-term focus of domestic investors. China’s equity market currently has a heavy bias towards retail investors, while the fund management industry is hostage to a system of monthly or quarterly performance reviews that leave little incentive for long-term investment plans.Chinese authorities believe that overseas capital, in the form of pension, sovereign wealth and asset management funds, could help change that, and have embarked on international roadshows to drum up interest. They have also lowered the requirements for those seeking licences to invest in mainland shares.Working with index providers would be a guaranteed way of increasing foreign participation in mainland markets. The many global investors who track the indices compiled by the likes of FTSE and MSCI would be forced to buy into the Chinese market were it added to global and regional benchmarks, or had its weighting increased.“This opening up could be a monumental change for global equity markets. It’s important that investors aren’t caught out,” says Deborah Yang at MSCI.China’s current weighting in globally recognised equity indices is far lower than the size of its economy or its markets would imply. Mainland shares account for just 0.15 per cent of the FTSE Global index, 1.1 per cent of its Asia ex-Japan benchmark, and only 6 per cent of the FTSE China index. Without any restrictions on foreign investment, those figures would jump to 3.1 per cent, 19 per cent and 60 per cent respectively.Similarly, China would grow from under a fifth to about a third of MSCI’s emerging markets index, which is tracked by $1tn in funds, if investment limits were removed today. In FTSE’s ranking of countries by combined market capitalisation, China would rise to fourth from the current 11th spot.There are some doubts, however, about the timing of the reforms.“I’m not sure that high ranking Chinese officials could know the timetable for [opening up the market]. It’s both a financial and a political decision,” says one international fund manager with holdings in China. “They might have a long-term plan, but it is only directional.”Global investors complain not just about barriers to entry, but also corporate governance, shareholder rights and complex equity structures. The biggest challenge may not be to provide access, but rather to align the interests of shareholders, management and the state.“If investors cannot make money through the rational investment process, the market will remain very cyclical and speculative”, says Cong Li, chief investment officer at Mirae Asset Global Investments in Hong Kong. “Diversification of the investor base is a good thing, but more reform is needed. For A-shares to become a really good destination for international investors, it’ll really take a long time.”Analysts say that radical measures will be needed to get Chinese markets up to international standards, prompting debate over how far and how fast China can realistically reform.“We’re moving in the right direction, but I don’t get overexcited,” says Gary Dugan, chief Asian investment officer at Coutts. “We’re some years away from making it a credible market. It’s going to be a hard slog and there’s a lot things that could go wrong.”
475;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-06T12:21:03Z;India equities: cheap enough to buy?;;"In the middle of January, India’s benchmark Sensex index touched the psychological 20,000 mark. It has since tumbled, closing at 19,271.35 on Wednesday dragged down by profit-taking, pessimism and a disappointing government budget.Taking over as finance minister in mid 2012, Palaniappan Chidambaram stirred up investor confidence as he rolled out a series of strong reforms. Against that backdrop, his budget speech was a damp squib.In Monday’s FT, James Crabtree and Josh Noble wrote:…While few analysts think Mr Chidambaram’s efforts last week did his country’s growth prospects much harm, many complained he did too little to restore flagging industrial investment or rein in a worrying fiscal deficit.The markets have dipped in the days following the budget – by enough to have analysts seeing this as a buying opportunity.On Tuesday, India fell into Credit Suisse’s “Cheapest Four” group – that makes it one of Asia’s four lowest-valued markets. The bank values regional markets using price-to-book ratios, adjusted by return on equities. And while investors in India once worried about excessively high valuations, they may now have bargains to choose from.In the decade that Credit Suisse has been running the model, if you take an equally weighted basket of the four most undervalued markets over a twelve-month period, the portfolio goes on to outperform the MSCI ex-Japan Index 90 per cent of the time.For India, the success rate is even higher. In a note to clients on Tuesday, analysts at Credit Suisse wrote:In the 14 previous episodes when India was in the Cheapest 4 club, it outperformed in 13 of them (the exception was the 12 months after 31 December 2003)And that exception can be taken as anomalous, as markets were mired by an unexpected election result at that time.“Last year, out of the bigger markets, India was among the better performers”, Sakthi Siva, a research analyst at Credit Suisse, told beyondbrics. “Some consolidation was expected in January and February and then there was a big pullback from the budget. It’s a buying opportunity.”She continued: “Last year, we pushed India very hard. India joined the “Cheapest Four” in December 2011, which we announced around 2 January 2012 and it ran so hard that in two months in had topped out of the bottom four. Personally, I would prefer a more steady performance over 12 months.”Credit Suisse is backing highly cyclical stocks, in particular. The analysts’ “top picks” include Tata Motors, Reliance Industries and Bank of Baroda. And they are hopeful for the Indian IT sector, betting on increasing capital expenditure from corporates, but they recommend cheap stock such as Wipro rather than Tata Consultancy Services.So, though Chidambaram’s budget has left commentators dissatisfied, selective equity investors could eventually benefit from the disappointment in the markets.Related reading:

476;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
477;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-03-04T08:46:14Z;China: property curbs hit stocks;;"A blunt reminder on Monday on how fragile is the recent recovery in Chinese equities and how vulnerable it is to worries in the property market.China’s stocks plunged after the state council late on Friday announced increases in downpayments and borrowing rates for buyers of second homes in cities, dragging down the CSI 300 Index by the most in two years, after the government ordered more measures to cool property prices and growth in the nation’s services industries slowed.China’s State Council announced late on Friday an increase in downpayments and loan rates for buyers of second homes in cities where prices have risen particularly fast. The news drove down property stocks by as much as 10 per cent, and the Shanghai Composite index closed 3.7 per cent down in its biggest daily loss since November 2010.China’s plunge pulled down stocks across Asia, with the MSCI index of Asia excluding Japan falling 1.7 per cent.China Vanke, the biggest property developer, fell 9.3 per cent before recovering to close 6.1 per cent lower. Sany Heavy Industry, a leading heavy engineering equipment manufacturer, lost 9.3 per cent.The latest drop means that the Shanghai composite is now almost back to where it was at the year, with the sell-off over the past month virtually cancelling out the previous gains. At one point it had stood 24 per cent up on its three-year low level hit on December 3.The latest property market curbs did not come as a complete surprise, given repeated hints about cooling prices given from officials, not least premier Wen Jiabao. But it seems that investors were still shocked to see the state council come out with specific and precise measure.Investors will be anxiously watching this week’s National People’s Congress in Beijing for more policy indications as the leadership struggles to boost domestic demand while trying to control inflation and the housing market.Related reading

479;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-02-21T16:37:57Z;MSCI index futures to trade in Europe;;Institutional investors will be able to trade some of their key MSCI benchmark indices as futures in Europe after the index provider announced plans to list them on the region’s main derivatives exchanges.On Thursday the US-based group said that in the coming weeks it will launch futures and options of popular benchmark indices on NYSE Liffe, part of NYSE Euronext, and Eurex, owned by Deutsche Börse. MSCI indices are frequently used by pension funds and asset managers to provide the framework for their investments.Institutional investors and fund managers wanting to use derivatives to offset their risk to an MSCI index have historically had to either use an over-the-counter (OTC) product such as a swap, or a listed derivative offered by a rival such as FTSE or Stoxx Limited.The move comes as asset managers and exchanges are faced with sweeping regulatory changes to derivatives trading. More of the off-exchange derivatives market is set to move on to transparent electronic trading venues as part of a G20 push to safeguard against systemic risk.“In the light of the upcoming regulatory changes, it is very positive for us to have listed, liquid alternatives to OTC swap transactions,” said Eicke Reneerkens, head of derivatives trading at Union Investment.MSCI is also looking to expand in the face of fierce competition. Last year Vanguard, one of the world’s largest mutual fund managers, switched six of its key index-tracking funds to FTSE International, owned by the London Stock Exchange.Eurex will offer futures and options based on the MSCI World, MSCI Europe, MSCI All Countries Asia Pacific ex-Japan and futures on the MSCI Frontier Markets. Liffe will add the MSCI Europe index to its central order book. Further derivatives of MSCI indices will be added on both exchanges later this year.Eurex also said it would explore letting investors net the margin they are required to post when trading other benchmark index derivatives at the exchange, such as the Euro Stoxx 50.By contrast, NYSE Liffe has steadily been building market liquidity via bClear, its cleared service for OTC equity derivatives, since 2009. It has open interest of around $7.9bn from more than 220,000 contracts on more than 40 MSCI index-linked contracts. BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse have indicated they would be early users of the contracts.
480;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-02-18T12:47:25Z;Chart of the week: EM shares – the cheap and the expensive;;"A hot topic of conversation this year has been the so-called ‘great rotation’: the idea that bonds have become over-expensive and we’re now due a mass switch by investors into equities. But on the whole, that’s less true of emerging markets than it is of developed ones.Chart of the week takes a look at price to earnings ratios across the major emerging markets to see which EMs might or might not benefit.The chart shows the P/E ratios of the constituents of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index as of January 31, 2013, with a few major developing markets thrown in for comparison.P/E is one of the simplest ratios used to assess the value of stock, but interpretation can be complicated: higher ratios don’t always imply the company is over-priced. Lower multiples don’t always imply a bargain, and different accounting measures across companies and countries can muddy the waters (more explanation here).Nonetheless, it is a good basic indicator, and the ratios here tell a story of the differences in investment potential across emerging markets. John Paul Smith, global emerging markets equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, gave beyondbrics his take on the numbers: “With EM, the more cyclical markets, and markets with higher degree of state involvement tend to be much cheaper – take Russia, China and South Korea for example.”What of the pricier end? “Looking at the more expensive EMs, they have a higher concentration of higher rated stocks with exposure to the consumer sector, better perceived corporate governance or lower state involvement.”The top and bottom countries on the chart illustrate the point well, Smith says: “The difference between Russia and Chile is a cyclical and state-owned market in the case of Russia and one with better corporate governance, low state ownership and low cyclicality in the case of Chile.”Smith is bearish on EM equities in general, arguing that even in markets that look cheap, it’s hard to find value.“Among EMs there is a polarisation within as well as between the different markets,” he says. “The consumer plays and [companies with] high return on equity and good corporate governance trade on high multiples. The other parts of the markets, the stocks which are structurally challenged, are standing on low multiples.”In this sense, aggregations can conceal more than they reveal, he says, and Russia provides a case in point. “One stock is so dominant and so lowly rated, and that is Gazprom, but listed retailers are as expensive as consumer stocks anywhere.”“Every single market I look at it is dominated by this polarisation. It’s hard for stock pickers in EM as they are faced with a choice between stocks that are structurally un-investable or just very expensive. And therefore you find it hard to make money. On a stock by stock basis, there is very little that combines attractive valuations with good fundamentals.”Related reading:

481;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bulls in SE Asia seek cheaper valuations;;Investors in southeast Asia have had a great ride in recent years. Since the depths of the financial crisis, the region’s equities are comfortably among the world’s best performing. But following long, breathless rallies, investors are beginning to wonder if these markets are finally running out of steam.Since the start of 2009, there have been few better places to invest. Indonesian stocks have risen 220 per cent, while Thailand and the Philippines have both risen 225 per cent. Over the same period, the MSCI emerging markets index is up 88 per cent, and the MSCI world index has added just 52 per cent. This year the rally has continued, with Manila and Bangkok both up by more than 10 per cent, following gains of more than 40 per cent in 2012.As quantitative easing and weak growth prospects in the west push investors to look to emerging markets, the region has benefited from a particularly compelling sales pitch.With a young population of more than 600m people, rich natural resources, and growing trade links to China and India, the region is at the centre of Asia’s economic boom. Incomes are rising fast, as are corporate profits. Infrastructure spending is set to soar as governments look to exploit record low funding costs, while higher wages in China are helping to bring export businesses south.As a result, the region has enjoyed enviable growth rates, far less dependent on the economic gyrations in developed markets than export-driven countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. The Philippines economy grew 6.6 per cent in 2012, Indonesia expanded 6.2 per cent, while Thailand’s central bank recently raised its own forecast for 2012 growth to 5.9 per cent.“The story in the Philippines and Thailand is of job creation, a good level of wage growth and a relatively underleveraged consumer . . . it’s a very good consumer environment,” says Adrian Mowat, head of Asia equity strategy at JPMorgan.But the strong performance has left markets trading at giddy valuations. The Philippines index currently trades at a price to book ratio of 2.6 and a price to earnings ratio of 20.8. Thailand fares much the same, at 2.3 times book and 18.3 times earnings. And Indonesia, despite underperforming its neighbours last year, is at 2.7 times book and 18 times earnings, compared to an emerging markets average of 1.6 times book and 12.3 times earnings.“The conflict we have is that we love the fundamentals, but we don’t like the price,” says Timothy Moe, chief Asia equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. “We think the region will probably take a bit of a breather in relative terms.”Meanwhile other parts of Asia have become more attractive. Since the start of December, Chinese equities have risen more than 30 per cent, on the back of improving economic data, financial reform, and a successful once a decade power transition.Japan too is back in fashion. The Nikkei 225 has also jumped more than 30 per cent since mid-November, on expectations the election of prime minister Shinzo Abe will herald the start of far more aggressive monetary stimulus. The yen has, in turn, weakened from under 80 per dollar to around 94 in a matter of weeks. Japanese exporters, long hampered by a strong currency, have led the Nikkei’s charge.As a result, some investors are switching their focus away from southeast Asia towards these two large, liquid markets.Emerging markets: News and comment from more than 40 emerging economies“From a valuations perspective you can see why people are looking more at north Asia,” says Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity. Though the economic fundamentals in southeast Asia still look good, it has become a “very overcrowded trade”.That sense of overcrowding is made worse by the size of the markets. The combined market capitalisation of the Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai and Philippines equity markets is around $345bn, similar to Sweden or Taiwan, and far smaller than Brazil.The region is also not risk-free. Previous periods of strong investment inflows, and the resultant currency appreciation, prompted some governments to act in the form of capital controls. Interest rates remain at historic lows, raising fears that inflation problems may return, while elections in Malaysia this year and in Indonesia in 2014 add a level of political uncertainty.However, many investors remain bullish. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank are among those who include Thailand in their 2013 equity market picks, while JPMorgan recently upgraded Indonesia to overweight.When it comes to valuations, investors should view such markets like buying “expensive mid-cap growth stocks, because the fundamentals are so attractive”, says Mr Mowat. He believes the growing appeal of Japan and China will not torpedo the southeast Asian rally as investors are more likely to fund their trades by selling Taiwanese and South Korean holdings.
482;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-02-11T19:48:32Z;Turkish bourse chief has ambitious plans;;"Istanbul’s stock exchange chief says the institution he heads has not kept pace with Turkey’s rise on the world stage – and he wants to transform the country’s business and finance in his attempt to catch up.Speaking to the Financial Times in his office near Istanbul’s financial district, Ibrahim Turhan sometimes seems a human torrent of plans and ambitions. In coming weeks, the stock exchange, which was one of the world’s best performing last year, will be rebranded Borsa Istanbul – a name that works in many languages, not least Turkish.Soon after, by midyear, Mr Turhan wants to finalise a strategic tie-up with an as yet undetermined foreign partner and moves to list commodities and derivatives continue apace. The longer term goal is to take the institution public before the end of 2015.However beneath the targets ticked off one by one lies a larger ambition. Turkey has a low savings rate, serious constraints on capital formation and huge investment needs over the next decade. Even the biggest companies remain family controlled and a long term domestic debt market is only slowly coming into view.By making the stock exchange more effective at capturing capital, Mr Turhan hopes to make up the distance between Turkey’s vaunting goals and its limited resources. This is a matter of high politics too: Mr Turhan was placed in his present position just over a year ago by a government keen to shake up what it saw as an underperforming institution.Mr Turhan points out that judged by measures such as their weight within the MSCI emerging markets index, Turkey’s capital markets fail to match up to the 1.7 per cent of global gross domestic product the country accounts for, or its 3.5 per cent of world trade.The total market capitalisation of companies listed on the stock exchange is about $340bn, almost a third of which is made up by bank stocks. That is significantly less than markets such as Mexico and Brazil, although those countries’ GDP also outstrip Turkey’s almost $800bn economy.“There is this disparity between the performance of the Turkish economy, trade and banking and the capital markets,” he says. “Now our mission is to fill this gap, to reflect the strength of the Turkish economy and Turkish industry.”His target is to reach $1tn market capitalisation in coming years.Mr Turhan is quick to identify the root causes of the problem. “In Turkey companies are still dominantly family-run businesses and it takes time to convince them [to change their ways],” he says, adding that even groups listed on his exchange have an average of just 30 per cent free float. “Neither Turkish corporates nor Turkish investors have the tradition of investing in capital markets in the longer term.”But changes are occurring outside the exchange’s confines – and are altering how his own institution does business. The Turkish government now issues 30-year bonds – a maturity unthinkable just five or six years ago he says. Last October, Anadolu Efes, the Turkish brewer, followed suit with a $500m 10-year issue – the country’s first investment grade-rated corporate bond.“These are only the very first steps of this market,” Mr Turhan says. “But I am sure that things will continue in that direction and very soon we can observe an explosion in all aspects of Turkish capital markets.”From a certain angle, the exchange has already been fairly explosive. The main index climbed about 30 per cent in the year to the end of January, before sliding in recent days. It was, he says, the best performing in the world last year – apart from Venezuela.However, obstacles remain. Changes in the sector’s regulation can be hard to predict. The government suddenly replaced the head of the Capital Market Board towards the end of last year. Previously the board had come up with a number of changes to corporate governance rules effectively slowing down an international battle for control of Turkcell, the mobile company that is one of the biggest stocks on the exchange.Then there are cultural factors.Mr Turhan expresses that the hope that “because of some structural reasons” – a seeming reference to the prospective retirement of family members – “companies will consider capital markets more and more as an appropriate platform for their financing”.With such expectations in mind, he and his officials visited several hundred companies last year to encourage a shift. He says he expects a greater number of big companies to hold initial public offerings this year, and still more in 2014.But he adds: “I don’t underestimate either that most Turkish corporates for the time being are very well capitalised – the ones in need of extra financing do not really constitute the majority of Turkish companies.”A key part of his work remains communication – particularly with families worried about losing control of their groups to new shareholders. “This is the message I am trying to send to all company owners,” he says. “These guys are not going to invade your companies; they will just become the ones with whom you share your profits.”"

485;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-02-07T23:11:19Z;Global inflows to Africa at two-year peak;;International inflows to African equities are at a two-year high as investors seek exposure to the region’s growth story.Money flowing into Africa-dedicated equity funds in the final month of last year reached $878.4m, the biggest monthly inflow in just over two years and four times the amount in the previous month, according to data provider EPFR.Weekly flows for the month of January, which have not been consolidated, are expected to be higher, the data provider said.The increase in demand has prompted index providers such as FTSE and MSCI to create more focused indices catering to both institutional and retail investor demand.FTSE launched a pan-Africa ex-South Africa index last month and said it was investigating the launch of regional and national indices in the near future.“There’s no doubt that managers are being forced to look further afield for returns. Estimates for growth across Africa are very handsome compared to richer countries,” said Jonathan Cooper, managing director at FTSE Group.The FTSE ASEA Pan Africa index covers 13 countries in North and sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa.Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management at MSCI, which launched its Emerging Frontier Markets Africa index in 2007, said the group was also looking to expand its Africa offering.“There is an increasing appetite for Africa, from African investors wanting to invest, but also international investors wanting to get increased exposure,” said Mr Lieblich.The MSCI Frontier Markets Africa index includes Nigeria, Kenya and Mauritius.However, he added, many of the region’s equity markets that have generated demand, such as Ghana, Botswana and Zimbabwe, were not yet ready to be included in regional indices because there were not enough publicly listed companies on the stock exchanges to offer in an index.“We’re monitoring all these markets but for now they are all characterised by one really big company. We’re eagerly waiting for some initial public offerings,” he added.While equity capital markets activity picked up in 2012, with $4.5bn raised through equity markets in sub-Saharan Africa, volumes are still less than half of those before the financial crisis, according to data from Dealogic.Meanwhile, retail investors’ appetite is also picking up. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, launched the first exchange traded fund for US investors focused on frontier markets in September. It now has $39m under management.“Driven by a growing consumer class and a rich supply of natural resources, investors are seeking exposure to the frontier markets,” said Daniel Gamba, head of iShares Americas institutional business at BlackRock. He said there was specific interest in exposure to African markets such as Nigeria and Kenya.
486;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-02-05T19:00:06Z;Goodbye Mr Bric;;"It’s the end of an era. Jim O’Neill, aka Mr Bric, is retiring from Goldman Sachs later this year, the bank said in a surprise announcement on Tuesday.A larger-than-life figure who made a big impression wherever he went, be it in the foreign exchange trading room where he started his financial career or at Manchester United, the football club he has long supported and once tried to buy. Professionally, he will always be associated with Goldman Sachs, where he rose to be chief economist and later chairman of its asset management arm.But in the emerging markets he will be remembered for inventing the Brics – the combination of Brazil, Russia, India and China, which he devised in 2001 as a way of providing EMs with a core set of economies, big enough and powerful enough to make an impression on investors.In investment terms, it paid off spectacularly. In the ten years since O’Neill launched the Brics in November 2001, the MSCI indices for the four Brics all comfortably outperformed the S&P 500. An investment of $100 in each of the four Brics,would have been worth $674 in Brazil, $451 in China, $459 in India and $414 in Russia. An investment in the S&P500 over the same years would have made just $112. See chart below.The Brics have since underperformed the S&P badly. But nothing is for ever in the markets. And in any case, O’Neill moved in, switching his focus to smaller emerging economies and branding them the N-11 before combining some of these with the Brics in 2011 in a new group called Growth Markets.None of these labels captured the imagination like the Brics, which turned from investment marketing concept into political reality, with the launch of the Bric summits of Brazil, Russia, India and China, who later invited South Africa to join them. Divided by their political differences, these nations have struggled to give the Bric grouping political clout, even on economic questions, such as the reform of the International Monetary Fund. But no matter, they have raised the importance of emerging markets in the public mind in a way that the words ‘emerging markets’ never did.And whatever the gains and losses of stock market investors, the economic advance of the Brics has forged ahead, even in the midst of the global economic crisis. In GDP gains since 2007, China has led the world, with a cumulative gain of 46 per cent by the end of 2012. India advanced by nearly 34 per cent, and Brazil by over 16 per cent. Even Russia, the worst performer of the Brics, managed almost 10 per cent, three times more than the US on 3.3 per cent.The focus that O’Neill gave to this historic economic transformation will surely be a more important legacy even than the money he made for his bank and its clients.Read O’Neill’s original “Building Better Global Economic BRICs” note from 2001, here.

488;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Vanguard benchmark switch under attack;Analysts say says ditching MSCI indices will hurt investors;"Vanguard’s decision to scrap MSCI’s indices as the benchmarks for many of its largest index funds has come under further attack with S&P Capital IQ believing it will hurt investors.The assertion comes as Vanguard, the US mutual fund group, today completed the migration of another five funds away from MSCI benchmarks.“If you own a handful of Vanguard funds you will be affected by benchmark changes this year. I doubt investors are aware what it [the switch] will mean,” said Todd Rosenbluth, a fund analyst at SP Capital IQ.“What is in investors’ portfolios will be different and may detract from performance,” he added.The US fund manager’s shift from MSCI benchmarks to cheaper FTSE and CRSP [the Center for Research in Security Prices] indices, involving 22 mutual funds and exchange traded funds with $537bn of assets, will in some cases affect portfolio holdings. The decision was made in October last year.“There are some differences in the new indices,” said Joel Dickson, senior investment strategist at Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group. “[South] Korea is by far the biggest change,” he said.The FTSE Emerging Index excludes the country, as it is classed as a developed market, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index categorises it as an emerging one.“We think it is a good thing not having such a large weight in Korea and giving more exposure to other emerging markets such as India or Russia,” he said.Definitions of mid-cap and small-cap stocks are also different in the new indices but Mr Dickson said Vanguard was “working hard to make investors aware of how their portfolios will change”.He said investors would benefit from “tracking exposure to the new indices at a lower cost than previous ones”, particularly over the long-term.But it may have cost Vanguard some business in the short term.The fund manager reported outflows of about $900m for the fourth quarter of 2012 from its emerging markets ETF, known as the VWO, following the decision to change index providers. However, overall the 22 index funds changing benchmarks saw about $9bn of inflows in the last two months of 2012, while the emerging markets ETF has made a positive start to 2013, taking in $1.4bn of new money (to 29 January), according to ETFGI, which tracks fund flows.“Time will tell whether or not the shift has been a mistake. The costs of such a switch is huge – such change is a real cost to investors,” said Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones.Analysts have also questioned if Vanguard has made a strategic mistake as the index switch appears to have benefited the directly competing emerging markets ETF offered by iShares, known as EEM.VWO had been winning market share from its iShares rival over the past three years but that reversed after the announcement of the index switch with EEM grabbing inflows of $8.9bn in the fourth quarter.Luke Montgomery, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said: “One wonders whether the cost savings of the index switch were worth the risk of forgoing further asset accumulation for Vanguard.”Mr Montgomery noted that Vanguard could make such choices without having to worry about any impact on profits as it is a mutually-owned company.In contrast, BlackRock has been careful to emphasise that the ETF fee reductions it announced last year would only have a minimal impact on its earnings.However, Bill McNabb, Vanguard’s chief executive has promised that it will continue to look for cost savings that can be passed on to investors, setting the stage for more battles in the price war between ETF
providers."

490;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-28T09:00:11Z;China: Volvo roars in, stocks roar away;;"Another good start to the week in emerging market equities, with Chinese stocks rising sharply following news of Volvo‘s plans to buy a $1bn stake in the commercial vehicle operations of Dongfeng Motor and a government report a 17.3 per cent increase last month in industrial companies’ profits.The Shanghai Composite index closed on Monday 2.4 per cent up, at its highest level for seven months and nearly 20 per cent above its recent low of December 3. How much more juice than can there be in the New Year equities rally?As Jamil Anderlini wrote in the FT, the December profits increase suggests that the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy could bring a profits surge in the coming months.As the FT reported, December’s increase marked the third month of double-digit profit growth after profits had contracted for eight consecutive months, spooking investors and prompting the government to loosen monetary policy and step up infrastructure investment to boost growth last year. Profits for the year rose 5.3 per cent.“We expect industrial profits to rise 30 per cent in 2013 on average,” Stephen Green, head of research for Greater China at Standard Chartered bank, told the FT. “We expect year-on-year profit growth to peak in the third quarter.”Bank of America said much the same in a note – and predicted a 25 per cent profits increase in the first half of the year.Meanwhile Volvo has agreed to pay Rmb5.6bn ($1bn) for a minority stake in the commercial vehicle unit of China’s Dongfeng Motor, creating a powerful new truck venture in the world’s biggest commercial vehicle market.As Patti Waldmeir wrote in the FT, Volvo said the deal would make it the world’s biggest maker of heavy trucks:The Swedish company, currently the world’s second-biggest truckmaker, will take a 45 per cent stake in the new joint venture, which has not yet received approval from the Chinese government. The move will give Volvo a significant foothold in China, where it previously had only a minor presence.In the stock market, Hong Kong-listed Dongfeng Motor Group rose 3.6 per cent and Shanghai-listed Dongfeng Automobile was up 10 per cent, leading a general surge in vehicle stocks. In other sectors, Sany Heavy Industry, China’s bellwether engineering group, was up 5.2 per cent.However, in contrast to earlier bits of good economic news from China this year, the Volvo and profits data announcements have failed to set other markets alight. The $-based MSCI index of Asian equities excluding Japan was trading down 0.45 per cent at 8am GMT on Monday. In Japan the Nikkei 225 index closed 0.9 per cent down. In India, where investors are nervously hoping for an interest rate cut at Tuesday’s central bank policy meeting, Mumbai equities were flat.As John Authers wrote in the FT, global sentiment is better now than it has been for a long time:In short, the stock market is rallying in a way that only makes sense if investors are convinced that a strong economic recovery is at hand. There are good new reasons for optimism, and resurgent confidence in investors.But it’s still more than possible that investors have got ahead of themselves: “So why fear a correction? The sheer speed with which markets have moved is dangerous. They are taking a lot of economic growth for granted,” added Authers.If that’s true for developed markets, it is also true for EM equities. The S&P 500 is up over 17 per cent from last year’s June low. The MSCI EM index is up nearly 20 per cent from the same trough.Related reading:

491;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-21T13:55:18Z;Korea’s chaebol under dividend pressure;;The miserly dividend yields of South Korean companies are well known to foreign investors. But the country’s chaebol, the huge family-run conglomerates, are facing growing shareholder calls for bigger payouts, spurred by stalling growth in capital investment and an incoming president who has promised to attack corporate governance failings.In 2011 companies on Seoul’s benchmark Kospi index yielded dividends worth 1.5 per cent of their share price, compared with the MSCI emerging markets average of 2.9 per cent. The figure for the 2012 financial year will be even lower, estimates research group Quantiwise. Equity analysts say they hear constant complaints from investors who feel the largest South Korean companies have reached a level of development where they can afford to boost returns to shareholders.“One of the reasons why Korean companies have a much lower trading multiple against companies in other countries is because of the cash management,” says Angela Hong, an analyst at Nomura.Scrutiny is growing as cash piles up on the balance sheets of the companies, many of which have cut back on capital expenditure citing an uncertain global economic outlook. LG Electronics’ recent announcement of record capex for 2013 bucked the overall trend: facilities investment by South Korean manufacturers is likely to grow only 1.3 per cent this year, according to the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Samsung Electronics, the country’s biggest company, has accumulated vast reserves as sales at its mobile phone division have boomed: it had net cash of $9.8bn at the end of June. But its cash distribution dwindled from 40 per cent of net income in 2007 to just 6 per cent in 2011, when investors received Won827bn ($770m).Investors were tolerant while a booming economy brought expectations of strong capital growth, but the current subdued outlook has boosted appetite for income, says Oh Sung-sik, a fund manager at Franklin Templeton in Seoul. “Investors hate this situation – Korean companies need to adapt to a low-growth environment,” he says.Park Geun-hye, South Korea’s president-elect, will take power next month having promised to impose “economic democracy” on the country’s conglomerates. Ms Park’s broad pledges to boost the power of independent directors and encourage co-ordinated voting by minority shareholders chime with chaebol investors’ growing discontent.A source of investor annoyance is the companies’ refusal to buy back preference shares, which lack voting rights but carry a slightly higher dividend than common stock, despite their trading at an unusually heavy discount – 65 per cent at Hyundai Motor, for example, and 72 per cent at LG Electronics. The gap in most large markets is less than 50 per cent.Many financial professionals say that buying back and cancelling these shares would benefit shareholders, especially given companies’ bulging balance sheets and modest investment plans.The cross-shareholding between chaebol companies, which enable the founding families to maintain control, have also reduced the clout of other shareholders and their appetite to challenge management. Only about 0.5 per cent of votes went against proposals at shareholder meetings in the first half of last year.But that compliant approach is being challenged by a small number of activist investors such as Wonil Lee of Allianz Global Investors, who runs a $2.6bn fund that uses its stakes in companies to push for improved corporate governance.In its defence, Hyundai Motor blames the lower liquidity of its preferred stock for the large discount and says its strategy dictates other uses of its cash rather than buying back stock. LG Electronics says it prefers to use its cash to pay down debt and invest in its core businesses.Overall, many investors remain willing to look beyond the relatively low yield from South Korean equity holdings.“The amount of corporate disclosure now has improved measurably,” says Audrey Kaplan, head of international equities at Federated Investors, the US financial group, who stresses the capital growth opportunities presented. “They’re high-quality companies, with low amounts of debt and highly profitable in most cases – I’m not sure where the concerns are.”
492;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-18T17:09:26Z;Banks: glimmers of hope;Developments this week offer fuel for both bears and bulls;"Time to take profits? Anyone who has owned bank shares over the past six months is sitting on a tidy gain. The MSCI World Banks Index is up a fifth, and some of the big names are up more than that – Barclays is up 85 per cent, Citigroup 50 per cent.Developments this week offered fuel for both bears and bulls. The bears can point to evidence that the industry has still not got over the past and is struggling to adapt to a less ambitious future. Profits at both Citi and Bank of America were reduced by payments for mortgage-related failures, while neither made much progress in cutting pay. BofA, for example, still gives 40 per cent of investment banking revenues to its staff. In the UK, Goldman Sachs had to row back from a plan to time bonus payments to coincide with a tax cut, while the domestic banks’ request for a time limit on claims for mis-sold insurance suggests they are still misreading the public mood.The bulls end the week feeling smug too. Morgan Stanley – helped by a good performance in wealth management – followed the example set by Goldman and JPMorgan with earnings that beat forecasts. Pay as a proportion of revenue fell in the investment banking units of all three as they cut staff. And in the UK, a strongly worded note to staff from Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins said anyone not buying into the bank’s “values” could leave.A glimmer of hope, but little more than that. The fundamentals remain troubling – an uncertain economic recovery, regulatory noise about the need for more capital, and profits that are consistently reduced by “one-offs”. Banks in Europe trade at 0.8 times tangible book value; the better US banks trade above that. To justify – let alone improve – such valuations, the banks will need to prove that the glimmers are getting stronger and more permanent.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
493;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-17T16:30:50Z;Frontier markets: looking for gold;;"Investors in EM equities have done well from the recent global rally, with gains in the $-based MSCI emerging markets index of 7 per cent since December 1 and nearly 13 per cent since September 1.But the big winners have been the smaller frontier markets. Argentina tops the list with a 28 per cent advance since December 1, followed by Romania on 27 per cent and Serbia on 23 per cent. The sceptics might say, ‘So, what?’ Little bourses tend to be more volatile than their larger fellows. But Citi’s Andrew Howell thinks he has spotted an interesting and potentially profitable change.Howell says there could be a pattern in these outsized gains, with at least four possible drivers.First there is liquidity. As he writes in a note:The massive inflows into EM equities of recent weeks that culminated in last week’s blowout $7.5bn inflow may finally be making their way down less well trodden paths. A look at foreign buying in markets like Nigeria, Vietnam and UAE does indicate a significant pick-up, with trading volumes so far this year nearly tripling from the average levels of 2H2012.For sure, it is not boom time yet: average trading volumes are still below 2010 levels and miles below pre-crisis… But some pick-up is evident… and we know that low liquidity is this asset class’s greatest enemy; rising volumes can be self-sustaining.Next, there is the hunt for alternatives to top-quality EM stocks that investors discovered long ago, in the shape of companies that may not be so outstanding but are still available at reasonable prices. Howell writes:[Investors] are being forced into less familiar / less liquid territory to find stocks that have been overlooked and look less overvalued. Some of them may have slight “issues” with the business model, corporate governance, etc. But suddenly these “less beautiful” alternatives are looking like the best there is on the dance floor.Also, with economists forecasting a moderate global recovery for 2013, the fundamentals are “generally OK”. Argentina may seem bound for a crisis and Egypt is already in one. But other frontier economies – Vietnam and the Balkans, for example – seem better than they did a few months ago.Finally, valuations are attractive. Howell says:Despite the big moves recently, frontier markets do not look particularly expensive. The region’s trailing PE (ex-GCC) of 8.6x has hardly budged in a year, in contrast with EM which has re-rated 20%, see Chart 4. The 33% discount to EM has been widening steadily for nearly 3 years now and was only wider for a brief period in 2009.Nor is any of this a flash in the pan. Over the past 12 months, the MSCI frontier market index is up 17 per cent versus 9 per cent for the EM index.But this is all very well. Investors should bear in mind that even with a recovery, global economic and financial conditions remain fragile. In such circumstances, there’s unlikely to be a general surge in asset values. Some companies – and some markets – will perform better than others. Just as frontier markets head the list of top-performing bourses, so they also dominate the bottom end. The worst performers since December 1, are Morocco (-6 per cent), Cyprus (-4 per cent), Pakistan (-3 per cent) and Zambia (-3 per cent).Related reading:

494;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-11T19:12:02Z;Bulls take charge in equities rally;;"“How the brave new world arrives, And I see how it thrives, In the ashes of our lives.” Rarely has Abba’s Happy New Year anthem sounded so fitting for stock markets as it does this January.Over the past decade money has seeped – and occasionally gushed – out of equities and into the safety of fixed income. Hopes that the new year would bring respite have continually been dashed. But more than five years on from the onset of the global financial crisis, stock market investors are finally beginning to contemplate a brave new world.After a robust second half of 2012, global stock markets have continued to rally this January. Many markets are now at or near multiyear highs, and futures markets indicate more gains are expected.Moreover, implied volatility gauges indicate that investors think it will be a relatively calm, smooth ride upwards. The CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s flagship yardstick of expected stock market turbulence, dipped to the lowest since June 2007 this week.Most importantly, money is pouring into equities. Previous post-crisis rallies have generally not been accompanied by investor inflows into stock market funds. But investors are now returning in droves, partly driven by the low returns on offer in fixed income.“I believe that we are in the very early stages of a generational shift favouring equities,” says Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners. “While we may have some periodic setbacks equities are set to outperform bonds for a decade or more.”Flows into equity funds overtook bond fund flows in mid-December, but appetite has grown further in January. The net inflows into all equity funds tracked by EPFR Global reached $22.2bn in the week ending January 9. That is the most since the third week of September 2007, and the second highest since EPFR’s records began in 1996.“Bonds are clearly overvalued, so it makes sense to rotate into equities,” says Robert Farago, head of asset allocation at Schroders Private Bank. “Valuations aren’t really a concern; equities are still cheap compared to other asset classes.”US equity funds have led the gains, seeing inflows of $10.3bn in the past week, despite concerns over renewed political brinkmanship over raising the debt ceiling. Some asset managers argue that the US economy is set to enter a quicker gear“Despite noise over the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling, there’s a nascent housing and spending cycle starting, banks want to lend, and corporates are willing to invest,” says William Low, director of equities at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. “We still prefer US stocks over most other markets.”But bourses in the developing world have arguably been the biggest winners from the nascent bonds-to-equities rotation so far.The MSCI Emerging Markets index has rallied over 11 per cent since mid-November, helping EM equity funds attract $7.4bn of net inflows in the week ending January 9, the highest since EPFR’s records started in 1996.Can the rally last? Some asset managers and analysts say that equities only look cheap compared with stunningly low bond yields.“I’m sceptical,” says Adrian Cattley, an equity strategist at Citigroup. “We’d love this to be the year when money comes back to equities but just because we want it, doesn’t mean it is going to happen.”The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 devised by Yale’s Robert Shiller is currently at 22.6 times, compared with a historical mean of about 16.5 times. The conventional forward-looking P/E ratio of the MSCI World Index is 13 times; not expensive but hardly a bargain.Much of last year’s rally was caused by the intervention of central banks, which eased some of the more dramatic “tail risks” and are seen to be providing a backstop to financial markets. This year investors have not just been pricing in fewer tail risks, but global economic growth picking up steam. That, however, may be overly optimistic.“The rally in 2012 was about avoiding disaster,” says Mr Farago. “What matters now is economic growth. The key risk for equities is that earnings expectations are too high and this will matter if economic growth starts to disappoint.”Indeed, the markets also remain vulnerable to many of the same tail risks that plagued investors last year. The US faces another round of tense negotiations over the debt ceiling; the eurozone may not be disintegrating but is in dismal economic shape; and China’s rebound could still disappoint. Other unexpected political events – in the Middle East, or between Japan and China, say – could also derail the rally.“Any one of these events could tip the apple cart over,” says Jim Stride, head of UK equities at Axa Investment Managers. “The market is pricing in a reasonable recovery in the global economy. I don’t think that is realistic. The pitfalls remain.”Still, as Abba noted in the closing lines of their 1980s classic: “May we all have our hopes, our will to try. If we don’t we might as well lay down and die.”"
495;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US fear index plummets to a 5½-year low;;Wall Street’s “ fear index” has tumbled to a fresh 5½-year low as investors turn increasingly positive on the outlook for global stock markets.The Vix index tracks investor expectations of market volatility revealed in the pricing of options that protect against violent moves on the S&P 500. As money managers typically seek protection against sharp share declines, the Vix is considered a gauge of how fearful investors are.Despite the limp economic recovery and political gridlock in the US, and the simmering European debt crisis, the Vix has continually been ground lower over the past year, and touched 13.2 points on Wednesday, the lowest since June 2007.Fund managers and strategists said the low Vix reflects the fact that central banks are seen as backstopping financial markets, lessening demand for downside protection. Signs of a tentative rotation by investors out of bonds and back into equities has further bolstered optimism.“It is a reflection of this global recovery broadening out, starting to stabilise,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “Market players are starting to become de-sensitized to Armageddon, end-of-the-world stories.”The Vix is not the only measure of implied volatility that currently indicates a pacific outlook. Europe’s Vstoxx stock market turbulence gauge and the CVix index, which reflects the expected choppiness of global currencies, are both near the lowest since mid-2007.The low demand for protection reflects the fact that global stock markets have been in robust shape recently. The MSCI World Index gained more than 13 per cent last year, its best performance since the recovery from the global financial crisis in 2009.“Lower tail risks have helped propel markets higher over the past half year,” said William Davies, head of global equities at Threadneedle, a UK asset manager. “The eurozone doesn’t look like it will implode, China’s economic growth seems to have bottomed out and the fiscal cliff was avoided, for the time being.”Nonetheless, many strategists warn that the Vix is unreasonably subdued, given the still-cloudy outlook for the US debt ceiling negotiations and the prospect of continued stresses in Europe.“We are going through period where the market knows there are some large macro obstacles on the horizon,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “So the index might remain low for the next couple of weeks, but that might change as the next debt ceiling debate begins.”Indeed, futures contracts on the Vix indicate that investors expect the gauge to climb above 20 points within half a year, and the volume of bets remains elevated.“Volatility is volatile,” points out Pam Finelli, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank. “If we see some extremely bad news, we could see the Vix double in a few days.”
496;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-08T18:08:17Z;Russia: Micex celebrates New Year;;"Russian markets re-opened on Tuesday after the country’s nine-day New Year’s hibernation holiday, and got 2013 off to a good start.Boosted by an improvement in global sentiment, the Micex index rose 2.7 per cent in its its biggest one-day gain since mid-September. The rouble appreciated 0.3 per cent against the dollar-euro basket.Russians don’t officially go back to work until Wednesday January 9, and the stock market bump was in line with the worldwide rally for equities prompted by the US deal to avoid the fiscal cliff and some promising economic data. (The FTSE All-World equity index on Friday reached its highest level since May 2011.)Meanwhile, the oil price is also rallying with the price of WTI Crude hovering around $93 a barrel – its highest price since last September.Russian equities are still the poor cousins of global markets, trading at a big discount to European and many emerging market peers – with a price/earnings multiple of just 5.5 – about half the figure for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.This long-standing gap persisted throughout 2012 despite some positive factors: high oil prices, reasonably strong economic growth (the increase in GDP is expected to come out at over 3 per cent), and the end of political uncertainty surrounding the March 2012 presidential elections and the Moscow street protest movement.One positive note for Russian stocks going was a report released at the end of the year by the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund, Ernst & Young, and a research centre at Lomonosov Moscow state university, which claims that Russian capital outflows are not actually as large as reported.The report has generated no little criticism about its methodology. In any case, even if Russia’s outflows are smaller than previously calculated, they are still outflows – in a world when most emerging markets are registering inflows. As Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday:A spat towards the end of last year over the true scale of capital flight from Russia risks missing the bigger picture, which is that capital continues to flow out of the country in the first place. Most other large EMs experience significant inflows. The fact that Russia doesn’t is a particular concern given that its current account surplus is likely to evaporate over the next three years or so.Clearly, a rerating of the Russian stock market involving a big new inflow of foreign investment would improve the outlook no end.Related reading

498;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-05T02:48:05Z;Elliott reveals insider trading inquiry;;Elliott Management, the $20.5bn hedge fund, has disclosed an investigation by a French regulator into alleged insider trading by its UK unit during 2010 in the shares of Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhône, a French toll road company.The hedge fund run by Paul Singer said in a regulatory filing sent to investors and reviewed by the Financial Times that it had received a “letter of grievance” from the Autorité des Marchés Financiers that said trading in APRR may have been designed to boost the share price of the French group ahead of the sale of Elliott’s stake.In June 2010 Elliott and another asset manager together sold a 13.7 per cent stake in APRR worth €900m to Eiffarie, a joint subsidiary of French construction group Eiffage and Macquarie, that wished to take its holdings of the group to more than 95 per cent.The AMF has raised questions, the hedge fund said, about trading in APRR ahead of that sale. The French regulator has said that Elliott inflated the price of the group and may have made a profit of about €2.75m.Elliott said the regulator’s letter has initiated an administrative proceeding that it intends to defend “vigorously”, with no costs or potential penalties borne by investors in its funds.It said its “purchases of APRR stock were made as part of a long-standing trading strategy dating to 2005”. A person familiar with the situation said the hedge fund’s strategy was to build a stake that was large enough to sell to Eiffarie and take it past the 95 per cent ownership mark.The hedge fund said the probe concerned trading on the final 11 of 300 trading days between December 2005 and June 2010 on which it bought APRR stocks. Elliott declined to comment beyond its regulatory filing.A person familiar with the situation said trading in APRR was affected by the removal of the company from inclusion in an MSCI index on May 26 2010, and that Elliott bought stock as it was sold by index-following funds.The person said that so-called “Chinese walls” were in place to prevent the transfer of non-public information within the hedge fund, and that no Elliott employees had been disciplined or dismissed.As part of the French administrative process, Elliott will prepare a response to the letter, and a rapporteur who will prepare the case for an eventual civil hearing may request further evidence.Elliott, which like most US hedge funds was required to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last year, disclosed the investigation in an amendment to its regulatory filings.
499;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2013-01-03T18:44:34Z;US ETFs enjoy record breaking 2012;Investor inflows surge to new annual high;Record levels of new cash poured into US listed exchange traded funds and products last year as BlackRock regained the title of fastest growing ETF manager from its rival Vanguard for the first time since 2009.US listed ETFs (funds and products) gathered net inflows of $187.2bn in 2012, up 58.1 per cent on last year’s inflows of $118.4bn, and surpassing the previous all-time high for annual inflows of $176bn set in 2008, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, said the record US inflows demonstrated that exchange traded funds and products were increasingly being embraced by investors as instruments that could help them make both strategic and tactical adjustments to the political and economic uncertainties influencing global financial markets.BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, emerged as the winner of the 2012 race for ETF investors’ cash with inflows into its US iShares operations reaching $59bn, more than double the $28.3bn gathered in 2011.State Street Global Advisors, the second largest US and global ETF manager, saw net new inflows rise 46.7 per cent to $30.3bn, helped by strong investor interest in GLD, its physically backed gold ETF which is the largest in the world.Vanguard, which won the 2010 and 2011 contest among US ETF managers, also enjoyed a strong performance with inflows up 49.2 per cent to $53.4bn.At the start of October last year, Vanguard announced that it would drop MSCI indices in 2013 in favour of benchmarks from FTSE and CRSP for index funds and ETFs with assets of $537bn in order to save costs.This decision appears to have had some influence on this year’s race among ETF providers.Vanguard’s largest ETF, known as VWO which tracks the MSCI emerging markets index, saw net outflows of $0.9bn in the fourth quarter of 2012.Meanwhile, the directly competing iShares ETF, known as EEM, took in $8.9bn over the same period.Inflows into VWO had been running well ahead of EEM in the first nine months of 2012. But the shift following Vanguard’s announcement of the index switch left them in a virtual dead heat over the year as a whole with inflows of $10.6bn and $10.5bn respectively.Some pundits have questioned if Vanguard has made a tactical error in announcing that it plans to switch index providers.However, Vanguard insists that the vast majority of investors have reacted positively to its plans which it views as vital to ensure further downward pressure on costs.The 18 Vanguard ETFs (including VWO) aftected by the index switch pullled in $3.9bn in the fourth quarter, more than a third of group inflows in that period.

503;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-12-31T16:56:25Z;Winners and losers of 2012: the beyondbrics emerging markets awards;;"If 2012 for emerging markets could be summed up in a few words, they would probably be “the search for yield”.That was a change from 2011, when the keynote was “the flight to safety”: market panic drove investors away from risky EM assets and into the safest possible developed market ones. But in 2012, as growth in developed economies continued to stagnate and real yields on some AAA sovereign debt turned negative, investors started looking further afield. With healthier public balance sheets and fast growing economies behind them, EM government bonds saw a surge of inflows.JP Morgan’s benchmark EMBI index, which tracks yields on EM government bonds, fell below 5 per cent – down from over 12 per cent in 2008 – to reach record lows, while volumes of EM debt issuance grew by around 50 per cent to $350bn. Emerging market debt funds enjoyed a stellar year, with massive inflows and high returns.The results were at times astonishing. As economic powerhouses such as Italy and Spain struggled to drum up business for their treasury bills, frontier markets like Zambia, El Salvador and Mongolia enjoyed massively oversubscribed bond issues and yields on a par with several Eurozone nations.Chile saw yields on its dollar denominated 10 year bonds hit record lows of 3.53 per cent in September, and by the end of the year S&P had it on the same credit rating as China: AA-.The other major Latin American economies benefited from the US Federal Reserve’s easing in the form of lower borrowing costs, even if the other alleged impacts of QE were less appreciated – the Brazilian finance minister called it a “currency war”.The Brazilian government certainly had its problems this year: the success of the ‘Brazillian model’ began to lose its shine as growth slowed dramatically. Nonetheless yields on its dollar denominated 10 years bonds were at record lows below 3 per cent.The new LatAm darling was – drugs war notwithstanding – Mexico, with its vibrant manufacturing and financial services. Some commentators said it might be set to overtake Brazil as the largest economy in Latin America within a decade. Its 10 year dollar denominated borrowing costs fell to 2.5 per cent, on a par with France. However, its fate remains heavily tied to that of the United States, the destination for 80 per cent of its exports – and exports make up 30 per cent of GDP. The outcome of the fiscal cliff debacle will determine whether 2013 is another winning year.The clear losers of the year in this arena: Argentina, whose dodgy inflation figures and battle with bondholders bode ill for any return to international capital markets, and Egypt, where a failure to get the economy back on track (or fully secure its long awaited $4.8bn IMF loan) in the face of renewed political strife has pulled the Egyptian pound to record lows and led to the cancellation of bond issues.Is EM sovereign debt a bubble about to burst? Doubts have been raised. Maybe we’ll find out in 2013, or as and when western central banks start pulling up interest rates and ending their ‘unconventional’ monetary policies.The story of the year, then, was fixed income. But 2012 was also a better year for EM equities than 2011. Lower earnings and poor fundamentals, despite the generally higher growth of their respective domestic economies, has put investors off them in recent years. And with central bankers keeping credit easy, stock markets in Europe and North America continued to perform.This year though EM stocks were, to a lesser extent than debt, also beneficiaries of the hunt for yield, helped along by record dividend payouts to encourage investors to reconsider their value.Compared with its fall of 21.5 per cent in 2011, the MSCI Emerging Markets index was up over 18 per cent this year. Note that overall, the MSCI World Index, which tracks developed economies stocks and excludes emerging markets, is up less than the EM index, at 15.6 per cent in the year to date.The biggest stock market winners were to be found in the smaller emerging economies. The largest increase, in dollar terms, was, at 297 per cent, in Venezuela – hardly regarded as a touchstone for finance friendly policy. There were also strong performances from the Istanbul Stock exchange (57.58 per cent), the rebounding Egyptian EGX 30 (57.69 per cent) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (36.45 per cent). Deepening capital markets are accompanying Africa’s rapid pace of economic development, with Kenya and Nigeria standing out in the worlds top 10 fastest growing stock markets in dollar terms.It was the bigger EMs which disappointed. With growth of 11 per cent, the MSCI Bric Index again lagged behind the overall EM index by 7 percentage points, as economic growth in all four constituents fell.The exception to the poor Bric stock market performance was India, whose BSE India Sensitive Index (Sensex) was up 28 per cent over the year as government moves to remove barriers to foreign investment attracted attention. Given the difficult macro-economic and domestic political circumstances, the BSE has a good claim to be the winner of the year.Although not the biggest loser in absolute terms, and still the major engine of global economic growth, China continued to disappoint equity investors, as one of the slowest growing of the major EM exchanges. The Shanghai and Shenzhen composites, dominated by state owned enterprises, both hit three-year lows and experienced only modest growth in the year. If Chinese economic growth expands as many now predict, and the government continues reforms to enable greater market access to foreign investors, 2013 might work out better.Related reading:

Even Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential adviser on corporate governance matters, which is often an ally of activist investors, now has one of them in its own shareholder register.ValueAct Capital, an activist hedge fund, last month disclosed a 5 per cent stake in MSCI, which owns ISS.The move was only one element in a late flurry of activism that caps a year in which activists have ousted boards, forced corporate break-ups and challenged sleepy management teams.Though the number of 13D filings, which announce when activists have acquired more than 5 per cent of a stock, is down from previous years, boards of directors and bankers still see 2012 as a banner year for activism. Many activists succeeded in pressing companies to return cash or do a deal, and some of the biggest brand names in the US, including Netflix and Procter & Gamble, came under siege.And with several activist funds producing investor returns of more than 20 per cent for the year, cash has flooded into the sector. “More money means a need to find more targets, and larger ones,” says Henry Gosebruch, managing director in JPMorgan’s mergers and acquisitions team.There was $57bn dedicated to activist strategies at the end of the third quarter, according to HFR, the research house, up from $51bn at the start of the year and $32bn at the end of 2008. The pressure on boardrooms seems likely to increase.Chris Young, head of contested situations for Credit Suisse, says: “There is a tremendous amount of interest from executive suites about vulnerability to activism and shareholder pressure, particularly in the US but also outside the US.”It comes as activists are setting their sights high, and looking overseas. Bill Ackman, founder of activist hedge fund Pershing Square, swept a boardroom election at railroad company Canadian Pacific and then moved on to the world’s largest consumer goods maker, P&G.Trian, an activist company founded by Nelson Peltz, Edward Garden and Peter May, has began a low-key campaign to encourage the leadership of Danone, the French yoghurt maker, into increasing profit margins and not wasting capital on costly takeovers.Not everything is going the activists’ way, however. While Ralph Whitworth of Relational Investors had a good year at Illinois Tool Works, he suffered in Hewlett-Packard. The investor was invited on to the board in November 2011: too late to influence the $10.3bn takeover of UK software maker Autonomy that has since proved disastrous. A person familiar with Relation said that he had experienced very long turnrounds before, including four years at Home Depot.Meanwhile JC Penney, the department store chain, is undergoing a strategic overhaul at the urging of Mr Ackman. Sales have plunged this year, taking the share price with it, but the investor likens it to a private equity style turnround that will ultimately bear fruit.Nonetheless, the fact that such activists are even in a position where they are welcomed on to boards reflects their change in stature and influence. A decade ago, lawsuits were the first response. “Today we get an entirely different reaction, we don’t get sued any more”, says Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners. “Long-only investors will actually call us with suggestions.”Some are very publicly onside, such as the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, a Canadian pension fund that worked with Jana to push for a spin out of the education business from McGraw-Hill, concluded last month.“Success begets success,” says Daniel Kerstein, head of the strategic finance group at Barclays. “The more we see activists appearing to create changes at companies and, through that, profiting for their investors, the more campaigns we’ll see. It’s self-perpetuating.”The next wave of activist fights is already shaping up ahead of the spring “proxy season”, when many public companies hold annual meetings where activists can wage public battles for board seats.For instance, after forcing splits at Marathon Petroleum and El Paso, a natural gas company, Jana has taken its playbook to Agrium, a Canadian fertiliser group. Agrium is resisting a split, so investors will vote on a new slate of candidates for the board proposed by Jana, one of which includes Lyle Vanclief, a former Canadian minister of agriculture.More activist situations are being resolved without going to proxy fights. But many of those that do turn into battles are still being waged by Carl Icahn, the billionaire raider turned activist who this month lost his second attempt to gain control of Oshkosh, the defence manufacturer.Mr Icahn says he expects to stay busy: “One problem with the economy is that way too may companies are just badly managed and too many boards do not hold management accountable”. Company directors, consider yourselves warned.

509;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Greece: not yet an EM, but something for the adventurous investor;;"By David EdgerlyGiven the endless sovereign debt crisis in Greece, the collapse of the economy, the chaos and corruption of the country’s politics it is perhaps understandable that reasonable investors have lost interest in the Athens Stock Exchange. Index provider MSCI is mulling whether to reclassify Greece as an emerging market.There’s quite a frontier feel to Greece at the moment. Phone calls to inquire about investing in Greece, in any form, are often met with either stunned silence or gales of laughter.The superficial numbers certainly support that reaction. The current market capitalisation of the Athens Stock Exchange is about €32bn and the average daily volume so far this year is €52m. Compare this to the heady days of 2007 when the market capitalisation was €185bn and the average daily volume was €474m. And yet, anyone who is willing to drill down beneath the sovereign wreckage can find some interesting and promising numbers in the private sector.For all its weakness, the ASE index has increased about 25 per cent this year. This number actually understates the growth because it includes the underperforming bank shares that are down 9 per cent while other sectors have performed well. OTE, the main telephone company, is up about 50 per cent. Mid-cap companies – granted, these have shrunk to micro-cap in most other markets – are up about 60 per cent. Some examples of these are Thrace Plastics, up 162 per cent; dairy products firm Kri Kri, up 133 per cent; Piraeus Port, up 75 per cent.“Forget the banks. They may have a huge weight in the index, but they continue to have operating problems. However, a lot of the other companies have done well,” said one Athenian broker.Are these gains merely a ‘dead-cat bounce’ off an oversold low or do they represent real operating improvements? In many cases the higher stock prices are justified by improved operating results.“A lot of companies have been able to contain costs while working hard to find new markets abroad,” said Nikos Pantlelakis, head of Pantelakis Securities.One example of this is Thrace Plastics, a company that says it has operations in 10 countries and records 84 per cent of its sales outside Greece. Group profit for the first nine months of 2012 was up 22.5 per cent compared to same period last year. The Ebitda margin jumped to 10.4 per cent from 8.8 per cent.“These operating gains are explained since 85 per cent of our turnover is outside Greece and a lot of effort is given to maintaining and improving our margins” said Thrace Plastics Group CFO Dimitris Malamos. He said that Thrace Plastics derives most of its sales from Europe and the US, and that the company has recently entered the Chinese market. Included in their European operations is a major facility in Scotland that employs 455 people and produces technical fabrics used in a wide variety of applications including horticulture, construction, geotextiles, sports and leisure, floor coverings, and furniture and bedding. He added, however, that the economic uncertainty in the EU and the US has caused the company to hold off on a final decision for planned investments until at least the second half of 2013.Although major institutional investors remain on the sidelines, Nikos Pantelakis said there is some interest. “Interest in Greek stocks is slowly rebuilding. There are more than a few people coming to Greece looking for opportunities,” Pantelakis added.This sentiment was echoed by a broker in New York who said hedge funds are showing some interest in Greece as a play on the larger issue of whether the euro breaks up or stays together. “A lot of small to medium sized hedge funds are willing to look at Greece now that it has become clear the euro will stay together. Then you have investors who previously had been in Greece and know the companies, got out when the crisis hit, and are now slowly coming back to the few big, international names in the market,” he said.“The big funds are just not ready to look at Greece. The whole market is a rounding error in a $4bn fund. You would have trouble building a 1 per cent position in any decent semi-liquid stock. It’s not seen as worth the risk, especially as their clients may not like seeing Greece anywhere in the portfolio at year-end,” he added.Will Greece be one of the better counter-intuitive investment plays in 2013? It’s too early to tell, but some investors with a taste for adventure have already had a decent ride.David Edgerly is a former fund manager in Turkey and the Middle East. He writes about the region in his Levantine Musings blog.Related reading:

514;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Fund file: are EM investors getting more than they bargained for?;;"If investors were asked to give a chunk of money directly to emerging market governments, most would refuse. But in the stampede towards low-cost, index linked investment in emerging markets, many will effectively end up doing just that, according to a report in Monday’s FTfm.Arjun Divecha, chairman of GMO’s board and manager of three of its emerging markets funds, says GMO research shows that about 35 per cent of the constituents of the widely benchmarked MSCI emerging market index are companies that are owned or controlled governments and that these companies actually account for about 70 per cent of the earnings generated by that index.“In our view, in the long run there’s a problem with investing in these government controlled companies,” Divecha says, explaining that government control produces two broad risks. The first is of excessive taxation or even expropriation of assets.“When economies turn down, as they have in the last few years, then it becomes hard for government owners to resist the pull of raiding these companies and treating them like a piggy bank,” he says.Divecha’s second concern second relates to shareholder interests. “Our view is that it is basically hard to serve two masters when one is your government and the other is your shareholders.”But passive investment champions, such as Jeff Molitor, chief investment officer in Europe for Vanguard, the low-cost ETF provider, think investors should not feel pressured to look at anything beyond returns and costs.The question boils down to the results you get, says Molitor. Although some active managers can outperform at a given moment, when you look at the results that stock pickers get across the board they are not better than passive managers, especially when you factor in costs, which are higher.He points out that developed markets also have risks relating to excessive control. “To say that government-owned entities are not run solely for the benefit of the public investors unfairly singles out emerging markets. You could say that about many other companies that are tightly controlled and traded in developed markets.”But Mark Robertson, head of communications at Eiris, the responsible investment consultancy, thinks there are particular problems with emerging market index tracking.“Environmental, social and governance factors have a particular importance in emerging markets. If you’re investing passively then there is a real risk that you are not taking on board these issues and protecting yourself against the risks,” he says. The risks are not homogenous, Robertson says, and could range from labour rights in China to governance risks in Russia.But the stampede is on. Of the $79bn invested in emerging markets funds for the year to November 21, 40 per cent (or $31bn) has gone into ETFs, according to EPFR Global, the funds data provider – a 5 percentage point jump on when beyondbrics last checked these figures six weeks earlier.“I think passive investing is a curse sent to us by the devil. I think it’s extremely dangerous,” says Jan Dehn co-head of research at Ashmore group, an active manager in emerging markets.Lots of investors are not listening.Related reading:

515;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-12-09T03:52:01Z;Rise in EM passive funds raises issues about risk;Many say passive EM investment is just too risky;The battle lines between active and passive managers appear more sharply drawn than ever, especially when it comes to emerging markets, which have seen a huge jump in index-linked investment.Of the $79.2bn invested in emerging markets funds for the year to November 21, 39.5 per cent (or $31.35bn) has gone into exchange traded funds, according to EPFR Global, the funds data provider. ETFs’ share of emerging market investment also appears to be growing fast. Figures released by EPFR for the year to October 10 show ETFs’ share has grown by nearly 5 percentage points (from 35 per cent) in just over a month.However, some would argue that investors’ rush into passive emerging market investment is misguided. “I think passive investing is a curse sent to us by the devil. I think it’s extremely dangerous,” says Jan Dehn, co-head of research at Ashmore group, an active manager in emerging markets.Mark Robertson, head of communications at Eiris, the responsible investment consultancy, agrees. He thinks the need for an active approach is particularly acute in emerging markets.“Environmental, social and governance factors have a particular importance in emerging markets. If you’re investing passively then there is a real risk that you are not taking on board these issues and protecting yourself against the risks,” he says, pointing out that risks are not homogenous and could range from labour rights in China to governance risks in Russia.Worse still is the perception that emerging market trading is now so mature that risks are priced in, says Mr Robertson. “These risks are not necessarily priced in and increasingly not in these days of rising investment in emerging markets,” he says.His views are, perhaps not surprisingly, echoed by active managers who are keen to emphasise the risks that are inherent in the passive approach.Arjun Divecha, chairman of GMO’s board and manager of three GMO emerging markets funds, points to the fund manager’s research into government control of emerging market stocks.He says about 35 per cent of constituents of the widely benchmarked MSCI EM index are companies that are owned or controlled by governments while also about 70 per cent of earnings generated on the index come from these government-controlled companies.“In our view, in the long run there’s a problem with investing in these government-controlled companies,” he says explaining that government control produces two broad risks. The first is of excessive taxation or even expropriation of assets.“When economies turn down, as they have in the last few years, then it becomes hard for government owners to resist the pull of raiding these companies and treating them like a piggy bank,” he says.The second relates to shareholder interests. “Our view is that it is basically hard to serve two masters when one is your government and the other is your shareholders.”Sandra Crowl, who sits on the investment committee of Carmignac Gestion, the French asset manager, agrees that government influence is something that investors should consider. “When you invest in an emerging market ETF or index tracker it means you will be investing in some of the largest companies in the emerging markets and they can be strongly influenced by the governments of the countries they are in,” says Ms Crowl.Active management, on the other hand, allows an investor to cherry-pick companies that are most likely to deliver the returns that investors are looking for in emerging markets, she says. “The principal reason for not being tied to a benchmark is so that you can choose investments in companies, countries or sectors where you are going to see growth.”But passive investment champions, such as Jeff Molitor, chief investment officer in Europe for Vanguard, the low-cost ETF provider, thinks investors should not focus on the arguments put forward by active managers.The question boils down to the results that you get, says Mr Molitor. He says, although some active managers can beat the index, when you look at the results that active managers get across the board they are not better than passive managers, especially when you factor in costs, which are higher.Mr Molitor also rejects the view that government-controlled entities might not be working to increase shareholder value. “If that’s the case, why are they publicly traded?” he asks.He points out that developed markets also have risks relating to excessive control. “To say that government-owned entities are not run solely for the benefit of the public investors unfairly singles out emerging markets. You could say that about many other companies that are tightly controlled and traded in developed markets.”Brett Hammond, managing director of index applied research at index provider MSCI, agrees with Mr Molitor that it is wise to consider risks across all markets, rather than focus on emerging markets in particular. “Concentrated ownership really matters to investors,” he says, adding that this could extend to companies where the founder, founding family or management retained majority control of a listed company.“No matter who owns it, if you have concentrated ownership it is a concern.” He says MSCI pioneered float adjustment and continues to exclude any company that floats less than 15 per cent of its shares on an index.But perhaps as an indication that some investors are beginning to doubt the wisdom of the purely passive approach, he also confirmed that there had been an “explosion of interest” in MSCI’s smart beta products as investors sought to move away from a purely market capitalisation weighted index approach.

Over the year so far Europe has now cantered past the US, with more than a 15 per cent total return on the MSCI index compared with less than 14 per cent in the US.The rally remained intact even after gloomy ECB growth forecasts released following the central bank’s interest rate-setting meeting in Frankfurt.“Equity investors see that the ECB is following a policy of cheap money to stabilise the currency union,” says Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “That will also be positive for the growth outlook and Germany will outperform the eurozone.”Yet the trend has little to do with an improving eurozone economy – and many analysts also expect earnings-per-share figures for European companies to fall or at least stay flat next year.Instead, the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” – or bond-buying – programme, launched by Mr Draghi in September, has reassured investors a backstop was in place to shore up the eurozone if needed, even if the programme has yet to be activated.“The risk of some cataclysmic implosion has receded since the summer, and that is basically what has been driving stocks higher,” says Bertie Thomson, senior fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. “Risk premiums have fallen sharply.”Mislav Matejka, European equity strategist at JPMorgan, adds: “It is not that there is likely to be much growth in the eurozone next year but that the stocks are undervalued compared with global peers, so they have some real catching up to do.”At the start of the summer the ratio of the price to forward-looking earnings was just 8.4 for stocks on the MSCI Europe index compared with 11.3 on the comparable US index. But in recent months, following the ECB move, this ratio for European equities has risen by nearly 30 per cent to 10.8 times. The move has brought valuations more in line with US stocks, which have a ratio of 12.8 times.In another sign that investors have become more sanguine, equity market volatility in Europe is at its lowest level in five years. The Vstoxx index, which measures market expectations for volatility, has been hovering at about 16 for the past week, its lowest level since 2007.Some analysts see the outlook for eurozone equities as depending crucially on politics, given that growth in the eurozone economy is forecast to be tepid at best. “To repeat the summer’s performance, we’ll need another piece of good news on the politics,” says Nick Nelson, global equity strategist at UBS.Still, there are signs the rally in European equities has also been driven by hopes that the financial stability provided by the ECB and better prospects elsewhere in the world will eventually feed into the eurozone real economy.Germany’s Dax index, which has risen 28 per cent this year to its highest value since January 2008, is positioned to benefit most from improvements in the global economy, given its companies’ exposure to export markets.Mr Draghi, for his part, cited surging European share prices as a sign of financial confidence returning to Europe’s monetary union. At his regular monthly press conference in Frankfurt, he also pointed to improvements in business confidence across the eurozone’s main economies, although he stopped short of predicting a turnround in the region’s weak growth prospects.The ECB revised down significantly its forecasts for eurozone economic growth, saying it expected the pace of next year’s contraction to be in a range with a midpoint of minus 0.3 per cent. In September, it had expected a 0.5 per cent expansion.However, eurozone purchasing managers’ indices this week suggested the worst of the eurozone recession was over, although they still pointed to a sharp economic contraction in the final three months of this year. Germany, meanwhile, on Thursday reported an unexpectedly steep 3.9 per cent rise in manufacturing orders in October compared with September.Deutsche Bank this month advised investors to buy global cyclical stocks in Europe, forecasting that global growth of 3.5 per cent would drive shares higher in 2013. The bank tipped companies including SKF, the Swedish ball bearings maker, and BASF, the German chemicals company, as likely to be some of the best performing stocks next year.In 2012 European financial and insurance stocks have been among the best performers, says Mr Nelson at UBS. “If the PMIs are right that the economy is at a turning point, it could be time to rotate out of financials and into some of the more economically cyclical parts of the market.”Additional reporting by Alexandra Stevenson
517;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-12-05T08:51:41Z;Chinese equities: a bounce at last;;After a long decline to their lowest levels for four years, Chinese stocks finally bounced off the bottom on Wednesday on hopes of more action from Beijing to boost the economy.The Shanghai Composite closed 2.9 per cent higher, with construction-related groups leading the way, headed by Sany Heavy Industry (up 10 per cent). This may be an over-reaction to the new administration’s proposals for an acceleration in urban development. But if these plans become policies, foreign fund managers who have been buying China recently will be congratulating themselves on their foresight.Investors were also buoyed by news from the financial sector, with reports of government plans to relax rules on banks investing in insurance and news of HSBC selling its $9.4bn stake in Ping An Insurance , the second-largest insurer, to companies controlled by Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group. Ping An rose 4.1 per cent on relief that the 15.6 per cent holding seems to have found a new long-term owner.The bulls were equally strong in Shenzhen where stocks rose 3.8 per cent, and in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng closed 2.2 per cent up, and the China Enterprises Index finished 2.7 per cent higher.But the euphoria was largely limited to China, with markets elsewhere held back by the concerns about the US fiscal cliff. The $-based MSCI index for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan was up by just 0.9 per cent.embed 2In any case, China has a lot of ground to catch up. As the chart shows, Shanghai is down 6 per cent on the year, while the MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan is up 14 per cent.Over the global crisis years, the contrast is even greater.
518;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-17T02:53:47Z;Vanguard adopts small provider’s benchmark;CRSP has a long academic track record;A previously little-known index provider has been thrust into the spotlight after Vanguard, the world’s fourth-largest fund manager, said last month that it was adopting CRSP indices as the benchmarks for some of its largest index funds.Although CRSP indices are less known among fund managers than the benchmarks provided by established commercial index providers, the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) has an established record in the indexing business since its foundation as a research centre at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1960.David Barclay, chief operating officer at CRSP, says Vanguard’s decision to adopt CRSP indices came as “a very pleasant surprise”.Bill McNabb, Vanguard chief executive, said at the time of the announcement that investors would save millions of dollars in index licensing fees over the long run through Vanguard’s switching from MSCI indices to benchmarks from CRSP and FTSE.Mr McNabb added that the new benchmarks would enhance index tracking precision for Vanguard’s funds, and better reflect underlying market components.CRSP has received further expressions of interest in its indices from other fund managers since the Vanguard switch.Mr Barclay says CRSP is not aiming to become a rival to established index providers such as MSCI or S&P Dow Jones Indices. Rather, he hopes to have just a small number of clients for CRSP’s investable indexes. Mr Barclay’s immediate priority is to provide CRSP research index to its 435 academic subscribers in 31 countries.CRSP started work on the investable index family in 2007, and in 2009 Vanguard provided “a little” development funding.Vanguard will pay licence fees to use the CRSP indices but Mr Barclay emphasises that the fund manager has not provided any additional funding.Vanguard is also encouraging co-operation between its portfolio managers and back-office staff with CRSP’s researchers, says Mr Barclay, as they worked together to develop indices that were both efficient and fully investable rather than academic benchmarks that a passive fund manager would have difficulty in matching in the real world.One of CRSP’s main indexing innovations has been the development of “packeting” – a method to reduce portfolio turnover.When considering whether a company should be classified as a large or mid or small stock, CRSP uses market capitalisation bands rather than break points, the lines drawn by all index providers to determine those categories.If a company has moved significantly through a breakpoint, a “packet” of 50 per cent of its total holdings is moved between the two indices.As a result, a company could appear in both a small and mid-cap index if its market capitalisation sits in the band on either side of the breakpoint between these two indices.“Fund managers want efficiency, so they want to reduce extraneous turnover in their portfolios while also maintaining a low tracking error to the underlying index. Packeting helps that,” says Mr Barclay.He says fund managers are hunting for any way to reduce costs in the current environment, in which asset returns and interest rates are expected to remain low by historic standards.And just as ETF investors have to “look under the hood” to understand the assets they are investing in, so index users should want assurance that they are using a high quality, efficient benchmark.As well as calculating cap weighted indices, CRSP offers a historic stock database with daily data stretching back to 1925, a survivor-bias-free US mutual fund database, a US Treasuries database and custom data services.It has also developed a merged database in partnership with Capital IQ Compustat, another provider of financial information, that allows subscribers to access both CRSP’s stock data and Compustat’s fundamental company data to help them analyse relationships utilising these two datasets.Another collaborative project is the CRSP/Ziman real estate data series that CRSP has developed in partnership with the Richard Ziman Center for Real Estate at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.Mr Barclay says this is a unique resource that allows researchers to analyse the US property market by combining stock prices and returns with historic data from real estate investment trusts.
519;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-17T02:53:47Z;Differences narrow as MSCI defends its patch;Rival indices share most constituents but there are differences;Once a year, investors and analysts in the United Arab Emirates engage in what has almost become a ritual for the local financial community – guessing whether the oil-soaked Gulf country will finally be included by MSCI in its influential emerging markets index.Local and international investment banks and brokerages spew out research reports predicting with varying degrees of confidence that the country will – or will not – be promoted from the index provider’s “frontier markets” gauge, and try to estimate the potential benefits.The fillip of an inclusion can be significant. MSCI estimates that based on data from Lipper, Bloomberg and eVestment data, institutional and retail funds with assets of almost $1.2tn reference the MSCI Emerging Markets index (some funds do not necessarily divulge their benchmark).EFG-Hermes, a regional investment bank, has in the past estimated that under a “best-case scenario” as much as $1.5bn could enter the UAE, and $3.9bn could flow into Qatar – another country that has been on review for an upgrade by MSCI.“Clearly a lot of people follow our indices, and changes made in the composition are important for countries and companies,” notes Baer Pettit, managing director and head of the MSCI Index business.Yet MSCI’s leading franchise in emerging market equities recently received a broadside from Vanguard, the US mutual fund behemoth. In October the asset manager changed the reference index of its $67bn Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund and its exchange traded fund from MSCI to FTSE’s equivalent.Although Vanguard moved nearly half its passive assets away from MSCI, the shift from the MSCI Emerging Markets gauge stood out, given the index provider’s dominance of the asset class.Cost appears to have been an important driver of Vanguard’s decision, but not all its investors appear to have agreed with it. The Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF attracted only $1m in net inflows in October, compared with average monthly inflows of $1.3bn this year, according to the ETF Industry Association.In reality, the difference between the various indices has become relatively small over the years. FTSE’s developing market gauge references just over 790 companies in 22 countries, while MSCI’s index has 818 constituents from 21 countries, for example, and there is plenty of overlap.The similarities are reflected in the performance. The MSCI Emerging Markets index has outperformed the FTSE Emerging gauge by 0.4 per cent over the past year. Since the start of 2000, the FTSE index has gained only 5.9 per cent more than its MSCI counterpart.“You see quite different opinions among investors on preferences between MSCI, S&P, FTSE and Russell for example, but over the past 10-15 years the broad cap weighted equity indices have become more homogenous,” says Scott Ebner, global head of ETF product development at State Street Global Advisors, which for the most part uses MSCI’s indices for its emerging market funds.Nonetheless, there are some differences that stand out. The UAE was promoted to FTSE’s emerging index in 2010, but continues to languish as a frontier market with MSCI, due to settlement issues and caps on foreign ownership.South Korea has also been promoted to FTSE’s developed market indices, but MSCI has kept it classified as an emerging market.Indeed, the Asian country has the second-biggest weighting in the MSCI EM gauge, falling behind China but ahead of Brazil, Taiwan and South Africa. Samsung is the single biggest company in the index, with a 3.7 per cent weighting.When Vanguard switched from MSCI to FTSE, this meant that its EM ETF had to increase its allocation to Brazil and China, and dump its South Korean holdings, highlighting the benefits of inclusion in various indices.While differences of opinion on a country’s classification are common, corporate classifications that can prove more problematic – and increasingly so as companies seek listings outside their domestic markets.For example, Prada, the Italian luxury goods company, and US luggage maker Samsonite last year floated in Hong Kong. Although emerging markets are a vital driver of their business, they remain headquartered in Italy and the US, and much of their revenue is still in developed countries.Similarly, Singapore Telecom is listed and based in the southeast Asian city-state, but relies on its Australian subsidiary Optus for about two-thirds of its revenue.“We have clear and transparent rules on countries, and equally on company nationalities. Some companies can be harder to put in a particular basket because we take a large number of factors into consideration,” says Jamie Perrett, director of index research at FTSE.“It can be complicated and will probably become more so in time, as more companies globalise and, for example, list outside their home markets,” he adds.
520;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-17T02:53:47Z;Smart beta defies simple definition;Alternative indices still have to prove their worth for investors;Everyone, it seems, is talking about smart beta and because the term is relatively recent it sounds like the new kid on the block.In fact, in many cases the group of strategies and indices it is now being used to describe have been around for a number of years – long enough to consider the wisdom and costs of different approaches.“We’ve been looking at it for at least the last decade or so. Over the past few years we’ve been going to our clients and saying that we think it’s not only a good idea, it’s investable,” says Phil Tindall, senior investment consultant at Towers Watson, the consultancy.“Defining it is quite hard. It’s kind of a new science. We see smart beta as a continuum between beta [broad market performance] and alpha [outperformance such as might be achieved by an active manager],” he says.A presentation on smart beta by Towers Watson at the beginning of November shows its broad definition includes investment in long-term themes such as emerging wealth or sustainability, or diversifying asset classes such as infrastructure or systematic risk premium capture which along with value-weighted equity indices also includes strategies such as currency carry.Towers Watson’s clients globally have now assigned more than £11bn ($17.5bn) to its broadly defined smart beta strategies with £1bn in new money since the end of March.Although some in the industry have dismissed smart beta as “active management in drag”, for most investors the quest for smart beta will take them to what most in the industry would call an index.These indices will, as Rolf Agather, managing director of research and innovation at Russell Indexes says, help them pursue a certain goal. These goals might include weighting companies by measures of size other than market cap, or providing exposure to certain types of stocks, such as high dividend paying or low volatility.Some in the industry, such as David Morris, founder and chief executive of GWA, who claims to have launched the world’s first non-price weighted index in August 2005, would value only a very narrow definition.As a former economist he was convinced that a company’s real value derives from its underlying wealth creation, so he built an investment approach based on book value.“I originally saw what I did as an active strategy,” he says. Due to his belief that short-term securities prices do not lead to long term value, he thinks minimum volatility strategies, for example, should not be included in smart beta groupings because they still use price-based variables in their weighting schemes.This splitting of hairs is common in conversations about what constitutes smart beta, but stepping back it is possible to see some broad trends appearing in the smart beta universe.MSCI, the index provider, has four branded smart beta indices that capture four of the most common approaches that are now labelled smart beta.It launched its equally weighted approach in 2008, the same year it also launched its minimum volatility indices.Value-weighted followed in 2010 and the most recent addition to its smart beta stable are the risk-weighted indices launched in 2011.But, with so many providers to choose from, there is now increasing focus on strategies’ relative costs.Dimitris Melas, global head of new product research at MSCI, says costs tend to be higher than for market cap indices, but he cautions that investors should not only be looking at the headline cost measure, they should also be inquiring about turnover.“For every 10 per cent increase in turnover there is a 5 basis point [0.05 per cent] reduction in net return, which might not sound a lot, but it can add up,” says Mr Melas.Towers Watson also looks at turnover very closely.“By not using price, you are going to incur higher turnover and something that is maybe double the turnover of the index in a liquid market we would find OK,” Mr Tindall says, adding that some of the more complex strategies might end up incurring far higher turnover and therefore associated costs. Market cap indices typically have a turnover of 8-10 per cent, Mr Tindall says.Mr Melas says turnover for the MSCI smart beta indices varies between 20 per cent, for minimum volatility and value-weighted, to 25 per cent for equally weighted and risk-weighted.MSCI cap-weighted indices average turnover of about 5 per cent. The modest turnovers achieved by MSCI, however, are achieved because it rebalances both cap-weighted and strategy indices only every six months.Potential investors in smart beta strategies must not only weigh the complex formulas that determine costs, risks and returns, they also have a profusion of new smart beta offerings to consider whose only worth has been determined by back testing.ETF provider Vanguard, a rigid follower of market cap strategies, issued a paper in July this year that warned many of the new strategy indices created for ETFs could disappoint as their reported returns were based on only hypothetical data.“Every back test is good – it’s another thing to run it live,” says Mr Melas, adding: “Personally, I tend to be cynical about back testing, including our own back tests.”Mr Tindall agrees. “You certainly should be sceptical of back tests. Have you ever seen a bad back test?”.But smart beta proponents point out that even though some indices have underperformed after launch, it may be too early to draw conclusions. In addition, different investment climates suit different strategies. Mr Melas points out that the last three years have not been good for value and fundamentally weighted indices, although minimum volatility indices have done well.For investors who have decided to move away from market cap, there is much to consider.
521;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-17T02:53:47Z;CME Group veteran to head Index Industry Association;Rick Redding is appointed as the first executive director of the trade body;Rick Redding has been appointed as the first executive director of the Index Industry Association (IIA), the trade body set up this year by leading index providers to promote best practice standards.Mr Redding spent most of his career with the CME Group, the exchange operator, where he held the post of managing director, products and services at CME.He has a wealth of experience in the indexing industry and played an integral part in the creation of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the indexing joint venture that was created last year by CME and McGraw-Hill, the parent company of S&P.“I am looking forward to working with the industry and the relevant regulatory bodies to promote practices that will benefit investors,” says Mr Redding.The IIA’s membership has now expanded to six providers. Russell Investments has just joined the association, following in the footsteps of Barclays and Nasdaq OMX which became members in June. The IIA was set up in March 2012 by FTSE, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices.Ron Bundy, chief executive of Russell Indexes, says Russell has joined the IIA to help investors develop a better understanding of the role of indices and to participate in establishing standards across the industry.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE and chair of the IIA, says: “Building an independent association is key to maintaining the health and high standards of the index industry.”
522;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-11T05:56:26Z;Delistings worry for managers;Peripheral eurozone states’ delistings could affect liquidity;Delistings from exchanges in Greece, Ireland and other peripheral eurozone states could deter fund managers from buying into companies in those countries, equity investors have warned.FTfm has learnt that at least four companies from Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have engaged lawyers with a view to moving their primary listings to London. That comes after Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, Greece’s largest company by market capitalisation, announced plans to leave the Athens exchange, mimicking a number of high-profile defections from the Irish stock exchange to London over the past year.Fund managers say delistings may eat into trading volumes when peripheral eurozone exchanges, and the companies listed on them, are being buffeted by a lack of confidence in their domestic economies.“The impact on liquidity is a concern,” said Paul Squires, head of trading at Axa Investment Managers. “As liquidity dries up it becomes more expensive to build or exit positions and that can influence investment decisions.”Funds with eurozone-only mandates may be forced to sell their holdings in companies that adopt primary listings in London.On the other hand companies that switch to London would become eligible investments for funds with UK mandates. Shares in CRH, a Dublin-based building materials company, rose 4 per cent the day it moved its primary listing to London, as traders anticipated buying by FTSE index-tracking funds. An LSE listing may also make it easier to issue more shares.“London is well regarded with a deep pool of investors and fund managers, which makes it easier to raise capital,” said Mark Austin, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, who has had inquiries from several companies about moving listings to London.But for exchanges in the eurozone’s periphery, losing out to London threatens to start a vicious cycle.“For exchanges like Dublin’s, losing companies is a big deal,” said a London-based small-cap fund manager. “It reduces liquidity and there is knock-on effect for brokers in terms of redundancies. That means less research so trading is of lower quality.”Ailish Byrne, at the Irish stock exchange, said trading volumes were not always adversely affected. Turnover of CRH shares in Dublin, where it has maintained a secondary listing, has increased since it moved its primary listing to London.But some companies, such as the Irish healthcare provider United Drug, have dropped out of their domestic exchanges altogether in favour of London listings.Luís Laginha, chief executive of NYSE Euronext Lisbon, said where Portuguese companies are considering listing abroad, they would maintain a primary listing in Lisbon. He also said investors had raised concerns about liquidity on the exchange during the eurozone crisis:“Liquidity is a concern for everyone connected to the market, and I can’t deny this has come up, but this is not something you hear fund managers only talking about in the context of the the Portuguese market,” he said.The loss of primary listings also threatens the standing of peripheral eurozone states in global equity indices, which are a key source of trading volume and investor interest.Coca-Cola Hellenic is one of just two companies in the MSCI Greek index, and MSCI will have to add a small company to the index to ensure it can still be calculated. MSCI warned in June it may demote Greece to “emerging” market status next year.Nikos Porfyris, deputy chief operating officer of the Helex Group that runs the Athens exchange, said foreign investors continue to be responsible for more than 50 per cent of trading and that Coca-Cola Hellenic is expected to maintain a secondary listing in Athens.The process of transferring a listing to London can be completed in less than two months according to lawyers, thanks to a clause in the European Union prospectus directive that allows companies traded on an EU-regulated exchange for 18 months, and with an approved prospectus, to list on another without issuing a new prospectus.People familiar with thinking at the London Stock Exchange said officials there have discussed the potential for more eurozone companies to switch their listing to London.“The LSE is certainly not discouraging the trend,” said one person close to the exchange.One London-based fund manager said: “It’s politically sensitive for the LSE to poach companies, but from my perspective, the more companies listed in London, the more choice of investments I have”.The LSE declined to comment.
523;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-11T05:54:30Z;Index switch hits Vanguard;As inflows evaporate, Vanguard defends cost-saving move;Inflows into Vanguard’s largest exchange traded fund have evaporated in the wake of its decision at the beginning of October to switch from tracking an MSCI index to a cheaper FTSE benchmark.The Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF attracted $1m in net inflows in October, compared with average monthly inflows of $1.3bn between January and September, says the ETF Industry Association.The drop in inflows for Vanguard is not attributable to reduced demand for emerging market ETFs generally. iShares’ rival fund received $1.3bn in net inflows last month, compared with average monthly inflows of $182m between January and September.The Vanguard ETF’s success was one of the key factors behind its parent winning the title of fastest growing US ETF provider in 2010 and 2011, ahead of iShares, the world’s largest ETF manager.Some fund managers have expressed reservations about the index switch, which they estimate will save 1 or 2 basis points a year in index licence fees. They question if the cost savings are worthwhile in view of the potential disruption to their portfolios.One manager from a Latin American pension fund with $45bn in assets under management said he was “upset” by the switch, which was announced without prior consultation. He said his fund’s international equity exposures were benchmarked against MSCI indices, a policy approved by the fund’s investment board that would now need to be re-examined.Rob Williams, principal at Sage Advisory Services, US registered investment adviser with $11bn in assets, said there were meaningful differences between the two emerging markets indices and that Vanguard’s switch had “created problems”.A key issue highlighted by some is South Korea is classified as an emerging market by MSCI but as a developed market by FTSE. Managers who wish to remain with Vanguard and retain an exposure to Seoul face having to make adjustments in their portfolios.Larry Whistler, chief investment officer of Nottingham Advisors, an independent US financial adviser based in Buffalo with $750m of assets, said he applauded Vanguard for putting downward pressure on fees. But he questioned whether the switch was designed to benefit Vanguard, or financial advisers, many of whom may be forced to make portfolio adjustments, creating tax liabilities for their clients.Vanguard has defended its move, saying large institutions, financial advisers and direct retail clients have all provided positive feedback.Francis Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard’s investment strategy group, said it anticipated inflows might slow in the short term but believed the index switch would benefit investors over the long run.“The switch will solidify our cost leadership in indexing over the next decade and beyond,” he said.Meanwhile BlackRock has launched a new low-cost vehicle, the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which carries a total expense ratio of 18 basis points, undercutting Vanguard by 2bp.However, BlackRock has not reduced fees on its existing product, which still costs 67bp.Mr Kinniry said he was “surprised” that more institutions and advisers who held the iShares ETF were not angry that the fee had not been cut.“Giving new investors lower cost products while not delivering savings to your existing clients does not seem to reward loyalty,” said Mr Kinniry.
524;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-11T05:52:59Z;Appetite rises for alternative indices;Aim to limit costs but boost returns is driving interest;An increasing number of investors are moving away from traditional market capitalisation-based indices to alternative strategies, known as smart beta, in search of better returns and lower costs amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic climate.State Street Global Advisors has seen a sharp rise in assets under management, in what it describes as advanced beta – a term that reflects a rejection of market cap-based equity indices, and bond indices that grant the highest weightings to companies and countries with the highest debt levels – to more innovative, alternative methods of index construction.SSGA saw its assets in advanced beta strategies rise by 53 per cent to $22.3bn in 2011. BlackRock has also seen a more modest rise.“The search for alternative indices is on. The appeal is lower costs and getting market exposure to specific themes such as gold or forestry,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, a consultancy.Richard Hannam, head of global equity beta solutions for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at SSgA, also believes cost is driving the shift. “Large pension funds in Europe, the UK, the US and Australia are doing this as the costs in moving from active to passive in the portfolio are attractive to them,” he adds.Industry-wide figures are hard to track down, but Mr Rajan estimates that about $5tn is now invested in smart beta via a panoply of exchange traded funds, fundamental indices and bespoke indices.Index providers are also experiencing rising demand for alternative or fundamental approaches in which stocks are weighted by metrics such as book value, dividends and sales, or minimum variance where portfolios are designed to reduce volatility.To some, a passive investment in smart beta is seen as replicating some of the over- and underweightings a more expensive traditional active manager might choose to make.At MSCI, Dimitris Melas, global head of new product research, says pension funds and endowment funds are “starting to recognise alpha [excess returns] comes from systemic risk and return [factors]. They realise they can tap into this in a simpler way without paying active management fees.” Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest US public pension fund, some Nordic pension funds and APG of the Netherlands have already taken this route, he adds.The appetite for customised or bespoke indices is on the rise, with some investors asking for a specific bias such as value-weighted or equal-weighted strategies, he says. MSCI has been producing alternative equity indices since 2006. Last year it added risk-weighted indices, tilted to stocks perceived to have lower risk, to its range.ETFs, with $1.8tn of managed assets, make up part of the alternative passive universe but pension funds are exercising caution, mainly choosing physically backed ETFs rather than more complex synthetic ones, says Mr Rajan. They are also concerned about the short-term nature of themed ETFs.Smart beta bond strategies are also increasingly popular. California-based Research Affiliates has developed fundamental indices for US investment-grade bonds, high-yield corporate bonds, and emerging market ones.On the equity front, State Street’s Mr Hannam says the next step in alternative beta strategies is to construct more indices combining several strategies rather than “the single-factor tilts that we have mostly seen so far”, because they will offer more upside.Alternative indices, whether combined or not, are “better than owning cap-weighted indices”, he argues. Historic backtesting of smart beta indices such as value weighted and small cap tend to show an outperformance over traditional market cap indices.Research Affiliates says its fundamental index approach has generated added value of 2-4 percentage points a year over cap weighted-indices for large stocks in developed markets, based on long-term simulations. For less efficient areas, such as emerging equities, the opportunity to add value is greater.But some index providers and asset managers say alternative indices do not beat market cap indices all the time, and the heightened concentration risk that can ensue when people pile into such indices can affect their efficiency.“These alternative strategies are not a magic bullet,” Mr Melas says.He emphasises the importance of backtesting live indices rather than simulated ones to gain a realistic perspective of historic returns. Selecting the right strategy to suit conditions is also important.“ Minimum volatility strategies tend to perform better in times of crisis because they emphasise stocks that are less volatile than the market and more resilient in times of downturn. They may not rise the best [in other environments] but will not fall as sharply either,” he adds.But there is agreement on the advantage of lower costs that such strategies offer compared with active management charges. There is also a consensus that the nascent alternatives strategies business is set to grow over the next few years, although the cap weighted approach to equities and debt in issuance method of weighting bonds are likely to remain dominant.However, although the rise of alternative beta may be seen as a challenge to active managers, it could also create opportunities for active managers, offering them a shot at redemption.“Asset managers have a chance to identify neglected stocks outside the indices that have been ignored,” Mr Rajan adds.

But not good enough to dispell investors’ post-election concerns about the US and its fiscal cliff.Markets were intially bouyed by the numbers from Beijing on Friday, showing bigger-than-expected gains in retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment. But one month’s figures don’t say much about the pace or duration of any rebound – especially as they coincide with the Chinese Communist party’s congress. No Beijing statistician will have wanted to deliver bad news right now.This chart of the MSCI emerging markets’ index paints the picture of the ebb and flow of investor sentiment on Friday:The official data showed, October industrial production up by 9.6 per cent year-on-year – compared to 9.2 per cent in September and consensus forecasts of 9.4 per cent. Retail sales grew by 14.5 per cent, more than forecast and more than the 14.2 per cent seen in September. Nominal fixed asset investment so far this year was up 20.7 per cent.Meanwhile, inflation came in below expectations – at 1.7 per cent for October, compared to September’s 1.9 per cent, suggesting the authorities have room for manoeuvre as they boost the economy.Writing in the FT, Simon Rabinovitch took a positive view, saying the numbers confirmed “that the world’s second-largest economy has ended its nearly two-year slowdown”.China is still on track for growth of under 8 per cent this year, which will likely be its weakest in more than a decade, but it now appears set for a relatively strong finish to 2012 thanks to an increase in government spending and looser monetary policy in recent months.Unicredit was bullish, saying in a note:Right on time for the start of the one-week-long 18th Congress of the Communist Party (which will end with a new political leadership), the Chinese authorities published a raft of positive economic reports this morning, showing further evidence that the slowdown has run its course, thus fueling hopes of stronger growth further down the road.But Barclays warned that the authorities would still keep a close eye on inflation, including in the property market. It said in a note: “Despite softer inflation, we think price stability – including asset/property prices – will remain a key objective for the PBoC [the central bank].Meanwhile, the sceptics at Capital Economics urged observers to take note of the timing:China’s October activity data provide the strongest signs so far of economic recovery. Given that they have been published while the Party Congress is in session, some sceptics have questioned whether they can be believed. In our view, there is solid evidence of a turnaround but not of a strong rebound.So while China might see a reasonable recovery next year, the rest of the world can’t look to Beijing to pull the globe out of trouble.Related reading

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
527;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-06T16:55:19Z;BlackRock gains after ETF price cuts;Vanguard move wins less enthusiasm from investors;The most recent initiatives by BlackRock and Vanguard to win an advantage in the price war among exchange traded fund providers have met sharply differing reactions from investors.BlackRock has seen a positive reaction to its decision last month to cut fees on some of its US-listed iShares ETFs, while Vanguard’s move to cut costs for investors by switching the index provider on some of its largest ETFs has been met with less enthusiasm.Data from ETF Industry Association show that IVV, the iShares core S&P 500 ETF, grabbed the award for best selling US ETF in October with inflows of just over $2bn following BlackRock’s decision to cut the fees on this product.The positive inflows for IVV stand in marked contrast to the performance of its direct rival, SPY, which also tracks the S&P 500 index and is managed by State Street Global Advisors.SPY, which is the world’s largest ETF, registered net outflows of $7.2bn in October, the largest withdrawals of any US listed ETF last month.A third direct competitor, Vanguard’s VOO, which also tracks the S&P 500 index, attracted inflows of $227m.Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, dismissed talk of a “price war” among US ETF providers as a myth last month, just days after the world’s largest fund manager cut fees on six of its largest ETFs and launched four low cost ETFs as part of a new “core” range aimed at buy and hold investors.But BlackRock has also seen a positive reaction to a reduction in the fees for AGG, the iShares fixed income ETF that tracks the Barclays US aggregate bond index, to 8 basis points, undercutting its direct rival, Vanguard’s BND, which costs 10bp.In October, AGG attracted relatively modest inflows of $224m while Vanguard’s BND registered net outflows of $152m.State Street’s LAG which also tracks the same Barclays bond index attracted zero inflows while Charles Schwab, which cut fees on its entire ETF range in September, saw its ETF in this category, known as SCHZ, take in $21m. SCHZ is the cheapest of this group with a 5bp total expense ratio.Vanguard’s announcement at the start of October that it plans to drop MSCI as index provider to some of its largest index funds also appears to have sparked some negative sentiment among investors.The index switch will take place next year but the news seems to have had an immediate impact on VWO, Vanguard’s largest ETF which tracks the MSCI emerging markets index.Inflows into VWO completely stalled last month. It gathered a paltry $1m in net new inflows in October, a substantial decline compared with the first nine months of the year when it was gathering more than $1.2bn on average each month.VWO’s previous success in attracting inflows was one of the key factors behind Vanguard’s success in winning the title of fastest growing US ETF provider in 2010 and 2011 ahead of its larger rival iShares.In the round of fee cuts announced last month, BlackRock opted against reducing charges on EEM, even though this ETF has lost significant market share to Vanguard’s VWO.But EEM attracted inflows of $1.3bn in October, even though its management fee remains significantly more expensive than VWO.BlackRock also launched a new low cost emerging markets ETF, known as IEMG, as part of the “core range”. This tracks the MSCI emerging markets investables index, a broader benchmark that includes smaller companies. IEMG attracted inflows of $83m in October, making it the fastest growing of the four new ETFs that iShares debuted last month.The positive reaction to iShares new products combined with strong inflows into its ETFs linked to China, Brazil, emerging markets debt and gold helped to boost net new inflows for iShares to $7.7bn in October, more than double the $3.3bn which Vanguard gathered across its ETF range.That performance appears to have swung the balance further in favour of iShares in this year’s race for investors’ cash among ETF providers.So far this year, net new inflows into iShares have risen by a third to $61.2bn while Vanguard has gathered $46.2bn in new inflows, a rise of 51.2 per cent on the same period in 2011, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.
528;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-05T21:40:44Z;Equities in smaller emerging markets soar;;Emerging market equities have for the most part been the disappointment of the post-financial crisis investment landscape.Despite robust economic growth and intervention by western central banks buoying most asset classes – in the process subduing emerging market bond yields to record lows – the benchmark MSCI index for developing stock markets remains 25 per cent below its pre-crisis peak. The global MSCI World index is 22 per cent off its peak.This year has brought better tidings, but the MSCI Emerging Markets index has gained only 9.6 per cent so far in 2012. Even Europe’s turbulent bourses have beaten that, with the FTSE Eurofirst climbing almost 11 per cent in 2012.However, the disappointing performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets index has been largely caused by the limp returns of several of the largest bourses. Brazil, Russia, India and China, collectively known as the Bric countries and for some time the main economic engines of the developing world, have all been laggards of late.This obscures the robust gains of many smaller markets, such as Mexico and the Philippines, which have both hit record levels recently. Stock markets in Indonesia and South Africa have also touched records of late in local currency terms, although weakening currencies have eroded returns in US dollar terms.Arjun Divecha, chairman of GMO and head of the asset manager’s emerging markets strategy, attributes this to idiosyncratic challenges in each of the larger developing economies – and the lessons learnt from past crises by the smaller ones, particularly in Asia and Latin America.“For different reasons, all the Bric countries have had structural and cyclical problems recently,” Mr Divecha says. “These smaller markets, on the other hand, are in a good spot right now.”In fact, the performance of many smaller emerging market bourses since the financial crisis is comparable to that of “defensive” blue-chip western companies, Goldman Sachs analysts noted in a recent report, despite their cyclical nature.Goldman attributes these markets’ strong post-crisis performance primarily to the fact that many have proved resilient to turbulence emanating from the eurozone. The lower the correlation to Europe, the better the performance, the analysts concluded.“This suggests that while the smaller EM equity outperformers may not be defensive in the sense of being independent of the economic cycle, they have demonstrated a defensiveness to the ups and downs of the euro area situation,” Kamakshya Trivedi and Julian Richers write.In contrast, the smaller emerging stock markets that have underperformed recently tend to be vulnerable to the eurozone crisis.For example, the exchanges of Poland and the Czech Republic have enjoyed a rally this year, and are regarded as relatively strong, fiscally prudent members of the EU – yet both are down over the past 12 months in US dollar terms.More broadly, the divergence of emerging markets is a sign that investors are increasingly differentiating between countries and even industries in the developing world, rather than lumping disparate countries into one homogenous group, says Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley’s asset management arm.“We’re done with the era where all emerging markets do well,” says Mr Sharma, author of a book, Breakout Nations, on the next clutch of promising developing countries. “We’re finally starting to see a wide divergence of performance of these markets.”Mr Sharma’s favoured emerging markets for the next few years are Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, the last having reached a peace deal with Muslim separatist rebels after 40 years of conflict.“The Philippines was in the wilderness for a long time and it’s now making a comeback,” he says.Yet many of these smaller emerging markets will be tested by slower growth in the larger developing economies. Many of the outperformers are exposed and correlated to Chinese growth in particular, Goldman notes.Ironically, China’s stock market is among the worst performers in emerging markets. Although recent data have nurtured hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising, the Shanghai stock market has continued to tread water. Either this means that the market is overly pessimistic and could be due for a rally or it is a better reflection of the country’s economic reality, strategists say.In the latter case, “several smaller EM equity markets with significant leverage to Chinese growth are vulnerable, both in terms of their own growth performance and in their equity markets”, Goldman’s analysts conclude.
529;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-05T11:21:38Z;America is not the next Greece;Richard Bernstein says the election’s debate on debt and the Fed creates more confusion than clarity;The propaganda of the US presidential election continues to divert investors’ attention away from some critical investment issues. These distractions might help explain many investors’ underperformance during the past year. Rhetoric suggesting the US “could be the next Greece” seems quite exaggerated because the US is already experiencing a historic deleveraging, and is one of the few economies that is actually improving.The melodrama certainly contributed to investors’ underweight of the US within global equity portfolios, and that one decision caused performance to suffer. For the 12-month period ending September 30, the S&P 500’s total return was slightly above 30 per cent, whereas the MSCI World Index excluding the US returned roughly half that.Politicians rarely cite government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, but this ratio is critical to investors. A larger corporation is likely to have a larger value of assets and liabilities (such as debt) on their balance sheet than might a smaller company. However, it is a company’s debt/equity ratio that lends insight regarding the risk of the company. A larger economy is similarly more likely to have a larger total value of outstanding debt, but debt/GDP ratios offer much more insight when gauging country risk.The famous “debt clocks” scattered throughout the US, which show the real-time expansion of government debt are quite misleading. The seemingly rapid expansion of government debt, highlighted by the debt clocks’ second-by-second increases, looks horrifying, but it is important to remember that GDP expands real-time as well. A debt/GDP clock might be quite boring though, and wouldn’t attract much attention.A country’s total debt, and not simply its government debt, helps determine the value of its currency and its future standard of living, yet political discussion focuses solely on government debt. Certainly, an expansion of government debt should always be carefully watched, but the current rhetoric regarding the growth in government debt totally ignores the significant deleveraging within the remainder of the US economy.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, total US debt (ie, the combination of government, corporate, and household debt) as a percentage of GDP peaked in 2008 at 359 per cent. The current figure is about 329 per cent. Although the absolute percentage remains high by historical standards, this decrease is unprecedented since 1970.It is widely accepted that the US is entering a secular period of deleveraging, and the data so far support that notion. However, politicians ignore that the deleveraging of the US private sector is actually overwhelming the added leverage within the public sector.Some politicians criticise the Fed’s monetary policies. I have thought for more than a decade that the Fed’s policies, under both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, have shown a lack of understanding of global financial markets. Financial theory outlines that there is a point at which lower hurdle rates cause imprudent risk-taking, but the Fed’s policies to foster lower rates reflect an apparent belief that risk-taking is desirable regardless of whether marginal investment is benefiting the real economy. Extreme financial inflation can be as detrimental as extreme price inflation.Nonetheless, political criticisms of the Fed’s policies often mislead investors. Although the US central bank’s balance sheet is arguably too large, the European Central Bank’s balance sheet is larger, and the People’s Bank of China’s balance sheet is 50 per cent larger (based on central bank data as of August 31).Political propaganda regarding US debt and the Fed’s policies has influenced forecasts for the US dollar, and those forecasts have generally been too bearish. The tradable DXY index, which incorporates investors’ expectations for the dollar, has appreciated more than 10 per cent from its April 2008 trough, and fears regarding the dollar’s demise have been exaggerated.Equity investors seem similarly misled, and appear too worried about inflation caused by misperceptions of US debt and Fed policies. According to our models, US equity investors are currently expecting nearly 6 per cent inflation for the next 12 months. With US inflation running at 2 per cent, the US equity market seems very undervalued.The US economy’s improvement is not as strong as the Democrats indicate, but it is also not as tenuous as the Republicans portray it. Investors have to ignore the political rhetoric, and accept the simple fact that the US economy is one of the few economies in the world that is actually improving at all. An objective re-evaluation of the risks might be bullish for the dollar and bullish for US assets in general.Richard Bernstein is chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors
530;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-11-04T04:03:26Z;Five hedge funds that share sound performance;How some very different strategies led to outperformance;"GAM Talentum Emerging Long/Short fund (formerly the Talentum Emerging Alpha fund)Strategy: Emerging market equitiesManagers: Enrico Camera and Iain CartmilDespite protracted emerging market turbulence, the GAM Talentum Emerging Long/Short fund has taken the volatility and the downside out of investing in the developing world.The equity fund’s one, three, and five-year annualised returns have been about 9 per cent. Its historical annualised standard deviation is 6.8 per cent, way below the 29 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Market Index. And the fund’s worst drawdown or peak-to-trough fall, has been less than 7 per cent versus a sector average of more than 40 per cent.This performance is one reason we decided to include this $70.1m fund. Another was its top-tier infrastructure, which was further enhanced by the Lugano-based parent company Arkos Capital’s recent decision to sell itself to GAM, the $48bn Zurich-based global asset manager.“GAM provides a platform for much stronger asset growth,” say co-fund managers Enrico Camera and Iain Cartmill. “They take care of our back office and sales, allowing us to run the fund independently, just as we’ve been doing.”What they have been doing is effective information mining that often gets the fund ahead of earnings’ revisions. The managers go long on companies deemed to have a competitive edge and whose valuations and prospects they believe have been underestimated.In the spring of 2011, Messrs Camera and Cartmill believed analysts were not appreciating the upside that AVI, a South African consumer staples and healthcare products retailer, was likely to experience as a result of the company’s new plant investments coupled with the country’s rising real disposable income. Within a year, the stock had doubled.On the short side, the fund bets against companies that are likely to be hit by competitive and macro headwinds. In the second quarter of 2011, the managers believed Brazilian insurers would see a drop in income. “The [central bank] was significantly cutting overnight rates which we felt would reduce interest income,” recalls Mr Camera, “while multinationals were teaming up with local insurers, which would put pressure on premium income.” The managers thought these two trends meant that 2011 consensus expectations for industry profit growth in the mid-teens were too high. Earnings growth ultimately came in closer to 10 per cent.Volatility is limited by being focused on low market-correlated absolute returns. When the standard deviation of the fund breaches 10 per cent, the managers cut its exposure until it falls to single digits. And it will bring net exposure to zero during challenging markets.Talentum did this to remarkable effect in 2008. The fund gained 8.7 per cent that year while the MSCI Emerging Market Index lost more than half its value.…LJM Preservation and Growth fundStrategy: Options/volatilityManager: Anthony CaineConsistency is a key reason why LJM Preservation and Growth Fund, with only $40m in assets, was included in this year’s review. Since its inception in 2006, the fund has generated annualised returns of nearly 11.5 per cent. Its five-year annual standard deviation is 8.6 per cent, and its maximum drawdown is less than 11 per cent.Manager Anthony Caine, whose LJM Partners dates back to 1998 and who also runs several other options funds with total assets of $297m, relies on first-tier operational infrastructure we deem essential for serious investor consideration.Another compelling factor is that, although options strategies have a history of blowing up from tail-risk events, this fund came through the global financial crisis unscathed. And as a commodity trading adviser, LJM offers daily transparency, a relatively low minimum investment of $100,000, and monthly liquidity.Mr Caine thinks disciplined use of S&P 500 options – guided by proprietary modelling and macro analysis – can help neutralise exposure to volatility and the index’s underlying value. This then enables the fund to consistently profit from the normal decay in option pricing. He also goes long or short when he believes the market is inaccurately pricing near-term volatility.So far, this has mitigated significant tail risk. In 2008 when the average hedge fund fell more than 21 per cent and the S&P 500 slumped 37 per cent, the Preservation and Growth fund surged by more than 12 per cent, stung only in October when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.“A key to this outperformance was that we had seen credit markets break down in 2007 – prior to the collapse in equities – and decided to establish defensive positions going into 2008,” said Mr Caine.While his strategy has excelled during difficult markets, the rub is that it often trails when stocks rally. In 2009, when the S&P was up more than 26 per cent, the fund gained only 11.1 per cent.The reason goes to a core thesis: when markets rally more than 10 per cent in any three-month period, they are less likely to do so again over the next quarter and S&P call contracts should experience reduced volatility. However, according to Mr Caine, when markets fall, there’s a greater likelihood of further decline and increased volatility. This explains why the fund is better at containing declines than in exploiting sharp upside moves.A detailed look at performance does reveal volatility between months. “But”, says Mr Caine, “we have found characteristics of the options market that, with timely rotation of positions, enables us to realise annual returns of 11 per cent.”…Omni Macro fundStrategy: Global macroManager: Stephen RosenSeveral facts immediately distinguish this global macro fund. It has never had a down year. Annualised gains are more than 21 per cent since inception in 2007. And manager Stephen Rosen has generated these returns by making only a few discretionary trades at any one time, having just five in place at the end of June.He does not believe in asset allocation. Diversification, to Mr Rosen, is not a substitute for due diligence and risk management. He is quick to limit a drawdown. When Omni has fallen by 3 per cent, he reduces exposure by 50 per cent.He has made this move seven times, most recently in late 2010 when he thought the Federal Reserve’s second crack at quantitative easing would give risk assets only an ephemeral lift, and again in early 2011 when he expected the re-emergence of the eurozone debt crisis to hurt stocks worse than it did. Omni ended both years up, 12 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively.Mr Rosen’s core structural trades, typically lasting one to three months, are informed by public policy, market behaviour, interest rates, and liquidity. Nick Munns, his co-manager, adds shorter-term tactical trades that play out in less than a week.Omni regulates its limited, concentrated investments and risk by trading liquid leveraged contracts. Gaining exposure in this fashion enables the fund to maintain significant cash balances. The fund does not explicitly limit leverage at the portfolio level, which typically runs about 150 per cent, occasionally reaching 275 per cent.Foreign exchange-focused and peppered with commodity, equity indices, and interest rate exposure, Mr Rosen’s positions reflect macro theses or their temporary dislocation.For instance, in November 2010 with the restart of QE, markets feared soaring prices. As an inflation hedge, investors ploughed into precious metals. Mr Rosen agreed with the implications of capital flooding into markets, but he had not yet seen evidence of inflation.Three-month US Treasury rates were just a few basis points and global growth was still slow.The doubling of silver prices in early 2011, in his mind, was a result of investors becoming transfixed by a thesis.In late April, using front futures contracts, Mr Rosen began shorting silver in several pair trades, being long gold and oil.When he unwound the trades in late May, the fund gained 4 per cent.…Parus FundStrategy: Equity long/shortManagers: Fabrice Vecchioli and Edouard VecchioliParus’ managers avoid looking into the eyes of company executives. “We prefer instead to sift for evidence of disruptive innovations to help clue a position, avoiding misplaced sentiment that can come from visiting people and places,” says Fabrice Vecchioli, co-manager of the $132m fund.This unorthodox approach may have emanated from the fund’s founders having cut their teeth as fixed income specialists. Mr Vecchioli and his younger brother Edouard believed their understanding of company financials and business models would give them an edge in bottom-up stock picking.Being market-capitalisation, sector, and geographically agnostic, the four-manager team relies exclusively on their own and independent research along with fundamental analysis to assemble a portfolio around competitive themes. Typically, two-thirds of the fund’s 45 positions are long and one-third are short.When the fund started, its long positions focused primarily on growth stocks and its short positions on solid companies that were deemed to be overvalued. This did not work, “so we adjusted our strategy,” explains Fabrice, “making sure our longs included growth companies with distinct competitive advantages and our shorts targeted lesser quality operations getting hit by structural issues.”This approach has served the Paris-based shop – which is presently relocating to London – very well. Since its inception in December 2002, the fund’s dollar share class has generated annualised returns of more than 17 per cent.The ride has remained a bit bumpy with trailing five-year average standard deviation of over 15 per cent. But this is primarily the result of having investment horizons of three to five years for its long positions and one to two years for shorts. And the fund’s worst drawdown, 15.5 per cent, reflects the underlying soundness of the managers’ ideas and their ability to reverse their positions when investment theses change.The fund’s performance when volatility has been at elevated levels is noteworthy. Between 2007 and 2009, Parus outdistanced its benchmark MSCI World stock index by an average of 25 percentage points each year.It presciently cut its net long exposure of 70 per cent-plus to under 30 per cent in May 2006 in response to deteriorating business specific conditions. It built a 20 per cent short position in various financial stocks, having seen the deteriorating quality of mortgage securitisations. This generated cumulative returns of 33 per cent in 2007 and 2008.The fund resumed its long stance in October 2008, and in March 2009 it started building positions in the credit card industry. The market was projecting it as the next subprime; the managers concluded otherwise. By July, Parus had an 8.1 per cent long position in American Express, Visa, and Mastercard, which added more than 5.3 per cent to the fund’s performance by the year’s end.…Phillips, Hager & North Absolute Return fundStrategy: Multi-strategyManager: Hanif MamdamiThis is an unusual fund. It offers daily pricing and liquidity. Its management fee is 1.45 per cent. It charges no performance fee and its minimum investment is C$150,000.In contrast with many funds that are struggling to attract and sustain capital, it has been hard closed for nearly two years to help it sustain consistent performance. Since it started in October 2002, the fund has delivered annualised returns of 15 per cent. Trailing five-year annualised volatility is 7.6 per cent, and its worst drawdown is 7.8 per cent.This hedge fund could be suggesting where the industry may be heading. That is a key reason why, despite having C$732m, we decided to include it in this year’s survey. The fund was established by one of Canada’s oldest independent investment firms, Phillips, Hager & North, which Royal Bank of Canada bought in 2008. It then made Hanif Mamdani head of alternative investments.The fund has generated its compelling risk-return profile by focusing on Canadian and US securities.Two-thirds of the fund’s exposure is in investment and non-investment grade corporate bonds and income trusts, which Mr Mamdani believes are the most reliable sources of absolute returns. He then mixes in market neutral arbitrage and opportunistic plays in long, distressed, and event-driven investments.Last November his team, including analysts Emil Khimji and Justin Jacobsen, uncovered six-year Goldman Sach’s Canadian-dollar subordinated bonds trading 650 basis points above Canadian government bonds, despite the bank having made substantial improvements to its balance sheet.Mr Mamdani established a 4 per cent stake, which has so far returned 18 per cent.Several years after Loral Space and Communications led a leveraged buyout of Telesat, a global satellite service operator, Mr Mamdani saw significant balance sheet improvement, which cut leverage as a multiple of underlying earnings nearly in half. He felt this would lead to the refinancing of 11 per cent senior notes due in 2015 on the first call date. This happened in May 2012 and produced a short-term net gain of 9.5 per cent.The fund’s equity position in Cogeco Cable, a Quebec-focused cable company, has not worked so far. Mr Mamdani thought the market’s overreaction to a pending acquisition, which sliced 15 per cent off the stock, was overdone.A further decline in the share price now makes the manager believe Cogeco may be “the cheapest cable stock in the continent”. Despite being down on the trade, Mr Mamdani has bumped up exposure, making it the fund’s largest holding, demonstrating he is not afraid of following his convictions."
531;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-28T05:00:58Z;Seasoned campaigner keeps boards on their toes;Bob Monks talks about the rise, or not, of shareholder activism;"Shareholders may be finding a voice on issues such as excessive pay and board composition but Bob Monks, a shareholder activist and corporate governance adviser, believes this year’s much-heralded “shareholder spring” has been disappointing, particularly in the US.“Shareholder activism in the US is more appearance than reality, [while] in the UK there is a sense of the useful involvement of shareholders,” says Mr Monks, a founder of GMI Ratings, the US governance research and ratings provider, and of ISS, the world’s biggest proxy voting agency, now part of MSCI.He puts this down to the failure of some big US institutional investors and leaders of churches, universities, foundations and endowments to become “responsible” owners. Without this there is a lack of “legitimacy of ownership involvement”, constraining activism to the fringe unlike in the UK where governance is increasingly under public and political scrutiny, he argues.Over the past 30 years, Mr Monks says US shareholder activism has mostly been the preserve of a number of large public pension funds such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and a handful of idealistic people.He believes the process needs more empowerment and that action to strengthen responsible ownership in the US must come from the top.A mandate for shareholder involvement such as “a declaration by the president that the involvement of owners [in investee companies] is in the national interest”, would be a real trigger for change, he says.Excessive executive pay is the leading issue Mr Monks believes shareholders must tackle. “Our great smoking gun is the way in which managers pay themselves as there is no economic reason to justify the levels of pay, certainly in the US.” He argues this trend has “leaked across the ocean” to the UK.In spite of “say on pay”, a non-binding vote introduced in the US under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, he believes that power remains with senior management.He points to Citigroup, where 55 per cent of shareholders either voted against the bank’s pay plan or abstained at an annual general meeting earlier this year, yet nothing has changed. “In the process of fixing executive pay, all the components are in the gift of the management. So the management picks the board, the compensation committee and the compensation consultant,” he points out.Unsurprisingly he points to proxy advisory services as the only place where informed independent advice on pay is available.Having started ISS, originally known as Institutional Shareholder Services, he is outraged by regulators’ attempts to crack down on the outsourcing of shareholder voting decisions to proxy advisers.Earlier this year the European Securities and Markets Authority launched a consultation into Europe’s proxy industry, while earlier this month the Financial Reporting Council rewrote the UK Stewardship Code requiring investors to explain how they use proxy voting agencies amid concerns investors are following advisers’ recommendations too closely. “Trustees hire proxy voting agencies to advise them how to vote and somehow this is being seen as the proxy advisory group having too much power. Trustees do not have to take their advice,” he says.Mr Monks believes companies worried about rising shareholder protest over executive pay, often through proxy agencies, are driving opinion against such groups, particularly in the US where powerful business roundtables and chambers of commerce are keen to retain control over remuneration.This power struggle is at the heart of a book he is currently writing. In it he propounds the view that large businesses have captured the public agenda in the US, wielding autocratic power and leaving shareholders with little clout.Trained as lawyer in corporate law, Mr Monks’s career has spanned business, investment, state government administration and pension fund trusteeship before he specialised in governance issues with the establishment of ISS in 1985. Although keen to champion proxy voting agencies, he sold his stake in ISS to the Thomson Group in 1994, less than a decade after setting it up. Having launched the agency to “try to advance the governance cause” he later saw “the limitation that all we could do was give advice on questions other people raise”, and wanted to do more.His most recent governance venture, GMI Ratings, set up in 2010 and specialising in environmental, social and governance research and ratings and the accounting-related risks of public companies, goes further, providing investors with analysis on what Mr Monks describes as “the character of companies”.Large institutions managing money mostly through index funds, in particular, need detailed information on the quality of management and how a company tackles ESG issues, he maintains.Another governance concern is the lack of women on company boards, particularly in the US. He argues a board that fails to have a roughly comparable number of men and women sitting around the table is not serious about its activities, and that this reflects negatively on the board.“In the US, the board is appointed by the chief executive and the shareholders can’t nominate or remove them,” he says. In the UK shareholders have more power and care more about the gender composition of boards, he argues.Although reluctant to support quotas, he believes they have worked in some countries such as Norway and could help jump start greater board diversity elsewhere.At GMI he has set up a talent pool of senior women managers, qualified to take a place on boards. The recruitment register is accessible to companies and headhunters in their board searches.With about 400 women on the books, he believes the register will at least stop companies saying “we can’t find qualified people” and would be a viable exportable model for other countries.……………………………………………………………..GMI RatingsEstablished

532;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-18T01:00:30Z;The rise of emerging markets ETFs;;"The popularity of exchange traded funds seems to know no bounds. ETFs, or open-ended investment funds that trade on stock exchanges like stocks, have emerged from nowhere in recent years to control over $1.7tn in assets under management.While most ETFs track the return of an equity index such as the FTSE 100 or the S&P 500, their ease of use and low fees have also make them the big new story in emerging markets investment.Consider this: of the $60.2bn that have gone into emerging markets funds for the year to October 10, 35 per cent (or $21.36bn) have gone into ETFs, according to EPFR.The funds’ presence is most pronounced in equities where 82.6 per cent of inflows into EM equity funds so far this year have been done via ETFs. (By contrast, they account for 13 per cent of the total inflows into EM bond funds).“We have seen a significant amount of inflows into emerging markets being done via ETFs in the past couple of years,” Jim Ross, global head of State Street’s ETF business, told beyondbrics. “The trend among investors is to diversify their holdings away from the US and western Europe. But how to do it is a trickier question.”“In the US, we can all go out and buy stocks on the stock market.” said Ross. “But it’s much harder for US investors to go out and buy stocks in emerging countries like China or Brazil or Sri Lanka.”Indeed, before ETFs came along, ordinary individuals could get exposure to emerging market by going to a mutual fund manager, who charged a hefty fee. But in the current low-growth and low-yield environment, investors are increasingly taking a hard look at the costs and benefits of using active managers compared to passive investment instrument like ETFs.“ETFs are very good instruments for emerging markets because even for asset managers, buying the actual securities of countries like Malaysia or China can be a very time consuming and complicated affair,” said Daniel Gamba, head of the America iShares institutional business at BlackRock. “You have to set up a custodian account, work with local broker-dealers and really do your homework on the stocks.”“ETFs give people a cheaper option to accessing emerging markets, particularly the smaller and more illiquid markets,” Gamba continued. “They could buy just one stock, listed on a major exchange, that would track the entire market and be relatively easy to buy and sell.”Given the advantages, it is no wonder that they have surged in popularity. There are now over 700 EM-dedicated ETF – more than twice the number just 3 years ago, according to ETFGI, a consultancy. Together, they attracted in the first nine months of this year 9.4 per cent of total ETF inflows ($130.7bn).In other words, almost 1 in every 10 dollars flowing into ETFs in 2012 has gone into emerging markets funds. Four of the ten most heavily-traded ETFs by volume are emerging markets, according to ETFdb, a data provider. Broad index trackers such as the $57.4bn Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the $37bn iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index are the most popular (they are the third and fourth largest US ETFs by assets), followed by country specific ETFs like iShares’ MSCI Brazil Index Fund and its FTSE China 25 Index Fund.But like so many financial innovations before it, ETFs are not without their risks.One concern is with liquidity. In theory, investors should be able to buy and sell shares of the ETF with relative ease because they are listed on the stock exchange. But the reality is that the success of an ETF is dependent on the the popularity and liquidity of the underlying asset that is being traded.In simple terms: the more traded the fund, the more likely you will be able to buy and sell your shares without incurring huge trading costs.This is unlikely to be a problem for those trading in large established EM ETFs like the Vanguard and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which respectively have average daily trading volumeS of 19.3m and 42.7m shares.But it could be an issue for those who choose to dabble in more niche ETFs like Guggenheim’s Yuan Bond ETF, which has an average daily trading volume of just 787 shares.As this WSJ piece succintly explains:A lack of liquidity can lead to wide “bid-ask spreads,” or the gap between the price buyers are willing to pay for shares of an ETF and the price sellers are asking. The wider the spread, the bigger the bite taken out of investors’ returns every time they buy or sell.So just as quickly as they are created, smaller EM ETFs can also quickly fold, as the liquidation of The IQ South Korea Small-Cap ETF earlier this summer showed. Here is an ETF Deathwatch list for those interested.Other concerns relate to the growing sophistication of the funds themselves. While “plain vanilla” ETFs continue to make up the bulk of EM ETFs, a new breed of more exotic funds – such as leveraged EM ETFs, which offer a geared return on a given index; inverse EM ETFs, which aim to go down when a benchmark goes up; leveraged inverse ETFs; and synthetic ETFs, which delivers the return on the benchmark index it seeks to track through total return swaps with a third party – are on the rise.So as with all investment products, caveat emptor. But the cost advantages of ETFs are here to stay. And as emerging markets grow bigger and more liquid, some of the challenges involved in entering and exiting EM investments will diminish.Related reading:

533;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-17T17:23:16Z;Fink says ETF price war a ‘myth’;Even though BlackRock plans a new low cost range;Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, dismissed talk of a price war among exchange traded fund providers as the world’s largest fund manager announced third quarter results on Wednesday.“There is no price war. We have to move on from this myth about a price war,” said Mr Fink.Earlier this week, BlackRock announced that it was creating a new range of 10 low cost ETFs, the iShares Core Series, aimed specifically at buy-and-hold investors by cutting fees on six existing ETFs and launching four new products.BlackRock’s initiative on fees reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the US ETF industry.Vanguard, the third largest US ETF manager which has traditionally been regarded as the lowest cost provider, has been able to use fee cuts to boost its market share.But Charles Schwab, the seventh biggest US ETF manager, set a new industry low for ETF charges after it announced reductions in fees last month that undercut both Vanguard and BlackRock’s iShares.However, Mr Fink played down expectations that BlackRock might decide to reduce fees elsewhere in the iShares ETF range while acknowledging that it was likely that other providers would likely strive to reduce their charges further.“There will always be more and more competitive pressure [in the ETF industry],” said Mr Fink.BlackRock has said the fee cuts will result in a hit of around $35m to $40m to iShares revenues but Mr Fink said he expected to see that offset by increased investor inflows.The question and answer session with analysts following the results presentation was entirely taken up by questions about BlackRock’s ETF strategy and its new advertising campaign to promote iShares.Refusing to be drawn on just how much BlackRock will spend on the US advertising campaign which is spread across television, the internet and in print, Mr Fink promised a “multi-year campaign to revitalise the iShares brand”.He said iShares distribution partners had repeatedly emphasised the need to raise awareness of the iShares brand among investors and financial advisers.Mr Fink was asked to explain why iShares had launched a new emerging markets ETF, known as IEMG, rather than reduce the charges on EEM, its largest emerging markets ETF. EEM has been overtaken in terms of assets by a directly competing product from Vanguard, known as VWO.He said that institutional investors, the main users of EEM, considered not only at management fees but also at other costs such as bid-ask spreads and tracking error.Trading liquidity for EEM was 2.5 times as large as VWO, its nearest competitor, said Mr Fink adding that many institutional investors wanted to remain benchmarked to the MSCI emerging markets index. Vanguard recently dropped MSCI as the benchmark for VWO in favour of the FTSE emerging index to save money.He acknowledged that there was a possibility that assets would shift from EEM which charges 67bp into IEMG which charges 18bp but said that he did not expect to see significant migration between the two products.Mr Fink noted that one client had withdrawn a $74.2bn indexed fixed income portfolio which went to a competitor that was prepared to do the business “at cost”.However, Mr Fink said that BlackRock would not “chase business simply to bolster assets under management, as some of our competitors are certainly doing”.
534;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-17T15:20:18Z;FTSE indices face revamp of businesses;;The London Stock Exchange is reshaping its information business as it faces an increasingly fierce battle to provide the indices investors use for trading.The bourse on Wednesday said Mark Makepeace would become group director of information services and incorporate it with his role as chief executive of FTSE, the subsidiary which compiles global indices. He will report directly to Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the LSE, and join the group’s executive committee.His predecessor, David Lester, has been named group director of corporate strategy.Mr Makepeace’s promotion comes as leading index providers such as MSCI, S&P and FTSE face upheaval of their business models. Most have enjoyed years of steadily rising profits from licensing based on growing interest in passive investment strategies and the rapid expansion of the exchange traded fund industry, one of their key revenue streams.However the decision by Vanguard, the US fund manager, earlier this month to ditch many of MSCI’s indices as the benchmarks for its largest index funds in favour of cheaper replacements threatens to start a revolution among index providers and passive fund managers. FTSE won some of the business and MSCI’s share price dropped 30 per cent when the news broke.Information services accounts for nearly a third of total revenues at the LSE. Last December it bought the 50 per cent of FTSE that it did not already own for £450m from Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. FTSE has had a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 per cent for the past five years.Mr Makepeace said the FTSE deal had enabled the LSE to combine its analytics from information services with FTSE data.Mr Lester, who has been at the LSE for more than a decade, will remain chairman of Turquoise, the pan-European trading platform, FTSE and Proquote, the retail quoting business.
535;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-17T11:03:16Z;Qatar opens up to foreign investment;;Industries Qatar’s decision last month to increase the amount of shares foreigners can buy in it is raising speculation that more Doha-listed companies will follow the lead of the petrochemicals maker.The company raised its foreign ownership limit in September to 12.25 per cent from 7.5 per cent, it said in a statement on Sunday, as it released its earnings results. The shares rallied strongly the following day and were the most traded on the Doha stock market.“This will lead to more companies opening up,” says Tariq Qaqish, deputy head of asset management at Al Mal Capital in Dubai. “I’m sure this had the blessing of the government.”Imposing limits on foreign ownership of shares has been the main reason why Qatar has failed to enter the MSCI emerging market index on several occasions, most recently in June. Membership of the index would place Qatar on the radar for more international funds and improve Doha’s branding as a regional financial centre.Across the Gulf, listed companies only offer a fraction of their business for international investors to trade. The rules vary from the most restrictive, Saudi Arabia, where foreigners cannot buy stocks directly, to the United Arab Emirates where foreigners can buy up to 49 per cent of companies.Most Qatari companies limit foreign ownership to a quarter of the company, though they can boost that if shareholders agree. Qatar Petroleum, the state-owned energy company, increased the free float of shares by moving 104.5m of Qatar Industries’ shares to the General Retirement and Social Insurance Authority.However, while there remains some interest from foreign investors, in particular in names such as Qatar National Bank and Qatar Electricity and Water, there is less excitement towards Qatar compared with a year ago, traders say. This year, the market has lagged behind its Gulf peers, largely on account of foreign selling, they say.“The interest is less due to some improvements on the regional political scene and the fact that the World Cup has not yet started to impact the economy,” says Sebastien Henin, portfolio manager at The National Investor in Abu Dhabi.Qatar has repeatedly failed to get a promotion to emerging markets from frontier markets status, as a result of what MSCI deems as very low foreign ownership levels. The next reclassification decision is due to be announced in November.If more companies follow Industries Qatar’s lead, “it will remove the hurdle for the MSCI upgrade to emerging markets. This is the only excuse now for MSCI,” says Mr Qaqish.Though the short-term story may not be so compelling, some investors are keen to invest in Qatar over the longer term, to take advantage of future growth plans tied to the vast spending around the 2022 World Cup.“Qatar’s growth outlook is set to materially brighten over the next couple of years likely forcing investors to revisit the investment case,” says Akber Khan, director of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha.But opening up the market may not be so simple. As Mr Henin puts it: “The stock exchange is considered as a way to redistribute wealth. The perception of having foreigners too present could be sensitive.”
536;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Index providers face rockier road;Vanguard defection adds pricing pressure to whole industry;Vanguard’s decision to ditch MSCI’s indices as the benchmarks for its largest index funds in favour of cheaper replacements threatens to start a revolution among index providers and passive fund managers.Analysts were shocked by Vanguard’s defection as a switch on this scale involving funds with assets of $537bn is unprecedented.“This is the first major instance of a manager switching the underlying index provider,” says Jennifer Huang, an analyst at UBS.Leading index providers such as MSCI, S&P and FTSE have been enjoying rising profits from index licensing fees based on growing interest in passive investment strategies and the rapid expansion of the exchange traded fund industry, one of their key revenue streams.But Vanguard has called time on that cosy arrangement with the $2tn US mutual fund group making it clear that it was switching index providers to save money that could in time be passed back to its investors.Analysts said Vanguard’s switch could have important implications for the future profitability of index providers.Suzanne Stein, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said other passive fund managers would now re-examine their relationships with index providers.“Vanguard’s defection leads us to be concerned that others will use it as leverage in pricing negotiations and it could potentially also lead to further defections,” said Ms Stein who cut her 2013 earnings forecast for MSCI by 23 per cent, citing concerns about further pricing pressure.Bill Warmington, an analyst with Raymond James, said it was possible the ETF industry was now entering a new era of using cheaper generic indices in which the brand of the fund trumped the brand of the index.“This is the beginning of a change for the indexing industry that could become more pervasive, particularly for conventional market-cap weighted indices,” said Sebastian Ceria, chief executive of Axioma, the risk management and optimisation company.Mr Ceria argued that Vanguard realised that most investors that use indices are concerned about asset allocation questions and getting directional calls right so they are not focused on the nuances of the methodology that an index provider uses.“The brand of the underlying index doesn’t make that much of a difference to most end investors but the cost of the fund does have an impact on their thinking,” said Mr Ceria.Index providers have always been reluctant to reveal any details of their fees, citing commercial confidentiality.Examination of MSCI’s figures suggests Vanguard was paying an average of only 1.8 basis points for its MSCI ETF licences, well below the floor of what index providers were thought to charge. The published average for MSCI ETF licences is just over 3bp.Its decision to ditch MSCI shows that even 1.8bp was too much for Vanguard, which has grumbled about index licence fees in the past.So from January, six Vanguard funds with $170bn of assets will move to FTSE indices.A further 16 Vanguard funds with $367bn under management will use new benchmarks developed by the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices, a previously little known player in the world of indexing.The switch includes 13 ETFs with assets of $123bn that are sub-classes of Vanguard index funds.MSCI admitted that losing Vanguard’s business would reduce revenues and operating profits for 2013 by around $24m. This would knock around 6 per cent from next year’s forecast earnings as the revenue loss flows directly to the bottom line.Investors’ judgment was far more harsh. On October 2 when Vanguard announced its plans, more than $1bn was wiped off the value of MSCI’s stock as its share price dropped 26.8 per cent, a record one-day fall.MSCI’s shares have failed to recover those losses, trading at $26.30 on Tuesday down 26.6 per cent since Vanguard’s announcement, amid fears that other passive managers might walk away or demand fee cuts.Attention has inevitably turned to MSCI’s most important customer, BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager.“The loss of the Vanguard ETF business could be followed by price cuts by MSCI to retain BlackRock’s ETF business,” says Mr Warmington.Although BlackRock’s immediate response was to say it planned to deepen its partnership with MSCI, describing its indices as the “gold standard”, it has also promised to cut fees on some iShares US ETFs before the end of the year to counter competition from Vanguard.As BlackRock paid MSCI around $72m in index fees in 2011, any index licence fee price cuts would be useful to BlackRock in the price war being fought by US ETF providers.Its negotiating position with MSCI now appears greatly strengthened.“Index pricing has to come down but the question is by how much. A lot of that is up to BlackRock,” says David Togut, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Mr Togut says ETF assets were previously assumed to be “sticky” for index providers, but in a conference call with analysts MSCI revealed that its licensing contracts are non-exclusive, so iShares or another ETF provider could walk away at any time.Ms Huang at UBS says she will monitor inflows into the rival emerging market ETFs run by Vanguard and iShares ahead of the January benchmark switch to determine the value that investors place on the underlying index.Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, says investors will always want branded indices associated with reputable providers.“Licence fees are a small part of the equation,” says Mr Matturri, adding that any savings in licence fees for the fund provider would be more than offset by transaction charges for rebalancing a fund’s holdings, with these being carried by investors.Mr Matturri says investors will ask if they are getting the same product from Vanguard after the index switch, as the FTSE and MSCI emerging markets benchmarks are different.“Retail investors may not understand the difference but institutional investors choose products that match either a defined benchmark or meet product liquidity requirements,” says Mr Matturri.
537;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-07T03:36:57Z;‘Regulators are wrong’ over proxy advisers;Prominent activist says move against proxies is misguided;Regulators are going after the wrong people in cracking down on the outsourcing of shareholder voting decisions to proxy advisers, according to Bob Monks, a shareholder activist and corporate governance adviser.His comments come after the Financial Reporting Council last week rewrote the UK Stewardship Code to require investors to explain how they use proxy voting agencies. Earlier this year the European Securities and Markets Authority launched a consultation into Europe’s proxy industry.Mr Monks said companies opposed to the recent wave of shareholder activism, often co-ordinated through proxy groups, were driving opinion, particularly in the US, where business roundtables and chambers of commerce want to keep control over issues such as executive pay.Trustees hire proxy advisory groups to advise them how to vote and somehow this is being seen as “the proxy advisory company has too much power”, said Mr Monks, founder of ISS, now part of MSCI and the biggest proxy voting agency.He described those “wanting to use the power of government to say that someone who advises trustees has got too much power” as “grotesque”.
538;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-04T01:30:27Z;Vanguard’s index switch to hit S Korea;;"It’s all in the detail. US fund manager Vanguard’s decision to switch to tracking FTSE indices for six funds worth over $120bn rather than the MSCI equivalents will have a big knock-on effect on emerging markets.The decision could see a shift of billions as the definition of what constitutes an emerging market differs between the two groups. South Korea may be one of the biggest losers.According to a JPMorgan note, “South Korea will be impacted the most: net outflow is estimated at approximately $10bn”, as South Korea is classified as a developed market in the *FTSE world, but an emerging market by the MSCI. South Korea has a weighting of around 15 per cent in the MSCI EM index.And it’s not just South Korea that will likely lose out. China could see over $350m net outflows as well – because it has a lower allocation in the FTSE EM index than in the MSCI version.There are winners though as the Korea- and China- bound funds are spread around other countries. Brazil, South Africa and India would see the biggest inflows, for a combined total of around $5bn, while Russia would attract over $400m according to JPMorgan estimates. Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand may also see slight increases.Other countries that will see a benefit by having a greater weighting in the EM FTSE universe are the UAE and Egypt.The biggest loser of all is MSCI, which saw its shares fall 27 per cent on Tuesday, through the loss of business. On Wednesday, they recovered nearly 5 per cent, but that still leaves them around 22 per cent down.* FTSE indices are not part of the FT GroupRelated reading:

The group’s assets are split roughly 60/40 between passive and actively managed funds.MSCI said it was “disappointed” by Vanguard’s decision to switch and estimated it would lose $24m in annualised revenues and operating income as a result.MSCI’s share price suffered its largest one day drop on record in response to the announcement, falling 27 per cent to $26.21 on Tuesday.Among the funds switching benchmark indices are the world’s first passive index mutual fund created by John Bogle, Vanguard’s founder, in 1976 and the world’s biggest emerging market ETF.The $197.3bn Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund will switch from the MSCI US broad market index to the CRSP US total market index, while the $67.1bn ETF will move from the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to its FTSE equivalent.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE Group, said the agreement with Vanguard was a “big win”. He hoped other emerging market fund managers would now realise they had a choice when it came to choosing a benchmark for their funds, he said.“The agreement with Vanguard creates a great platform for growth for FTSE in the US and beyond,” said Mr Makepeace.FTSE created a dedicated team to deal with the needs of ETF providers earlier this year. It has also focused on the US market, which generates about 30 per cent of the company’s revenues but where the FTSE brand was less well known.Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard, said he expected the new licensing agreements to allow Vanguard to reduce expense ratios for its index fund and ETF investors over time.During a conference call held by MSCI, several analysts asked whether the switch by Vanguard might be followed by a similar move by iShares, the world’s largest ETF manager.However, Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, described MSCI as “the gold standard of global and international equity indexes”, and said: “We plan to deepen our partnership with MSCI to help deliver the highest quality products and portfolio construction to our clients.”
541;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-02T12:22:33Z;Guest post: if it’s all about macro these days, why haven’t EM stocks done well?;;"By Morgan Harting of AllianceBernsteinIt doesn’t seem to make sense. Superior macroeconomic fundamentals in emerging countries have not led to stronger (or even positive) equity returns over the last two years.Since the beginning of 2011, the unhedged return in US dollars of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has been down 10 per cent, while the MSCI World Index has delivered 6.5 per cent. What’s going on?The answer is simple: Even in a time when the markets are highly sensitive to news about macroeconomic developments and government policy in developed markets, investors still pay attention to earnings. And while economic growth and corporate sales and profit growth rates remain higher in emerging markets than in developed markets, the sharper economic deceleration in emerging economies has led to an even sharper deceleration in earnings.Emerging-market sales growth has generally kept pace with economic expansion, but profit margins have shrunk due to rising costs, particularly for commodities and wages. In developed economies, by contrast, sales growth has been sluggish, but companies have been better able to sustain margins. Their greater orientation to service industries and higher value-added businesses have made developed-market companies less susceptible to commodity-price pressures, while their stronger bargaining power with labour has allowed them to keep a lid on wage growth.Investors in emerging markets have still been able to profit from superior macroeconomic fundamentals – if they’ve owned bonds as well as stocks. The JP Morgan Corporate Emerging Market Bond Index (denominated in US dollars) has returned 25 per cent since the beginning of 2011. Investors have rewarded emerging-market corporate bonds’ appealing combination of lower balance sheet leverage and higher yields. Lower leverage is great for bondholders, but not necessarily ideal for shareholders.What’s ahead? Recent PMI surveys above 50 across emerging economies as diverse as Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia and Turkey point to favorable near-term momentum. But the sustainability of growth in these and other emerging countries will hinge on a recovery in global growth, in our view. There are also signs in some countries that domestic credit expansion is hitting its limit.With the consensus estimate calling for 13 per cent earnings growth in emerging markets next year and the MSCI EM trading at just 10 times 2012 earnings, investors could reasonably expect annualised returns in the low double digits over the next several years, if the consensus estimate proves accurate. To the extent that corporate debt issuance in emerging markets continues to be heavy, increased financial leverage could drive even faster earnings growth and stronger equity returns.This increased leverage, if it occurs, would not necessarily hurt emerging-market bonds. Since corporate balance-sheet leverage in emerging markets is generally reasonable, additional debt issuance needn’t undermine the creditworthiness of emerging-market corporate debt. Strong expected demand is likely to keep corporate bond yields relatively low, allowing issuers to reduce their interest expenses.With the yield on emerging-market corporate bonds currently at about 5 per cent, it’s hard to imagine returns rising much higher, but the lower expected volatility of bonds would still make the asset class an important complement to equities. A wider range of new issues also creates an opening for investors in emerging-market stocks and bonds to make opportunistic plays on individual companies’ capital structures.Morgan Harting leads the emerging markets multi-asset portfolio team at AllianceBernstein.

542;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-10-01T17:38:57Z;Passive aggression;The growing investor appetite for index-based investment strategies means ETF industry assets are on the rise;Passive investing is enjoying an unprecedented period of popularity as growing numbers of institutional and retail investors discover that exchange traded funds and other index-based products are vital tools for building robust portfolios.The rise of passive investment strategies has been fuelled by widespread disenchantment with the failed promises of active managers and the realisation that better returns can often be delivered by low-cost ETFs and index funds that match the market.A substantial body of academic evidence provides support for the view that while an active manager might manage to outperform his benchmark in equity and bond markets in any single year, the vast majority fail to deliver outperformance over a sustained period.Rising ETF industry assets are the most visible reflection of investors’ growing appetite for index-based investment strategies.Assets held in ETFs (funds and products) stood at $1.8tn at the end of August, growing by 26.5 per cent a year over the past decade, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.Further strong growth is widely expected with consensus estimates suggesting ETF assets could reach $10tn by 2020.This is supporting revenue growth for index providers such as MSCI, S&P, Barclays Capital, Russell, FTSE and Stoxx, all of which earn fees annually from licenses based on assets held in ETFs and other index-linked products.Index providers are notoriously secretive about their fees but they can generate substantial revenues from even modest charges given the scale of the assets linked to their benchmarks.MSCI estimates that around $7tn in assets is now benchmarked to its indices worldwide with ETFs accounting for $344.3bn.S&P Dow Jones Indices says over $1.5tn is directly invested in financial products based on its family of indices and it holds the leading position among ETF index providers with assets of more than $420bn spread across 600 ETFs.FTSE Group says $3tn in assets is linked to its indices including $56bn held in ETFs.Earlier this year, FTSE set up a dedicated team specifically to deal with the needs of ETF providers, underlining their importance to the business of index providers.“We want to develop long-term relationships with ETF providers that enable us to invest in research and infrastructure and in our brand,” says Jonathan Horton, president of FTSE North America.Mr Horton describes index providers as the engine of innovation for the ETF industry.“Innovation is at the heart of what we do and that is helping to drive growth in the ETF industry,” he says.Index providers usually describe these innovations as “smart beta” or “alternative beta”. These are indices designed to deliver higher absolute or risk-adjusted returns or lower volatility than conventional cap-weighted equity benchmarks.Cap-weighted equity indices have been criticised for delivering sub-optimal returns by overweighting overvalued stocks and, conversely, underweighting undervalued ones.Similar issues arise in fixed income markets where cap-weighted indices allocate more to the largest issuers of debt that may not provide the best investment opportunities for bond investors.Interest in alternative beta indices has been fuelled by the global financial crisis of 2007-08 that prompted many investors to become more focused on controlling risks than simply maximising their returns.Among the best known alternatives to cap weighting are the fundamentally weighted indices developed by Robert Arnott’s company Research Affiliates in 2005. These indices, known as RAFI, rank their constituents by book value, dividends, sales, and cash flow instead of market value. The RAFI methodology can be applied to both equities and fixed income markets. Fundamentally weighted indices based on the Research Affiliates methodology are now offered by FTSE Group and Russell (for equities), Citi (sovereign bonds) and Ryan ALM (US corporate bonds).The simplest of the alternative approaches is the equally weighted portfolio. In an award-winning paper published earlier this year, academics from the University of Frankfurt and the Edhec Business School in France showed that random combinations of equally weighted stocks from the US market outperformed both the the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices.Credit Suisse recently used constituents of the MSCI Europe index to compare a range of alternative beta portfolios (equally weighted, minimum variance, equal risk contribution and maximum diversification). It found that all of the alternative beta portfolios delivered higher returns and higher Sharpe ratios (a measure of risk-adjusted performance) than the conventional cap-weighted MSCI Europe index between December 1999 and July 2012.Edhec-Risk Institute, a division of Edhec business school, carried out a similar analysis of four alternative indices (equally weighted, minimum volatility, risk efficient and fundamentally weighted RAFI) tracking the US market.While all four outperformed the cap-weighted S&P 500 index over the past nine years, each alternative index behaved well only in certain market conditions. Edhec concluded that no single model could “pretend to be uniquely superior” as alternative-weighted indices delivered different results depending on conditions.ETF providers have been enthusiastic adopters of alternative beta indices, allowing investors easy access to these strategies.In the US, Powershares runs a range of fundamentally based ETFs linked to FTSE RAFI indices as well as low-volatility ETFs while Guggenheim runs equally weighted ETFs as part of its range. In Europe, Ossiam offer several minimum variance and equally weighted ETFs.Low-volatility ETFs have proved a particular hit with investors, gathering more than $4bn in assets since the first was launched in 2011 with Powershares, iShares, Direxion and QuantShares now offering competing products.
543;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-09-27T23:02:24Z;FRC curbs advisory groups’ voting role;;UK regulators are cracking down on the outsourcing of shareholder voting decisions to advisory groups amid fears that they have too much influence on issues such as executive pay.The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which oversees corporate governance, has announced changes to the UK Stewardship Code that will make investors explain more clearly how they use these groups, which some say are in effect proxy voting agencies.The new requirements, which come into effect on Monday, follow worries that the use of advisory groups, such as the US-owned ISS, is preventing shareholders from engaging with companies themselves.Martin Sorrell, chief executive of global advertising group WPP, was one of the biggest critics of these bodies after ISS recommended that shareholders vote against his 60 per cent pay rise at the company’s annual meeting in June.Other company heads have expressed concerns that ISS – which advises an estimated 25 per cent of shareholders in FTSE-listed groups – and similar bodies such as Pirc and Manifest are unregulated and unaccountable.One senior executive said: “An investor who has shares or owns part of a company is making a decision in the best interests of the corporate, as they have money riding on their decision.”ISS, owned by international financial information group MSCI, insists it is a force for good and says it helps to improve shareholder decision-making by carrying out research that many investors do not have time to do.It points out that its recommendations – on director appointments, rights issues and remuneration – are made on the basis of the principles of good corporate governance and investors are not compelled to follow them.But the FRC said investors must explain more clearly how they manage conflicts of interest, the circumstances in which they will take part in collective engagement and the use they make of proxy voting agencies.FRC head Stephen Haddrill said: “Investors may choose to outsource some of the activities associated with stewardship, but they cannot delegate their responsibility.”
544;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-09-14T16:10:29Z;QE3 to boost riskier assets;;This week’s announcement of another round of quantitative easing (QE) in the US is likely to lead to gains for riskier assets in the weeks ahead while pushing the value of the US dollar downwards.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Thursday that the central bank would spend $40bn each month buying mortgage bonds until such time as US employment data improve, and continue with the policy of exchanging short-dated US government bonds for longer maturities. He also said that he expected US interest rates to remain abnormally low until 2015.If previous experience is anything to go by, this will lead to strong gains in shares, commodities, property and higher-risk bonds, for two reasons. One is that banks will take what the Fed pays them for their mortgage bonds and Treasuries, and put that money to work in riskier markets.The other is that QE, and rock-bottom interest rates, keep yields on safe assets at very low levels, forcing investors to look elsewhere for returns that beat inflation.Equities boomed during the first two instalments of QE. The MSCI World Index, which tracks developed-world equities, rose by 39 during the first bout of QE, which began in November 2008 . During the second bout, which was effectively announced in August 2010 but didn’t actually start until November 2010, it rose 24 per cent.Emerging-market equities did even better – the MSCI Emerging Markets index doubled the first time around, and rose 19 per cent the second. It’s easy to capture the performance of both indices via index-tracking funds and exchange-traded funds. Those who prefer to stay closer to home won’t miss out either - UK shares, in the form of the FTSE 100 index, also had a terrific run during US quantitative easing and there’s an even greater choice of tracking products.Within individual stock markets, there are variations in performance while QE is in progress. In the UK, mid-cap shares (as represented by the FTSE250 index) did better than either blue-chips or small caps during previous bouts of QE. Cyclical shares – automotive, miners, industrials, retailers, electronics and so on – tended to notably outperform defensives like utilities, telecoms pharmaceuticals and food retailers.A major casualty of QE is the US dollar. The Dollar Index - which tracks the currency’s performance against a basket of leading rivals – declined 7.1 and 9 per cent during the first two instalments. When the US dollar weakens, commodities customarily strengthen – and this relationship held true during previous periods of QE. The Continuous Commodity Index – an equally-weighted basket compiled by Thomson Reuters – produced a total return of 31.2 and 29.7 per cent during QE1 and QE2 respectively.Most of that came from energy, industrial and precious metals. Gold may have hogged the headlines but the standout performer was actually silver, which rose 69.4 per cent during QE1 and 88 per cent during QE2. Precious metal prices are very volatile, but easy for individual investors to track via spread bets, contracts for difference or, if leverage is considered too risky, via exchange-traded commodities.The latest instalment of QE may also help boost US property prices, which were already showing signs of recovery, because this time the Fed is buying mortgage bonds instead of Treasuries.This will help keep long-term US home loan rates down and so stimulate the housing market. However, it’s not easy for UK-based investors to gain exposure to US house prices without actually owning property.Dominic Picarda is associate editor at Investors Chronicle (www.investorschronicle.co.uk)
545;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-09-11T18:35:49Z;EM equities: it’s the fundamentals;;"As many emerging market investors have found, GDP growth doesn’t easily translate into stock market appreciation. In fact, when it comes to investment decisions, macroeconomic factors often don’t even come into it.Reyl Asset Management, based in Geneva, has an EM equity fund that is ahead of the MSCI EM index by around 40 percentage points since its July 2009 launch. Instead of worrying about the latest IMF economic outlook, the fund starts from company fundamentals and pretty much ignores macroeconomics.Fund manager Emmanuel Hauptmann explains that as a result Reyl is underweight the big four Bric economies – not because the fund doesn’t like those countries but because it ignores country allocations. Instead, the fund looks at company metrics such as cashflow and corporate governance to pick stocks.“Price to earnings might look good, but we care more about cashflow, capital expenditure and governance,” he told beyondbrics. “If there is something like an inventory build-up, that’s a red flag.” Other worries are management owning preference shares, or other conflicts of interest. “Common shareholders are often the bottom of the food chain. We are very defensive,” he adds.The result: underweight Brics.The Reyl fund is just 2.1 per cent invested in China, compared to the MSCI EM index which has a 16.6 per cent weighting. Brazil (4.3 per cent, MSCI 13.2 per cent) and Russia (0.5 per cent to the MSCI’s 6.1 per cent) are a similar story. South Korea also comes out from Reyl’s strategy very underweight, at 5.3 per cent to the benchmark 15.4 per cent.The countries that come out well ahead of the MSCI on allocation are Thailand, Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa. Reyl also cheats the EM definition a bit, including Australia and Singapore due to their correlation with EMs. As a result, out of the top 15 invested stocks, four are in Thailand – top is Advanced Info, a telecoms company.The industry split is also revealing, with Reyl much more heavily invested in healthcare (6.9 per cent to the MSCI’s 1.3 per cent) and industrials (14.3 per cent to 6.7 per cent), and underweight materials (5.6 per cent to the MSCI’s 11.7 per cent) and energy (0.9 per cent to 12.9 per cent).Hauptmann explains that Reyl also looks at growth, tries to pick emerging trends, monitors analyst sentiment and looks for dividends. “But we are not contrarian investors. We reduce risk though our allocation.” The fund has up to 500 stocks, and monitors liquidity closely. As a result, it has a high turnover but low volatility.The main EM equity fund has $434m in assets under management, and there is a long-short fund with around $100m. “We could go up to over $1bn,” says Hauptmann. “There are very few bottom-up investors in the market.”Related reading:

547;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-09-07T17:45:26Z;Early days but cautious optimism on ESG;Debate over suitability of ETFs for ESG investors;Interest in investing that takes account of environmental, social and governance issues has grown in recent years, but can exchange traded funds, which by definition do not pick and choose between stocks, be of use to the ESG investor?The answer lies with the increasing trend for ETFs that follow specialist or customised benchmarks, allied with the development of ESG indices, usually mainstream indices subjected to an ESG filter. Indices such as the MSCI ESG family and the FTSE4Good index, as well as a host of sector-specific indices covering areas such as clean technology or sustainable water, are suitable for inclusion in an ESG portfolio.As with all investment that includes extra-financial factors in its analysis, it is important to distinguish precisely what is being included or excluded. The terminology is still confusing and the precise meaning of each term is not fixed, so investors need to check in each case what the methodology of the underlying index is.For Thomas Kuh, head of ESG indices at MSCI, the key distinction is between socially responsible investment (SRI) and ESG. For him, the former includes values-based screens, likely to exclude tobacco and arms companies, as well as others that are not aligned with the specific investor’s ethical values, while the latter simply integrates analysis of environmental, social and governance issues into traditional financial analysis without necessarily imposing a negative filter.However it is defined, the concept is gaining ground. According to Mr Kuh, MSCI’s own research has shown that company share prices are more sensitive to ESG-related events since the financial crisis in 2008 than they were previously.“One of the signifiers of acceptance of ESG is that it is applied to a broader range of asset classes and is available to investors through a broader range of products,” he says. Although there is a swiftly growing class of ESG ETFs, he cautions “these are early days” for such products. “The success of these kinds of products is going to depend on the appetite of investors in these products.”Having delivered this note of caution, he adds that MSCI is “optimistic about that”, as befits the head of ESG indices at the index provider.Although there may be an appetite for responsible ETFs, investors may wish to consider whether this is the most appropriate vehicle for them, as responsible investment by its nature tends to be long term, whereas one of the distinguishing characteristics of ETFs is that they are easy to trade into and out of. This leads many investors to use them as short-term investment tools instead of buying and holding, as would be consistent with a more ESG-conscious approach.While there are ETFs that cater to ESG investors, there are also ETFs, or at least exchange traded products, that many ESG investors would exclude automatically. In the case of ETPs tracking soft commodity indices, there is a campaign being waged by charities to deter financial institutions from participating in the futures markets and hence offering the products themselves.The campaign against “betting on hunger” is based on the belief that the recent massively increased speculative interest in futures markets has forced prices higher and made them more volatile, hurting both food producers and consumers in developing countries.At least five European banks have withdrawn funds linked to food commodities in response to pressure, while Deutsche Bank has said it will not issue new ETFs linked to agricultural commodities. Deutsche already has around $1bn in such products. Commerzbank has removed agricultural products from its ComStage commodity ETFs as well as similarly halting further food-related launches.Although the campaign against financial institutions profiting from food speculation has built up significant public support, creating a large reputational risk for banks that do not wish to be associated with pictures of starving children, the jury is out on how much such investment actually influences spot prices, the actual price paid for the food rather than the futures contracts.Since there are other factors pushing prices up, including increasing demand from a globally growing population with, in many cases, rising standards of living, and a severe drought hitting the US corn crop, separating out the impact of speculative interest on prices is difficult. There is little evidence it pushes prices higher systematically, although there is some consensus it may contribute to price volatility.According to the 2011 Agricultural Outlook from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, “most researchers agree that high levels of speculative activity in futures markets may amplify price movements in the short term, although there is no conclusive evidence of longer term systemic effects on volatility”.
548;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-08-26T18:12:04Z;Obama should pray that China overtakes US;;"Fellow Financial Times columnist Niall Ferguson has received some fierce criticism for a piece he wrote in Newsweek, under the provocative headline: “Hit the road, Barack”.Among various complaints, critics cried foul over a graph showing that the International Monetary Fund predicts that, on current trends, China will overtake the US to have the world’s largest economy in 2017.They have a point. Nobody disputes this claim (in a chart headed “A nation losing ground”). But this event would be no indictment of US economic policy under President Obama, or his predecessors. China has four times the population of the US; parity would mean that Americans were still on average four times richer.Indeed, US business and the US economy desperately need China to keep growing. Mr Obama need not be embarrassed when China’s economy overtakes that of the US; but he should lose a lot of sleep over any suggestion that China might fail to do so.On that basis, China should be causing sleepless nights in the White House. The latest flash estimates for China’s purchasing manager data, designed so that 50 should be the dividing line between expansion and recession, are now at a nine-month low of 47.8.Western analysts are notoriously nervous of official Chinese data. However, commodity prices are something of a truth teller. Iron ore prices, driven almost exclusively by Chinese demand, have fallen by a third since April. Copper prices are also mired in decline.Stock markets, too, are raising red flags. China’s domestic stock market is the most eye-catching. The Shanghai Composite index this week dropped to a low last seen in March 2009 – the month the developed world’s stock markets started their great recovery. It is down 66 per cent from its 2007 peak, and has underperformed the S&P 500 by 32 per cent since the beginning of last year.True, Shanghai stocks enjoyed a classic speculative bubble in 2007. Their collapse follows a pattern typical after such incidents. (Charts showing how similar the Shanghai bubble was to the earlier Nasdaq bubble are to be found on the FT’s Long-Short blog). In any case, stock market growth is not closely tied to economic growth, at least on a year-by-year basis.But then look at how woefully Chinese stocks open to western investors, as represented by the MSCI China index, are underperforming MSCI’s index of US stocks. Since the beginning of last year, they have underperformed by 26 per cent. But this measure is also imperfect. Big US companies are themselves heavily exposed to the Chinese economy.When western stocks are analysed by their exposure to the Chinese economy the problem becomes most apparent. Deutsche Bank’s baskets of large European stocks, divided according to their greatest international exposures, show that China-exposed companies have underperformed US-exposed stocks by 40 per cent since the end of 2010. This is chiefly driven by mining companies, who cannot counter investors’ alarm about China’s attempt to refocus growth away from investment projects and towards consumption.Miners’ share prices already appear adequately to discount the low materials prices, and indeed seem to be projecting them far into the future.Globally, materials companies have underperformed developed world stocks as a whole by 20 per cent since the beginning of last year, according to MSCI indices.Some sectors fare better. Luxury goods companies, also heavily exposed to China, have been doing fine.But this is not just an issue for miners. The grain of what executives in other industries are telling their investors suggests that they, too, are concerned about the consequences of investment decisions in China. In combination with the political risks in Europe and the US, this has led many decisions to be postponed.Goldman Sachs produces a quarterly “beige book” compiling managements’ comments during their investor briefings. One of the clearest themes of the latest edition is concern over global growth, which largely comes from China. Caterpillar, for example, said that it was lowering production there and intended to cut production further.The greatest hope of optimists among executives, at least as parsed by Goldman, is that China can rebound and execute its growth shift successfully. United Technologies, for example, rhapsodised over the possibilities for growth in demand over the next 15 years. IBM reported very strong growth in computer sales.The upshot for the US is clear. Everyone needs to be offering up a prayer that China does indeed overtake the US on schedule, three years from now. That would help Americans grow richer."
549;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Guest post: Greece could benefit from rebranding as an emerging market;;"By David EdgerlyWhen could a potential downgrade be a welcome relief? When you’re a broker or fund manager in Athens struggling with disappearing volume and complete lack of interest from major international investment institutions. When the general hubbub of a trading floor has been replaced with the quiet contemplation of fishermen interrupted by occasional shouts of joy when a real customer nibbles at the bait of depressed prices.MSCI, the company that creates investment indices, issued a press release in June saying that the MSCI Greek Index (MXGR) was under review for reclassification to Emerging Markets. MXGR is “structurally no longer in line with Developed Market size requirements,” the press release noted.That is a bit of an understatement. The current market capitalisation of the Athens Stock Exchange is approximately €24bn (about 10-12 per cent of GDP that is itself a moving target) and the free float, i.e. stock available for trading is 30 per cent. The average daily volume so far this year is €48m, although in July the trading volume declined to €24m a day. By way of comparison the market capitalisation of the Cairo Stock Exchange, very much an emerging market, is about $60bn or €48 billion. This amounts to about 30 per cent of GDP.“The proposal on the table now for consideration is to re-classify Greece into Emerging Markets,” a spokesman for MSCI said. “Depending on the reaction we receive this move could be modified to put Greece into a Stand Alone category,” he added.This would mean that Greece would no longer be part of the Developed Europe index where it has a minuscule 0.08 per cent weighting with just two stocks, Hellenic Bottling, the Coca Cola bottler, and OPAP, the gaming company the government is desperate to privatise.An index weighting this small effectively means that very few institutions would bother including Greece in its Developed Europe portfolio. Even if a Greek stock doubled or tripled it would not have much impact on any decent-sized fund if the manager remained in the narrow index guidelines.Before Athenian egos get bruised at the thought of being re-classified with the huddled masses in emerging markets they should consider the possibility that such a re-classification might breathe some life into the market.“Greece would definitely be better off out of the Developed Europe index. We are such a small fish in a huge pond that no one notices us. Better to be a larger fish in a smaller pond. Even if we come to a deal with the [EU] Troika and remain in the euro, it would take years to re-build the confidence required to interest large institutional investors,” said one Athens-based broker who said that given the sensitivity of the issue he wished to remain anonymous.This sentiment was echoed by a fund manager who said it was critical to more people into the market. “The emerging market fund managers may well have more appetite than developed market managers for the opportunities that we have now in Greece,” he said.These opportunities include an index that has fallen 89 per cent from its high point this century on January 3, 2000. As low as the index is now, it is up 30 per cent from the all time low of 476.36 reached on June 5, 2012.For those that can distinguish between sovereign debt problems and individual corporate performance there may well be opportunities beneath the rubble of the market crash. But for the moment the only people even looking at the market are a few non-index related hedge funds or private equity funds. Most are simply waiting for resolution on the currency issue. Will Greece remain in the Euro or revert to the drachma? One optimistic Greek broker said everything could change if there is a deal with the Troika.“Judging by Greece’s current situation is risky. For example, if Greece and the Troika reach an agreement we could see a big revival of interest.”Perhaps, but the first to take advantage those opportunities could well be the emerging market fund managers who are more used to unstable political and economic situations.David Edgerly is a former fund manager in Turkey and the Middle East. He writes about the region in his Levantine Musings blog.Related reading

550;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
551;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Pensions turn back to stocks for income;Pensions schemes are joining the rush for dividend stocks;Rock-bottom government bond yields are pushing some pension schemes to reverse the industry’s decades-long rush out of equities and into fixed income.The move is being prompted by a dramatic crossover in yields between major asset classes, with 85 per cent of UK FTSE 100 companies now offering higher income than the 1.5 per cent available on 10-year gilts and the S&P 500 in the US trading on a yield of 2.6 per cent, well above the 1.54 per cent yield of 10-year Treasuries.The yield of the MSCI Composite European index is now 4 per cent, comfortably above the sub-3 per cent yield of the average single-A rated eurozone corporate bond, according to Union Bancaire Privée, a Swiss private bank.“For the first time since the 1950s, equities yield more than government bonds and the comparison with corporate bonds is perhaps even more interesting,” said Scott Meech, co-head of European equities at UBP.The UK’s £1.5bn Berkshire local authority scheme has issued a tender for four equity income managers and Pete Drewienkiewicz, head of manager research at Redington, a consultancy, said his clients are starting to favour equities for income with “a couple of £30m-£50m mandates so far”.Net inflows from institutional investors into US and global dividend focus funds soared to $10.3bn in the first quarter of 2012, up from just $2.25bn in the same quarter last year, according to eVestment Alliance, a data provider.Fund managers and consultants said they were seeing a growing number of UK defined benefit schemes holding equities for income, rather than their potential capital gain, following a similar trend in the US.Louise Kooy-Henckel, managing director of global equities at JPMorgan Asset Management, said there has been “an increase in the type of mandate highlighted through [Berkshire’s] search,” in both the US and UK.“We have entered a low yield, low growth environment where generating income streams has become a challenge. For many investors, diversifying their income stream is key to delivering a sustainable yield.”Paul Trickett, head of portfolio solutions for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said he expected to see growing interest in high-dividend equities which “provide cash flow which can be modelled against the need to fund benefit payments”.A survey of 83 senior figures in the UK and European investment industry conducted by MHP Communications showed three-quarters believed pension funds should be looking to “re-risk” in the current environment.However, schemes’ ability to make large-scale switches out of gilts and investment-grade bonds is limited in the UK by the Pensions Regulator, which imposes caps on the amount of risk they can take in the recovery plans many schemes have in place to eliminate deficits. Mr Drewienkiewicz warned that relying on cash flows from equities could carry unexpected risks, particularly if dividend payouts were financed by borrowing rather than underlying earnings.Claire Ballantyne, head of bond research at Hymans Robertson, said some of her clients were still seeking to sell equities and buy fixed income, which they believed had better potential as a growth asset.
552;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-07-29T04:20:30Z;ING fund seeks results with focus on valuation;The ING Global High Dividend fund only considers yields above 2.5%;Over the past 12 months, Bruno Springael, senior portfolio manager of the €442m (£347m) ING Global High Dividend fund, has reduced exposure to economically sensitive stocks offering growth, and moved towards those with enticing valuations.Mr Springael and co-manager Herman Klein have moved away from stocks in sectors such as utilities, telecoms, healthcare and energy – traditional dividend payers – and towards securities on low valuations in sectors such as industrials and raw materials.Industrials is now the second-largest industry sector in the fund – at 14.9 per cent of the portfolio – although financials, a more dividend-oriented sector, remains the largest at 18.6 per cent, while healthcare makes up 12.7 per cent.However, the regional and country weights are capped at 15 percentage points more or less than the sector weightings in its MSCI World benchmark index. To avoid concentration in a few sectors, the overweight position of a sector relative to the MSCI World Index is capped at 10 percentage points.Utility GDF Suez, yielding 8.3 per cent, is the fund’s largest stock weighting at 1.64 per cent.The managers select stocks from companies with a market capitalisation of at least €1bn and an average of €3m in trading volume per day.Mr Springael says: “We only take into consideration stocks yielding more than 2.5 per cent.Further analysis of dividend sustainability and other fundamental factors, aided by a research team of 26 analysts, narrows the selection to 300 to 400 stocks from which the managers further trim their portfolio to 90 stocks.“Ultimately, we choose the stocks that offer a sustainable dividend yield as a result of the quality of their balance sheet and the strength of their business.“In constructing portfolios, we aim to allocate most of our risk budget to stock selection,” says Mr Springael.Mr Springael says the fund exercises strict discipline as to which prices it buys stocks, as well as when it sells them.“Each time the dividend yield of a stock drops below 2 per cent, we systematically sell our full position in that stock.“This stop-loss ensures we take profit on high performers and reinvest the proceeds in other undervalued names,” he says.The current managers took over the fund in 2011 when Moudy El Khodr and Kris Hermie left the company.Since January 2011 the fund has lost 0.95 per cent, compared with the 0.33 per cent return from the MSCI World Index.The managers may need more time to prove themselves in their new roles – but with contrarian bets in less traditional sectors, they are giving themselves the chance to pull away from the pack over a longer time frame.Jenny Lowe is features editor at Investment Adviser, a Financial Times publication
553;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;KKR bucks trend in weak market;;Buyout group KKR bucked the trend of weak markets during the second quarter as the deal struck last month to merge Alliance Boots with the pharmacy chain Walgreens boosted its balance sheet.The jump in the value of KKR’s stake in the high street retailer and pharmaceuticals distributor, taken private in a roughly £12bn deal at the height of the private equity boom, pushed the value of KKR’s investment portfolio up 5.1 per cent in a period when the MSCI world index declined almost 6 per cent.The complex deal that will initially see Walgreens buy 45 per cent of Alliance Boots was largely responsible for a rise in the value of KKR’s investments, and came as the group also sold down its stake in another 2007 buyout, Dollar General.Economic net income, a measure of performance that captures such balance sheet moves and excludes certain non-cash accounting charges associated with a corporate reorganisation prior to listing, rose 73 per cent on the same period last year to $546m.Assets under management for the New York-based investment firm dropped 1 per cent to $61.5bn, as the return of capital to investors in its funds outweighed fundraising and the rise in value of its investments during the quarter.“We completed or announced transactions which are expected to return over $4bn of capital to our private equity investors, continued to grow our Asian private equity and energy and infrastructure platforms,” Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-chairmen and chief executives, said in a statement.However, the total does not include $6bn committed so far to KKR’s 11th private equity fund, $3bn raised for its next Asian fund and the $7.8bn managed by Prisma Capital Advisors, a fund of hedge funds purchased during the quarter for an undisclosed sum.KKR also announced an expansion of its capital markets activities as part of a joint venture with fellow private equity group Stone Point. Each will commit $150m to the new entity, Merchant Advisors, which will aim to provide investment banking services to medium-sized companies.Distributable earnings of $406m were almost triple that of the second quarter last year, reflecting proceeds from secondary stock offerings at Dollar General.Income from fees was $69.8m in the quarter, down from $76.1m a year ago as incentive fees paid by KFN, a listed vehicle managed by KKR, declined.KKR will distribute 13 cents to holders of shareholder units, up from 11 cents in the same period last year. Over the past year the group has distributed 70 cents, in effect a yield of 4.9 per cent. KKR’s stock rose 6.3 per cent to $15.15 in pre-market trading on Friday.
554;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-07-13T19:03:44Z;Friday the 13th: who’s scared wins;It may be superstitious nonsense but it often pays to be spooked;For shareholders who suffer from paraskevidekatriaphobia, it was a nervous end to a bad week. The 13th of the month falls on a Friday at least once every calendar year, and when it does many investors expect the worst. Who can forget when the junk bond boom went ka-boom that Friday in October, 1989 – sending the Dow down 7 per cent?Predictably enough, historical data do not support this superstitious nonsense. Of the 55 unlucky Fridays since 1980, the average return for the MSCI world index is 20 basis points, with positive days occurring 60 per cent of the time. That is not to say, however, that worried investors should come out from under their beds. Anything that keeps trading to a minimum helps boost returns via lower transaction costs. It often pays to be scared.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
555;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;World’s top investor eyes emerging markets;;Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world’s biggest institutional investor, has confirmed a shift into emerging market equities, as it seeks higher returns amid rising payouts and persistently low bond yields.On Monday the fund said it had selected six asset managers to invest an undisclosed portion of its allocation to foreign equities.The move comes almost a year after Takahiro Mitani, the fund’s president, told the Financial Times that the GPIF, with the majority of its Y108tn ($1.36tn) in assets in domestic bonds at the end of December, was eyeing its first foray into emerging market assets to cover payments in the world’s most rapidly ageing society.“Japanese domestic equities haven’t performed for the last 20 years and now it seems as if other developed markets may be becoming like Japan,” said Taro Ogai, head of the investment consulting group at Towers Watson in Tokyo. “In order to enhance returns, they have to look elsewhere.”The GPIF’s move mirrors efforts by companies in Japan, the world’s biggest creditor nation, to increase exposures to higher-growth markets. In the largest external deal this year, for example, trading house Marubeni Corp has committed to spending $3.6bn on Gavilon, the US grains trader with a strong position in China.The GPIF’s investment is expected to begin cautiously, at about Y100bn in total, according to the Nikkei newspaper.Analysts said that the GPIF may also need several quarters of above-par performance from its asset managers to increase weightings at the expense of domestic bonds, which is the only segment of the GPIF’s portfolio to have shown a positive return over the past five years.The six managers selected – including Lazard Asset Management and Invesco – have been asked to beat the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which tracks 21 countries including Brazil, China, India, Russia and Turkey.Over time, though, analysts expect the GPIF’s exposure to emerging market stocks to increase, as the need for yield intensifies.Like many Japanese pension funds, the GPIF has been struggling for years to overcome funding gaps created by falling interest rates and two decades of slumping stocks. In April it said it would draw down its reserves by a record Y8.8tn in the new fiscal year – the fourth straight year the fund will have dipped into reserves to meet payout obligations.Under a five-year investment plan announced in March 2010, the GPIF said it would allocate about two-thirds of its assets to domestic bonds, 11 per cent to Japanese stocks, 8 per cent to foreign bonds and 9 per cent to overseas equities, with the remainder in cash. During the October-December period last year, foreign equities generated the biggest investment returns for the GPIF, yielding a positive return of 8.8 per cent.“The optimal allocation to emerging-market stocks might be around 20 to 30 per cent of their foreign equity position,” said one executive at a Tokyo-based fund manager. “They will take a long time to get there.”
556;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Felda shares defy earnings doubts;;Felda Global Ventures, the Malaysian palm oil operator, on Friday defied doubts over its earnings potential as its shares continued to trade well above the offer price in this week’s initial public offering.News that the company was to be included in two widely followed market indices next month buoyed the shares, an asset manager in Kuala Lumpur said, even as the shares were marked “underperform” by Macquarie Securities.The shares closed flat on Friday at M$5.32, which is 17 per cent higher than Thursday’s offer price.Felda’s performance makes its IPO, the second-largest this year after Facebook, one of the most unusual stock market debuts of recent times.The shares have been buoyed since their listing on Bursa Malaysia on Thursday by the support of a number of cash-rich Malaysian institutions, such as pension funds.Support has also come from a mix of “cornerstone” investors that include a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, as well as buying by ethnic Malays, or “bumiputeras”, who were allocated 11.5 per cent of the shares.However, some analysts have expressed doubts over Felda’s earnings prospects, pointing to the old age of more than half the trees in palm oils estates and tough competition in the refining business.On Friday Macquarie initiated coverage of the company, the world’s third-largest producer of palm oil. Its estimates were 20-30 per below analysts’ consensus.“While we acknowledge that there could be support for the stock in the near term, especially from local funds, we believe that an unfavourable tree age profile, strong competition on downstream and unattractive valuations are key factors that will probably drag the share price lower on a 12-month basis,” Macquarie said.Sabri Ahmad, Felda chief executive, told the Financial Times that the company needed to expand into refining, partly as a defensive strategy to protect the market for its oil products and partly as a way of reducing its reliance on buyers, traders and rival companies to which Felda already sells palm oil.Mr Ahmad said the move was also necessary because Malaysian palm oil refiners were operating at a negative margin, since refiners in neighbouring Indonesia were able to buy crude palm oil more cheaply due to tax breaks. “We [Malaysia] may lose market share,” Mr Ahmad said.However, Macquarie said that “about 20 per cent of Felda’s profits in 2011 came from various downstream refining operations, where we see competition from Indonesia as well as reversal of abnormally high margins in 2011 (especially for palm kernel) as the key risks to profits going forward.”FTSE International plans to add Felda to its FTSE All-World Index and FTSE All-Emerging Index on July 5, while MSCI said it would add the stock to its MSCI Global Standard Large cap indices on July 12.
557;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-06-29T10:32:40Z;EU Summit: cheer may be short-lived;;"Investors in emerging markets have joined in the general celebrations marking the better-than-expected outcome of the European Union summit in Brussels.Equities, bonds and currencies rallied on Friday, not least in commodity-exporting countries, which could benefit from a recovery in commodity prices.But the experience of previous summits shows that such joy is usually short-lived. Eurozone leaders haven’t escaped from the financial swamp yet, they have merely surfaced successfully for a large gulp of air.As news of the deal broke around 03:45BST, risk assets rallied rapidly, spurred by a sharp 1.3 per cent rise in the euro against the US dollar.Emerging-market equities posted their biggest daily gain in five months after EU leaders agreed to relax support conditions for loans to Spanish banks and ease assistance rules for Italy.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 2 per cent. In Asia, the Hang Seng index closed up 2.2 per cent and Seoul’s Kospi, 1.9 per cent. Mumbai’s Sensex traded 2.3 per cent higher, buoyed by hopes of a restart to India’s stalled economic reforms.Asian currencies mostly rose against the dollar, with the Korean won climbing 1.1 per cent, the Malaysian ringgit 0.7 per cent and the Indian rupee, 1.3 per cent.In central and eastern Europe, where markets have been battered because of their proximity to the eurozone and its woes, the MSCI CEE index rose 2.4 per cent, with Budapest up 1.7 per cent, Warsaw up 0.8 per cent and Russia (RTS index) up 2.5 per cent.Russian stocks were driven up by a recovery in commodities, including oil, which rose 2 per cent to $93.21 a barrel for Brent crude.The rouble gained 0.35 per cent against the US dollar to Rbs33.015 and the Polish zloty gained 0.6 per cent against the euro to 4.26 zlotys.The European Union accounts for around 30 per cent of the exports of the 21 countries in MSCI’s emerging-market index. EU-based banks have collectively been the largest cross-border lenders to emerging markets, notably in Asia, creating fears that a credit crunch in the eurozone could create financing difficulties around the world.After Friday’s rally, the dollar-denominated MSCI EM index is virtually back where it was at the start of the year - just 1 per cent up. That compares with a 2.4 per cent gain in developed-world stocks.But during the second quarter, the MSCI’s EM index has lost 11 per cent, compared to a 9 per cent drop in the MSCI world index of developed country stocks. EMs now trade at a substantial discount to developed world equities – around 10 times estimated earnings versus 12 times, according to Bloomberg data.But that doesn’t make EM equities a safe bet. The eurozone’s vulnerable members – Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy – remain, well, vulnerable. EU leaders, who traditionally take a long summer break after this pre-holiday summit, will do well to keep close to their smart phones – or make sure their secretaries do. As broker Clear Currency said in a note on Friday: “The Eurozone is far from out of the woods and we still need to see some follow through.”Citigroup said:At first glance, these agreements go somewhat further than our earlier expectations. But many other issues remain unresolved, such as whether… Italy and/or Spain will call for financial assistance in order to drive down their elevated bond yields.So the leaders in the financial swamp have dodged death for now (our photo, by the way, is of a mud football player, who is fine). But they are a long way from the safety of the shore. EM investors should bear in mind that, with all markets remaining in a volatile state, the risks of further violent swings – in both directions – are more than likely as eurozone leaders continue their struggle to reach dry land.Related reading:

560;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-06-20T21:27:45Z;"[snap]: MSCI holds fire on South Korea; Greece could be demoted to EM";;"So much for that upgrade. MSCI on Wednesday held fire on South Korea and Taiwan, deciding not to upgrade them from emerging to developed market status in its annual review of country classifications.But perhaps the bigger shocker (or not depending on your point of view) is news that Greece is being added to MSCI’s review list for potential reclassification from developed to EM status. Talk about a kick in the teeth.From the MSCI press release:The MSCI Greece Index is structurally no longer in line with Developed Markets size requirements with only two index constituents. If these two remaining index constituents were to experience further decrease in size, MSCI may be forced to discontinue the calculation of the MSCI Greece Index. The weight of the MSCI Greece Index in the MSCI World Index has decreased from 0.16% in May 2010 to 0.03% in May 2012.In addition, the Greek equity market is the only Developed Market in which in‐kind transfers and off‐exchange transactions are prohibited and stock lending as well as short selling practices are not well established. This has created significant concerns for market participants and in particular for passive portfolio managers. The Greek authorities have not been receptive to repeated complaints from the international investment community and did not manage to bring equity market regulations and practices in line with the evolving standards of Developed Markets.MSCI may launch a public consultation on a proposal to reclassify the MSCI Greece Index toStandalone Market status outside of the regular reclassification cycle if the country were tointroduce accessibility restrictions to its equity market following a potential exit of the countryfrom the European Monetary Union.Ouch.And here’s MSCI’s explanation as to why it didn’t upgrade Korea – which it admits “continues to meet most of the Developed Markets criteria”:MSCI welcomes the positive developments on the provision of stock market data following the signing of a Market Information Service Agreement between MSCI and the Korean Exchange (“KRX”). However, other significant accessibility issues highlighted in previous annual market classification reviews remain unresolved. In particular the limitations in currency convertibility, absence of an offshore currency market, lack of currency trading outside local market hours, problems with respect to equity and/or foreign exchange trade settlement timing, and issues linked to the rigidity of the ID systems that prevent in‐kind transfers and off exchange transactions remain unchanged and prevent a reclassification of the MSCI Korea Index to Developed Markets.The index provider decided also to take no action on Taiwan, which was on review for upgrade to developed status; Qatar and the UAE, both of which were on review for upgrade from frontier to emerging status.Elsewhere, Morocco has been put on review to be demoted to frontier market.More to come on beyondbrics.Related reading:

561;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-06-20T11:34:00Z;S Korea: MSCI upgrade time?;;"Is South Korea about to progress from emerging market status? It’s been on the cards for a while but Wednesday may be the day when MSCI moves the country from its EM index to the developed country list.There are still some question marks over foreign exchange and stock market data, but ifs and buts aside, what would it mean for Korea?Daewoo Securities said an estimated $14bn of foreign capital would flow into South Korea’s equity market if the country is upgraded. It expects most of the capital inflows would occur in the first half of next year. South Korea’s market capitalisation currently accounts for 15.49 per cent of the MSCI emerging market index while it would take up 2.26 per cent of the MSCI advanced market index if it gets upgraded.Kim Hyung-tae, head of Korea Capital Market Institute, said: “Stock price volatility has been reduced in all those countries upgraded to advanced markets such as Portugal, Greece and Israel. So we expect an upgrade to reduce volatility in South Korea’s stock market too.”But Lee Young-joon, analyst at Hyundai Securities, thought a MSCI ‘pop’ was unlikely. “Even if Korea gets upgraded, it will not immediately lead to rapid revaluation of Korean stocks because there is no longer a big valuation gap between advanced markets and emerging markets,” he said.Whether or not there is a surge of equity buying, there could be other effects. Im Roh-jung, analyst at Solomon Investment & Securities, pointed out: “We will see a lot of foreign capital inflows into the stock market, but it will also boost the Korean won, which could undermine the country’s exports. It may cause a headache for our policy makers.”Aspirin at the ready then.Related reading:

563;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-05-17T17:50:47Z;Russian equities: return of the bear;;"Few emerging markets have escaped the storms emanating from the eurozone. But few have been hit as hard as Russian equities.On Thursday, the rouble-denominated Micex index entered bear territory, with a 3.5 per cent fall in Moscow trading, taking the fall from its March high to over 20 per cent. The $-based RTS, which fell 4.4 per cent on Thursday, was already deep in bear land, having breached the 20 per cent level earlier in the week.Along with the general flight to safety, investors are reacting to the sharp oil price drop which the Greek crisis has prompted by hitting economic growth, notably in the EU, Russia’s biggest customer. For those who bet on a bounce on Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency, this is all very painful.These charts show the grim picture:While emerging markets, as measured by the MSCI index, have now given up all the ground gained in this year’s rally, Russian stocks have lost much more – having fallen 8.4 per cent this year in the case of the RTS. That’s nearly double the drop in Warsaw, though (crumb of comfort) only half the decline in Athens.Why is this, when the Russian economy is, on the surface, going great guns? GDP grew in the first quarter by 4.9 per cent, well above the government’s 4 per cent forecast. With consumers spending their way through the winter on the back of strong oil prices and the government stepping up pre-election spending, the economy was largely insulated from the shocks hitting the eurozone.But, a slowdown is on the way, with the authorities due to impose utility bill hikes delayed because of the election. Even before the latest Greek crisis, economists were predicting growth for 2012 of only 3-4 per cent.Far more serious is the impact of the falling oil price. With the budget balancing at $110 a barrel in 2012, the recent drop in prices below $110 has an obvious impact on the budget – even before the new administration considers how to fulfil Putin’s pre-election spending promises. With the oil industry paying about half the total taxes, it could hardly be otherwise. And the effects quickly spread to the rest of the economy – consumption, for example.As this chart demonstrates, the impact on the stock market is rapid: Russian generally stocks and crude move in tandem:But as the chart also shows, the correlation has come under strain in the past year. The anti-Putin protests have prompted general concerns about Russia’ s political stability and capacity to respond to changing economic circumstances. Those who expected a rally on Putin’s return to office were sorely disappointed, even before the market turmoil of recent weeks.Russian business people are voting with their wallets just like foreign stock market investors. As figures disclosed on Thursday showed, capital flight reached $42bn for the first four months of 2012, more than half of last year’s $80.5bn outflow, which was itself the second-biggest figure ever.Putin told Barack Obama he was too busy with his new administration to attend the Group of Eight summit in the US this weekend. Investors will be hoping that he wasn’t just making an excuse. He has a lot of work to do.Related reading:

564;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-05-15T08:44:50Z;CEE: GDP numbers shock investors;;"Another nasty European economic data surprise – this time from eastern Europe, where GDP numbers published on Tuesday showed the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania all in recession in the first quarter – and all performing far worse than expected.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the Czech economy shrank 1 per cent, the third consecutive quarterly decline, Romania’s contracted by 0.1 per cent and fell back into recession after recording growth in the previous three months, and Hungary saw GDP decline by a full 1.3 per cent.Of four countries reporting preliminary GDP figures on Tuesday, only Slovakia showed saw growth, an increase of 0.8 per cent, thanks to a new Volkswagen factory.It all demonstrates just as CEE financial markets are being battered by the eurozone crisis, so the region’s economies are also feeling the pain. While all these countries have their domestic challenges, all rely heavily on the eurozone for growth-generating exports.The MSCI east Europe index which fell around 4.7 per cent on Monday, was down nearly 1 per cent in early trading. Romanian stocks were notably weak, with a 2.6 per cent drop.After Monday’s fall, CEE currencies were mostly steady against the euro. The effects of the poor CEE GDP numbers were partly offset by good figures from Germany, showing 0.5 per cent growth.But there is no doubting the nervousness in the markets – nor, as is clear from the GDP data, the impact of that nervousness on the real economy.Related reading:
CEE: bearing the brunt of the storm, beyondbrics"
565;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-05-14T14:47:48Z;CEE: bearing the brunt of the storm;;"While emerging markets as a whole are suffering in the latest storm in the eurozone crisis, central and eastern Europe have been hit particularly hard.On Monday, the $-denominated MSCI index of central and east European equities was down a full 4.6 per cent, more than double the 1.9 per cent decline in global EMs. Stocks, bonds and currencies were all sold off in the flight to safety.With CEE economies more exposed to the Greek crisis than other EMs, investors’ reactions should not come as a surprise.If anything, the market has been rather slow in its response to the latest drama in Athens, which started with parliamentary elections at the start of last week.But with talk of a Greek withdrawal from the eurozone now increasingly public, investors are getting more nervous about other parts of Europe, including CEE.“The outlook for global emerging markets continues to be quite challenging, with the deterioration of the backdrop in Europe,” Benoit Anne, of Société Générale, wrote in a note.From the standpoint of global emerging markets (GEM), what actually matters to me is the “what next” question. We need to see some solid ring-fencing if the Greece exit risk materialises. The worrying concern, as I see it, is that so far the EU authorities’ track record in terms of containing contagion risks has been less than stellar, to say the least.TAC, a French investment research group, said in a note:Recent political events and elections in the Eurozone have clearly signaled the extent of political and social fatigue (an understatement for Greece or Spain…) in many Eurozone members. From our economic perspective, the political changes should accelerate discussions and decisions on a “growth strategy” as well as a reinforcement of the sovereign firewall, two key requisites for allowing a smoother exit from the current difficulties.However, increasing uncertainties on the more structural / long-term policy requirements and unavoidable political tensions and hesitations will continue to nurture large movements in confidence and market sentiment. Financial volatility is therefore here to stay.In CEE, first in the firing line is Romania, where Greek banks play a prominent role. The Bucharest stock exchange index was down by 4.1 per cent in late trading, the biggest decline in Europe outside Athens.Not for behind was the large Russian market, where the $-denominated RTS index was 3.6 per cent lower, dragged down by a sharp 5.0 per cent decline in metals and mining stocks.Disappointing results from Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminium company, hurt confidence. But the real culprit was a drop in commodity prices, including oil, which fell 1.5 per cent to $110.6 a barrel for Brent crude.Warsaw saw stocks decline by 2.3 per cent, Budapest by 2 per cent, and Prague by 2.1 per cent.On the currency markets, the Hungarian forint was down against the euro by 1.5 per cent at 292.9, the Polish zloty by 1 per cent at 4.35, and the Russian rouble by 0.4 per cent at 39.01.In bonds, Russia’s 2022 US dollar issue fell, pushing the yield two basis points higher to 4.218 per cent. Turkey’s 2022 dollar bond was little changed, leaving the yield at 5.172 per cent.The extra yield investors demand on EM debt over US Treasuries rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 372, according to JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Index.Related reading:

566;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-05-08T18:08:25Z;EM markets wrap: what decoupling?;;The idea was that even as both the US and Europe remained mired in debt and recession, emerging markets would continue to power ahead. That might be true for GDP growth, but not when it comes to the equities market – as Tuesday’s sell-off showed.As was the case during the 2008 global financial crisis and last summer’s market rout, emerging market equities are not immune to the sense of gloom hanging over the world economy.Markets from India to Poland and Brazil on Tuesday took a hammering in a wave of global selling as the financial markets, after several months of relative calm, showed signs of jitters once again following the elections in Greece and France over the weekend and the soft US economics data last week.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 1.1 per cent to 1001.85, its third consecutive day of losses. Although the index is up nearly 10 per cent for the year to date, it remains down some 20 per cent from its peak in 2011.“There’s a lot more worries about growth and what’s going on in Europe which is dragging down commodities, which has a big impact on emerging markets,” Greg Lesko, who manages $700m at Deltec Asset Management in New York, told Bloomberg. “It’s not an emerging market economic situation as much as concern about what’s going on outside of the emerging world.”In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 0.25 per cent after falling 2.6 per cent the day before while India’s Sensex index dropped 2.2 per cent. The picture was not much better in central and eastern Europe or in Latin America.In Poland, where exporters are particularly exposed to a slowdown in Europe, the headline Wig20 index fell 1.6 per cent while the BUX Index retreated 1.4 per cent in Hungary.Elsewhere, Mexico’s IPC index of leading issues tumbled 2.4 per cent and Brazil’s Bovespa stock exchange is down 1.8 per cent.“Flows to EM equities have virtually stopped since February, and the MSCI EM has largely underperformed the S&P 500,” said Pablo Goldberg, global head of EM research at HSBC. “We see this as a response of the combination of better expectations for the US, but disappointing growth data in the EM giants of China and Brazil.”The waning appetite for risk and yield has not just hit EM equities. LatAm currencies, after a roaring start to the year, also came under selling pressure on Tuesday with both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real down more than 1 per cent.

568;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US jobs data hits oil, EM equities;;The disappointing US payroll figures published on Friday have had an immediate impact on oil prices – with implications for both producers and consumers in emerging markets.Brent crude slumped 3 per cent, taking its three-day drop to around 6 per cent, the biggest such plunge since last summer, and few investors will want to be reminded what then happened in financial markets globally, not least EMs.At 1730 GMT, Brent crude was $15 a barrel below its 2012 high of $128.40. Oil for June delivery was trading $3.62 a barrel lower at $112.46. US crude fell by almost 5 per cent, falling by $4.85 to $97.69, plunging below $100 a barrel for the first time in nearly three months.Among EMs, lower oil prices tend to benefit big importers including China and India. They disadvantage major exporters, including Russia, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.However, the bigger-than-expected slow down in US jobs growth is bad news all around, especially for those countries, headed by China, that are big exporters to the US. That’s why EM equities joined the general sell-off in stocks. At 1730 GMT, the MSCI EM index was down 1.14 per cent, dragged down by an especially sharp drop in central and eastern Europe, where the regional MSCI index was down 3.83 per cent. In oil-dependent Russia, the RTS index was down 4 per cent.
569;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MSCI and Saudi Arabia: friends again;;"After a discreet but damaging spat over licensing that saw Saudi Arabia fall out of MSCI’s indices in 2009, the Middle East’s largest economy and the world’s most influential emerging markets index provider appear to have kissed and made up.MSCI said on Monday that it will reintroduce its Saudi Arabia Domestic Indices and related regional indices – such as the MSCI Arabian Markets – in June, a move that some hope could signal another move by Saudi Arabia to ease foreign investor access to its bourse, the largest and most liquid in the Arab world.Making no mention of the undignified scrap of yesteryear, MSCI and the Tadawul, Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, put out a joint statement on Monday celebrating the rapprochement:We are delighted that we are once again able to offer indices covering the Saudi Arabia equity market,” said Baer Pettit, Managing Director and Head of the MSCI Index business. “We believe that this announcement will be welcomed by investors both in the region, and globally. Our clients continue to demand high quality indices that accurately reflect the equity market opportunity in the region, either as benchmarks or as the basis for various financial instruments.Abdullah Suweilmy, CEO of the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) commented:We are very pleased to have MSCI as an authorized index provider at Tadawul. Investors and asset managers in Saudi Arabia and around the world can now use the services of MSCI for their view of the equity market in Saudi Arabia, and financial product providers can use MSCI as the basis for products that enable investors to participate in the performance of the Saudi stock market.Of course, this will matter little to international investors unless Saudi Arabia eases its restrictions on foreign investment. Currently, Gulf residents and Saudi nationals can invest normally, but overseas investors have to place their bets via swaps through local authorised brokers. These swaps give the investors full economic rights – ie the capital gains, or depreciations, and dividends, but no voting rights.That is fine for many hedge funds, but many long-only fund managers – the money Saudi really wants to attract, to ease the bourse’s infamous volatility – face caps on how many derivatives they can hold. Moreover, at a time when counterparty risk is a major concern of large asset managers, accessing the market via local brokers swaps, even strong entities like HSBC and Morgan Stanley, is hardly ideal.Saudi policymakers are aware of this, and people familiar with the matter have long said that the kingdom is considering introducing a “Qualified Foreign Institutional Invester” scheme similar to that of China – perhaps as early as this year.Reintroduction into MSCI’s local indices is an encouraging sign, but the game changer would be full foreign access, and subsequent promotion to MSCI’s Emerging Markets Index. That may still take time.Related reading:

570;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Frontier markets: a new (easier) index;;"Frontier markets have raised a lot of excitement among investors but they are not always easy to invest in. Many of the more exotic exchanges are not fully open to foreigners.Handily, MSCI, the index provider, on Wednesday launched a Frontier Markets 100 index – a subset of its existing MSCI Frontier Markets index, designed to be easier to trade in and track. So what’s new?The existing MSCI Frontier Markets index consists of shares in 155 companies based in 25 countries. The 100 index has – you guessed it – 100 companies based in in 21 countries and imposes two filters designed to make it easier to trade:First, many companies based in frontier markets have limits on how much of their stock can be owned by foreign investors. When any company gets close to its ownership limit, it will automatically be excluded from the 100 index.Second, any company that has less than 10 per cent of its market capitalisation traded each year will be excluded – the existing broader index has a much lower threshold. The 100 index will be reviewed in May and November each eyar and, if necessary, the number of its constituents brought back up to 100.So what kind of companies will an investor tracking the index be exposed to? If you think it’s all about mining and oil, think again.Ted Niggli, managing director of MSCI, told beyondbrics: “It’s a common misconception of frontier markets that they are all based on commodities. In fact, in these countries many commodity companies are state-owned [therefore not investable] or the resources are mined by global companies. The index has far more financials than materials.”In fact, at its inception the 100 index will consist of 57 finance companies, 18 in telecommunications, 12 energy companies, eight industrials and three materials companies. The biggest company by index weight is National Bank of Kuwait, representing 9.2 per cent. Kuwait’s Mobile Telecom makes up another 9 per cent. No other company makes up more than 5 per cent of the index.Kuwait, though, is far and away the dominant country in the index, with a weighting of 33.4 per cent. Qatar with 15.7 per cent and the UAE with 11.1 per cent come next – giving the 100 index a fairly heavy Middle East slant.The index’s raison d’être is very much investability – in terms of performance, not much will change. Indeed, if past data are anything to go by, investors shouldn’t expect the performance of the 100 index to be much different from that of its parent. The extrapolated return of the two indices from November 30, 2007 to March 28, 2012 resulted in a difference of just 0.2 percentage points: a fall of 11.8 per cent for the overall index and of 12 per cent for the 100.A reminder, if any were needed, of the risks inherent in frontier markets. Over the same period, the S&P 500 fell 5.1 per cent and the FTSE 100 fell 9.7 per cent.Baer Pettit, head of the MSCI Index business, said the company had seen “significant demand” among its clients for a more tradable version of the MSCI Frontier Markets Index. The first to use it will be BlackRock, in a forthcoming iShares exchange traded fund.Related reading:

571;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-03-14T14:06:39Z;Canada: an EM proxy, but for how long?;;"Cautious investors who want to play the emerging markets whilst avoiding some of the possible risk have long looked to Toronto.As the charts below show, the Toronto stock market index, when translated into US dollars, has in the past 10 years been moving almost in tandem with the $-denominated MSCI emerging markets index. Over five years, through the turmoil of the global crisis, the correlation has been even closer.The reason is clear – natural resources companies are dominant in both Toronto and EM stock markets. So both are driven largely by swings in commodity prices. But could this relationship break down? And if so, what would be the consequences?The chart below shows the close correlation between the Toronto market, the MSCI EM and the London Metals Exchange $-denominated metals index over the past five years:This chart shows the correlation over 10 years. It’ s still pretty close:The performance highlighted in the chart translates into the following investment returns, including, in the case of stocks, re-invested dividends:Forecasting commodity prices has in the past proved very difficult given their volatility. The bears say that slower global growth, coming out of the financial crisis, should mean slower demand growth in commodities giving more time for producers to increase supplies. The bulls say that growth in the materials-intensive economies of the emerging markets is likely to remain pretty strong by historic standards in the 2010s even if it doesn’t match the heady 2000s.Since these arguments are finely balanced, it’s a mug’s game trying to guess the future of equity markets which move in response to commodities let alone the correlations between such markets.But that’s not the end of the story. What if the Toronto and EM indices themselves become less dependent on commodity-linked stocks, through the growth of other companies – specifically consumer-oriented domestic industries? These are already mature in Canada but they are in their early stages in most emerging markets. Indeed, for many portfolio investors – and for leading multinationals – the coming emerging market consumer spending boom is one of today’s most important business stories.As Phil Langham, senior portfolio manager, emerging markets, at RBC Global Asset Management, told beyondbrics:The TSE has moved incredibly closely with the EM index… But I do think that it would be wrong to assume that this very close link is permanent and I also think that looking into the future anyone buying either commodities or a commodity-driven market as a proxy for emerging markets will be missing out on the most exciting part of the EM story, which is domestic demand.The dominant themes in the last two decades in emerging markets have been the rapid growth of the export sector and an infrastructure boom which in turn helped to drive the surge in commodity prices. Over the coming decade emerging markets will see a shift from investment and exports to a consumption boom. Rising incomes, easier access to finance, domestic growth policies and positive demographics all support this case.But it may not be so simple for some EMs to decouple their domestic economies from commodity price trends. As Andrew Howell, an EM equjity strategist at Citigroup, told beyondbrics:It is a bit odd to think of Canada as an EM proxy, but you can’t fight the charts. Whether not emerging markets will manage to see this decoupling between a downtrend in commodity exposure and an uptrend in the consumer is, of course, debatable.In most EMs, consumer sectors are still quite small [as consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks are less than 10 per cent of market cap of MSCI EM]. And in commodity-rich countries like Russia or South Africa, it is difficult to imagine a downturn in commodity prices not having a major negative impact, at least initially, on consumer spending and government finances.[But] over the long term, certainly you would want to be more positive on EM non-resources than on Canadian non-resources on the basis of the time-old concept of convergence.Stock-pickers say the Canada-EM correlation considerations apply only to investors who invest in index-based funds. Those willing to spend the time and effort to select individual companies can easily reduce their exposure to commodities in their EM portfolios, increase holdings in consumer-related companies – and boost their returns.Indeed, many have long done so. The Dow Jones index of EM consumer market companies has, has, since its inception on January 1 2006, risen by 116 per cent, more than double the 51 per cent increase in the MSCI EM index over the same period.Those who invested in a narrower basket of stocks – the EM-listed affiliates of western multinationals – have done even better, as beyondbrics has reported, citing Martijn Cremers, an associate professor at the Yale School of Management. He found that between June 1998 and June 2011 such affiliates outperformed their local markets, their own parents and the MSCI index. Almost all were consumer-related stocks.Related reading:

572;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-03-14T00:53:07Z;LatAm market wrap: rallying on Fed comments;;“Latin equities continue to benefit from the ‘sea’ of global liquidity,” Jason Press, Latin American equity strategist for Citigroup, told beyondbrics. “Without a doubt the Fed message added additional fuel to the beta rally, evidenced by the outperformance of Brazil and Metals today.”In Mexico, which counts the US as its biggest trading partner, the IPC index of leading issues rose 1.14 per cent on signs of strength in the US economy. The peso strengthened modestly against the dollar, rising 0.5 per cent to 12.5938.Brazil’s real, however, remained largely unchanged against the dollar, at 1.8008, as investors remain wary of recent government measures to curb the currency’s rise.Elsewhere, Argentina’s benchmark Merval index closed 2.37 per cent higher, Peru’s General Index edged up 0.64 per cent and Chile’s Ipsa ended flat.LatAm equities have had a strong run since the start of the year, as foreign investors, in search of better yields, flooded in for bargains following the sharp sell-off in Q3 of 2011.For the year to date, the MSCI LatAm Index is up 16 per cent, about the same as the gains made in the wider MSCI Emerging Markets Index.But is the market due for a correction in light of the multiplying signs of economic slowdown in EMs? Only last week, Brazil revealed a sharp pull back in GDP growth for 2011 while Beijing surprised the market by reducing its annual GDP growth forecast for the first time in eight years.Press from Citigroup thinks not.“Despite the impressive market rally, we still see pockets of value, including among Latin American financial stocks, homebuilders and select industrial stocks,” he said.However, Adriano Moreno, a strategist with advisory firm Futura Investimentos, thinks the stocks will struggle to go much higher.As he told Reuters:“No one is purchasing medium-or long-term positions anymore because the market had a significant rally this year and prices aren’t as attractive.What we’re seeing is a lot of portfolio turnover, with people selling off their defensive stocks like utilities in favor of ‘internal cyclicals,’ such as retail, banks, and other companies linked to domestic consumption.”While central banks can respond to the slowdown by cutting rates – and they have – the scope for further easing may be eroded by oil price increases, as the FT’s Stefan Wagstyl explained in this recent article.But tell that to the EM bulls.
573;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-03-13T09:55:14Z;Raising eyebrows in Abu Dhabi;;"Equity analysts in the United Arab Emirates are puzzling over some unusual trading patterns in the Abu Dhabi stock market this week – and over a curious response to the affair from ADX, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.Hours before an announcement that two of the emirate’s biggest real estate developers would merge into a $15bn property titan, the shares of Aldar Properties and Sorouh rose in tandem by 7.9 per cent to Dh1.22 (33 cents) each.The fact that the stock price increase came before the announcement was enough to set alarm bells ringing. However, the next day the shares of the two companies again rose in lockstep, by the same amount: 9.8 per cent, to Dh1.34.A freak coincidence? Frank Kane, columnist in The National newspaper, commented: “The chances of a comet colliding with the Earth tomorrow are probably less remote.”The incident raises the question of whether the UAE – which has been pushing for entry to the MSCI emerging market index – will take tough action on alleged misconduct by traders or adopt a light touch.Despite initial assurances to the contrary, the answer appears to be the latter.Here is a statement issued by the ADX on Tuesday:Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange denied the claims circulating in some media outlets that it plans to investigate trading in Al Dar and Sorouh shares. The unfounded rumors of an investigation allege a suspicious price movement of both companies’ shares prior to their mutual public statement of merger talks.CEO of Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange Mr. Rashed Al Baloushi said in an official statement that ADX carries out daily routine checks on all share trading activities through highly sophisticated electronic surveillance systems which can detect any instance of share-trading violations.Mr. Al Balosuhi also reiterated that the exchange does not perform any investigations unless it was highly confident that trading laws have been violated, which did not happen in the case of Al Dar and Sorouh share trading.That doesn’t exactly square with remarks by Abdullah Salem Al Naimi, manager of market operations and surveillance at the exchange, who promised an investigation, telling The National: “We were very suspicious when we saw the unusual trading movements of both stocks.”Neither the Abu Dhabi exchange nor the securities and commodities authority returned calls for comment. Aldar and Sorouh both declined to comment.As a well-timed reminder, the exchange posted a statement on March 11, “Insider trading prohibition period,” reminding investors of the rules covering trading by anyone with privileged information about a listed company in the period before regulatory filings.The announcement of the proposed merger came on the same day as Sorouh’s annual general meeting in Abu Dhabi. It is not a done deal – the plan is to study a merger of the two companies for three months and then reach a decision.The “government-blessed” proposal comes after a wide-reaching spending review in Abu Dhabi to ensure that the emirate’s petrodollars are being well spent.Aldar secured government funding of nearly $10bn after the real estate market slumped in Abu Dhabi and projects slowed. Sorouh has also struggled amid difficult market conditions. Over the past few months, however, both share prices have been on the rise.“If the information leaked, the stocks should not have traded higher anyway, because the terms and values of the asset exchange are not clear,” Yazan Abdeen, fund manager at ING Investment Management in Dubai, told beyondbrics.Investigating possible market manipulation will be crucial if the UAE is to get its upgrade to emerging markets status from MSCI. After several applications, the emirate has so far fallen short.Related reading:

574;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-03-06T08:58:03Z;China’s growth target cut hits markets;;"Chinese stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, dragging down other emerging markets, as investors digested the implications of Beijing reducing its annual GDP growth forecast for the first time in eight years.While premier Wen Jiaobao’s announcement on Monday of a 7.5 per cent 2012 target came as little surprise following multiple official signals, it seems to have prompted investors to look again at global growth prospects – and come to a distinctly cautious conclusion.The Shanghai Composite index ended down 1.4 per cent, the biggest fall in a month, following a 0.6 per cent drop on Monday. The Hang Seng was down 2.2 per cent as investors took profits in large-cap shares that led this year’s rally.With bourses also lower in South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, the MSCI emerging markets was down 1.1 per cent, following a 1.3 per cent drop on Monday.This year’s unexpected emerging market equities rally, which saw the MSCI up 19 per cent at its peak at the end of February, now seems to be fizzling out as investors take profits and consider the outlook for the rest of the year.The immediate trigger was Wen’s speech, where he confirmed the 7.5 per cent target, the first time it has dropped below 8 per cent since 2004, and repeated his pledge to rebalance the Chinese economy away from exports and towards domestic consumption.As Jamil Anderlini wrote in the FT, Wen said: “The key to solving the problems of imbalanced, uncoordinated, unsustainable development [in China] is to accelerate the transformation of the pattern of economic development. This is both a long-term task and our most pressing task at present.”Wen’s statement was followed by more evidence of economic slow down in the eurozone and a drop in US factory orders in January, the first in three months.None of these are shocking developments. Indeed, the 1 per cent fall in US factory orders was smaller than had been expected. But together they add up to a reality check. Those investors who were already looking for excuses to take profits from the 2012 equity rally – in both developed and emerging markets – found plenty.That’s not to say the economic prospects for the developing world have suddenly deteriorated. Last year, the emerging economies’ GDP grew at an average of 5.4 per cent, spearheaded by 9.2 per cent from China. For 2012, the International Monetary Fund predicts 5.9 per cent for the emerging states – which is an increase, albeit very modest.China has almost always overshot its official targets – often by a considerable margin. So Wen’s 7.5 per cent should be seen as a minimum, rather than as a maximum as is so often the case with developed-world official GDP goals.But, the EMs depend to an extent on the developed world, where the IMF forecasts growth of only 1.9 per cent, up from 1.2 per cent. And that assumes no further shocks from the eurozone.Beijing itself is cautious, and not just with the GDP target. On Monday, the People’s Bank of China set its noon peg at Rmb6.3121 to the dollar, the biggest daily weakening since October 2010. On Tuesday, is was set even weaker, at Rmb6.3141.The currency, allowed to move in a band round the official peg, is now weaker than at the start of the year. Traders said that suggested the future target rate may be moving from Rmb5.9 to the dollar to around Rmb6.1, with greater weakness allowed on the way.That’s good news for Chinese exporters – but bad news for trade partners, notably the US which has been putting pressure on China to allow the Rmb to appreciate.As the FT reported, China’s central bank chief has hinted that Beijing may soon loosen its grip on the country’s currency, saying the renminbi should be allowed to float more freely. The comments by Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s Bank of China, were his most explicit in months on the topic of exchange rate reformThe central bank could widen the daily trading perhaps to 0.7 percent or 0.75 percent from the current 0.5 percent – with perhaps further loosening coming later.That would be another move on the long road to currency liberalisation. But in the short-term it would allow the authorities to have the currency weaken (to help exporters) whilst leaving the overall range in place.If Beijing is cautious about the outlook for exports – and therefore for the world economy – investors are right to be a bit nervous about EM equities.It’s worth recalling that the rally came off a very low bottom, when confidence was shot to pieces by the eurozone crisis. Even now EM stocks aren’t expensive, trading on around 10.7 times forecast 2012 earnings, compared to a long-term average of 12.Meanwhile, with developed-world central banks pumping liqidity into the financial markets – not least in the eurozone – there’s a lot of cash around looking for returns. So, there’s plenty of scope for another rally if and when investors become a litte more certain about growth. But it’s not likely to happen just yet.Related reading

575;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-02-27T17:40:46Z;EM affiliates out-perform their multinational parents, says Yale professor;;"What’s the best way of investing in emerging markets? Local companies or multinationals with big exposure to emerging markets?How about getting the best of both worlds, says Martijn Cremers, of Yale University. Cremers shows in a study published on Monday that emerging market-listed affiliates of multinationals perform much better in the stock market than their parents. The 92 such affiliates comfortably out-perform both emerging markets and developed world markets. Take a bow, Hindustan Unilever, Walmart Mexico, and Coca-Cola Icecek (Turkey).The companies in the study, commissioned by Aberdeen Asset Management, span the EM globe, with 24 from Asia, 15 in eastern Europe, 22 in the Middle East, 9 from Africa (all South African), and 22 in Latin America. Their listed parent companies come from the US, western Europe and Japan. including some with more than one affiliate, notably Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group with three, and Nestle, with two.Cremers, an associate professor at the Yale School of Management, found that between June 1998 and June 2011 a dollar invested in these affiliate companies would have grown to $23.03, compared to $8.92 for an investment in their local stock markets.A portfolio of the 86 parent companies (six are unlisted) would have fallen behind, with a dollar investment growing to only $4.15. And the rich-world markets in which they trade have done worse of all: a dollar invested would have brough back just $2.00. For comparison, the MSCI index over the period would have brought a return per dollar of $1.63.The chart below shows the outstanding out-performance of EM affiliates:Moreover, as Cremers shows, the extra returns earned from investing in EM affiliates don’t come at the price of greater risk. The annualised volatility of the affiliates’ portfolio was 24.6 per cent, lower than for their country indices (29.7 per cent), and only slightly higher than their parents (21.4 per cent).Cremers argues that this out-performance is the result of the affiliates’ better corporate governance than other companies in their local markets, plus the stabilising role played by the multinational parent groups.The affiliates may have benefitted from improved corporate governance through the controlling stakes of their parents, the multinational corporations. Such improved corporate governance can result in improved investor protection and operating performance.Both these factors are particularly important in a crisis. When other investors head for the door, and finance may be hard to find, multinational parents tend to stand by their EM affiliates.What’s particularly striking about the report’s findings is the way that the EM affiliates have pulled away from their parents since the 2008 crisis. The crisis clearly forced many investors to put their portfolios through some rigorous scrutiny. They decided that they liked the safety of the affiliates over their local markets – and the growth prospects of the affiliates over the parent groups.What the analysis cannot say is what comes next. Could it be that other EM-based companies learn from the experiences of multinational affiliates, improve their corporate governance and improve their stock market performance? Or do they face too many local pressures – political, economic and social – to change their ways very much?If the local competition doesn’t improve, multinationals’s affiliate could continue to out-perform. But if it does, they and their stock market performance could come under pressure.Related reading:

576;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-02-21T09:01:19Z;Greece: doubts linger after deal is done;;"There has been barely of flicker of reaction in emerging markets on the momentuous news of the Greek bail-out. While the euro rose modestly on Tuesday after EU leaders made their announcements, there was little reaction further afield.In a sense, this is as it should be – the rescue had been widely anticipated by investors. It is also overshadowed by doubts over Greece’s political, social and economic capacity to shoulder its huge burdens – a point highlighted by the gloomy confidential report prepared for eurozone leaders last week and published on Tuesday in the FT. There are no easy ways forward. Not for Athens, not for bankers and not for investors.Indeed, the biggest shock in the rescue package concerns the lenders. As the FT reported, bank negotiators had believed they had a deal for reducing the long-term value of their bonds by about 72 per cent.This from the FT:But in the bond swap that will be used to execute the debt restructuring, private bondholders will not only receive new bonds with a lower face value, but their interest rates will be significantly lower than the deal struck last month. In a statement issued by representatives of private bondholders, the new interest rates – 2 per cent for the first three years, 3 per cent for the next five, and 4.2 per cent thereafter – were described as “well below market rates”.So as well as the hair cut, the eurozone barbers are treating their customers to a compulsory low-interest gel, with its effects lasting for years to come.None of this is good for the banks’ ability to regenerate their balance sheets and service other customers. At the margin, it will accelerate the European deleveraging that is now in full flow, not least in Hungary and other vulnerable EMs in central and eastern Europe.Not surprisingly, while Asian EM equities on Tuesday were flat, with the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index unchanged, CEE equities were down, with the MSCI east Europe index 0.8 per cent lower.On the currency markets, the euro quickly gave up its early gains, trading later at $1.325, up 0.1 per cent. In Asia, the biggest fall was sustained by the Indonesian rupiah, down 0.7 per cent, in a general but very slight weakening in local currencies.In CEE, where local currenices have been rising strongly this year, the euro rose slightly against the Polish zloty and the Czech crown but weakened against the Hungarian forint, which was trading at Ft287.1 to the euro.ING said in a report on Tuesday:With the Troika agreement on Greece finally going through (IMF Head Lagarde saying she would take it to the IMF Board in March) and the IIF [representing private lenders] stating that there is also a PSI [private sector involvement] agreement in principle, any negative EME-related news (risk of EC proposing suspension of EU funds to Hungary under the EDP, according to media) is being quenched, with the drop again in EUR/USD volatility buttressing assets.So, the outlook is stable for the moment. But it is a fragile platform on which to build investor confidence.Related reading:

577;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Fund file: bond reality check needed?;;The new rush for emerging market bonds being tracked closely by beyondbrics makes you wonder what some investors use instead of memory.It’s true that with Moody’s having put Austria, France and the UK on negative credit watch last week, some investors might not feel the need for historical perspective. But a little bit of scepticism might be a good thing, and an alternative way of rating credit risk might help deliver it, as a report in FTfm explains.MSCI, the index and information provider, has joined a select few in launching a tool that allows investors to assess the exposure of their sovereign bond holdings to environmental, social and governance issues.“In the case of sovereign bonds, it is clear ESG issues such as political and social risk can have a sizeable impact,” says Hewson Baltzell, head of product development at MSCI. “For example, the current situations within the eurozone, in Hungary, and implications from the Arab Spring all demonstrate the importance of investigating the relationship between ESG issues and a country’s creditworthiness.”The MSCI ratings cover 90 countries responsible for 99 per cent of sovereign bond issuance and provide information going back five years.Back-testing shows this information can be instructive.The ESG ratings on Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland in 2007 were much lower than their conventional bond ratings, according to James Gifford, executive director of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.But what does this mean for investors in EM debt?Experts think an ESG approach can highlight future problems in some economies that are not reflected in traditional ratings and might give investors pause. “Both China and India have a number of environmental, social and governance problems they are wrestling with that are not reflected in the market,” Mr Baltzell says.China, in particular, is thought to score lower than its peers on key governance indicators such as civil liberties and political rights. It has also shown deterioration in environmental areas – the costs of its pollution problems are adding up.Hindsight is 20/20, investors might scoff. But that is exactly the point. History proves that it is a good idea to take these factors into account.“The way the credit rating agencies ignored corruption, social inequality, and other lead indicators of risk in Egypt is yet another example of the very limited – and misleading – approach of the mainstream rating models,” says Raj Thamotheram, president of the Network for Sustainable Financial Markets.For those who remain on the sidelines, Bank Sarasin has some common sense to throw into the mix: “Sustainable economic development is a basic prerequisite for being able to service sovereign debt,” it says, in a report published last year.Those in the EM debt gold rush cannot say they haven’t been warned.
578;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-02-14T21:30:08Z;EM equities: no signs of slowing;;"It’s been a good year so far to be an emerging market equities investor, to say the least. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index surged 11 per cent last month – its strongest January in 11 years, rebounding from a 21 per cent tumble last year – and is currently at its highest level since August.And it seems that fund managers are counting on more EM joy still. According to a monthly survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch – considered a barometer of sentiment in financial markets – there has been a “stunning rise in asset allocation to EMs” in February. Even after last month’s stellar performance, the jump towards EMs is the second biggest in the past 12 years.Why the bullishness? According to BofA:Thanks to a stronger policy response in Europe and better-than-expected macro data around the world, asset allocators significantly increased their exposure to EM equities this month… Unsurprisingly, this surge in EM exposure coincided with an improvement in FMS risk measurements (lower cash levels, higher equity allocations) and stronger expectations for global growth.The outlook for Chinese growth, which BofA says is “arguably the most important barometer of EM sentiment” was perceived as the strongest it’s been since November 2010. That’s thanks to an improvement in global growth expectations: after spending much of last year predicting a recession, a net 11 per cent of fund managers now reckon the global economy will improve over the next 12 months.China regained its position as the most favoured EM in February, having been overtaken by Brazil last month. There were also big swings in favour of Turkey, now the third-most popular EM, and Mexico, which went from being more than 20 per cent “underweight” to around 5 per cent “overweight”. And Indian equities, though still lagging behind their peers, saw a “massive rally”, said BofA.Across EMs as a whole the mood is most definitely risk-on, with cyclical industries in favour – particular the financial services industry, which suffered a torrent of negative sentiment toward the end of 2011.The strong improvement in the macro outlook spurred a massive shift in EM sector allocations to Financials: the sector went from a huge underweight (-44%) to modest overweight (+7%) in February. And as fund managers became more constructive on global growth prospects, they reported increased holdings of Materials (+7%) to the highest level since April ‘11. Other cyclical sectors also attracted additional interest.Are investors setting themselves up for a fall? Some analysts think so – and BofA says the bottom line is that exposure to EMs in now “dangerously high”. It notes that the most investors are overweight EMs since December 2010, at levels which, historically speaking, have coincided with short-term underperformance.Then again, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is still around 13 per cent down from its 2011 peak, and investors worldwide are apparently hungry for risk. Given that a net 36 per cent of the global panel surveyed – with more than $600bn of assets under management – said they’d most like to “overweight” EM equities over all other regions, this rally might have a while to run still.Jerome Booth, Head of Research at Ashmore Investment Management, questions the assumption that current investor bullishness about EMs is unsustainable. He told the FT: “To say that they [EMs] are overweight begs the question – overweight what?… One might well conclude that at least half the world’s future income is likely to come from the emerging world. Traditional indices may be useful for benchmarking performance but not for asset allocation. Arguably most investors in the developed world are still horrendously under-weight emerging markets. As they realise this, in large part because they are making fundamental reassessments of risk in the developed world, they are catching up . A bit.”His conclusion? “This is not reversible as it driven by people discarding prejudices. And prejudices are asymmetric: unlike knowledge, once lost they are not reacquired. So there is probably more so-called ‘over-weighting’ coming”.Related reading:

579;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-02-06T15:00:43Z;Blindfold metrics: EMs v the world;;"A puzzle to begin the week, courtesy of some creative work by analysts at Morgan Stanley.Conan Carr and colleagues compare stocks in four regions – Europe, the US, Japan and emerging markets – using standardised accounting, valuation and growth metrics. The twist? They disguise the identity of each region, challenging you to figure out which is which. “We expect that like us, some of your preconceptions will be challenged along the way,” they say. Let’s see.Your first clue: the price-to-book value of each region’s stocks, plotted against their return on equity.Equities in region A comes across the most expensive, C and D are relatively cheap, and B is just above “fair value”.Some more information:Or, in table form:[table id=17 /]To clarify, each region’s equities are ranked relative to the others, from 1 (best) to 4 (worst). The categories are weighted to give an overall ranking.All guesses in? Here’s the answer:Region C, the region that ranked highest overall – emerging markets
Region D – Europe
Region A – US
Region B – JapanEM stocks have long been touted for their growth potential, of course, but is it a surprise that they rate so well compared to their peers? Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take:Overall rank = 1. The analysis is consistent with a preference for EM over DM equities. EM is second most attractive on valuation after Europe. Profitability, which may surprise some, leverage and growth components all point toward EM equities as first compared to other regions. However, EM performs worst on the earnings quality and volatility components of the ranking – is this enough to offset all the other metrics? The market thinks so today, but probably won’t several years from now if earnings quality improves.Have investors been too cautious, then? It’s worth noting that even after a dismal 2011, in which the the MSCI Emerging Markets Index tumbled almost 20 per cent, investors in EM stocks have celebrated the highest returns of any region over the past 3, 5, 10 or 15 years:What’s more, the new year has brought a fresh surge of optimism. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has climbed 14.5 per cent year to date – that’s almost twice as much as the World Index.Related reading:

580;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-02-03T07:53:20Z;Indonesia: a haven for investors?;;"Those hoping to get away from it all in Indonesia usually think of Bali. But Jakarta’s financial markets are arguably as much of a haven for investors these days.Investors are drawn to Indonesia by strong domestic consumption from an increasingly wealthy population of 240m – a shelter from wobbly global trade on which export-oriented Asian countries such as Korea and Taiwan are heavily reliant. Economists are predicting another quarter of over 6 per cent growth when statistics are released next week. But how much can one really hide in Jakarta?“It is so large in terms of population – third in Asia and fourth in the world – and obviously consumption is rising, so that is why the market views this country as less affected [by global turmoil],” said Kelly Chung, a portfolio manager at ING who focuses on Indonesia.The data support much of that view. Indonesia’s exports add up to a little more than 20 per cent of GDP, according to HSBC, compared with more than 60 per cent in Thailand and Vietnam. That means a fall in trade affects Indonesia less than nearly all of its peers (although India, with a similarly deep local market, is also less exposed to the ups and downs of trade flows).The promise of growth in a country with just 67m people fewer than the US has kept Indonesia’s markets strong. Last year, the MSCI Indonesia index beat the regional MSCI index by 26 per cent and the debt market got a boost from Indonesia’s recent elevation to investment grade.But as always, the picture’s more complicated when you get up close.For starters, many of those domestic consumers earn their salaries in industries closely linked to commodities and are thus vulnerable to the volatility expected in those markets this year.According to Nomura analysts, agriculture created up to 40 per cent of Indonesian employment in 2010, meaning rural income in particular is “largely dependent on commodity prices.”They write:For example, when commodity prices declined sharply in 2008-09, monthly car sales contracted by as much as 48% below the previous peak. Motorcycle sales dropped 40% from the peak over the same period. Car sales bounced back when CPO [crude palm oil] prices surged in mid 2009-10, in our view reflecting the concurrent bounce in rural incomesIn addition to palm oil, Indonesia is also a major exporter of coal and other commodities. Although mining creates relatively few jobs on the national scale, equipment makers and mining infrastructure companies need coal prices high enough to encourage mines to continue large capital expenditures.“The global situation actual has a bit more importance for the Indonesian economy that people realise,” said Teddy Oetomo, head of Indonesia research for Credit Suisse.And, of course, Indonesia’s protection from trade swings means that if world growth does pick up, its low exposure to global growth means equities wouldn’t get that much of a lift, analysts from Morgan Stanley argue. In that (optimistic) scenario, investors would be more likely to head towards trade-exposed stocks now priced at cheaper valuations than Indonesia’s relatively expensive market.Related reading:

581;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-02-02T16:23:42Z;Frontier equities: still out of favour;;While interest in frontier market debt may be waxing, international investment in frontier equity markets has waned considerably of late.After robust inflows over most of 2010, funds dedicated to frontier markets and tracked by EPFR Global, a data provider, have suffered a five month streak of net outflows. Investors have now withdrawn money for nine of the past 12 months, cutting the total assets under management to $7.5bn.Despite the ebullient start to the year, which has caused most emerging markets and other risky assets to soar, a further $54.5m has been yanked out of frontier market equity funds tracked by EPFR so far in 2012.The funds monitored by EPFR are mainly international, niche players, and most investors in frontier markets are local funds. However, even these seem to lost some of their appetite.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has gained over 12 per cent already this year, clawing back some of its 20 per cent drop last year. Yet the MSCI Frontier Markets Index has edged up less than 1 per cent so far in 2012, and fell over 22 per cent last year. The broader MSCI World Index has gained 6.3 per cent in 2012, after shedding 7.6 per cent last year.There are still some believers. Exotix, the boutique investment house dedicated to recondite fringes of the financial system, argues that African equities – which make up a large component of the frontier market indices – are “worth watching this quarter and beyond”, particularly Nigeria:We think the Nigerian market – amid some attractive valuations – is well placed for recovery this year. While we do not expect the external factors to go away quickly, domestic factors should turn supportive. Real GDP growth of 7-8%, and strong non-oil growth, should support corporate profits. Moreover, we think the central bank is closer to the peak in its interest rate cycle.Nonetheless, Exotix remains sceptical that the new year’s rally in riskier assets can last, given the uncertainties still swirling around the world, not least Europe. Although frontier markets are less correlated to global market movements than many other assets, no harbour will remain safe if the financial storm worsens into a tempest.

For 2012 to date, the MSCI Brics index is up 12.2 per cent, ahead of global emerging markets at 8.9 per cent. “This follows a poor year in 2011 and BRIC underperformance v. GEMs since late-2009.”Fair enough. But as Dennis himself points out, January is often a time “for contrarianism and for rotation plays. It is fairly common for the underperformers of the previous year to ‘come out of the gates quickly’ in the new year and for the outperformers of the previous year to lag.” However, Dennis doesn’t think that this undermines the good start: “There has been a decisive move back into higher-beta markets”.So which markets are up? “All four Bric markets are in the top eight best performing EMs so far this year, led by India (17.1 per cent), followed by Brazil (14.1 per cent), Russia (11.1 per cent) and China (9.4 per cent)” (See chart below). True, but which are the other four markets in the top eight? Hungary, Egypt, Turkey and Poland – hardly a group to inspire confidence, with, respectively, question marks over IMF help, political stability, balance of payments and the eurozone. Indonesia, something of an EM darling at present, is 14th in the list, behind the global average, but after a good 2011 it is less of a recovery play. India had an awful 2011 – a better 2012 was likely.Dennis argues that the Brics are “at the forefront of the falling inflation and interest rate trends in EMs – one of our key themes for 2012. All four Bric countries have eased monetary policy recently.” True, but so have Indonesia, Philippines, and Turkey. And Chile. And Thailand. It’s hard to see the Brics necessarily at the forefront – they are part of a trend.Next up is fund flows. Do the inflows into EM funds of $4.23bn year-to-date point to a strong 2012? Not necessarily. As the numbers show, there is a relatively close correlation of EM fund flows to MSCI performance of 0.71 over the last 11 years. But which number is driving which? Dennis suggests that performance drives flows, not vice-versa. So if markets in 2012 go south, the fund flows should duly follow. If funds are driven by performance, then they are hardly an indicator of things to come.Lastly, Dennis looks at valuations. Here, he is on stronger territory. “Valuations are supportive. Brics carry lower valuations than non-Bric EMs on all of our metrics; for example, Brics currently trade at 9.6x forward v. 11.9x for the non-Brics.” There is no doubt that on the data given, Bric markets look cheap.Dennis concludes: “Equity markets seem to have decided that most of the likely bad news for 2012 has been discounted – we agree.” The problem is that it’s the unlikely bad news that tends to hurt markets the most. We’ll see.Related reading:

583;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2012-01-25T17:33:02Z;S African stocks: record highs – if you’re a local investor;;"There has been little to cheer about on world financial markets in recent months but in the past week South African equities have been able to claim an all-time record.The Johannesburg Stock Exchange, by far Africa’s largest, has hit record highs with its benchmark All-Share Index closing on Monday at 33,940 points following six straight days on the way up. But there’s a snag: that’s only in local currency terms. For international investors it’s a different story, with the rand’s weakness cancelling most of the gain – though the market is still up, just.In rand terms, the All-Share is some 18.5 per cent above its 2011 low of 28,391, hit in early August. But in US dollar terms, the increase is 6 per cent. That’s still above the 5.4 per cent advance in the $-based MSCI emerging markets index, but only just.The upswing in the JSE’s fortunes follows the trend of other emerging markets responding positively to cautiously improving sentiment on the global outlook, with analysts saying both internal and external factors have been at play.“Our share price went to an all-time high because you started to get slightly better sentiment or news flow around the global recovery. Yes, there are still concerns around Europe, but the data around the US is improving and the data on China is not too bad,” says Kevin Lings, chief economist at Stanlib.The surge on the stock market has been driven in part by retailers, such as Woolworths, Shoprite and Massmart – in which Walmart acquired a 51 per cent stake in last year. The perception that China looks set for a soft landing rather than a hard one has also supported a rally in mining and other commodity related stocks, which account for just over a third of the JSE’s market capitalisation. With their revenues in dollars, they have been proving their worth as a powerful hedge against rand weakness.The question is whether the momentum can be sustained.On Wednesday, the All-Share closed at 33,637, down 0.29 per cent.“It’s a bit of a worldwide [trend] – people are buying decent quality shares where they are getting a sensible dividend yield because the rest looks such a mess, which makes me feel they are pushing it to the limit at this stage,” says a Johannesburg-based trader. “Also, down here you always get a bit of a January factor, people come back from their holidays, the institutions work out their cash flows, and say we had better put some money in and of course that leads to other people following.”He and others note that some valuations, particularly of retail stocks, are already looking expensive, with Massmart trading at around 41 times its earnings.“Personally I’m not too sure it’s going to last,” the trader says. “I would expect things to pull back from here once reality actually sets in.”And while South Africa is in a far healthier position than many developed nations, with GDP growth of around 3 per cent estimated for 2011, forecasts are being downgraded.Last week, Gill Marcus, central bank governor, said growth this year was expected to be 2.8 per cent compared with 3.2 per cent in a previous forecast. At the same time, the country is facing inflationary pressures, with the consumer price index hitting 6.1 per cent in December.The eurozone’s continued woes also play heavily on South Africa, which exports about a third of its manufactured goods to Europe.“The risk for South Africa is that we feel our domestic environment is under pressure,” Lings says. “The feeling is, South Africa is losing momentum and the loss of momentum is coming through from the consumer.”Consumer spending had been an important driver of South Africa’s recovery from the previous recession and any slow-down in spending would clearly hit retail stocks.So while the highs can be enjoyed, investors should be wary of tougher and more volatile times ahead. For international investors the exchange rate comes into play. The rand suffered during a general decline in emerging market currencies in the second half of last year driven by a flight to safety in the US dollar. If those flows have now stabilised there might be some prospect of currency gains. So far this year the currency has risen against the dollar, but only by 1 per cent.Related reading:

585;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-12-30T17:30:53Z;BB 2011 awards: EM winners and losers;;"It has been a torrid year for emerging markets and there have been very, very few success stories. Amid fears of a global recession and huge volatility across markets, investors have fled even remotely risky assets. That has spelt disaster for EMs.The MSCI emerging market index has fallen 21.5 per cent since January and there have been very few economies which have escaped that trend.The MSCI Latin American index dropped 21.5 per cent while the MSCI Asia (ex Japan) shed nearly a fifth of its value. MSCI’s eastern Europe index fell 25 per cent as its members suffered for their proximity to the eurozone.And it’s not as if EM markets have any global trend excuses to fall back on – the S&P 500 traded flat in 2011 and even Europe’s markets “only” dropped 12 per cent.As Jonathan Garner of Morgan Stanley told beyondbrics: “Emerging market equities have underperformed developed market equities by 15 per cent over the last 12 months.”Even within the EM gloom there were dark and bright spots. And the fight for biggest EM loser of the year was particularly fierce.However, on careful reflection beyondbrics unanimously chose India to receive the dubious award.India’s benchmark Sensex index led Asia’s fall in 2011, losing a quarter of its value to record its second worst year ever – no real surprise considering India’s persistently high inflation and struggling currency, its series of seven compensating interest rate hikes (13 since March 2010), and its stalling economy.Snapping at India’s heels were Hungary and Egypt where social and political unrest have led to severe market turmoil. Both countries are staring at balance of payments crises as their currencies suffer and their reserves diminish. And neither looks likely to receive the external funding they need any time soon – repeated downgrades by all three credit rating agencies have only underlined their problems.Egypt’s benchmark index has lost nearly half of its value in 2011. And Hungary’s Bux index has shed over 20 per cent while its currency, the forint, has tumbled over 10 per cent against the euro – its biggest yearly decline on record.Other noteworthy, albeit illiquid, under-performers included Nairobi, which saw its headline index plunge over 30 per cent, Kazakhstan, where political unrest spurred a 35 per cent fall in equities, and Ukraine which saw 40 per cent of its main index wiped out in 2011.As Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, told beyondbrics, Ukraine’s problems are especially varied:It failed to respond with a credit rate hike to defend its faltering currency, failed to sign an EU-association agreement due to the Tymoshenko situation and it has an ongoing energy problem with Russia. Its banks are also undergoing massive deleveraging and it is reliant on its steel industry which is suffering as China slows.EM winners were harder to spot and any accolades are very relative.Again, there were illiquid markets which saw massive moves – Venezuela’s bourse jumped some 77.5 per cent while Zambia’s Lusaka stock exchange recorded a 26 per cent jump- but they were the exceptions.The biggest winner in Latin America, bar Venezuela, was Mexico which outperformed the MSCI LatAm index by some 18 per cent – however, that still equated to a drop of 3.7 per cent.Robertson pointed to Nigeria and Ghana as Africa’s 2011 success stories. Although both saw their main indices shed value (5 per cent in Ghana and 16 per cent in Nigeria) he was optimistic that Nigeria’s peaceful elections and Ghana’s oil-find would pay dividends in 2012.As Robertson noted, “Ghana has made it to middle-income country status”.However, this year’s biggest winners came from south-east Asia. The Philippines was the regions best performer – up 4.1 per cent in 2011 – but beyondbric’s EM champion for 2011 is Indonesia.Indonesia’s markets may have gained just 3.2 per cent over the year but its return to investment status by Fitch Ratings in December and its strong fundamentals, driven by domestic demand, underline its recovery and potential.As Robertson said, “it might not just be Indonesia’s year; it might be Indonesia’s decade.”Related reading:

587;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MSCI to UAE and Qatar: keep trying;;"It’s late, the doors are closed, and poor Qatar and the United Arab Emirates aren’t getting in.Perhaps they didn’t have the right shoes, their hair was not quite right or they just simply didn’t look the part, either way the message from the bouncer on Thursday was clear, just like the last time: try again in six months time.Well, it wasn’t a nightclub. It was the MSCI emerging market index that Qatar the UAE were trying to enter. But the disappointment was just as real.For both countries the issue are quite specific – concerns over the implementation of a delivery versus payment system for the UAE, and problems over foreign ownership limits in Qatar.The decision on Thursday to once again review both Qatar and the UAE’s hopes for MSCI emerging market status in six months time, didn’t come as a huge surprise to investors in the region, whose interest in the topic is starting to flag.Some traders in the UAE had been a little overoptimistic:“Well, it turned out to be more a case of wishful thinking on my part,” wrote one Dubai-based trader. “Qatar and UAE were in the beauty parade but both were judged to be ugly sisters.”You can’t blame them for their optimism, with such low volumes, many are just hoping to hold on to their jobs after another round of cuts at many of the big investment banks.“I don’t think even the largest brokers are making money at these volumes,” Eric Swats, head of asset management at Rasmala Investment Bank in Dubai told Beyondbrics.MSCI said that in the UAE, while the new DVP system was working well, “investors continue to stress significant concerns over the effectiveness of this new framework to fully ensure the safeguarding of their assets”.In Qatar, the index provider confirmed that “stringent foreign ownership limits, including on large companies, remain a major concern to international institutional investors”.HSBC’s George Elhedery, head of global markets for the Middle East and north Africa, took a conciliatory tone expressing “disappointment” over the decision and said “both markets have a clear view on what they need to address if they are going to enter the index.”Abu Dhabi-based CAPM Investment’s stuck the dagger in:“The real reason…is the lack of volume,” the Abu Dhabi-based investment bank wrote in a note to clients.So, unless Qatar budges on its foreign ownership limits then it doesn’t seem to have much of a chance of getting on the guest list.On the other hand, the UAE has everything to play for – especially if the reason really is the payment systems. If it’s a case of volumes, as CAPM suggests, then it will need to lure the investors. In current market conditions that will be hard. Bet on another round of rejections in six months’ time.Related reading

588;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-12-01T14:21:52Z;Brics? It’s Carbs that make you strong;;"By Kingsmill BondTen years ago the mood among emerging market investors was one of despair. After a series of crises, EM equities had gone nowhere for a decade. All they seemed to offer was risk without reward.The rebranding of the asset class as Brics was welcome and timed the bottom of the market perfectly. However, the cyclical upsurge in commodities has been so powerful that it has revealed a split in both emerging and developed markets: commodity producers – EM and DM – have outperformed in equities to such a degree that it is time to reorganise our labels. Out with the Brics and in with the Carbs.We believe that for equity investors the world is most usefully divided into three groups of markets: high-growth emerging (such as China and India); low-growth developed (the US, Europe and Japan); and commodity producers both DM and EM – headed by Canada, Australia, Russia, Brazil and South Africa – which we will call the Carbs.Emerging markets are able to grow rapidly and consistently from a low base; developed markets are mired in debt and face the prospect of a lost decade; the Carbs are driven by the commodity cycle.As recently as 2003, Russia had a GDP per capita of just $3,000, Brazil was still emerging from crisis, and Australian GDP per capita was just 70 per cent of the US’s. After many years of low commodity prices, commodity economies were largely off investors’ radar screens and many seemed to struggle from one crisis to the next. They made up as little as 5 per cent of the MSCI global equity index and their total GDP added up to barely a fifth of the US’s.The commodity cycle has changed all this, transforming economies and markets out of recognition. If we look at the five largest commodity producing countries with liquid markets (the Carbs), their GDP has increased fourfold from $2tn to $8tn since the start of the commodity cycle in 2003, while the real value of their currencies against the dollar has nearly doubled. Governments have paid down debt, built up reserves of over a trillion dollars, and face the current crisis in a much stronger position than the developed markets. Equity markets are up fourfold on average, and daily trading has increased twentyfold.The Carbs now account for 12 per cent of the MSCI Global equity index and their GDP is equal to 52 per cent of the US’s.The key driver of this was the change in the price of their key export commodities, up between 280 per cent (for oil) and 520 per cent (for iron ore) over the period. These price changes – and the volume growth that followed as spare capacity was put to work – are sufficient to explain the earnings growth of the commodity stocks as well as the real currency appreciation and half of the earnings growth of the domestic sector.The performance of the Carbs’ equity markets has followed the commodity cycle, and has far outpaced those of Asia and the US. Moreover, the Carbs economies have enjoyed many similar drivers as consumption has tripled, housing prices have doubled, manufacturing has been damaged by ‘Dutch disease’, and unemployment has fallen.Thanks to this transformation, we believe that the Carbs have emerged as a separate asset class: countries where the commodity sector makes up a large share of GDP and the equity index and the currency is linked to commodity prices. Between them, the five Carbs alone control 29 per cent of the world’s landmass (with only 6 per cent of global population) and are responsible for the production of between a quarter and a half of most commodities. Taking fairly conservative valuations, we calculate that the value of the commodity assets of the Carbs is nearly $60tn, over seven times the level of their GDP. The list could easily be extended to include other commodity-exporters including Saudi Arabia, Chile, or Kazakhstan.However, the investment story for the CARBS is changing as the commodity cycle matures. We believe that the era of rapidly-rising commodity prices is now over as global economic growth slows; the story has moved on to volume increases, with Brazil and Canada planning to double oil production, and Australia to triple gas production, over the next decade.The opportunity thus lies in infrastructure companies that will make this possible, in those commodity companies able to exploit the growth, and in non-tradeable services such as retail and banking in markets where these sectors are underdeveloped such as Russia or South Africa.The risk to this asset class is of course that commodity prices fall significantly. But here we believe investors should make a distinction within the markets. If China shifts from infrastructure to consumption, from building roads to driving on them, then we anticipate outperformance from the energy markets of Russia and Canada.Kingsmill Bond is Russia strategist at CitigroupRelated reading:
brics at 10 file, beyondbrics"
589;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-11-29T07:00:06Z;Chart of the week: Brics at 10;;"So, was he right? Ten years ago Jim O’Neill of Goldman Sachs looked at four growth economies – Brazil, China, India and Russia – put their first letters into an acronym, and the Brics (as a concept) were born.So how have they fared? What if you invested in the Brics ten years ago – where would you be now? Chart of the week finds out.There are a myriad of ways of looking at this, but beyondbrics is going to be hard-headed and stick to equities and GDP.A quick look at the MSCI indices for the four Brics since 2001 shows that they have comfortably outperformed the S&P 500. If you invested $100 at the time of O’Neill’s report in November 2001 in each of the four Brics, you would now have $674 from Brazil, $451 from China, $459 from India and $414 from Russia. Your 100 S&P bucks? Worth $112.But let’s play devil’s advocate for a minute, and go back, to 1995, for example. Where do our five $100 bills get us?Well, the best bet would have been Russia – despite two massive crashes that wiped off over 79 per cent of the MSCI value, $100 dollars in 1995 would now have become $800 now. Brazil and India would have given you an acceptable return of $363 and $263 respectively.But China has barely scraped into positive territory: our $100 has earned just 48 cents. And the S&P is up to $265. Not such a clear-cut picture. Was O’Neill lucky in his timing?But equities aren’t the only indicator – or even the main one from the point of view of overall economic development.The Bric countries have seen great GDP growth – China’s economy has risen from around $1,000bn in 2001 to over $6,000bn today. Aside from Russia in 2008-09, all of the Brics have avoided recession in the last ten years.So have the markets and GDP risen in step? Not really. The rise in equities from 2001-11 has outpaced GDP growth in India and Brazil – giving investors a better return. But in the same period Russian and Chinese GDP growth have comfortably exceeded the markets – in China’s case, because many of the state-run enterprises that dominate the economy have different priorities, other than boosting return on equity.In Russia, valuations are overshadowed by investors’ concerns about corruption, transparency and state intervention in the economy. Many fund managers were disgusted by the Yukos affair – the oil group that was broken up when its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was convicted of fraud. The portfolio investors were among those who lost out.[table id=3 /]* percentage increase in GDP – percentage increase in MSCI
** percentage increase in MSCI – percentage increase in S&P500The change in equities vs GDP is even clearer for China when we look at the 1995-2011 period. Over that time, GDP has grown from $728bn to around $6,988bn – a rise of over 800 per cent, compared to the relatively flat markets over the same period. India too has had a significant increase in GDP over equities over the last 16 years, with GDP rising from $365bn to $1,843bn, a rise of over 400 per cent, with equities going up 163 per cent.The upshot? O’Neill’s choice of the BRICs was inspired. His timing even more so.Related reading:

590;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-11-28T15:45:40Z;Goldman bullish on MENA;;"Goldman Sachs is bucking the trend by broadening its Middle East and North Africa equity research coverage at a time when other banks in the region have slashed their equity research teams.The bank said this week that it was initiating coverage on 80 new stocks in the region, taking their total regional coverage to 121 stocks across ten countries, according to a copy of the report sent to clients.“It is a punchy, contrarian move,” said one Dubai-based trader.The timing is interesting, if not rather odd, given that international investor interest has waned in the region since unrest has spread across the Middle East, prompting uncertainty among foreign investors. Market volumes have struggled as European debt woes also prompted a higher aversion to risk.Only a few months back, Nomura, Japan’s largest investment bank, canned its Middle East equity research team based in Dubai. They said they’d continue to cover major names from London. Others including Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse also let their head of Middle East equity research go, Reuters reported at the time.Perhaps Goldman is betting on an MSCI upgrade for the UAE or Qatar, which would likely prompt more interest in the region’s markets.Goldman initiated its coverage, on an upbeat tone, with 28 new buys, eight of which are the bank’s top picks.The lucky eight are: Arab Potash (Fertilizers, Jordan), Aramex (Logistics, UAE), Drake and Scull (Construction, UAE), Industries Qatar (Chemicals, Qatar), Jordan Phosphate (Fertilizers, Jordan), Juhayna (Consumer staples, Egypt), Orascom Construction Industries (Construction/Fertilizers, Egypt) and Wataniya Telecom (Telecoms, Kuwait).The bank’s choices are targeting three major themes, looking at companies that can benefit from 1) basic resources 2) infrastructure development and 3) rising consumer spending.High oil prices over the next two years will mean that the region’s economic growth “will be more resilient than global levels,” next year, according to Goldman.Traders in Dubai were relieved to hear that the region’s equities hadn’t been totally abandoned, at least not by Goldman.The bank had recently cut two staff members in Dubai, one on the equity research team and another in equity sales.“Good to see someone making a statement and nailing their colours to the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] mast,” one trader said.Related reading:

591;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-11-16T15:18:56Z;Russia: the equities roller-coaster;;"It’s never a dull moment in Russian equities. In early 2011 they soared 21 per cent, on strong oil prices and hopes of a global economic recovery, an increase four times larger than the 5 per cent rise in global emerging markets.In the grim months that have followed, Russia is down nearly 30 per cent, compared to a 21 per cent drop in EM overall. And there’s little chance of a recovery without a meaningful resolution of the euro crisis.Russia’s volatility stems from its dependence on exports of oil, gas and metals. When the global economy is growing fast, demand for commodities grows too, and commodity prices often overshoot.The gains bring particular benefits to Russia because it is stable and the public finances are solid (thanks to natural resources tax revenues). Conversely, when the global economy slows, commodity prices tend to weaken and the effects on Russian equities are especially severe, like this summer/autumn.The swings are accentuated by the fact that foreign investors dominate trading in Russian equities – holding around two-thirds of the free float, once state and oligarch shareholders are excluded.So when the foreigners rush for the door, they tend to break off the hinges as happened in the 2008-09 crisis. With this year’s crisis coming as less of a shock than Lehman Brothers, the effects have been less dramatic but are still painfully clear to investors.Take a look at this chart, which compares the 2011 performance of the RTS, Poland’s WIG and the MSCI emerging markets index:Chris Weafer of Troika Dialog says there’s little chance of a change until the world outlook improves:Despite the currently strong domestic fiscal and monetary picture and despite the fact that assets are trading on average about one-third that of EM peers, the market will not materially out-perform the global trend until investors have more confidence that the US/EU can avoid a serious slowdown and China can manage a very soft landing in 2012. Only then will we see the Russia move strongly ahead as it did in the first 4 months of this year and in the October global markets rally.The curious point in this sell-off, unlike 2008-09, is that Russian shares are sharply down even though the oil price has held up because of the Middle East turmoil. Normally, the RTS tracks the oil price fairly closely, but this time it hasn’t, as this chart demonstrates (note the divergence towards the end of the chart):Now, it could be that it is oil prices that are “wrong”. They could be set for a fall if the coming economic downturn is even more severe than expected, with oil demand easing in China and other key EMs, as well as in the west.More likely, it’s that Russian equities have been dumped in the general flight to safety, which has seen a lot of indiscriminate selling.If that’s the case, Russian equities could be ripe for a rally. It’s hard to imagine one coming while the eurozone crisis rages, with even Dutch bonds being dumped this week.But if European Union leaders finally get a grip, then it could be time for a more selective look at EM equities – and Russia might benefit. Russian domestic political developments might help the mood.There’s been a lot of hype about prime minister Vladimir Putin’s decision to stand again for the presidency. While this has generated some heat in Moscow – notably with finance minister Alexei Kudrin’s sacking – it’s overwhelmingly likely that Putin and co will engineer a smooth return to the Kremlin.Given Putin’s ambivalence about economic reform, that’s bad in the long term. But his safe return to the presidency could still encourage some investors – Russian and foreign – to bet on political and economic stability. They will judge that there’s plenty of money to be made in Russia even without reform, at least for the next couple of years.Russia bulls, like Weafer, tend to grasp at any signs that investor behaviour might be changing. After all Russian stocks are extraordinarily cheap, trading on an average price to earnings multiple of just 6, compared to an average for the MSCI index of around 10 times.Weafer says there has been a “tentative increase in allocations to Russia” in large EM and regional equity investment funds. According to data from EPFR, the research company, the total new allocation of money to Russia reported last week was $75m – a third straight week of net positive flows at a difficult time in world markets.This is hardly the flood that would signify a real change in investor attitudes to Russia. But it shows that at least some fund managers are reassessing the prospects for the Cinderella Bric.Related reading:

592;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-11-04T08:10:13Z;EM stocks and currencies jump – but for how long?;;Despite exhibiting plenty of emerging market habits, Greece remains on the other side of the EM/DM divide. News that the Greek PM has scrapped plans for a referendum on an EU aid has given emerging markets a shot in the arm.But it looks like the bounce was already on the cards – investors have poured money back into EM this week at a rate not seen since April.By late trading on Friday, Asian stock markets were all in positive territory. Gains in China and India were minimal, but elsewhere the rally had some gas.The Hang Seng jumped 3.6 per cent, Taiwan 1.9 per cent, and South Korea 3.1 per cent. Indonesia added 2.3 per cent, the Philippines 1.5 per cent.But the real action was in the currency market. The won soared 1.8 per cent against the dollar, Malaysia’s ringgit climbed 1 per cent, while the Taiwan dollar, the Philippines peso and the South African rand all moved significantly higher (boosted perhaps by Japanese buying). A return to appreciation for the renminbi may also have helped.Meanwhile fund flow data from EPFR showed the best week of inflows in 6 months, with emerging markets recording $3.5bn of new money, mostly into GEM funds and Asia ex-Japan funds. That’s the highest figure since April.A word of caution, however. Despite the recent rally in emerging markets, the MSCI EM Index is still off 19 per cent since the end of… April.Even sell-side analaysts warned against euphoria over Friday’s bounce. This from Chris Weafer of Troika, a Russian investment company:But there is still far too much uncertainty and far too many variables as to how this crisis may yet play out for any complacency that the initially positive market reaction may now expand unchallenged. Investors have become very adept at 180 degree turns in recent weeks and remain very sensitive to the still fast changing newsflow.And this from Barclays Capital:We maintain our cautious stance and would not chase the rally. We are concerned that in Europe, implementation fatigue may surprise a market that has already priced in a very positive outlook.
593;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EMs gain on euro relief;;Emerging markets are joining in the general surge of relief sweeping world financial centres on news of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis deal.Even though European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet warned this was no time for complacency as he left the Brussels summit, investors judged that the worst might be over – and plunged into risk assets, not least EM equities. By 08.15 London time, the MSCI EM index was up by 2.15 per cent, and the MSCI EM eastern Europe index by 3.8 per cent.In Asia, EM shares as measured by the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, were 2.3 per cent higher, ledby a storng performance in the Hang Seng (up 2.7 epr cent near the close).In eastern Europe, Russia’s RTS index was trading more than 3 per cent higher in late morning local time. Warsaw’s WIG20 opened 2.4 per cent up – in line with early gains in western Europe.As Jamie Chisholm reported for the FT, Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London, said in a note that the deal was no “silver bullet” for the eurozone debt crisis and much detail had yet to be hammered out.“Officials have certainly come up with a comprehensive list of actions but we are certainly still a long way from all the process parts being in place and thereby we will remain subject to ‘headline risk’ in the coming months,” he wrote. “I think the announcement is enough to buy some time and generate a moderate risk-on phase.”That includes EM. But for how long it lasts depends on what European Union leaders and bankers do next. In July, hopes that a package for Greece would restore confidence were soon dashed. Failure this time would have even more serious consequences for Europe’s governments, financial markets and banks. Not to mention taxpayers.
594;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
595;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-10-18T09:00:04Z;EM markets: falling back;;After the brief rally, the fall. Emerging equity markets tumbled on Tuesday, led by Asian stocks as Chinese GDP figures failed to impress. The Hang Seng closed down 4.23 per cent, Korea’s Kospi fell 1.41 per cent, and after a 9-day rising streak the MSCI emerging markets index fell 2.3 per cent.A 9.1 per cent GDP growth rate may sound high but for China it’s the slowest for over two years. Add eurozone worries to the mix after Angela Merkel, German chancellor, said there was no quick fix to the debt crisis, and investors have taken fright.“The China growth figure fell short of expectations,” Chu Moon Sung, fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management told Bloomberg. And “concern that it may have been too rosy to expect a quick fix to Europe’s debt crisis, is boosting the market’s volatility.”European markets followed Asia down, with Russia’s Micex falling 1.1 per cent, and Poland’s Wig20 also down 1.1 per cent in early trading.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest lender by market value, tumbled 6.1 per cent in Hong Kong. The stock was the biggest drag on the MSCI emerging market index, which had rallied in the last nine days with a 13 per cent rise. Overall the index is down 17.5 per cent over the last year.
596;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-10-17T09:50:46Z;EM stocks: a rally of sorts;;Emerging market bond funds may have seen dramatic outflows in the past couple of weeks, but EM equities are on their longest streak for over a year – gaining for the ninth straight day on Monday.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 1.86 percent to 952, after surging 5.8 per cent last week – the most since July 2009. But before investors cheer unreservedly, a little context is worth bearing in mind.On Monday the Hang Seng closed up 2.01 per cent, the Korean Kospi index was up 1.62 per cent, India’s Sensex was flat at -0.22 per cent, and Russia’s Micex was up 0.7 per cent.However, the MSCI EM index is 15 per cent down over the last 12 months and down 18 per cent in 2011 – more than the 7 per cent decline in the MSCI World Index of developed countries. The nine-day streak has seen the index bounce back from a low not seen since 2009 but it will need the run to last 28 days if it is to recover to its 2011 peak from April 8 of 1,206.“There are some very good things happening, we’ve had the European bank contagion at least removed to some degree,” Todd Martin, Asia equity strategist for Societe Generale told Bloomberg. “Valuations are amazingly low not just in Asia but global equities.”Economists are also predicting good news from Chinese GDP figures on Tuesday – most predict a 9 per cent growth rate.But no analysts are predicting a month-long rally.
597;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-10-12T21:21:57Z;Latin America market wrap;;Latin American markets have reacted positively to news about action on Eurozone debt worries, a trend that has left analysts cautious.Although Slovakia has voted against the expanded EFSF, there is a general consensus that political wrangling will subside and allow the measure to pass, which will help bolster the European rescue fund.Equities, currencies and bonds have all moved broadly stronger. The widely-watched MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index has turned heads, jumping more than 10 per cent from its October 4 listing.While the short term boost has turned Latam markets up, the long-term doubts about the economic health in Europe and the US continue to take their toll.“These markets are responding very closely to what’s going on in Europe and the US,” said Christopher Garman, director of Latin America at Eurasia Group. “Concern over the European outlook has grown. Growth concerns in the US and Europe have grown.”The Brazilian real and the Mexican peso have both gained on the US dollar and are among the strongest recent currency gainers. Mexican bonds have also experienced a sizable rally.Mexican stocks staged a particularly strong rally following the Federal Open Market Committee suggested that there was a possibility of a third quantitative easing session. The Mexican IPC index is up more than 2 percent.Numerous other Latin American markets have seen their major indexes benefit from the next out of the Eurozone and the US. Chile’s IPSA has risen 9.3 per cent and Argentina’s Merval jumped 6.4 per cent since October 4.Ed Kuczma, investment analyst on emerging markets for Van Eck Global, said the jump could be attributed to three factors: short covering, sovereign wealth and pension funds, and company share buy-backs.“You’ve had some short covering going on that could help explain why things have been rallying in the first couple weeks of October,” Kuczma said. “A lot of companies themselves believe that they will be able to make their way through this recent financial turbulence and they’re buying back stock … They think their shares are undervalued right now.”“Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds seeing long term value are natural buyers on panic, crisis selling,” he added.There is, however, a pervasive worry that Latam could bear the brunt of another recession in the US or, even worse, a crash in Asia. With much of the region’s income provided by manufacturing and commodities, a drop in demand could strike at the heart of markets.But until the European situation is put to bed and there’s definite signs that the US and Asian economies are stable, Latam markets should continue to see aggressive swings.

598;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-09-27T07:16:02Z;Asia: markets rebound on euro hope;;At last a little ray of hope. Asian markets are sharply up on Tuesday in the belief that European Union policymakers are edging fractionally closer to a solution of the eurozone crisis.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index of Asian emerging markets was up 4.5 per cent at 0800 BST, its first rise in five days, powered by particularly good bounces in Seoul, Jakarta and Hong Kong and a general improvement in Asian currencies. But keep a sense of perspective: the $-based MSCI index is still down 21 per cent on the year. The clouds of gloom are still omnipresent.“It’s a knee-jerk reaction to the world failing to come to an end last night,” Richard Morrow, director at Melbourne-based private client stockbroker E.L. & C. Baillieu, told Reuters. “It is a reversal and I don’t see it lasting. The market has been as gloomy as I can remember since the last days of 2008.”Lifted by a 2 per cent gain in US stocks on Monday, Asia’s top performer on Tuesday was South Korea, with the Kospi index closing 5.2 per cent up, followed by Indonesia (+4.5 per cent in late trading, and Hong Kong (+3.2 per cent near the close).On the currency markets, The Korean won finished 0.64 per cent up against the dollar. Indonesia’s rupiah traded higher by 1.3 per cent, and the Thai baht by 0.5 per cent.In Europe, EM bourses opened with some sharp gains, including a 2.7 per cent jump in Russia’s Micex index, and a 3.1 per cent improvement in Warsaw’s WIG20, relfecting similar gains in western Europe. EM currencies rose against the euro, notably the Polish zloty (+0.5 per cent).
599;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-09-26T07:15:08Z;Markets: doom and gloom everywhere;;"Asian financial markets slumped on Monday as fears that European leaders are failing to get to grips with the eurozone crisis undermined global economic confidence.With US Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner warning at the weekend IMF/World Bank meeting of the danger of a “catastrophic risk”, there was a sell-off from Manila to Mumbai with foreign investors leading the rush to the exits. The biggest victim was Bangkok, where shares plunged nearly 8 per cent.“Markets have moved well beyond Greece by now and are really focusing on the outlook for growth and the possible contagion into the banking sector,” Mark Konyn, the Hong Kong-based chief executive officer of fund manager RCM Asia Pacific told Bloomberg Television. “Confidence is continuing to drain.”The MSCI index for Asia Pacific excluding Japan was 3.5 percent down at 358.81, in its third day of declines. Aside from Thailand, other big drops were recorded in South Korea (-2.6 per cent), Jakarta (-6.0 per cent) Manila (-4.2 per cent), and Kuala Lumpur (-3.9 per cent). The Hang Seng was 3.6 per cent down in late trading and the Bombay Sensex 1.5 per cent lower.On the currency markets, the Indonesian rupiah lost 3.76 per cent against the US dollar, suffering the biggest losses of any major currency. The Korean won dropped 2.7 per cent, the Thai Baht 0.8 per cent and the Philippine peso 0.7 per cent.In Johannesburg, the rand was a full 2.8 per cent lower in early trading, takings its losses for the year against the US dollar to 26 per cent. In Europe, emerging markets had a torrid start just like their counterparts in developed financial centres. The Russian rouble lost 1.2 per cent against the dollar and Russian stocks were down 2.9 per cent, as measured by the Micex index. The Polish zloty 1.2 per cent against the euro and the WIG index opened 2.7 per cent down.Related reading

601;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-09-06T18:06:33Z;US banks lead Wall Street lower;;US bank stocks fell sharply on Tuesday – following the lead of their European counterparts 24 hours earlier – as renewed fears about eurozone sovereign debt hit investors’ confidence as they returned from a long Labor Day weekend.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 led the market lower, with bank shares down 1.8 per cent as the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,165.24.The broad index has now more than reversed the late August four-day rally, and is trading only 60 points above its year lows seen early last month.“There is no reason to think this ends anytime soon,” said Dan Greenhouse, chief strategist at BTIG, blaming European politicians for the falls in US equities.Morgan Stanley was the biggest faller among the big banks, off 4 per cent at $15.33. Citigroup fell 2.5 per cent to $27.70. Bank of America, the biggest faller in early trading, pared some losses to close down 3.6 per cent at $6.99.On top of bond market jitters about Italian sovereign debt, US banks had their own bad news to contend with, as federal lawsuits against big banks dominated US headlines over the holiday weekend. The possible settlement of one case concerning foreclosure practices was balanced by a new case announced on Friday over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran held out hope for bank stocks, predicting mortgage refinancing revenue “will be big in the second half of 2011”.In a note to clients Mr Foran argued that as many as 75 per cent of US mortgage holders have an incentive to refinance at current record low interest rates. “Capacity constraints and pricing power,” mean banks are better placed than customers to benefit, as they can charge customers interest rates higher than banks’ own cost of funding.Mr Foran upgraded Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp – up 1.4 per cent at $9.75 – from hold to buy, because of its large mortgage book.Mr Foran also said big mortgage originators, Wells Fargo – down 1.2 per cent to $23.92 – and Bank of America should receive temporary revenue boosts from refinancing.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said another refinancing spike, “would be helpful but not a game changer”.Even at the peak of the last refinancing spike in the fourth quarter of last year, mortgage refinancing revenue only accounted for 14 per cent of revenue at Wells Fargo and 11 per cent at Fifth Third.Credit Suisse recommended clients buy regional bank stocks, arguing low interest rates are already priced into their business models because most regional bank lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins compress over time, as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Analyst Craig Siegenthaler recommended buying Fifth Third, Zions and Synovus Financial.But Zions and Synovus both fell, down 1.2 per cent to $15.99 and 2.2 per cent to $1.31 respectively. Bellwether regional bank, Regions Financial was among the the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, down 5.8 per cent at $3.89.Consumer discretionary stocks fell 0.4 per cent, with Harley Davidson, down 2.4 per cent to $35.15, suffering after a survey of dealers by RBC Capital Markets found sales growth likely slowed in August.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4 per cent to $4.21.But consumer staples were also off 0.4 per cent, and utilities were down 0.6 per cent as defensive stocks fared badly too.Netflix shares rose 2.7 per cent to $218.77, after the company announced its Latin American customers will have access to Miramax content.Netflix shares are still down almost 10 per cent for the month after the breakdown, last week, of contract renewal talks with the cable network Starz.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500. Its shares rose 8.9 per cent to $27.77 after the company successfully concluded its 3 month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple InlandThe $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple shares rose 25 per cent to $30.85.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, underwriters of Dunkin’ Brands summer IPO, both initiated coverage of the donut and coffee chain owner. Goldman told clients to sell the stock. Morgan Stanley rated it hold. Analysts at both banks said the potential for earnings growth was already reflected in the share price.Dunkin shares rose 0.1 per cent to $27.02Energy stocks were down 1.1 per cent, but Sunoco was up 5.3 per cent at $38.03, after the chemical manufacturer decided to shut its last two petroleum refineries.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 0.9 per cent at 11,139.3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,473.83.
602;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-08-31T15:35:31Z;Citi: EM equities to recover – soon;;"One of the bigger bulls in emerging market equities has had to eat a bit of humble pie – or, as he puts it, reset the compass, in light of the precipitous drop in prices in the past month.But the experience has not persuaded Geoffrey Dennis, EM equity strategist at Citigroup, to abandon his underlying optimism. Quite the contrary – he sees the sell-off as a buying opportunity – predicting a 22 per cent gain from August 30 levels in the MSCI emerging markets index by the end of 2011 – and a 6.5 per cent increase over the year as a whole, as the chart below shows. That’s a brave call, for sure. But is it right?Dennis argues that the recent sell-off has unusual characteristics – which suggest that it’s not as bad a sell-off as it looks.First, during the height of the turmoil – July 22 to August 22 – EM equities tumbled by about the same as developed market equities – 16 per cent. So, this as he puts it, is “a global meltdown – no EM underperformance here”.Next, the EM equity correction has coincided, abnormally, with falling EM bond yields – so there has been no general flight from EMs as a whole. This is positive for EM equities, not least because the dividend yield/bond yield gap in EM has narrowed and in three countries – the Czech Republic, Poland and Taiwan – it has crossed over, with the implications that shares in these countries are particularly cheap.Also, EM currencies have held up well in the mayhem, falling only 2.7 per cent against the US dollar, as measured by a Citigroup proxy index. Dennis says: “As markets rebound, currency gains should bolster returns and favour domestic stocks.”Moreover, with growth in developed economies slowing and the Fed and other central banks signalling a further bout of easy monetary policy, EM rate hikes totalling “nearly 500 basis points” have been cancelled, which is good news for EM equities, says Dennis in his report.He concludes, this is all particularly good for consumer discretionary stocks, given the probability of low interest rates and of still-strong economic growth in emerging markets of around 6 per cent.This is all very well, but, given the high level of uncertainty in global financial markets right now, Dennis seems to be taking stability – particularly in the developed world – a bit too much for granted.First, the unusual nature of current world market conditions – which Dennis is right to highlight – is itself a cause for concern for many other observers. In particular, there are some doubts as to whether the current resilience of EM bonds will last. Another financial jolt from the developed world might trigger a full-blown flight for safety - a new twist in the agonies of the eurozone, for example, or another bout of uncertainty over the US fiscal/debt position.Next, while it is true that the pressures on EM central banks to raise rates have eased, they haven’t gone. India’s central bank has signalled that it may raise rates by another 25 basis points, possibly in September. In China, no less a person than prime minister Wen Jiaobao on Wednesday SAID China needed to bring down the pace of price increases. India’s inflation rate is 9.2 per cent; China’s 6.5 per cent. These are not small numbers.It follows that the scope for EM authorities to boost economic growth as happened in China in 2008-9 are limited this time. As John Plender wrote in the FT on Wednesday in a piece entitled ‘Don’t count on EMs coming to the rescue‘:Contributing substantially to global economic growth is not the same as imparting a demand boost to the world economy. In fact the emerging markets as a group are in surplus overall on the current account, which means they are a drag on global growth rather than a spur.Plender says:It is hard to escape the conclusion that expectations of the emerging markets have been pitched too high, while prospects for the debt-sodden developed world will remain mediocre for some time.Plender doesn’t address the question of equity valuations. But clearly if economic expectations for EMs are too high, hopes for EM equity market performance may also be.Dennis, in effect, argues that, following the sell-off, those hopes and expectations are no longer too high. But is he giving enough weight to the dangers of further eocnomic and finanical hurricanes in the developed world? beyondbrics doesn’t think so.Related reading

As part of the sale process, it had approached sovereign wealth funds and other investors in the Middle East and Asia, according to people familiar with the matter.Gaddafi’s family flees to Algeria
Algeria’s foreign ministry confirmed on Monday that Safia Gaddafi, wife of the embattled Libyan leader Muammer Gaddafi, had arrived on Algerian territory along with other family members, the FT reports. The presence of members of the Gaddafi family in Algeria could prove an embarassment to the authorities there, not least as domestic public opinion has long been uneasy about the government’s ambiguous stance towards the conflict in Libya.Automakers and tech shares lift Asia
Returning risk appetite boosted automakers and technology stocks in Asia after better-than-expected US consumer spending data and news of a bank merger discussion in Greece offered investors respite from a recent spate of bad news, the FT reports. The MSCI Asia Pacific index gained 1 per cent, rising for a fourth day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1.4 per cent, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.9 per cent and South Korea’s Kospi Composite gained 0.8 per cent.Brazil leads gains in Latin America
Latin American equities were stronger, led by gains in Brazil as traders were closely watching the results of a meeting of Banco Central do Brasil, the country’s central bank, the FT reports.The Brazilian government raised a key budget surplus target, indicating it would control spending while examining how and when to lower interest rates. The target for this year’s budget surplus was raised by 10bn reals ($6.3bn) to help cushion the blow of slowing economic recovery worldwide. Markets were watching the central bank’s decision later this week.Reserve Bank of India opening doors for corporates to enter banking industry The Reserve Bank of India laid down the broad rules of the game: finance companies can be converted into banks, and promoter groups with “sound credentials and integrity” and a 10-year record of successfully running their businesses can set up banks, the Economic Times reports. Such banks should have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 500 crore ($109m), run 25 per cent of their branches in rural unbanked regions, list within two years, and be owned by a separate holding company that cannot borrow money to float the bank.Pemex and Sacyr team up over Repsol
Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex and Spanish builder Sacyr-Vallehermosa are joining forces in an effort to increase their presence on the board of Repsol, Spain’s largest oil company.The move comes as Pemex said it would buy a 5 per cent stake in Repsol, worth about €1.1bn at current prices, on the open market this week, the FT reports. Sacyr owns a 20 per cent stake in Repsol and Pemex, the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, already owns a 5 per cent stake. Monday’s stock market close valued Repsol’s total equity at €22.24bn.Beijing to invest $1.25bn to block sand

Beijing will plant 53,333 hectares of forest in Zhangjiankou and Chendge, following a previous 135m yuan investment to plant 13,333 hectares of forest between 2009 and 2011 and forest conservation.Shockwaves ring as Cosco reneges on contracts
As China’s economy has boomed, shipowners have nursed nagging doubts about how long the country would willingly hand foreigners the vast sums many earned ferrying commodities from Australia and elsewhere, the FT reports. That nervousness has now been heightened after China’s Cosco reneged unilaterally on payments on many of its highest-priced contracts to charter ships, struck at the height of the market in mid-2008.Sina buys $66.4m stake in China’s Tudou to expand in online video
Sina, owner of China’s third- most popular website, paid $66.4m for a 9.05 per cent stake in Tudou Holdings, a video company that held an initial public offering in the U.S. this month, to expand, Bloomberg reports. Sina acquired 1.075m American depositary receipts of Tudou at the IPO, paying $31.2m, it said in a filing to the Securities and Exchanges Commission yesterday.Chinese tycoon seeks to buy tract of Iceland

Asian stocks started the week on a positive note as some banks and chipmakers gained ground, although the stronger yen weighed on Japanese exporters, the FT reports.
The MSCI Asia Pacific index was up 0.6 per cent at 120.98, rising for a third day, after investors took comfort from Ben Bernanke’s comments on Friday that the US Federal Reserve may do more to support the stalling US economy.Tiger Airways overhauls management in wake of ban
Singapore’s Tiger Airways on Monday announced a management shake-up in the wake of a financially disastrous flight ban in Australia, the FT reports.
The budget airline, part-owned by Singapore International Airlines, said Chin Yau Seng, a former SIA executive drafted in after the flight suspension, would take over permanently as chief executive from Tony Davis, who ran the company before moving to Melbourne to sort out the Australian problem in July.Tunisia: Gulf investor places a bet

Salam Kushrabi edged his way over the rubble of a fire station in Tripoli’s Abu Salim district on Sunday, moving from a room housing a large unexploded rocket into another where a charred body lay trapped under mangled concrete and metal, the FT reports. Although he said he was a rebel supporter, Mr Kushrabi was upset by the destruction in a building he claimed was used as a field hospital for Col Muammer Gaddafi’s many loyalists in the area. It was hit by a Nato bomb on Thursday.India’s Piramal eyes $1.5bn overseas deals
Piramal, the Indian conglomerate that recently invested $650m in Vodafone, plans to invest at least $1.5bn to expand aggressively its overseas pharmaceuticals business as it seeks to become the country’s first global drug developer, the FT reports. Ajay Piramal, chairman of the family-owned company, said that it planned to acquire several ailing midsized biotech companies and patents as well as enter joint ventures with big pharmaceutical groups that are struggling to develop new drugs in western markets because of rising costs.Sinopec net tops estimates on fuel production
China Petroleum & Chemical, Asia’s biggest refiner, posted record half-year profit that beat analysts’ estimates after it kept the cost of crude-oil purchases in check while increasing fuel production. Net income rose 12 per cent to 41.1bn yuan ($6.5bn), the company known as Sinopec said yesterday, Bloomberg reports.China set to challenge global wind industry
Altogether, Europe’s manufacturers account for 89 per cent of their own region; 32 per cent of the US and 37 per cent of the global market, says the European Wind Energy Association, the FT reports. But even in this stronghold of homegrown might, apprehension is growing about an emerging force in the global wind industry: China. Five years ago, there was not a single Chinese wind turbine maker among the world’s top 10 manufacturers. Now there are four: Sinovel, number two behind Vestas; Goldwind, Dongfang and United Power.Rice may rally 22 per cent on Thai buying
Rice may rally 22 per cent by yearend as Thailand, the world’s largest exporter, buys the grain from farmers at above-market rates, pushing up costs for importers and fanning global inflation even as economic growth slows, Bloomberg reports. The price of 100 per cent grade-B Thai rice, the regional benchmark, may rally to $750 per metric ton by Dec. 31, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of seven exporters, traders and millers conducted last week.China’s food chain lures private equity
Global private-equity firms, including Carlyle, Blackstone Group LP and 3i Group PLC, are increasingly looking to China’s food chain—from dining and food retailing to fishing—as the Chinese government seeks to consolidate the industry and improve food safety. Foreign private-equity groups invested $2.6bn last year in the country’s food and agriculture sectors, more than triple from a year earlier, according to Zero2IPO Group, a Beijing-based research firm that tracks China’s private-equity industry, the WSJ reports.European officials round on Lagarde
European officials rounded on Christine Lagarde on Sunday, accusing the managing director of the International Monetary Fund of making a “confused” and “misguided” attack on the health of Europe’s banks, the FT reports. Ms Lagarde, the former French finance minister who replaced Dominique Strauss-Kahn as head of the IMF in July, used her address at an annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to call for an “urgent” recapitalisation of Europe’s weakest lenders, saying that shoring up the banking system was key to cutting “chains of contagion” across the region.Global warming fears rise in developing world
Consumers in the developed world are becoming increasingly apathetic about global warming, while Latin Americans – who have suffered much from unusual weather patterns – are becoming more concerned, according to a survey, the FT reports. Nielsen’s global study of online consumers comes as scientists and politicians, among others, debate the role of global warming in the severity of Hurricane Irene, which lashed the American east coast over the weekend.Push for permits in Gulf of Mexico
Sixty per cent of rigs contracted in the Gulf of Mexico are not working almost a year and a half after the Macondo disaster, the FT reports.

605;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-08-18T14:13:35Z;[update] CEE: will the IMF have to help out again?;;"Another day, another bout of euro worries hitting central and eastern Europe. The region’s bourses are sharply down on Thursday – with the MSCI east Europe index falling 6.95 per cent, compared with a 4.98 per cent drop in western Europe.It’s a useful reminder of CEE’s continuing vulnerability and dependence on external capital and credit inflows. In the 2008-9 crisis, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund stepped in to fill the breach left by private financiers. In a timely report, Unicredit suggests they might have to help out again.While most CEE economies have fairly low levels of public debt – quite unlike the eurozone’s problem countries – they are suffering from investors’ general caution over Europe and from the knock-on effects of slowing economic growth in western Europe, notably Germany, as was revealed in GDP figures this week for Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania.Since the end of July, the MSCI east Europe index is down over 17 per cent, compared with a 12 per cent drop in the MSCI global emerging markets index. In local currency terms, Warsaw (see chart above) has seen the biggest drop of CEE’s larger boursse with a decline of nearly 17 per cent. These are big losses, with evidence of plenty of indiscriminate selling in the general flight to safety.Unicredit looked at five countries which turned to EU/IMF rescue programmes in 2008-9 – Hungary, Ukraine, Latvia, Serbia and Romania. It says bluntly that while all these countries have done well with their economic restructuring, the international outlook makes the future decidely tricky:Recent weeks have seen a considerable increase in uncertainty surrounding the outlook for global economic activity and capital flows. Most of the above countries have managed to register impressive improvements in their external and fiscal accounts from a flow perspective but it is uncertain in this current environment if this is sufficient to guarantee market access at viable financing costs consistently over the coming quarters.Unicredit points out that while the five countries have benefits from disbursements totalling a chunky €46.9bn since 2008, they will soon have to start repaying these loans.Hungary kick starts this process with an EUR 2.0bn repayment to the EU in 4Q this year, with IMF repayments next year totalling EUR 3.6bn
next year. By 3Q next year, all 5 countries will have begun repayment, representing an outflow from the region of EUR 8.2bn next year, followed by EUR 14.2bn in 2012. Ukraine is scheduled to repay a total of EUR 2.5bn over the course of next year, Romania EUR 1.5bn. Serbia, having only drawn partial payments from its program, must repay a manageable EUR 0.2bn next year, Latvia EUR 0.3bn.This chart paints the picture with the flows turning negative over the next few quarters:Serbia and Hungary have now finished their programmes. Romania had the good sense this April to set up a precautionary €5bn EU/IMF stand-by arrangement. Latvia’s programme is scheduled to expire at the end of this year – so it could do the same.Ukraine is in a much harder position with a programme that is still in place but suspended for lack of progress on economic reform. IMF-friendly reforms would bring Kiev a net €1.7bn next year.Latvia, which has elections next month, could go back to the EU/IMF for more support. Serbia would fine this more difficult, says Unicredit, as it has decentralised some funds from the central government to local authorities in a way the IMF criticised. But Belgrade’s repayments are modest.The biggest questions hang over Hungary. Viktor Orban, prime minister, has pubicly broken with the IMF, declaring last year that Budapest didn’t need any more support. But as Unicredit says, that leaves him at the market’s tender mercies since repayment to the EU/IMF will have to be financed from the markets and will last until 2015.Not for the first time, there could be tensions between Orban and his international partners.Unfortunately for CEE leaders – or perhaps fortunately – the critical developments will come in western Europe, particularly in the eurozone. If the eurozone meets its challenges and devises credible refinancing and recovery plans for its weaker members, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, then CEE economies will benefit.For now, investors are decidely negative. But in a report on Thursday Willem Buiter, Citigroup’s chief economist, takes a different view. He says:This note argues that both the sovereign crises and the banking crises can and will be managed and that market concerns are overblown. We take the contrarian view that while the path to the end-state could be choppy, the current crises will in the end result in a stronger EU and Euro area.It’s not the first time the outspoken Buiter has challenged the majority opinion. There will be many European policymakers hoping that on this occasion he’s right.Related reading

Hot on the heels of the bad GDP numbers from Germany comes evidence of economic slow down in central Europe. On Tuesday, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania all reported slower GDP growth in the second quarter, due in large measure to the disappointing performance announced earlier in the day by Germany, central Europe’s biggest trading partner, the beyondbrics reports.Uncertainty plagues RIM in India
Multinationals hate unpleasant surprises and operating in a permanent state of uncertainty.

In July last year the Indian government warned that it would block BlackBerry services, unless RIM gave the security authorities full access to data transferred by the messaging system.Growth worries weigh on commodities prices
Commodities markets focused on risk again following weak economic figures from Germany, with gold gaining ground and concerns about global growth hitting oil and industrial metal prices, the FT reports. Weaker than expected second-quarter growth data from Germany – which has so far been the engine of Europe’s recovery – gave rise to worries about the eurozone’s prospects as well as adding to fears of a global slowdown.Tech shares lift Asian markets

India’s inflation eased slightly in July compared with the previous month, which may prompt the central bank to pause its aggressive monetary policy as it tames record high prices, the FT reports. Wholesale prices in Asia’s third-largest economy rose 9.22 per cent in July, down from 9.44 per cent in June, and significantly lower than a year ago when inflation was a whisker away from double-digit levels at 9.98 per cent.China official paper calls for widening of yuan

Emerging-market stocks rose the most in a month after U.S. retail sales posted the biggest increase in four months and Morgan Stanley lifted its allocation for developing equities to the highest level since April 2009, Bloomberg reports.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index increased 1.3 percent to 1,002.77 as of 2:54 p.m. Singapore time, set for its largest increase since July 13. The gauge is rebounding from three weeks of losses after Standard & Poor’s cut the U.S. credit rating and concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis may spread. Taiwan’s Taiex Index jumped 2.4 percent and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rallied 3.8 percent, set for its biggest advance since June 2010.China’s Dalian Fujia plant runs normally despite shutdown order
China’s privately-run Dalian Fujia Petrochemical Co Ltd is operating its 700,000-tonne-per-year paraxylene plant normally despite a local government order on Sunday to close the plant due to a toxic spill scare, an industry source said on Monday, Reuters reports. The plant, one of the country’s leading importers of naphtha, is carrying on normal shipments of naphtha from regular suppliers such as Iran and Papua New Guinea, according to the source.AirAsia owner nears deal for QPR
Tony Fernandes, Malaysian airline entrepreneur, is poised to take majority control of Queens Park Rangers, the English Premiership football club, as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the transaction, the FT reports.
Mr Fernandes, owner of the low-cost airline AirAsia, is close to finalising a deal where he will buy a 51 per cent stake in the newly promoted West London club from Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One motor racing chief.Economic vulnerability mars Singh’s record
When Manmohan Singh tops the battlements of Delhi’s Red Fort on Monday to deliver India’s independence day address, many expect him to lament the high-profile corruption scandals that beset his administration, the FT reports.
One columnist, Kiran Bedi, a former senior police officer, has dared the prime minister to seek “redemption” from his country’s 1.2bn people. Another urges him to declare personal disappointment in scandals that have mired the telecoms industry, the Commonwealth Games and the top brass of the military.China mulls return to Benghazi projects
In the western outskirts of Benghazi, hundreds of five-storey, half-built buildings are spread along the road towards the Libyan frontline in Brega, the FT reports.
The west Benghazi project for 20,000 housing units is now under rebel guard, the walls surrounding the vast scheme sprawled with anti-Gaddafi graffiti.Risk assets draw buyers as summer storm abates
The summer storm that has buffeted markets so savagely since the start of August looks to have blown itself out, with most risk assets attracting buyers, the FT reports. The FTSE All-World equity index is up 0.5 per cent and commodities are stronger, with copper up 1 per cent to $4.05 a pound. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is forecast to start the session by advancing more than 0.5 per cent.Central banks polish gold’s shine
The system of fiat money is 40 years old today. And quite frankly, it is looking its age. The Bretton Woods system under which fixed exchange rates were linked to the gold price gave way to the current monetary system, in which currencies are backed by fiat, or trust, four decades ago, the FT reports.Caterpillar builds on solid China foundation
When Caterpillar, the world’s largest producer of earth-moving equipment, opened its first joint venture in China in 1994, the country was still among the poorest in the world in terms of gross domestic product per capita, and bicycles, not cars, dominated the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. Fast forward to today, when China is the world’s biggest market for machinery, accounting for about 9 per cent of Caterpillar’s annual revenues, the FT reports.South Korea seeks to safeguard its SMEs
Bahk Jae-wan, South Korea’s finance minister, played to the cameras as he flitted between the colourful stalls of Sooyu market in Seoul last month. Having bought some rashers of pork belly, he logged onto his Facebook page and appealed to his fellow Koreans: “Why not visit a traditional market?”
“Reviving markets for 360,000 merchants at small and medium-sized enterprises is a top policy priority,” said the shirt-sleeved minister, who posed among the pumpkins and cabbages, the FT reports.Emerging Markets

Emerging-market stocks rose the most in a month after U.S. retail sales posted the biggest increase in four months and Morgan Stanley lifted its allocation for developing equities to the highest level since April 2009, Bloomberg reports.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index increased 1.3 percent to 1,002.77 as of 2:54 p.m. Singapore time, set for its largest increase since July 13. The gauge is rebounding from three weeks of losses after Standard & Poor’s cut the U.S. credit rating and concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis may spread. Taiwan’s Taiex Index jumped 2.4 percent and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rallied 3.8 percent, set for its biggest advance since June 2010.Protests force Chinese factory to close
Chinese authorities ordered a petrochemical factory to close on Sunday after more than 12,000 demonstrators confronted riot police, demanding the plant’s relocation over health fears, the FT reports.
Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, mostly young people, in the public square in front of the municipal government offices in Dalian, Liaoning province, but Chinese state media gave no reports of injuries.AirAsia owner nears deal for QPR
Tony Fernandes, Malaysian airline entrepreneur, is poised to take majority control of Queens Park Rangers, the English Premiership football club, as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the transaction, the FT reports.
Mr Fernandes, owner of the low-cost airline AirAsia, is close to finalising a deal where he will buy a 51 per cent stake in the newly promoted West London club from Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One motor racing chief.Economic vulnerability mars Singh’s record
When Manmohan Singh tops the battlements of Delhi’s Red Fort on Monday to deliver India’s independence day address, many expect him to lament the high-profile corruption scandals that beset his administration, the FT reports.
One columnist, Kiran Bedi, a former senior police officer, has dared the prime minister to seek “redemption” from his country’s 1.2bn people. Another urges him to declare personal disappointment in scandals that have mired the telecoms industry, the Commonwealth Games and the top brass of the military.China mulls return to Benghazi projects
In the western outskirts of Benghazi, hundreds of five-storey, half-built buildings are spread along the road towards the Libyan frontline in Brega, the FT reports.
The west Benghazi project for 20,000 housing units is now under rebel guard, the walls surrounding the vast scheme sprawled with anti-Gaddafi graffiti.Libyan rebels advance on Zawiyah
Libyan rebels advanced north to within 25km (15 miles) of the coastal city of Zawiyah west of Tripoli on Saturday, after a six-hour battle which pushed the front line to its closest point to the capital since the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi began in February, Reuters reports.
They hope to capture Zawiyah and cut off Gaddafi’s stronghold in the capital from access to the outside world along the coast road.Risk assets draw buyers as summer storm abates
The summer storm that has buffeted markets so savagely since the start of August looks to have blown itself out, with most risk assets attracting buyers, the FT reports.
The FTSE All-World equity index is up 0.5 per cent and commodities are stronger, with copper up 1 per cent to $4.05 a pound. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is forecast to start the session by advancing more than 0.5 per cent.Gold Drops for Third Straight Day
Gold declined for a third day, set for the worst run in seven weeks, as concern eased that the global economy is stalling, boosting global equities and cutting demand for haven investments, Bloomberg reports.
Spot bullion lost 0.5 percent to $1,738.88 an ounce at 2:43 p.m. in Singapore, after shedding as much as 1.1 percent. Gold, which reached a record $1,814.95 on Aug. 11, is still 22 percent higher this year on debt woes in Europe and the U.S. The metal in Swiss francs rose to this year’s high of 1,390.91 today.Caterpillar builds on solid China foundation
When Caterpillar, the world’s largest producer of earth-moving equipment, opened its first joint venture in China in 1994, the country was still among the poorest in the world in terms of gross domestic product per capita, and bicycles, not cars, dominated the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. Fast forward to today, when China is the world’s biggest market for machinery, accounting for about 9 per cent of Caterpillar’s annual revenues, the FT reports.South Korea seeks to safeguard its SMEs
Bahk Jae-wan, South Korea’s finance minister, played to the cameras as he flitted between the colourful stalls of Sooyu market in Seoul last month. Having bought some rashers of pork belly, he logged onto his Facebook page and appealed to his fellow Koreans: “Why not visit a traditional market?”
“Reviving markets for 360,000 merchants at small and medium-sized enterprises is a top policy priority,” said the shirt-sleeved minister, who posed among the pumpkins and cabbages, the FT reports.Emerging Markets

Asian stocks tumbled as fears rose that the global economy may be heading for a recession with the European debt crisis spreading and the US economy slowing, enduring a heavy sell-off as investors shun risk after global central bankers failed to stem fears of rapidly slowing growth, the FT reports. Following the biggest decline since the financial crisis for both the S&P 500 index and US Treasury yields, the MSCI Asia Pacific index dropped 3.8 per cent, down more than 10 per cent from its May peak. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged 3.8 per cent to its lowest levels in more than four months. South Korea’s Kospi Composite index fell 3.5 per cent, plumbing its lowest intraday levels since March. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 declined 3.8 per cent to a two-year low.ICBC to buy 80% of Standard’s Argentine arm
China’s ICBC has agreed to buy 80 per cent of the Argentine operations of South Africa’s Standard Bank for $600m, according to people familiar with the plans, the FT reports. The deal is the most high-profile move by a Chinese bank into Latin America, a resource rich key trading partner, and is set to be announced after Jiang Jianqing, ICBC chairman, meets Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, on Thursday.Investec to split Evolution if bid succeeds
Investec would move to break up the stockbroking and wealth management arms of Evolution Group were the South African bank successful in its bid for the UK stockbroker, the FT reports. According to people familiar with Investec’s thinking, the company is primarily interested in Evolution’s private clients operations, Williams de Broë, and would be likely to “spit out the unwanted bits of the business”. Investec is understood to be keen to merge Williams de Broë, which reported assets under management of £5.8bn at the end of December, with its own private clients division, which has assets under management of £30bn.Moser Baer to list solar unit in 2012
Moser Baer plans to list its solar power unit Moser Baer Clean Energy in the next financial year to raise funds for its solar power projects, the WSJ reports. “We are operating different energy verticals,” said Moser Baer Chairman Ratul Puri on Thursday. “We are basically planning to tap the potential of the renewable energy segment.” He said the company plans to set up about 400 megawatt of solar power projects in the current financial year, which is expected to cost about 60bn rupees ($1.3bn). In January, SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Management said it would invest $129m in a thermal power unit of Moser Baer in a bid to benefit from the massive capacity additions in India’s rapidly growing energy sector.China to take shot at aircraft duopoly
China will make aircraft manufacturing a cornerstone of its “new strategic industry” plan, an upgrade in status that will lock in long-term government support for the nation’s fledgling rivals to Boeing and Airbus, the FT reports. The move is troubling for the world’s two biggest aircraft makers, which have been bracing themselves for increased competition from emerging rivals. “The days of the duopoly with Airbus are over,” Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing’s civil aircraft division, said at the Paris Air Show in June.China income is growing faster than CPI: Experts
The, income of urban and rural residents in China’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities grew faster than consumer prices in the first half of this year, China Daily reports. According to the report, 29 of 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities reported that their resident’ income grew more than 10 percent from a year ago, while according to statistics released by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), consumer price index, the main gauge of inflation, increased by 5.4 percent year-on-year. “Actually, Chinese residents’ real income is higher than statistical results,” said Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center.Indonesia banks fear results of proposed rules
Indonesia is considering a dramatic change in the regulatory landscape, this time in finance, the FT reports. If adopted, the measures are likely to lead to unintended consequences and only partial implementation. The regulation, which Bank Indonesia officials said was still “a work in progress” with no fixed implementation date, would force its banks’ majority shareholders – whether local or foreign – to sell down their holdings, although state banks would be exempt.Tehran bourse moves towards options launch
Iran’s bourse plans to expand its fledgling derivatives market by launching options in the coming months despite the cold shoulder traders have given to single stock futures, the FT reports. Tehran Stock Exchange, whose operations are limited mostly to stocks, warrants and bonds, introduced single stock futures in July 2010 to help diversify, vowing to add options and stock index futures as next steps in the development of the country’s capital markets. Bourse officials have promised to launch the options by October but market analysts say the introduction could be delayed to the end of this year.Qatar plans $1.1bn sale of treasury bills
Qatar plans to sell 4bn riyals ($1.1bn) of treasury bills next week as the central bank seeks to set a benchmark for debt sales and soak up excess cash from local lenders, Bloomberg reports. “The objective of this is to manage liquidity and also to build our sovereign yield curve,” Central Bank Governor Abdullah bin Saud Al-Thani said in a telephone interview today. The three-month T-bills will be sold on Aug. 8 and will be split equally between Islamic and non-Islamic securities, Al- Thani said. Qatar has issued 10 billion riyals of T-bills of different maturities on a monthly basis this year, the governor said. The Aug. 8 issuance will be the fourth.Emerging Markets

611;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-08-05T00:49:56Z;EM equity investors: tin hat time;;"It’s tin hat time for emerging markets investors. For all the talk about EM markets decoupling from the turmoil in the US and Europe, Thursday’s market rout showed that EM equities are no safe haven.EM stocks had their worst day in more than a year as deepening concerns over the European debt crisis and dimming prospects of an economic recovery in the US prompted equity investors to head for the exit across the globe. The MSCI All-Country World Index, a measure of stocks in developed and emerging markets, slid 4.1 percent to 311.6, falling 13 per cent from an early May high. Within this, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 2.6 per cent, driving the losses further down to 11 per cent from this year’s high in early May.“There’s been a worsening in the international situation, which has reached markets around the world, including here in Brazil,” Brazil’s finance minister, Guido Mantega, was quoted by Reuters as saying.“This reflects the weakening in the US and the European situation, which isn’t being solved.”In its worst one-day performance since February 2010, the MSCI Latin America stock index sank 5.3 per cent – taking its losses to 10 per cent this week. Argentina’s Merval led the plunge, falling 6 per cent to 3109.89, followed by Brazil’s Bovespa , which fell 5.7 per cent to 52,833.69 to hit a two-year low.Also in negative territory around the region were Mexico’s IPC index – down 3.4 per cent to 33,307.60 – and Chile’s benchmark IPSA was down 3.9 per cent to 4143.73 - the most since October 2008.“We are in the first phase of an adjustment related to concern about Italian debt sustainability and weak US growth,” Enrique Alvarez, Latin America analyst with IdeaGlobal in New York told Reuters. “People are selling Latin American assets to cover losses elsewhere.”And it’s not just LatAm stocks that are taking a pounding. In Russia, the benchmark Micex index closed down 2.1 per cent, trading at the lowest levels since late June, while the rouble weakened due to falling oil prices.Asian equity markets, which were closed by the time the global market rout gained momentum, are likely to be hit when they open on Friday. On Thursday, Taiwan’s Taiex Index closed down 1.7 per cent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ shares fell 1 per cent. South Korea’s Kospi Index was down 2.3 per cent, completing its biggest three-day sell-off since November 2008.“The Latin American markets are more commodity-based that the Asian ones, but the issue of global growth affect them both,” Pablo Goldberg, head of emerging markets research at HSBC, told beyondbrics.“Emerging markets stocks have not been great throughout the year and everything goes back to global growth: we need signs that economies are re-accelerating before investors will feel more comfortable with equities,” he added.Translation: Don’t put those tin hats away yet.Related reading:

612;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-08-01T17:22:59Z;EM back on the block…?;;"Asian and European markets woke up on Monday to the news that a US debt ceiling deal had been struck and stocks around the globe picked themselves up after being knocked down pretty hard last week. July was a rough month: a eurozone default became increasingly imminent and an American one suddenly possible.But while developed markets were off in July, emerging markets managed a small gain – further evidence, surely, of EM’s new safe haven status? Not necessarily.Developed markets dropped 1.8 per cent in the month. Emerging markets rose 0.7 per cent, according to data from S&P.But does this signify a turnaround for emerging markets, where equities are down 2.9 per cent year-to-date – unlike developed markets, which are up 2.3 per cent? That depends on who you talk to.It is said that even a dead cat will bounce if it’s dropped from a high enough place. And Monday’s rally in Europe – triggered by a last-minute agreement in Washington for a debt ceiling deal ahead of the August 2 deadline – were just that.Concerns over US growth prospects – US manufacturing data released on Monday were lower that expected – have already overshadow news of a debt deal. The bigger question now is whether ratings agencies like S&P will cut America’s credit rating and what the future may hold for the euro. As Chris Weafer, strategist at ING wrote in a note, market optimism in the short term “will be more of a ‘the patient didn’t die but remains in critical care.’”Emerging markets similarly reacted to the news on Monday with ebullience, and MSCI indices across the EM world rose; the main EM index was up 1.3 per cent, Asia ex Pacific 1.7 per cent, emerging East Europe 1.5 per cent.However, unlike developed markets, the EM rally appears to be more than just a dead cat bounce.Nick Chamie, the global head of emerging markets at RBC told beyondbrics that the bank is expecting emerging market performance to pick up later this year.He said, “In our view the peak of EM inflation in next two to three months will prove to be a nice tailwind for EM.”Howard Silverblatt, senior analyst at S&P, thinks it’s too early to call EM equities’ performance in July a turnaround.“We don’t see a huge turnaround” he told beyondbrics. “Investing in EM is not that easy, [though we've] come a long way and its easier on the institutional side… There isn’t that much buying happening, but you are seeing a lot of reallocations, ” he said.Alan Conway, head of emerging market equities at Schroders noted that EM watchers should remember that emerging markets are still very much beholden to events in developed markets.“The thing that undermines the EM story is developments in the developed world”, Conway told beyondbrics. But even Conway maintains prudently bullish on emerging markets and believes that EM will outperform DM for the full year, barring a risk-off scenario, or overly optimistic projections on inflation.Related reading:

613;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-07-21T08:55:09Z;China: slowing slowly but IMF warns of hard landing risks;;"Chinese stocks slipped on Thursday on further evidence of a deepening slow down in the Chinese economy, with the publication of early data for July showing a widely-watched index turning negative for the first time in a year.HSBC’s flash estimate purchasing managers’ index dropped to 48.9, a fall of 1.2 percentage points and the first drop below the neutral 50 level since July 2010. It doesn’t signal a hard landing but it suggests Beijing’s drive to cool an over-heated economy is starting to bite.HSBC said:Production growth slowed largely because of cooler domestic demand. The new orders sub-index contracted (marginally) for the first time since July 2010, printing 49.5 in July (vs. 50.4 in June). The new exports orders sub-index improved slightly from previously, but stayed below 50 for the third straight month at 48.4 (June: 46.7). Together, both readings suggest that new business flows are slowing not only because of weakness in external but also domestic demand. The latter can be attributed to the continued filtering through of Beijing’s tightening measures.But don’t worry, says the bank:Does the below-50 reading of PMI (if confirmed in the final PMI result due on 1 August) imply a hard landing for China? No, because as history’s shown before (e.g. July 2010 when the PMI printed 49.4), a marginally below 50-reading is still fully supportive of an industrial production growth rate of around 13 per cent.The Shanghai Composite closed 1 per cent down on the day, which is hardly dramatic. The MSCI index of Asia minus Japan was later trading 0.8 per cent lower. So investors have clearly noted the figures but taken them in their stride.Economic policymakers may think differently. An International Monetary Fund report published on Wednesday says China’s growing economic power means its capacity to cause global economic shocks has risen.As Reuters reported, China’s big trading partners worry about the risk of a “hard landing” that could spread damage around the world.In its first China “spillover” report, examining how domestic policies in big economies affect the rest of the world, the Fund said allowing the yuan currency to rise more rapidly was important for stability.But a stronger yuan on its own would yield only limited benefits to the rest of the world, the IMF said, so it must be accompanied by reforms to promote domestic demand, especially steps to cut household and corporate saving rates.The IMF said:Failure to rebalance the growth model would imply unprecedented
increases in export market share, potential overhang in capacity, and adverse spillovers from resulting stresses on corporate and bank balance sheets.The IMF asked China’s key trading partners — the United States, Europe and Japan — about their concerns regarding China’s domestic policies. Sustainability of China’s rapid growth was the first issue. “The concern is that overheating in China could put added pressure on commodity prices and draw short-term capital to the region,” the IMF said in its report.The partners also worried that continued high investment in China could create excess capacity. Given uncertain demand prospects in advanced economies, that could risk “a hard landing that reverberates beyond China.”The Fund shows particular concern about excess savings pushing excess investment:Excess savings depress real interest rates, reinforce savings behavior (a low return requires more saving in order to reach a targeted balance; see China 2011 Article IV Staff Report, Box 9), and encourages investment in capacity creation—capacity that is used to meet foreign demand at an attractive real exchange rate and low input prices. [The figure below] illustrates the total effect of distortions on the cost of capital, which in China has risen over time and helped keep capital costs low, thus spurring investment.This is not the world’s clearest chart. But the general message is obvious – Chinese companies’ cost of capital is much cheaper even than that of their rivals in other Asian economies with artificially high savings rates. And it is getting cheaper.(The other S5 economies are those that that, along with China, are examined for spillover effects – the US, the eurozone, Japan, and the UK).The report doesn’t deal with what may or may not happen tomorrow or the day after. But its long-term perspective highlights the fundamental economic problem of today – global imbalances.Related reading

614;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;IPOs: pausing for breath;;"What goes up, must come down – at least a bit. And so it is with initial public offerings.After a bumper 2010 in which issuers in Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), India, South Korea and Russia raised a combined $153.7bn – or more than twice the $74.4bn raised in 2009 - the dash for new share issues from emerging markets appears to be losing steam.Even as the overall volume of global IPO climbed 14 per cent during the first half of the year to hit $114bn, the amount raised from these emerging markets was largely flat at $51.3bn, compared to $50.6bn the year before, according to data from Thomson Reuters.Within this, India and South Korea were the biggest losers. Indian companies, having raised $2.1bn through 27 issues during the first half of last year, only managed to raise $760m through 19 issues during the first six months of this year.The drop was even more pronounced in South Korea, which saw the amounts raised from new issues fall from $7bn in H1 of last year to $2.4bn this year.Contrast this with the US, where new issues rose from $8.4bn during the first half of last year to $23.9bn during the first six months of this year and the obvious question is what happened?From Edemir Pinto, Brazil’s stock exchange chief, who boldly declared that Brazilian IPOs will raise more than 55bn reals ($35bn) for the whole of 2011, to VTB Capital, which forecasted that Russian listings would hit $15bn-$20bn, the view at the start of the year was that 2011 was going to be another bumper year for emerging market IPOs.“If things keep the same pace, we’ll have the greatest volume of IPOs in our history”, Pinto told the Brazilian magazine Exame, in January.Yet six months on, with the exception of Hong Kong – which in spite of a slew of cancelled IPOs, saw new issues jumps from $826m in H1 2010 to $8.7bn in H1 2011 – the surge that many were predicting has failed to materialise.Brazilian companies have so far raised $4.3bn via 10 issues, while Russian companies have bought in $2.1bn. (This compares with the $4.1bn and $2.7bn raised in H1 last year.)In some ways, the slowdown in the growth of new EM issues should not come as a surprise.Inflation is sending interest rates up and share prices down in many of these countries. The MSCI index is up 1.9 per cent in the year to date compared with the 7.6 per cent rise in the S&P 500.This in turn is prompting companies to cancel or scale back sales.“IPO markets do well when risk-taking is on the rise and economies are going through a period of strong growth,” said Masha Gordon, head of emerging market equities at PIMCO. “At the moment, we have skittish markets and uncertainty about the outcome of mid-cycle rebalancing in emerging economies. Naturally, investors are more selective”Concurrently, valuations for new issues have gotten too punchy for some investors’ liking while the relatively lacklustre performance of some recently listed companies have dented interest in new floats.“Why go for new issues, particularly if the companies are neither remarkable nor cheap, when the MSCI EM index has a forward P/E of 10 times and we see plenty of value in listed stocks?,” said Gordon.Not everyone shares this view however. Maria Pinelli, Ernst & Young’s Global Vice Chair of strategic growth markets remains bullish on the IPO market in emerging countries this year.“There’s a lot of pent up capital out there waiting to be deployed,” she said. “Private equities and institutional investors – they all have quite a lot of room in their portfolio and are looking for companies to sponsor.”But will they put it in equities and more specifically, new issues though? While emerging markets have lost none of their “safe haven” status, investors seemed to be looking to get exposure in other ways. Data released by EPFR, the Boston-based fund tracker in recent weeks showed that investors are fleeing the equity market in favour of bonds. And as beyondbrics noted elsewhere, EM bond markets are on a tear at the moment, with amounts raised by dollar-denominated and local currency bonds in Asia during the first six months of the year both hitting new highs.That said, investors are fickle creatures. With another six months to go, EM IPO bulls may be proved right yet.Related reading:

This cleared the way for a deal on a second bail out plan to avoid a crippling default.Nigel Rendell, senior emerging markets strategist at RBC Capital Markets, told beyondbrics: “Lots of people who got out of emerging markets over the past few weeks have bought back in. People don’t want to be left on the sidelines – but for how long is anyone’s guess.”Despite this recent rally, the index is still down 0.4 per cent this year. In the same period, the MSCI index of developed county stocks has risen 4 per cent.
616;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-06-22T15:02:30Z;The Gulf: magnanimous MSCI;;"Investors had expected that MSCI, the index provider, would spurn the UAE and Qatar’s attempts to have their bourses bumped up from frontier to emerging market classification.But they were pleasantly surprised at how softly MSCI let them down.The index provider said in its announcement late Tuesday that it would review the markets’ status in December— pleasing investors who had expected the countries to be rejected this time and not reconsidered until MSCI’s annual review next year. Citi analysts noted:This is an unusual step for MSCI, and in our view suggests that promotion is highly likely to occur at that point.The countries are keen to be included in the index because it would draw in money from global emerging market funds that control more than $450bn of assets.The biggest question is now whether Qatar will lift limits of foreign ownership of key companies, a move analysts think unlikely but which MSCI has identified as important for Qatar to qualify for EM classification.Qatar—seen initially as a major driver behind the effort to upgrade the region’s markets—took many by surprise when the chairman of the exchange said in May that it would retain its strict ownership caps.Reconsidering that decision would require the support both of the companies and political authorities, analysts say. Opening key companies, in particular the conglomerate Industries Qatar, to increased foreign ownership can be politically sensitive because of their important role domestically. Fahd Iqbal an equity strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai says:It’s understandable that the Qatar would be hesitant on IQ in particular because it’s one of the few countries in the world where one of your crown jewels is available for foreign investors to own stakes in.Markets had reacted tepidly to the silver-lined rejection, suggesting rejection had been priced in. Abu Dhabi closed flat at 2732.54 as did Qatar at 8217.42, while The Dubai Financial Market fell 1.8% to 1549.61.MSCI said it would revisit the UAE and Qatari exchanges again in December in order to give market participants a bit more time to test a new settlement systems – known as DvP – introduced only a few weeks ago.Mahdi Mattar, head of research with CAPM Investment, says that “if there are no issues with the DvP, then it’s automatic [for the UAE] in December.” But on Qatar, he says, “I’m slightly pessimistic.”Related reading:

Indian stocks with strong political links – defined as those with direct political involvement or ones that are dependent upon a government licence – have underperformed the broader Indian market by 14 per cent over the past year, according to research from Ambit Capital, a Mumbai-based brokerage. The sharp fall in investor sentiment among as many as 75 politically influential companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange follows scandals involving a possible $39bn public loss from an auction of 2G mobile telecom licences and the mismanagement of Commonwealth Games contracts.PetroChina shale gas talks collapse
PetroChina and Calgary-based Encana have abandoned plans for a joint venture to develop a large shale gas deposit in western Canada, marking the latest in a series of retreats by Chinese companies from proposed natural resource deals overseas, the FT reports. PetroChina’s investment, set at $5.4bn when the deal was unveiled in February, would have been China’s biggest investment in Canada’s energy sector. It would also have been its largest in shale gas, a type of natural gas deposit that is difficult to extract and for which Chinese companies want to master the technology.World Bank in push for food price hedging
The World Bank is taking the rare step of encouraging companies in developing countries to buy insurance in the derivatives markets against sudden changes in food prices with a deal that should allow them to hedge $4bn worth of commodities, the FT reports. The deal, struck with investment bank JPMorgan, comes as countries such as China and India weather a second surge in agricultural commodities prices following the 2007-08 food crisis.MSCI delays decision on upgrading UAE, Qatar to Emerging-Market status
MSCI, whose stock indexes are tracked by investors with about $3,000bn in assets, delayed until December its decision on whether to raise the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to emerging-market status, Bloomberg reports. South Korea and Taiwan failed to win the developed-market designation from MSCI, which currently considers them emerging markets, according to a statement yesterday. The two countries, Asia’s biggest developing stock markets after China and India, will be evaluated again for a shift in 2012.Croatia warned on joining the EUCroatia’s bid to join the European Union will be delayed or derailed entirely if it fails to live up to promises the country made during accession negotiations, several EU member states have warned, the FT reports. Member states are expected to approve a declaration on Friday that would welcome the former Yugoslav country into their ranks in July 2013, depending on each state’s ratification in the meantime.Mexico captures ‘La Familia’ drug boss
Mexican authorities on Tuesday claimed to have dealt a fatal blow to one of the country’s most infamous drug cartels following the arrest of its suspected leader, the FT reports. José de Jesús Méndez Vargas, known as El chango or “The Monkey Méndez” was detained at a federal roadblock in Aguascalientes, in Central Mexico. It is understood that no shots were fired – though there were few other details.Over 120 Indian companies sets up Singapore office a month
As many as 120 India-based companies are incorporating offices in Singapore every month, taking advantage of the city state as a gateway to Asia-Pacific markets, the Economic Times reports. Speaking at the launch of the annual corporate awards campaign for Indian businesses in Singapore, R Narayanamohan, the chairman of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) said the community of Indian businesses has grown to 5,000 in Singapore as of this month, up from 4,000 a year ago. Indian companies make up the single largest business community from any single country in Singapore.Fernández to run for re-election in Argentina
Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, has announced that she will seek a second term in office, ending months of speculation and setting the scene for an October election against a divided opposition, the FT reports. “I always knew what I had to do, what my duty was,” she said in a message broadcast on national television from the presidential palace on Tuesday. Ms Fernández evoked the memory of Néstor Kirchner, her husband and predecessor as president who died in October, to explain her decision to run.Chile hydroelectric power plant on hold
A fiercely contested project to dam two pristine rivers in southern Chile and build five hydroelectric power plants in the glacier-carved Patagonian wilderness has been temporarily put on hold by an appeals court ruling, the FT reports. The appeals court in the southern city of Puerto Montt this week granted three injunctions brought by environmentalists against the May 9 approval of an environmental impact plan for the HidroAysén power project, which is owned by the companies Endesa and Colbún.Emerging Markets

618;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Why MSCI said “No”;;"Sure enough, MSCI held fire on S Korea and Taiwan, deciding not to upgrade them from emerging to developed market status in its annual review of country classifications.Here’s their explanation as to why.Accessibility issues in both markets, in particular the lack of full currency convertibility, including the absence of active offshore currency markets, and issues linked to the rigidity of the ID systems, remain unchanged from the view of international institutional investors.In Korea, MSCI notes that some measures have been put in place in an attempt to alleviate frictions and inefficiencies resulting from the lack of full currency convertibility and the ID system. Examples are the revision of the Banking Act to provide foreign investors additional funding options for securities settlement purposes, the adjustment of currency market settlement timing, the use of lead IRC accounts for block trading and the endorsement of an in‐ kind transfer principle.However, feedback from investors indicated that their actual experience has seen limited improvement as administrative constraints attached to these measures make them of limited effectiveness in practice. In addition, anti‐competitive practices have not been eliminated: the provision of stock market data continues to be subject to contractual anti‐ competitive clauses.On a positive note for Taiwan, pre‐funding practices, while not completely eliminated, are now less severe following the implementation of a T+2 DVP settlement cycle.The index provider decided also to take no action on the MSCI Qatar Index or the MSCI UAE Index, both of which were on review for upgrade from frontier to emerging status. Those reviews were extended until December, “to give additional time for market participants to assess the impact of the recent positive changes implemented in these two markets”.Maybe next time…Related reading:

President Barack Obama will on Wednesday announce his plan for pulling US troops out of Afghanistan, a decision that will set the foreign policy tone for the rest of his first term, the FT reports. Mr Obama will make the announcement in a prime-time address before heading to Fort Drum army base in upstate New York on Thursday to visit troops who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The White House has been tight-lipped about Mr Obama’s deliberations, with the president coming under pressure from the military to unveil only a modest drawdown of the 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan.Indian investors avoid ‘political’ stocks

Emerging Asia’s wealthy are getting richer twice as fast as their peers in other regions, the FT reports. For private banks, which generally seek clients with at least $1m in investable assets, that sounds like a licence to print money. Instead, the industry is struggling with rising costs, sputtering revenues and narrowed margins, raising questions about whether some of the banks flooding into the market will eventually have to drop out.Over 120 Indian companies sets up Singapore office a month

China’s central bank will produce more than double the quantity of gold Panda coins this year than it had planned, in response to a surge in buying from Chinese investors, the FT reports. The increase in production is “to meet the needs of collectors”, the central bank said in a statement posted on its website.

Both countries failed to pass the test in the past few years due to market access issues.The index provider also delayed its decision until December on whether to upgrade the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to emerging-market status from their current frontier classification.Qatar and the UAE have been under review for a promotion from their frontier market status for the past two years, but issues such as stringent foreign ownership limits and use of dual account structures have been delaying the move.
621;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Greece: CEE weathering the storm;;"Central and east European markets have so far lived through the Greek hurricane remarkably well. Even Romania, which has been through the wars, economically speaking, and has a big Greek business presence, has seen little impact: a key $1.5bn eurobond launched last week on very fine terms has barely moved from its issue price.But can this last? Even though most investors have taken account of the risk of a Greek default, it is hard to fully discount the potential consequences. The lesson of the Lehman Brothers debacle is that the knock-on effects are hard to predict.For this week, with the political gales raging in Athens, the MSCI index of CEE shares was down 3 per cent mid-day on Friday, compared with an increase in Eurotop of 0.5 per cent up and a drop of 2.1 per cent in MSCI’s emerging markets index. Hardly a disaster.Indeed, for the year to date, CEE equities are among the top performers in difficult global markets. The MSCI regional index is up 3.3 per cent compared with a drop of 2.3 per cent drop in the Eurotop index of leading west European stocks and 4.2 per cent global decline in MSCI’s emerging markets index.Even in Romania and Bulgaria, two countries with particularly strong economic ties with Greece, there is no clear sign of contagion. The Bucharest stock market is down 0.3 per cent on the month but up 5.5 per cent on the year. Sofia is up 13.6 per cent on 2011 – making it one of the world’s top performers – despite a 3.3 per cent drop in June.In bonds, it is a similar story. The JP Morgan EMBI+ index of emerging market hard currency bonds for up 3.2 per cent for CEE for the year to date, a bit short of the 3.9 per cent global gain but not hugely so. For June, CEE is up 0.255 per cent versus 0.265 per cent. As mentioned, Romania”s five-year new issue is holding up well, as have Hungary’s sovereign bonds launched this year.Fitch said in a report this month:The [Hungarian] government completed its 2011 external financing plans with the issuance of a USD3bn ten-year bond and a USD1.25bn 30-year bond issued in March 2011 (the 30-year bond was re-opened in April 2011) and a seven-year EUR1bn Eurobond in May 2011, at relatively tight spreads, despite market concerns over highly-indebted sovereigns on the periphery of the euro area.So, nothing much to worry about, then? Gunter Deuber, head of CEE macro-economic research at Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank, thinks not.He points to the considerable reputation the region has gained in overcoming the 2008-9 global crisis through serious economic restructuring, not least in Romania where public sector pay, for some employees, was cut by 20 per cent. “They have done what was needed. This is something other countries in the EU must still deliver,” said Deuber, with a thinly-veiled dig at Greece.Also, the authorities have prepared for a possible default, making sure that the subsidiaries of Greek banks are in good shape to operate without funds from their parent groups, if need be, says Deuber. This is less of a challenge than might be imagined since many international banks operating in the region have local deposits in access of local loans and other assets.But this isn’t the whole story. The Lehman crisis showed that once one default prompts a sudden rush for the financial exists, it becomes impossible to predict where the stampede will end – or who will be knocked down in the panic.Gabriel Sterne, economist at Exotix, the UK stockbroker, is worried that this is precisely the danger that now stalks south-east Europe. “It’s the second-round effects. People think they are anticipating the worst for Greece. People thought they were priced in with Lehman, but they turned out to be wrong. ”Sterne argues that the very strength of CEE markets this year is a danger signal – evidence that investors have underestimated the risks.CEE bulls retort that, as Deuber has suggested, the region’s policymakers have had plenty of time to prepare for a possible Greek collapse – and in much more cautious global circumstances than existed before Lehman.So the insurance policies are in place. But we won’t know whether the cover is sufficient unless and until the worst happens.Related reading:

622;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-06-16T17:46:45Z;Tough sell for Gulf equities;;"From Dubai’s successful $500m 10-year dollar-denominated bond sale to Majid Al-Futtaim Holding’s plans for a $2bn global bond programme – gulf headlines this week (ex OPEC) have touted the resurgent strength of the UAE bond markets.Next week though, equities will dominate the local headlines – and the news may not be so positive.C0me next Tuesday, all eyes will be on the bourses in Qatar and the UAE. MSCI is due to decide then whether to upgrades the markets from frontier to emerging status, and investors aren’t sold that the upgrades will happen.The markets in question ended the week on an uncertain note. Abu Dhabi rose 0.7 per cent on Thursday (the end of the work week in the Middle East), while Dubai fell 0.04 per cent and Qatar was down 0.8 per cent.EFG-Hermes, which had been positive on Qatari’s inclusion, cut its rating on the market to neutral from overweight in early June after it decided that the upgrade was unlikely to happen. However it said the UAE was “better positioned for an upgrade.”Part of the problem is technical. The MSCI has cited foreign ownership caps on equities as one factor limiting the markets’ inclusion, and Qatar has said recently it would not change those caps in the near future.MSCI considers the opinions of market participants in making its decisions, and there’s some question about investor enthusiasm for these exchanges.It’s not just the Arab unrest that is giving investors pause. It is also what the two countries’ equity markets have, or don’t have, to offer.While both resource-rich Qatar and the UAE have formidable growth prospects, the stocks listed on their exchanges do not offer the most efficient way to get exposure to that growth, analysts and investors say.The UAE market does not offer investors Gulf oil and gas stocks, and shares of the major telecom Etisalat are closed to foreigners. Aabar, one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, delisted from the Abu Dhabi exchange last September.“We don’t have a representation of the strength of the economy reflected in the equity market,” Tariq Qaqish, a fund manager with Al-Mal Capital in Dubai, tells beyondbrics.Selling the region’s macro story is one thing – one even Dubai seems to manage now – but selling its equities is another.Related reading:

623;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-06-14T12:38:01Z;S Korea: us, developed? No thanks;;"Lee Myung-bak, South Korea’s president, thought he was issuing a dire warning when he declared rampant corruption was stopping Korea from becoming an “advanced nation”.But Korea’s financial institutions seem happy to lurk in the penumbra between an emerging market and a developed one.MSCI, the index compiler, will decide whether to upgrade Korea to a developed market from an emerging one next week. The mood on local markets is that an upgrade would be an annoyance rather than an honour.Many traders worry capital flows will be erratic as emerging portfolios swing out and developed ones swing in. Sharp changes in investment flows are Korea’s primary fear and have sparked a series of (admittedly light-touch) capital controls.Last year, Seoul reimposed a withholding tax on sovereign bonds mainly because it knew this move would keep it out of Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index. Being part of WGBI would invite heavy foreign investment flows and could pump up the won, which would be bad for exporters. Korea felt more comfortable out of the club.Such international index compilers look at market volumes and regulation far more than corruption. The strategic dangers of corruption should be an issue when appraising Korea but they tend not to be.Anti-corruption campaigners say Lee has little chance of making any difference here and question his authority to judge what is holding Seoul back now it is on the threshold of becoming an “advanced nation”.The country has needed a major campaign against corruption for years. It has also needed a radical shake-up of formulaic and expensive education. It is crying out for imaginative ways to get women into the higher echelons of the work-force. Perhaps most importantly, it needs to end state protection of small-and-medium sized businesses, which is hobbling the broader economy.Such reforms really would turn Korea into an advanced economy and improve the lives of ordinary Koreans. But Lee has achieved little in these areas during his presidency. He has appeared to be more interested in pardoning bosses of conglomerates found guilty of corruption than in trying to stamp out graft in Korean society.Few policymakers seem serious about tackling such politically challenging reforms. Unless the next president takes firm action, South Korea may stand tantalisingly close to being hailed as an “advanced nation” for quite some time – no matter what MSCI says next week.Related reading:

Small Chinese businesses are feeling the effects the government’s monetary tightening and face a cash squeeze that may be worse than during the global financial crisis in 2008, according to an official warning, the FT reports. From tile manufacturers in Shanghai to shoe factories near Hong Kong, smaller businesses have driven Chinese growth over the past two decades, accounting for about 60 per cent of gross domestic product. So, a sharp slowdown in their activity would weigh heavily on the Chinese, and by extension, world economy.China reports less-than-estimated trade surplus
China reported a less-than-estimated $13.1bn trade surplus in May as imports surged and export growth slowed, Bloomberg reports.

The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists was for a $19.3bn surplus.

China has broken ground on two economic development zones in North Korea, in a tentative sign that the authoritarian state is warming to Chinese-style economic reforms, the FT reports. China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday the countries would develop two “government-led, enterprise-based and market-oriented” economic zones close to the Chinese border. There have been numerous attempts by Chinese entrepreneurs, provincial officials and even the UN to promote cross-border economic co-operation, with limited results. Thursday’s announcement marked the first time the two allies had jointly launched such an initiative.Flood of Syrian refugees heads for Turkey
Syrian refugees have poured across the border into Turkey to escape the regime’s crackdown on protesters as world powers struggled to reach a consensus on applying greater pressure on Damascus, the FT reports. Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkish foreign minister, told reporters on Thursday that at least 2,400 people had now reached Turkey, part of a wave of refugees fleeing from Jisr al-Shughour, the Syrian town and flashpoint of regime repression in the nearly three-month uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.MSCI index shift poses ETF tax threat
Many investors in emerging markets exchange traded funds risk an unexpected tax bill if a potential upgrade of South Korea and Taiwan this month to developed-country status in a key market benchmark goes ahead, the FT reports. A rebalancing of MSCI’s emerging market index would expose US holders of ETFs based on the benchmark and other similar indices to taxable capital gains, drawing attention to the increasing complexity of the fast-growing market for exchange traded products.Jindal Synfuels proposes $10bn CTL Project in Orissa

Russia on Thursday ramped up pressure on an increasingly fragile Belarus, cutting the electricity it supplies to the ex-Soviet republic by more than half in an attempt to secure payment on $54m in unpaid bills, the FT reports. Inter RAO, the Russian electricity exporter, said it would cut off all of the power by June 19 if the money was not paid, according to the local Belta news agency. The electricity it provides accounts for 12 per cent of Belarus’s needs. The company declined to comment, but Russia’s energy minister, Sergei Shmatko, said on Thursday that the move was a commercial decision and had no political overtones.Emerging Markets

They come on top of a swath of sanctions slapped on Iranian institutions over the regime’s suspected nuclear weapons programme and are designed to steadily increase the pressure on Tehran.China to develop N Korea trade zones
China has broken ground on two economic development zones in North Korea, in a tentative sign that the authoritarian state is warming to Chinese-style economic reforms, the FT reports. China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday the countries would develop two “government-led, enterprise-based and market-oriented” economic zones close to the Chinese border. There have been numerous attempts by Chinese entrepreneurs, provincial officials and even the UN to promote cross-border economic co-operation, with limited results. Thursday’s announcement marked the first time the two allies had jointly launched such an initiative.Flood of Syrian refugees heads for Turkey
Syrian refugees have poured across the border into Turkey to escape the regime’s crackdown on protesters as world powers struggled to reach a consensus on applying greater pressure on Damascus, the FT reports. Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkish foreign minister, told reporters on Thursday that at least 2,400 people had now reached Turkey, part of a wave of refugees fleeing from Jisr al-Shughour, the Syrian town and flashpoint of regime repression in the nearly three-month uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.MSCI index shift poses ETF tax threat
Many investors in emerging markets exchange traded funds risk an unexpected tax bill if a potential upgrade of South Korea and Taiwan this month to developed-country status in a key market benchmark goes ahead, the FT reports. A rebalancing of MSCI’s emerging market index would expose US holders of ETFs based on the benchmark and other similar indices to taxable capital gains, drawing attention to the increasing complexity of the fast-growing market for exchange traded products.Jindal Synfuels proposes $10bn CTL Project in Orissa
Jindal Synfuels, a subsidiary of Navin Jindal managed JSPL, plans to set up a Coal to Liquid plant with an overall capacity of 80,000 barrels per day equivalent of key oil products such as Diesel, Naphtha, and LPG near Augul where JSPL is coming up with a steel plant, the Economic Times reports. The CTL Project envisages consumption of about 30 MMTPA Run of Mine (ROM) Coal at an investment of Rs 45,000 crore which includes mining operations. It proposes to adopt state-of- the-art clean coal technology to drastically lower the carbon footprint.GE, Harbin Electric sign deal
Harbin Electric will purchase four of GE’s gas turbines with FlexEfficiency technology, to be used in district heating applications, in a move to further develop in China’s high-end electric market, China Daily reports. GE and Harbin Electric (HE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Friday in which they agreed to jointly provide equipment and design ideas for gas-fired power plants in the Chinese market. According to the memorandum, HE will buy four Frame 9FB gas turbines from GE by the end of 2013 and use them in the future projects. However, HE has not yet worked out the details of the projects, said Wu Weizhang, executive director and president of Harbin Power Equipment Company Ltd.Russia halves electricity supply to Belarus
Russia on Thursday ramped up pressure on an increasingly fragile Belarus, cutting the electricity it supplies to the ex-Soviet republic by more than half in an attempt to secure payment on $54m in unpaid bills, the FT reports. Inter RAO, the Russian electricity exporter, said it would cut off all of the power by June 19 if the money was not paid, according to the local Belta news agency. The electricity it provides accounts for 12 per cent of Belarus’s needs. The company declined to comment, but Russia’s energy minister, Sergei Shmatko, said on Thursday that the move was a commercial decision and had no political overtones.Emerging Markets

Concerns about slowing US growth also weighed on the regional indices. The MSCI Latin American index fell 2.2 per cent to 4,359, its sharpest one-day drop in the past 4 weeks.Peru’s Lima General Index plummeted on Monday, down 12.4 per cent to 18,586, more than the technical definition of a correction and erasing almost all of the gains made since the beginning of May. Trading was suspended early. Humala won a bitter election in which he fought against right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori, with markets closely tracking opinion polls during the past few months.“The outcome of this election is bearish for markets, particularly in the near term, and bearish for economic activity over coming quarters,” said analysts at Bulltick Capital Markets. “Peruvian markets have reacted strongly to the downside and will continue to trade on uncertainty and fear in the near term until governing intentions are made clear.”Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts on Monday lowered their recommendations on Peruvian mining companies on concern over potential higher taxation and delays in projects resulting from Ollanta Humala’s presidential election victory.

627;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-05-31T15:10:24Z;The Gulf states: obstacles ahead;;"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all? The small states of the Gulf are competing to make a name for themselves internationally. Recent news from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates shows how important burnishing their image still is for all nations in the region—but also how many of their coming out plans remain very much works-in-progress.Qatar, most notably, faces the potentially damaging suggestion that bribery tainted its successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. The economics of hosting the Cup are debatable—it needs to increase hotel rooms in the country by 10-fold, plus those nine new air-conditioned stadiums—and the PR blow from losing the event or the release of more evidence that its bid wasn’t strictly halal would be significant.Another test—perhaps slightly less high-profile than the World Cup—will come in late June when MSCI, the influential index provider, decides whether Qatar and the UAE have reformed their bourses enough to justify upgrading them from frontier to emerging market status.Yet matters look less than certain for the upgrade, which brokers and analysts say Qatar has been the driving force behind.“It’s a profile thing, like the World Cup,” says Yazan Abdeen, ING’sinvestment manager for Middle East equities.The two main obstacles barring Qatar and the UAE from gaining emerging market status are their cumbersome settlement systems and restrictive caps on foreign ownership of stocks.Although the Dubai Financial Market has upgraded its settlement system, the Nasdaq Dubai bourse announced last week that its upgrade would be delayed until July.A Qatari official, meanwhile, told Reuters it would not lift its foreign ownership caps this year.Over in the UAE, the mostly autocratic nation has been public lately about its attempts to expand political participation among citizens and protect the foreign workers on its flagship construction projects.Human rights activists have long criticized the treatment of labourers on UAE construction sites, some of whom face unsafe working conditions, withheld passports, unpaid wages, and poor living conditions. A group of artists in March announced a boycott of the Guggenheim-Abu Dhabi, still under construction, until workers’ rights and safety could be guaranteed by an independent monitor.On Thuesay, the developer announced that PricewaterhouseCoopers would do regular independent audits of how workers on Abu Dhabi’s cultural projects are being treated.And though few abroad are aware that the UAE had elections—let alone elections in need of reform—the nearby Arab spring has heightened local awareness of the extremely limited popular participation in thefederal government.Voting in the Emirates is still limited to electors selected by government official with the advice of prominent citizens in the various emirates. Only half of its Federal National Council, a consultative body, is elected; the rest of the members are appointedby the authorities.But, the chair of National Election Committee told the Financial Times on Sunday, the number of voters is expected to be increased to around 80,000 this year, up from up from 8,000 in the last round of voting in 2006.”They know that this is giving the country an image that they have to work on, that they are lagging behind when it comes to democratization,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, a political scientist atUAE University. “They are very, very sensitive to that image.”Related reading:

630;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-05-23T08:14:59Z;Pakistan: investor confidence ebbs;;"Pakistan ’s equity investors initially chose to ignore the death of Osama bin Laden as no more than a flash in the pan, even though many across the country of 180 million were shocked by his discovery in the country’s northern city of Abbottabad.Shares barely moved on the news and in the three weeks since his killing by US special forces on 02 May, the Karachi stock exchange’s 100 index has fallen by just below two per cent. A reality check seems to be settling in among the equity investors after initial hopes of a bin Laden windfall of increased US support.“After news of Osama bin Laden’s killing came, some people thought that there might even be a windfall for Pakistan in terms of a robust increase in US economic support” says Muhammad Suhail, head of Karachi’s Topline securities brokerage house.A senior official with the KSE’s management added; “The view was that after bin Laden’s killing, the US may want to pour more money to give a boost to Pakistan’s economy which would strengthen the liberal class. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be happening”.Given the gloomy political news – compounded by Monday’s Taliban attack on a military base in Karachi - it’s a bit of a wonder that shares haven’t fallen far more decisively. The market is 6 per cent down from its January peak – its highest level since the 2008-9 global crisis. But the MSCI frontier markets index is over 8 per cent lower.It’s a far cry from the mood of the previous two years when the market roared out of the crisis and posted a 158 per cent gain trough-to-peak.Investors at the Karachi stock exchange (KSE may be right to worry about the future of US economic assistance and of the country’s dwindling foreign direct investment inflows. The US has on average given just over U$2bn a year in the past decade in economic and military support, says Suhail. Foreign direct investment in the July-June financial year which ends next month is likely to be no more than U$1.5bn, down dramatically from U$5bn just five years ago.Monday’s Taliban attack will do nothing to reassure multinationals about the stability of the country or its commercial capital. At least 12 soldiers died in the fighting. And with the economy slowing, Pakistan’s economic outlook is looking difficult, even without the political headaches.Pakistan’s fiscal deficit is likely to be 6.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the 2010/11 fiscal year(July-June), compared with the government’s target of 5.5 percent, the State Bank of Pakistan said in a statement on Saturday, according to Reuters.The central bank also revised its forecast for inflation to range between 14 and 14.5 percent for the year ending June 30, compared to its earlier projection of between 14.5 and 15.5 percent. But GDP growth is likely to come out at just 2.4 per cent versus a govenremtn targert of 4.5 per cent, which itself is very modest by emerging market standards.The central bank on Saturday left its key interest rate unchanged at 14 per cent.US Senator John Kerry, the powerful chairman of the US Senate’s foreign relations committee, in a visit last week warned of scepticism towards Pakistan among US elected politicians, though he also left the door open for continued US-Pakistan cooperation. But in Karachi , many are already perturbed over the future.Even if the US chooses to avoid taking punitive steps over concerns on bin Laden’s discovery in a well-fortified Pakistani city, many foreign investors will likely remain wary of Pakistan. Questions mount over the possible presence in Pakistan of other terrorist leaders such as Ayman Al Zawahiri, the Egyptian militant and the second-in-command of Al-Qaeda.With prospects appearing to have shrunk for large chunks of foreign capital heading towards Karachi and with Pakistan’s economy sluggish, there is plenty to worry about.Further reading

632;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-05-18T13:30:45Z;EM bears come out of the woods;;"While emerging market bulls continue to fuel the EM equities rally train - last week shovelling $265m into EM equity funds – a growing number of bears are piling out, raising the question: has the rally run out of steam? The latest bear to emerge, Kenneth Fisher, says sentiment in the market has become “too ebullient, too sanguine”.The billionaire investor and chief executive of Fisher Investments has already put his money where his mouth is: his fund – which manages $44bn - sold over $1bn of its emerging market exchange traded fund stocks in the last quarter.“Things that lead a bull market early on reach a period at some point, which we think is about now, where they start to run out of steam,” Fisher said in an interview with Bloomberg.Fisher Investments sold 20.6m shares in the iShares MSCI EM index fund and 2m of its shares in the Vanguard MSCI EM ETF, the two biggest emerging market funds in the US – with a combined hold of $86bn, according to Bloomberg data.The MSCI Emerging Markets index is down 2.6 per cent at 1,133.39 since the start of the year. The index rallied in April, hitting a peak for this year of 1,206.49 on May 2, only to drop 6 per cent since then.Emerging Europe has been the one bright spot this year, with the MSCI EM Europe Index outpacing others EM indices, gaining 3.4 per cent over this year. Asian and Latin American equities suffered losses; the MSCI Emerging Asia Index is down 0.6 per cent and the MSCI Latin American Index 7.6 per cent since the start of the year.Fisher’s view remains a contrarian one – developing markets are still a favourite among the majority of global fund managers, but concerns about global economic growth are beginning to slow risk appetite.Data last week from EPFR – which tracks global fund flows on a weekly basis – showed that equity funds saw a seventh week of consecutive inflows but the net gain of $265m was significantly lower than the $1.2bn the previous week, and the $11.1bn for April. The slowdown was chalked up to commodity price volatility and weak macro data from the US.As concerns increase about global growth, expect more EM bears to come out of the woods. As beyondbrics reported a few weeks ago, John-Paul Smith, strategist at Deutsche Bank, has views similar to Fisher’s and believes a new phase for EM equities is looming when they will be less attractive to investors. Smith told beyondbrics:EM governments and companies became addicted to top-line growth between 2002 and 2007 and we’re just not in that environment any more. We had a mini-echo of that as the Chinese fiscal stimulus came in but that echo is fading away.Related reading:

But it could harm the big exporters of oil and minerals, notably Russia.With the MSCI index at 1146.84, level with its 2010 close, other EM markets are naturally spread around the break-even point.The top performer among the larger bourses is Seoul, with a 3.5 per cent gain, followed by Russia’s RTS index (up by 3.4 per cent) and Jakarta (up 2.8 per cent), with Seoul and Jakarta trading close to record highs.

Bad news for the commodity exporters among emerging markets. But not necessarily good news for the importers as many of these countries (headed by China) are big exporters to the US. They won’t be cheering a weak US economy.Not for nothing is the MSCI emerging markets index down 0.9 per cent on the day, a fall that comes on top of a 2.5 per cent decline since mid-April. Investors have been selling EM equities, and commodities, on fears of economic disruptions, not least the combined threat of weak US demand and EM inflation risks.Brent crude, which has spiked close to $127 a barrel in the last two weeks on the Libyan conflict, fell sharply on the London opening on Thursday from around $121.50 to as low as $116.84 in the mid-afternoon for curdue for June delivery.The Labor Department disclosed a 43,000 increase in first-time time mployment claims to 474,000, the biggest jump since last August, the day after the Energy Department revealed bigger-than-expected crude stocks. Crude inventories rose 3.42 million barrels to 366.5 million last week, the highest since October.“The data is signaling that the recovery isn’t as rapid as some were expecting,” Ben Westmore, a minerals and energy economist at National Australia Bank. in Melbourne, told Bloomberg. “It’s going to be a slow grind back for the US.”And if it’s going to be slow grind back for the US, it will be slow grind back for many other countries, developed and emerging.Related reading

637;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2011-03-15T12:56:09Z;SocGen: invest in EM via VW;;"Sleepy Europe the best way of investing in emerging markets? As far as equities are concerned, Societe Generale thinks so.A basket of stocks of European companies with high EM exposure (including German carmaker Volkswagen) has performed better over the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath than either European equities as a whole or EM equities. Past performance is no guide to future returns as the disclaimers say. But still, it is food for thought.Since its launch in November 2007, the SG emerging index (of around 25 European companies) out-performed both the MSCI Europe index and the MSCI emerging markets index. The SGEI index was down just 3.3 per cent as of February 25, compared with a 7.2 per cent drop in the MSCI EM index and a whopping 20.1 per cent decline in the MSCI Europe index.As the chart shows (click to enlarge), SG argues that it is better to invest in EMs ‘indirectly’ through multinationals operating in EMs than EM companies. Stock market volatility is lower in developed stock markets and so, therefore, is the risk premium. Also, EM economies face greater cyclical pressures than developed economies – notably, right now, the dangers of overheating. Local companies are more exposed to this economic risk, not least because in some countries, for example, China, they are required to implement government policies even when commercial logic may point in a different direction, eg state-led bank lending in China.SG calcualtes that for 160 selected large European companies, revenues from EM operations will rise from 18 per cent in 2002 to 31 per cent in 2010 and 37 per cent in 2015. EMs’ contribution to growth – already at 55 per cent for both revenues and ebit profits – will rise to 60 per cent and 63 per cent respectively.Small and mid-sized stock-market-listed companies (in a sample of 75) are significantly less engaged in EMs. The EM share of revenues is growing from 12 per cent in 2002, to 17 per cent in 2010 and a forecast 21 per cent in 3-5 years’ time, estimates SG.There are striking differences in exposure to individual countries. In China, top of the list is Richemont, the textiles and luxuries group, with an estimated 30 per cent of 2010 revenues coming from China, followed by STMicroelectronics on 25 per cent, and BHP Billiton on 25 per cent.In Brazil, Seadrill, the energy services company, is top on 50 per cent, followed by SBM Offshore (48 per cent), Portugal Telecom (47 per cent) and Pirelli (33 per cent). In Russia the European leader is brewer Carlsberg (27 per cent), with Tele2, the telecoms group, second on 26 per cent and BP third on 25 per cent.In eastern Europe, excluding Russia, Erste Bank comes first (60 per cent) followed by OMV, the Austrian oil group (also 60 per cent), and Telekom Austria (35 per cent).In India, Holcim, the Swiss cement group, leads the pack with 16 per cent, followed by Spain’s Repsol-YPF on 15 per cent and Standard Chartered, the bank, on 11 per cent.In Africa, Italy’s ENI is top on 57 per cent, followed by Bourbon, energy equipment, on 51 per cent and France’s Total on 34 per cent.SG’s basket of 23 companies for the period to February was as follows:Beiersdorf, BHP Billiton, BBVA, Carrefour, Diageo, Ericsson, Erste Bank, HSBC, Inditex, LVMH, Nestle, Prudential, Renault, Saipem, Santander, Schneider, Siemens, Standard Chartered, Technip, Unilever, Veolia, Volkswagen and Xstrata.The bank has reshuffled the pack for the future, dropping some companies and bringing in others, and taking the total to 25, as follows:Adidas, Anglo American, BBVA, Casino, Atlas Copco, Erste Bank, Danone, BHP Billiton, HSBC, Diageo, Michelin, Prudential, Ericsson, Peugeot Citroen-PSA, Standard Chartered, Henkel, Saipem, Inditex, Siemens, L’Oreal, Vallourec, Unilever, Volkswagen Telenor and Xstrata.That’s quite a shift, only two years after the original index was compiled, given the long-term nature of EM investment. But that does not undermine the strength of the overall strategy. It just underlines the difficulties in implementing it.Related reading

638;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-12-08T17:10:09Z;Qatar and UAE upgrade talk abounds;;Investors enthusiastically pumping capital into emerging markets have largely avoided Gulf bourses, mainly because of the “frontier markets” status accorded them by MSCI, the influential index provider. But some experts say this could be about to change.Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been under review for an upgrade to MSCI’s Emerging Markets index for several years, but have thus far been denied. A number of reasons are cited, such as foreign-ownership limits and a delay between payment for a stock and receipt of the underlying share.MSCI’s decision is not due until June, but speculation is mounting that the two markets will be upgraded, according to analysts and fund managers.For the first time in two years analysts at EFG-Hermes, the Egyptian investment bank, see a greater than 50 per cent chance that the two markets will be promoted, according to a recent research note.The benefits could be significant. Although Qatar and the UAE are likely to account for a minuscule part of the MSCI EM index, it is tracked by emerging market funds worth an estimated $380bn.Under a “best-case scenario” as much as $1.5bn could enter the UAE and $3.9bn could flow into Qatar, according to EFG-Hermes.“The excess liquidity that has found its way to emerging markets is about to break the dam,” says a senior local banker.“This liquidity has to find a new home, and with most emerging markets looking crowded or expensive, a lot of investors are looking for the UAE and Qatar to be upgraded.”However, there are still hurdles to overcome. First, the share delivery-versus-payment problem highlighted by MSCI has yet to be resolved.The UAE has said that it will introduce a DvP system in the first quarter of next year, but reforms are often sluggish. Qatar can move quickly when it wants to, but has offered no official timeline on when it will move over to DvP.Second, restrictive foreign-ownership caps at many large Qatari companies weigh on the gas-rich emirate’s chances of an upgrade, and there appears to be no significant moves to lift the limits.Not all experts are convinced that upgrades will be forthcoming, given the slow pace of reforms and limited trading in many stocks. “None of them deserve to be upgraded, to be honest,” says a senior capital markets lawyer.Indeed, some bankers say the talk of upgrades is overshadowing a far more significant event on the horizon: the possibility of Saudi Arabia opening up fully to foreign investors.International investors can currently only access Saudi indirectly via swaps. In effect this deters most long-only funds, who are restricted on how many derivatives they can hold.It is still uncertain when – or even whether – the Saudi Capital Markets Authority will open the market further, but some experts hope it could happen next year.“UAE and Qatar MSCI upgrades would prompt an uptick for these markets but, in my view, Saudi Arabia moving to cash instead of swaps will be the biggest event for the MENA capital markets,” says the senior local banker.
639;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-11-01T03:26:21Z;Liquidnet to offer Israeli securities;;Liquidnet will on Monday launch trading in Israeli securities as the operator of dark pools continues its global expansion even as it cuts costs.The company said it would be the first block trading venue to offer direct electronic access into a Middle Eastern market.With the addition of Israel, Liquidnet now offers trading access to 37 equities markets and provides access to all of the MSCI World index.John Barker, head of international for Liquidnet, said: “The Israeli economy continues to perform well despite the financial crisis and the geopolitical events of the last decade. Most recently, the MSCI Barra reclassified Israel as a developed market.”“Bringing markets like Israel onto our system is essential in helping our members realise their global investment ideas,” he added.This year Liquidnet has entered New Zealand, Mexico, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Slovenia.All Israeli executions will be printed to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange through Liquidnet’s partnership with a local broker, which is a member of the TASE.There are 612 equities traded on the Tel Aviv exchange.
640;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-10-27T17:10:48Z;Hopes rest on pan-emirates exchange;;Gulf markets usually bounce back after the sluggish lows of summer and Ramadan. This year is no different but analysts nevertheless fret that the rebound has been modest as global uncertainties combine with concerns that the regional recovery is not as strong as it could be.But bigger changes are afoot as the emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai – where volumes are less than half of what they were a year ago – plot the creation of a pan-emirates exchange that could start to rival those of the regional behemoth, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.Goldman Sachs is finalising a report on the planned merger of ADX and DFM for the Emirates Investment Authority, a federal sovereign wealth fund that should end up owning the holding company controlling the two exchanges.One person aware of the matter says disagreements remain over the price that Abu Dhabi would have to pay Dubai for the two emirates to split ownership of the new venture 50/50. ADX is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, while DFM is owned by Borse Dubai, a government-owned holding vehicle for exchanges.An offer of about Dh1.2 a share was on the table a few months ago, but the stock has strengthened to Dh1.74 a share. During the boom, it was valued as high as Dh6 a share.Abu Dhabi, which has bailed out Dubai with loans of at least $20bn since the financial crisis struck, is pushing for a stronger federation in the United Arab Emirates – linking the country’s markets is one of the most obvious ways of furthering this process.But Dubai will also want a good price for one of its crown jewels, which has a strong cash flow and good reputation. “What price can you put on a monopoly?” says one person familiar with the talks.Nonetheless, few market analysts disagree with the logic behind a unified bourse, perhaps to be called the Emirates Financial Exchange, with separate trading floors but common technology.DFM and Nasdaq Dubai, the city’s international exchange, have merged trading platforms, granting DFM retail investors easier access to Nasdaq Dubai. DP World, the ports operator listed on Nasdaq Dubai, has recently enjoyed stronger volumes than Emaar Properties, the bellwether equity on DFM, even as DP World plans a London listing to boost liquidity.At a national level, the roll-out of a common platform to ADX would make life easier for investors and reduce costs for struggling brokerages. The UAE could even eventually link its technology to other regional exchanges that suffer from more modest volumes, such as Bahrain, Oman and Jordan.The positive mood music from a merger would not only please international investors, it could also presage important regulatory changes to attract foreign investment. DFM, for example, has implemented some regulatory and technical solutions to try to appease MSCI Barra, which has as yet refused to lift the UAE from “frontier” to “emerging market” status.If a unified exchange were able to implement these changes, the UAE could eventually expect a sharp increase in foreign emerging markets funds that track MSCI indices.While investor sentiment might not point to a bull return, government action could still have a real impact.
641;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-10-03T10:09:23Z;No rush to separate alpha and beta;;"Alpha has been a word difficult to avoid in the past decade. The term glitters promisingly from presentations by commercial investment managers, although their results often emit a dimmer sparkle.Alpha is jargon for risk-adjusted excess performance due to skill and so inevitably has been appropriated as a justification of active management, especially at the stockpicking level.In contrast, index-tracking or passive management is described as beta: almost devoid of skill; following market movements rather than in anticipation of them; consequently low cost. Almost all exchange traded funds are passive vehicles while the vast majority of pooled funds are actively managed.So far, so easy. It should be intuitive that alpha would be less significant to investors than beta. After all, if a manager is asked to outperform an equity index by 1 percentage point and the benchmark returns 10 per cent, then the skill, or alpha, involved will be a small fraction of the total return. Much of the manager’s portfolio composition would indeed approximate the index so as to not stray far from the desired outperformance.Separation of alpha from beta suggests that instead of buying this mixture of anticipatory skill and straightforward copying, the two get pulled apart and active managers are measured exclusively by, and rewarded exclusively for, their skill.In practice, however, such divisions are not that common. Across Europe, a handful of pioneering pension funds have introduced the policy, notably AP7 in Sweden, ATP in Denmark and PGGM in the Netherlands. But these are a tiny minority. The bulk of money remains mixed, and measured against well-known indices supplied by FTSE, MSCI Barra, S&P and others.Given that alpha/beta separation was heralded years ago with the popularisation of hedge funds, why has the practice not found more users?Divyesh Hindocha, global director of consulting at Mercer, believes part of the issue is defining alpha. “If a manager is looking for short-term trading anomalies, that is different to long-term, thematic positioning. But there is alpha in both strategies,” he says.Moreover, he believes there are both pragmatic reasons and skill in aggregating such ideas with market direction: “Clinical separation of alpha and beta doesn’t always make sense – long-only portfolios seeking longer term opportunities that package alpha and beta have a role to play in portfolios.”This is all well and good if remuneration reflects such combinations fairly. But there is a growing body of thought that much of what managers attribute as alpha, especially in longer-term thematic investing, boils down to some cyclically persistent aspect of stock markets that is better termed “smart beta”.Dimitris Melas, executive director of research at MSCI, says anomalies such as outperformance of value over growth, or small cap versus large cap can be viewed as such.MSCI itself does not promulgate belief in such perceived smart betas. It does, however, offer an increasing range of indices, alongside the conventional market-cap betas, for those who do.These smart beta products – typically in the form of ETFs – will put pressure on conventional active managers, according to Steve Birch, head of manager research at pension fund adviser, Hymans Robertson.He believes, however, that the weight of money benchmarked against indices such as the S&P500 is so great that outright change is unlikely.“I would be more than happy to pay well for performance upside with a manager that could demonstrate skill,” says Mr Birch.“I would comfortably recommend such an approach to our clients. But there is a noticeable lack of products offering alpha only.“The investment industry likes the comfort that beta gives. It’s a cushion of revenues. There are not enough firms willing to be rewarded for skill alone.”There thus seem two reasons as to why alpha and beta are rarely separated.First, it is difficult for everyone to agree on a definition.Second, the asset management industry is active not so much in making brave portfolio management decisions on behalf of clients as preserving the status quo. That way, products can appear straightaway in financial advisers’ most popular searches instead of going into a minor Absolute Return category. Investors feel comfortable that there is a recognised reference index while the product creators avoid the tough task of being judged purely on skill.On this status quo, Jack Gray, an academic at the Paul Woolley Centre for Capital Market Dysfunctionality, contrasts commercial asset management with other industries.“In other industries and even other financial sectors, it appears that circa six large players (forced by regulators to compete) ‘works’. That configuration will inevitably and healthily lead to smaller breakaways with truly distinctive offerings,” he says.“In Australia we have four large banks and about six smaller regional banks that might force competition on the larger ones. On the other hand, we have about 80 active Australian equity managers.”A forthcoming paper* co-authored by Mr Gray blames asset managers, their clients and intermediary consultants’ excessive belief in the superiority of their own decision-making for the glut of asset management organisations.Alas, when many of these organisations do attempt to prove their worth by taking a step towards alpha/beta separation – as occurred four years ago with the launch of 130/30 funds – the results can be memorable for all the wrong reasons, as next week’s article will tell.*Why Do Investors and Their Agents Favour Active Management to the Extent They Do? by Ron Bird, Jack Gray, Massimo Scotti, for the Paul Woolley Centre for the Study of Capital Market Dysfunctionality, University of Technology Sydney"
642;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-09-29T16:44:14Z;Ripples from Saudi index row spread;Share prices likely to feel effects;Saudi Arabia’s stock market, the largest and most liquid in the Arab world, is due to be dropped from the indices of MSCI Barra, an influential index provider, after negotiations over licensing failed to bear fruit.Given the importance of Saudi Arabia, fund managers who invest in the Middle East and benchmark themselves against MSCI Barra’s regional indices, have switched, or will soon have to move, to a substitute measure, most likely Standard & Poor’s Pan Arab Index.“It effectively gives the local Middle East index market to MSCI’s competitors,” says Daniel Broby, chief investment officer at Silk Invest, an emerging market specialist fund manager. “Clearly, someone from MSCI had too much sun when in Riyadh. Saudi is by far the largest geography, most liquid, and largest market in the Gulf.”MSCI Barra, which was expected to make the move on Thursday, declined to comment.The differences in country, sector and company weightings between the two indices could also have an impact on stock prices in the region, fund managers say.“Regional managers have no choice. They will have to shift out of their regional indices and into an alternative,” says Sebastien Henin, a fund manager at The National Investor. “That means we could see some volatility on some specific names and countries.”The Saudi market is likely be the biggest loser from a move from MSCI Arabian Markets to the S&P Pan Arab index. In the former, the Tadawul has a 51 per cent weighting, and in the latter 45.7 per cent, according to EFG-Hermes. Kuwait’s weighting also drops from 19.2 per cent to 17.2 per cent.Jordan’s weighting rises from 0.7 per cent to 3 per cent, and Morocco’s jumps from 2.9 per cent to 6.1 per cent. United Arab Emirates bourses also see their importance rise somewhat.How significant are these shifts for the underlying stock markets and companies?International asset managers are now largely absent from the region. Retail investors dominate trading, particularly in the Gulf, where mutual funds hold only about $25bn, according to Lipper, a data provider.However, while there are no passive, index-tracking funds in the region, asset managers pay attention to the weighting of indices. Given the low trading volumes, some companies and countries may therefore notice the shift in the coming weeks.Overall, the MSCI indices favour larger companies, while the S&P indices are more broadly based.For example, Sabic, the large Saudi petrochemicals group, makes up about 10 per cent of the MSCI Arabian Markets index, but only about 6.5 per cent of the S&P Pan Arab index, says Fadi al Said, regional head of equities at ING Investment Management.Given the size and liquidity of the Tadawul market, a lower weighting will not be a serious negative, but smaller companies, such as Arab Bank in Jordan, are likely to benefit.Overall, Mr Said says the index shift “might have a slightly negative effect on the large cap companies, and a slightly positive impact on the small and medium cap companies”.
643;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-05-24T16:13:04Z;New regulator illuminates Egypt exchange;;As one of only two markets in the Arab world to be given emerging market status by MSCI Barra, the Egyptian stock market attracts significant capital flows from overseas funds as well as from local investors. Moreover, since the EGX 30 index has risen 4.1 per cent in the year to date, Cairo is one of the best-performing markets in the region.The Egyptian authorities are looking to boost that status by announcing measures that pave the ground for the introduction of index-linked funds and tighten the rules of disclosure for traded companies.“Our aim is to find the correct balance between regulatory measures and energising the market by encouraging new forms of activity,” says Ziad Bahaa El-Din, chairman of the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority.The EFSA was formed only last year and Mr Bahaa El-Din, a lawyer, is its first head. The body unifies under one management team the previous regulators of the capital market and the mortgage and insurance industries.Over the past five years, Egyptian government policies have been mostly pro-business and strongly supportive of the private sector, giving the bourse an increasingly important role in the economy.Brokers say the introduction of index funds will increase the variety of products in a market that is still limited in the range of vehicles it offers to small investors. The measures include rules for market makers in index funds – the last step needed to allow the product to come to market.“There are too many retail investors who do not really know how to invest,” says a managing director at a leading Cairo brokerage house. He says retail investors make up almost 60 per cent of daily trading volumes. “This type of . . . fund will be one way to absorb them,” the managing director says.Other measures aimed at boosting activity allow same-day trading and margin-trading on a larger number of stocks. Mr Bahaa El-Din says his authority has agreed new standards that will double the number of “active” stocks eligible for such operations to more than 100. Shares of companies in which at least 10 per cent of the capital is a free float are now considered active. The previous threshold was 15 per cent.The EFSA is also moving to introduce stricter disclosure rules. Companies will be obliged to inform the market before the start of trading about changes to their capital structure, the nature of their activity or the nominal value of their shares.Decisions such as capital increases and share splits will have to be disclosed promptly to prevent the spread of rumours and manipulation of the market.“We are forcing a much higher level of disclosure for corporate actions,” says Mr Bahaa El-Din.The authority is now endowed with the range of powers exercised by regulators elsewhere in the world, including carrying out surprise inspections and taking cases to court. So far, it has brought “a handful” of cases to trial over the past year, two of which have led to criminal convictions.“More importantly, we also have the power to settle [out of court] with wrongdoers,” Mr Bahaa El-Din says. “But I do not believe that all crimes should end with settling. I want to send a clear signal that settling is exceptional, not a right or a rule.”To that end, the authority is building up capacity by taking on 40 staff a year. They undergo a newly introduced 16-month training programme, including a trip to a counterpart abroad, which this year will be Singapore.More generally, Mr Bahaa El-Din wants an improvement in the quality of quarterly corporate results. “Companies need to have more research published on them. Some companies do not allow analysts enough information,” he says.Brokers say most of the big companies traded on the Egyptian market adhere to reasonable standards, but they complain that, among small and medium cap entities, corporate governance, insider trading and failure to abide by the rules are often a problem.“The issue is not so much regulation, but it is the enforcement of existing regulations,” says the managing director of the brokerage house.The EFSA is also moving to tighten the over-the-counter market for stocks in companies that have been removed from the main exchange because they breached listing regulations. This part of the market is particularly chaotic and open to manipulation, according to brokers, and will now be limited to two half-hour trading sessions every week.“This was not meant to be a fully fledged market,” says Mr Bahaa El-Din. “It was only meant to help investors exit from stocks that have been delisted.”
644;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-05-19T16:29:24Z;UAE eyes prize of higher market status;;Local fund managers have been clamouring for years for an upgrade of regional bourses to emerging market status, rather than the current more remote “frontier” classification.FTSE, a sister company of the Financial Times, has approved the United Arab Emirate’s markets for inclusion in its benchmarks. This means that, in September, about 170 funds tracking the FTSE index of emerging markets will seek exposure to the Abu Dhabi Exchange, Dubai Financial Market and Nasdaq Dubai.“The UAE market had made sufficient improvement over a short period of time to go straight to an emerging market,” says Jonathan Cooper, FTSE’s regional managing director. He cites established regulators and a competitive brokerage landscape as reasons for inclusion as emerging rather than frontier status.But MSCI Barra, usually considered a more influential index that is used by about 80 per cent by value of emerging market tracker funds, has proved a tougher nut to crack. It is due next month to revisit its decision last year not to give the UAE “emerging” status.Haissam Arabi, chief executive of Gulfmena, an alternative asset manager based in the Dubai International Financial Centre, says that if the UAE were promoted up to $5bn could flow into its stock exchanges. Initial public offerings, which have been off the agenda since the financial crisis but now beginning to creep back, could also expect an easier run.As things stand, the UAE’s markets trail Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar in terms of market capitalisation, but they are more liquid, easier for foreigners to access and have a competitive brokerage network.MSCI Barra, which has declined to comment on the classification process, last year identified several barriers that prevented the from UAE stepping up.Among the reasons were a delay between payment for a stock and receipt of the underlying share, and a lack of distinction between proprietary and client trading accounts.There are also concerns that limits on foreign ownership on some UAE stocks – varying between 15 and 49 per cent – alongside government stakes in many of the country’s blue chip companies limit the free float available to foreign institutions.On the positive side, Nasdaq Dubai, a sophisticated but inactive exchange that has been taken over by DFM, allows short selling and derivative products.Consolidation of local exchanges may also assist an upgrade. Dubai hopes that the DFM’s appeal to retail investors will rub off on Nasdaq Dubai once trading platforms are merged.The bigger prize, however, is pan-UAE consolidation.Officials at the Abu Dhabi and Dubai bourses have confirmed that their respective governments are discussing a tie-up, though a speedy resolution is unlikely given the obstacles and sensitivities involved.A merger would make the UAE the second-largest – and most open – exchange in the Gulf after Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul.It would also increase the pool of stocks on one bourse with a free float needed to lure foreign investors.As Mohammed Yasin, chief executive of Shuaa Securities, says: “ADX and DFM combined have a better chance of gaining access than each alone.”

646;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;M&A burst drives Wall Street higher;;"A burst of merger and acquisition activity moved US stocks higher Monday, aided by stronger than expected consumer spending and manufacturing figures as well as optimism that a Greek bail-out plan may be agreed soon.Consumer spending was last month stronger than had been expected – up 0.5 per cent – and higher for a fourth consecutive month while incomes increased by less than expected.“Real consumer spending will probably rise around 2.5 per cent in the first quarter, better than the 1.7 per increase in the fourth,” said Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight. “Consumer spending is improving gradually but is not playing a leading role in the recovery. Wage and salary incomes improved in January but overall personal income increased only 0.1 per cent because dividend income, farm income and interest income all took a hit.”Manufacturing expanded in February for a seventh consecutive month, although by less than expected, suggesting that US factories are leading the recovery. The ISM index fell to 56.5 from 58.4 in January.After the close, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher to 1,115.71, inching above 1,115, a technical level traders focus on.

It trumps a $6bn approach by Thermo Fisher, a rival US company, and represents a 50 per cent premium to Millipore’s earlier share price. Thermo Fisher was 0.3 down to $48.65.OSI Pharmaceuticals surged 51.9 per cent to $56.25 after Astellas Pharma, Japan’s second-largest drugmaker, said it was about to begin a $3.5bn hostile takeover for the company.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
648;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-02-07T10:01:02Z;Index providers benefit from slice of ETF pie;;"Most players in the financial services industry have had an up and down ride in the past few years as bust followed boom. Index providers, however, seem to have kept calm and carried on.“The index market has been growing pretty strongly for the last decade and barely missed a heartbeat in the past 18 months,” says Andrew Buckley, executive director of strategy at FTSE Group, the index provider owned by the FT and the London Stock Exchange. This enviable composure has been due in large part to the massive growth of the exchange traded funds market.ETFs are investment vehicles traded on exchanges, usually tracking an index of some kind. The index may have existed before the invention of ETFs, such as the FTSE 100 or the S&P 500 or may be developed at the specific request of the ETF provider. In either case, the index provider gets a slice of the pie.“It has had a tremendous impact on the index provision industry,” says Henry Fernandez, chief executive of MSCI Barra.“It has provided a critical source of revenues to fund business growth, product innovation, expansion generally.”Mr Fernandez points out that until recently, index providers relied largely on two revenue streams: the sale of data; and derivatives such as listed options and futures based on the indices.But now “providers of equity indices have seen a huge source of business and gone out and grabbed it”.This is a positive development for all, he thinks. “They are using it to go out and create new products, to create new intellectual capital, to enrich the world.” Whether or not it has enriched the world, it has certainly enriched index providers. Although no one was prepared to be specific about how much they make from that line of business, Mr Buckley says the share of FTSE’s revenues coming from the ETF business has increased six-fold in the past five years.He further predicts the ETF market will grow at a rate of 25 per cent a year for the next five years, although some of that will depend on asset prices continuing to grow.This might seem ambitious, until you contemplate recent history.In the past decade, the compound annual growth rate for ETF assets globally has been 56.3 per cent – 90.5 per cent in Europe, according to figures from BlackRock, the world’s largest ETF provider.“It’s had an interesting impact on our revenue mix,” says Mr Buckley. The bread and butter of the index business, data provision, continues to be a stable source of revenues, while ETF licensing has added a “high margin, fast growing but very volatile” extra income stream.It is volatile because most ETF users pay a proportion of their assets under management to the index provider, so that revenues go up and down with assets and asset prices. Some providers talk about a fee of 5-10 basis points, but others are less forthcoming.“There is a greater variety of commercial structures than people on the outside are aware of,” says S&P’s global head of ETF licensing Reid Steadman. He refuses to offer any enlightenment to those outsiders, saying only: “The goal is to enter a commercial structure where all parties benefit from the success of the product.”The top three index providers, which between them have nearly three-quarters of the market in terms of assets under management, are S&P, with assets of $249.18bn (£157bn, €180bn) and 233 ETFs; MSCI with $243.80bn and 268 ETFs; and Barclays Capital (which specialises in fixed income indices) with $87.48bn and 70 ETFs.There are 107 more index providers fighting over the remaining 28 per cent of the market, according to a BlackRock report.S&P has been in the market longer then most, having licensed the first ETF on an index in 1993, and Mr Steadman says he is seeing big changes as Europe’s market accelerates.So much more exciting is the demand for indices from European ETFs, in fact, that Mr Steadman recently relocated from New York to London to be nearer the action. As markets open up to ETFs globally, S&P is having to rethink aspects of its strategy.“It’s always been S&P’s goal to maintain the strength and exclusivity of our brand, so we’ve been careful about who we license our indices to. In the past, that has meant we have often entered into exclusive arrangements.“We are now opening up our business more for the simple reason that we want as many investors as possible to have access to products based on our indices.”While the US market has a simple enough structure that one ETF based on the S&P 500 will be available to almost any investor, the more fragmented European and Asian markets require multiple products based on any given index, he says.Boundary lines are being redrawn between index providers in terms of product range as well, he points out. “It used to be all index providers were snugly fit into their own areas of strength but all of them have to some degree sought to diversify their offerings.”The need to offer a wide range of indices for ETF licensing was part of the motivation for S&P’s acquisition of the GSCI commodity index range in 2007, he says. “We benefit from the diversification, just as an investor would.”"

650;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2010-01-03T07:50:32Z;More respect for behavioural studies;;"From now on, the asset management industry is going to have to take more account of risk, according to the responses to FTfm in its informal survey of the industry. “The most important lesson is about managing risk”; “the crisis has highlighted the importance of managing risk in asset management, regardless of its nature”; “risk has to go back to the heart of the investment approach of a solid investment manager” – these are typical comments from the chief executives, chief investment officers and consultants who pondered the lessons of the past decade and forecast the challenges of the next for us.In some ways, this is a no-brainer. Many portfolio managers failed to predict the massive increase in correlation as things went wrong and lost vast amounts of money for their clients. These clients rightly felt aggrieved, having been told the diversification of their portfolios would protect them from losses.Clever people have been turning their minds to how to model financial markets in bad times – RiskMetrics, MSCI Barra and Goldman Sachs all look to a regime-shift model. In this, you use one model for markets when all is going well, or at least as well as can be expected, and another in dark days when it seems all hell may break loose at any moment. This latter is concocted by plucking those days or periods from the past the analyst thinks were turbulent and building a model based on those samples rather than the entirety of historical data available.But simply to say the asset management industry needs to focus more on risk is an empty truism if there is no attempt to think about how risk has featured in asset management and why that was inadequate.
It is even possible that building more and better mathematical models of risk will not make things better for the asset management industry.This is because mathematical models assume the outcomes will be received by rational investors. These mythical beings are not uniform – they can be risk averse or risk seeking – but they value what they may gain at the same rate as what they may lose, and their level of risk aversion is unaffected by how other people are doing.Unfortunately for the number-crunchers, this is not the case. End-investors are ultimately human, and it is becoming clear that humans are irretrievably subject to impulses and vagaries that do not fit the neat description of rationality.The growing field of behavioural finance is attempting to explore the bounds of rationality in decision-making, working out whether our irrationality is systematic (it is) and whether a better understanding of it can improve investments (the jury’s still out). Even more important for asset managers, it looks at how individuals value outcomes – not symmetrically. Losing something hurts more than gaining something of the notional equivalent value pleases us.At the moment, behavioural finance as a discipline is still very largely based on the experiments done in controlled conditions, usually on college students. Critics like to point out that this is a far cry from financial markets, where billions of decisions are made, mostly by professionals, in distinctly uncontrolled conditions.But since the pure mathematical approach appears to have let down its proponents badly, whether because of a fundamental wrongness or because it was incorrectly applied, perhaps the behaviouralists should be allowed more respect (and possibly more funding for their research).As John Belgrove of Hewitt Associates said in our survey, “behavioural finance disciplines are likely to become more dominant, respected and better developed” in the coming decade. Better developed is important, because in spite of the Nobel Memorial prize for economics awarded in 2002 to Daniel Kahneman (a psychologist), behavioural finance is still not sufficiently developed for it to be properly integrated with market theory.It is true the turbulence of the past couple of years can be used to learn more about the risks of financial markets. It is even likely that complex mathematical models will have useful insights to offer chief risk officers, responsible for making sure asset management companies know what risks they are taking. But unless they somehow incorporate the discoveries of behavioural finance, they will be no better at understanding either how markets are likely to behave or how investors are likely to react to them.sophia.grene@ft.com"
651;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-11-01T09:02:05Z;Sponsors adopt diverse revenue sources;;Providers may not like to admit it, but the major market index industry is fairly saturated. There are already hundreds of major market indices available and the situation is further compounded by Thomson Reuters’ September entrance into the industry. With so many players and options, providers are being forced to find ways to put themselves above the competition and search for new clients.One of the main problems for the providers is that index construction does not differ dramatically from firm to firm. This is especially true for major market index creation because their investability is much less of an issue. All the firms claim their process is unique, but each one will mention similar themes, such as the importance of creating an objective and representative product.The most significant differences appear to be in the calculation of an index or security’s liquidity. As one of the most difficult concepts to quantify, there are several approaches.This was a point that Andrew Clark, chief index strategist at Thomson Reuters, concedes. He says: “Our competitors tend to use a volume filter to determine what securities go in the index. But academic research has argued in favour of things like price and quote depth (the ability to sell without significantly moving prices).”However, quote depth was not a term with which David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P, was immediately familiar. He agrees that everyone has their own way of calculating liquidity, and his firm primarily looks at turnover rates, price and trading days.Yet with minimal differences between the major market products, providers have been forced to look for other sources of income. They traditionally make their money from two main revenue streams. The first and most common is through licensing their indices to different types of market participants. These include ETF providers, fund managers and investment banks, which use the indices as the basis for their own products. The second revenue source is the provision of underlying data for the index products. This information can be used for academic research, for example, or benchmarking.However, with so much competition, these revenue streams are under pressure and firms have had to diversify. MSCI Barra is heavily involved with analytics and S&P offers ratings. Thomson Reuters has its well-established data feeds. Dow Jones and Stoxx claim to be the only providers relying on being pure index sponsors, believing their credibility and standing in the market alone are enough to compete. But few in the industry believe any operator is truly a pure index sponsor as the pressures to compete have forced companies to search for other sources of income.The competition has been the fiercest in the hunt for new clients and markets. Even though the major market indices are some of the most widely used index products in the industry, providers still see plenty of room for growth. While they foresee more growth for their less developed indices, such as those in sectors, styles, emerging markets and alternatives, they are adamant there is plenty to be had for the majors.Several firms say the Middle East is a region ripe with new potential clients. Thomson Reuters and S&P have been particularly aggressive there. Mr Clark says sovereign wealth funds in the region have been regularly asking for more index products, especially those that are sharia-compliant.At MSCI Barra, Ted Niggli, head of indices, sees opportunities in China and Brazil and with hedge funds and institutional investors.He says: “In China the QDII [qualified domestic institutional investor] programme has allowed managers in China to manage ex-China funds. Many places in the world are opening up and it’s especially interesting in China and Brazil.”Many of these emerging market indices are now beginning to exhibit characteristics of the major markets and this in itself is proving to be an area for growth.FTSE recently upgraded Korea’s stock exchange from an advanced emerging market to developed market status.Andrew Buckley, executive director-strategy for the FTSE Group, believes the development of these markets will create new opportunities for the providers.FTSE’s strategy will be to make new exchange partnerships that will put it in a position to be the authority on the indexing of those respective markets, he says. He points to existing arrangements in places such as Taiwan, Spain, Singapore and Italy. and hints that many more could follow.
652;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-11-01T08:58:53Z;The right tools for emerging market benchmarks;;"Emerging market equity indices have evolved in the past 20 years, providing greater liquidity, a broad range of countries and regions for investors who want to move outside domestic or developed markets, and ease of access.When MSCI Barra, an index provider that has been in the business more than 40 years, launched the MSCI Emerging Market Index in 1988 it represented only about 1 per cent of the All Countries World Index (Acwi) – a combination of developing and developed markets. “Since then we have seen tremendous growth. Today it represents about 12 per cent of the Acwi,” says Dimitris Melas, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa applied research at MSCI Barra. Institutional investor appetite to extend portfolios across borders or to measure investment performance against more far-flung benchmarks has triggered an exponential growth in the number of emerging market indices. These focus on single countries such as Korea, Taiwan or China or cover wider regions such as the Middle East or Africa. Thomson Reuters, a new player in the indices business, has just brought out a new regional index for European emerging markets.“Some countries such as China are so important and high profile that high net worth and retail investors are investing as well as institutional ones,” says Andrew Buckley, strategy director at the FTSE Group. Indices such as the FTSE Xinhua China Index, a joint venture with Xinhua Financial Network, are among the most popular ways into the country, he says. They are used as performance benchmarks, and as the basis for derivative trading and index tracking funds.So how are emerging market equity indices constructed and what makes them investable? Alka Banerjee, vice-president of global equities at Standard & Poor’s Index Services says they are designed in the same way as developed market indices. A basic definition of a market is needed. Is Ghana an emerging or a frontier market? The answer comes from the “liquidity of the market, its size, trading frequency and infrastructure”, she says.The definition of market infrastructure includes whether there are regulatory authorities, what the settlement and custody requirements are, the tax system, trading facilities, foreign exchange trading facilities, and whether it is possible to invest directly in a country.“We make sure there are no trading bottlenecks in our indices and we are concerned about liquidity and trading access. Otherwise if a company is likely to become bankrupt we would have to take it off the index,” says Ms Banerjee.This means screening companies before adding them to an index and assessing relative value to size, determining how many shares are held by government and how much is freely floated.“It is essential to select a stock market that meets all these requirements, before arriving at a list of emerging markets that are investable,” she adds. S&P covers 22 emerging markets and 35 frontier markets.Each index provider measures a market against a similar list of requirements. “The criteria are clear for anyone investing in an emerging market. It is all about transparency,” says Mr Buckley. In the FTSE Group, a full list of quality criteria has to be met by developed markets but fewer are required for emerging markets and less for frontier markets.“Institutional investors expect free access to developed markets but in emerging markets this will be less so. However they can be operational and relatively efficient,” says Mr Melas.Ms Banerjee goes further. “Information and transparency have evolved enormously in the past few years. Larger frontier markets in the Gulf Co-operation Council countries are trying to come up to speed now,” she says.Faced with an ever-growing number of indices, how do index product providers decide which index to track? If a product provider is using an index as a benchmark it is essential to make sure it suits the investment objectives in terms of country and sector needs.“It is vital to get it right as there are transition costs to changing a benchmark and it can be time-consuming,” says Mr Buckley.When it comes to exchange traded fund providers it is essential they can replicate the index, so size is important, index providers say. “We try to strike a balance between replication, investability and market size, like our competitors,” says Mr Melas.Other criteria involved in the choice include the quality of data provided and how well and quickly they are conveyed to fund managers, including ETF
managers.A characteristic of markets – and particularly emerging markets – is their dynamic nature. Most index providers have a permanent market watch list to monitor such changes. The shift from frontier to emerging market or from the latter to a developed market, as economies grow and stock exchanges become more mature, liquid and better regulated, is an ever-changing factor. The reverse also happens as economies and markets shrink.On the FTSE index watch list, United Arab Emirates is scheduled to move up to secondary emerging market index status from next September and Malta promoted to frontier level, while Argentina will be demoted to frontier market. Similarly, in May, MSCI will classify Israel as a developed market in its indices instead of an emerging market, while other possible candidates to follow a similar route include Korea and Taiwan.“These [shifts] are vital for institutional investors who follow our indices. Some will sell but others will be attracted to the changing markets,” says Mr Melas."
653;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-09-17T19:31:31Z;Re-emerging markets;;"“Decoupling” – the notion that emerging economies could ignore a slowdown in developed economies – went from being an investment buzzword in 2007 to a bad joke after the synchronised crash in 2008. It is little surprise that, along with other risky assets, emerging market investments have recovered more sharply than developed ones since the March lows. The odd part is how they have subsequently overshot. This decoupling makes as little sense as it did two years ago.The MSCI Barra index of emerging equity markets has beaten the Dow Jones Industrials by about 20 percentage points since before Lehman’s collapse, and by almost 40 since early March. Trailing valuations are the highest in almost a decade. Bonds show a similar exuberance. The excess yield over US Treasury notes in the benchmark EMBI+ Index is now about 320 basis points, less than just before Lehman’s collapse. Since financial markets’ nadir in early March, a Brazilian 10-year sovereign bond has seen its yield drop 208 basis points even as the US 10-year note’s yield has risen 52bp.If the world is still a riskier place than those blissful pre-Lehman days, it stands to reason that emerging economies are too. True, their simpler financial systems escaped the toxic waste that sank developed peers, and those with resource-rich economies are newly attractive. But it is also true that developing countries lack key advantages in a slow or no-growth world.Even those with mountains of hard currency cannot print more dollars at will. Meanwhile, their nascent middle classes have kept up spending only in countries utilising stimuli, such as China; they have retreated elsewhere. The past year has been a reminder that emerging economies have no monopoly on financial meltdowns. But this should not obscure their greater dependence on global growth.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
654;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-09-13T07:27:37Z;Media group steps into indices market;;Thomson Reuters is throwing its hat into the index provision ring with the launch of a range of branded indices.“We’re doing this mainly because clients have asked us,” said Sunand Menon, managing director of Thomson Reuters Indices. “Clients and markets are demanding more choice and alternatives to what is currently available.”Index providers have come into the spotlight recently following reports News Corp’s Dow Jones index business is up for sale. Thomson Reuters had been mentioned as a possible buyer, but has refused to comment.Instead, it is bringing to the market its own family of 800 indices, covering some 44 countries, 18 regions and 10 business sectors. This latter is what Mr Menon described as “a key value proposition”. He said the Thomson Reuters business sector classification system is more granular and therefore more precise than that of rivals.Mr Menon said another advantage of the new indices will be their emphasis on investibility. Thomson Reuters will use a liquidity filter to ensure each index represents the market as a fund manager might actually hold it, hoping to bypass companies that are listed but do not trade.Most measures of liquidity focus on volumes traded, but Thomson Reuters looks at how easy it is to find a price for a share. “There’s no liquidity if there’s no price to be found,” pointed out Mr Menon.For the moment, the indices all cover equity markets, but the company plans to extend its coverage into other asset classes soon, as well as offering “alpha indices”, designed to outperform standard capitalisation-weighted indices, and customised indices.Thomson Reuters will be competing with the likes of FTSE (a joint venture between the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange), Dow Jones, Standard & Poor’s and MSCI Barra. Several of these index providers are clients of Thomson Reuters, which has offered index calculation services for several decades.“It will come as no surprise [to our competitors],” said Mr Menon. “They’re very, very aware of our capabilities, but we have a formidably competitive offering.”Thomson Reuters is not planning to compete primarily on price, believing its classification and liquidity methodologies are sufficiently distinctive to make its product superior to rivals. “There has been huge customer demand [for us to provide indices] due to the limitations and lack of flexibility from other providers,” he said.However, Mr Menon added there would be efficiencies in the process that would mean clients might save money by using Thomson Reuters indices. Because the data provider already gathers and distributes data from many stock exchanges to other index providers, it will be able to cut out at least one link in the chain.Mr Menon said many index users already used some services of Thomson Reuters, so using their indices as well would make life easier. “It’s clear from a customer’s perspective that a single point of contact and accountability is desirable,” he said.Index provision is a profitable business for the current incumbents. MSCI Barra, for example, reported an earnings margin before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of nearly 50 per cent in its last results. “We wouldn’t be entering the branded index market if we didn’t think it was a great business to be in,” said Mr Menon.
655;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-09-02T16:12:13Z;Index row hits Saudi stock exchange;;Sluggish trading during Ramadan has been enlivened by a spat between MSCI Barra, an index supplier, and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul stock exchange.At issue is a demand that Tadawul allow the index provider unimpeded access to the data it collates and how MSCI sells that data on to end-users such as fund managers.Tadawul is demanding payment for that information and says it has signed agreements with other index providers, such as Standard & Poor’s, to provide alternative indices. MSCI has said it may be forced to discontinue its indices containing Saudi securities.At present, only investors from the countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council can freely trade shares in Saudi Arabia. However, the exchange has been moving steadily to liberalise this. Last year, the Saudi Capital Markets Authority (CMA) allowed foreign investors to trade shares by entering into swap agreements with “authorised persons” in the kingdom.Indices are important because of the weight of funds that follow them. As far as index builders are concerned, Saudi Arabia accounts for half of the market capitalisation of GCC markets and about three-quarters of the value of securities traded.MSCI says: “As a matter of principle and policy, MSCI cannot agree to grant stock exchanges pre-approval rights on MSCI’s ability to license its own indices.”Sources close to Tadawul say that they “are disappointed with MSCI’s stance but note that other index providers are completely comfortable with Tadawul’s terms and conditions”.Hashem Montasser, head of asset management at EFG-Hermes in Dubai, says the current impasse is unlikely to cause a large outflow of funds because institutional investment in Saudi Arabia is at an early stage.“Those that are in it [the Tadawul] from the institutional investor community know the market and are not necessarily bench-marked. Those that are not will probably wait,” Mr Montasser says.“It will certainly have an effect medium- to long-term by sending the wrong signal…I can’t think of it being in any way positive…It is a fairly minor situation that can be mitigated quickly by both sides. We know that the CMA and the Saudi authorities want to become more integrated into the international investor community.”Giyas Gokkent, economist at National Bank of Abu Dhabi, is concerned because of the impact on international funds investing in the region.“For any fund that is benchmarking against these indices it is a big issue. It is a very, very important issue for fund managers. I cannot emphasise enough just how important it is,” Mr Gokkent says.“From our perspective, if you look at large international exchanges, that should be the standard to follow. Making investing in equities more expensive is not the way to go.”A London-based fund manager, who asked not to be named, is forthright. “It’s bloody annoying, because I don’t know what my index is from one day to the next. It just seems to be posturing by both parties, and we have no sense of what is going on.”

News Corp and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Industry executives speculated that interest could come from competitors such as Standard & Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill, FTSE, a joint venture between the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, MSCI Barra or Russell.An auction could also attract exchanges including NYSE Euronext, or financial information providers such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, they added. McGraw, MSCI, NYSE, Russell, Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters declined to comment while FTSE did not return calls.The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, puts one of the best known financial information brands up for grabs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, while tracking just 30 stocks, has become a byword for the performance of US markets.The Journal reported that a buyer or joint venture partner could change the name of the benchmark index, although this could not be verified.News Corp has released no figures for the index business since the takeover, but in Dow Jones’ last earnings as an independent company, it reported a
29.2 per cent jump in revenues to $101m for the first nine months of 2007.The 160-staff business enjoyed margins of more than 25 per cent.The business, which compiles 130,000 indices, makes money from licensing them for use as the basis of investment products. It has served as a counterweight to the group’s flagship newspaper, whose exposure to volatile advertising markets has forced News Corp to write down Dow Jones by $2.8bn.The first Dow Jones index appeared in 1884 in the Customers’ Afternoon Letter, launched by Charles Dow and Edward Jones.The sale talks come as News Corp is looking to build on the Journal’s status as one of the few newspapers with a paying online subscriber base. The group is in non-exclusive talks with the publishers of the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune about a planned pooled website."
657;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-07-22T16:00:36Z;Index upgrades halted;;"When index provider MSCI Barra announced last month that it would not upgrade the stock markets of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to its influential emerging markets index, investors largely shrugged.The index provider had already held extensive talks with asset managers and indicated that an upgrade of the three markets was unlikely.Kuwait had never been considered a likely candidate for a promotion from the Frontiers Markets Index.But the UAE and Qatar emerged slightly better, and are on review for an upgrade. However, asset managers fret that the financial crisis may derail reforms. Many doubt that the two countries will be taken up even next year.“When new, emerging economies are slapped by a crisis, they can often react by withdrawing into a shell and halting reforms,” says Fadi Al Said, regional head of equities at ING Investment Management. “I’m really worried that this could happen with the Gulf markets.”The index provider attributed the decision on Qatar and UAE mainly to a lack of segregation between proprietary and client trading accounts – and to onerous restrictions on foreign
ownership.Both Qatar and the UAE cap foreign ownership of onshore companies at 49 per cent, and in many cases individual companies have much lower caps, restricting the free-float available to international investors.MSCI Barra said that the UAE regulator is expected to come out with a new regulation dealing with the lack of separation between trading and custody accounts soon. But asset managers say restrictions on foreign ownership will be one of the largest impediments to index upgrades for Qatar and the UAE.Indeed, some companies in the UAE are lowering their foreign ownership caps. In Qatar, the five largest companies on the exchange – accounting for more than half the market capitalisation – enforce a 25 per cent limit on foreign ownership.“There is room for foreign investors to buy into bluechips like Industries Qatar, but given the size of the index-tracking funds, they will have to increase it further if they want to be taken up,” says Ahmed Al-Hammadi, head of EFG-Hermes’ asset management arm in Qatar.There are also other issues of concern to international investors. For example, regulators in the UAE and Qatar do not yet allow derivatives or short-selling.“It’s not just an issue of shorting for the sake of shorting, but to be able to hedge your exposure to a stock or index. This is important to many investors,” says Ali Khan, managing director of equities at Arqaam Capital in Dubai.The stakes are considerable. Fund managers estimate that an index upgrade could lead to a doubling of trading volumes in the exchanges. More passive, international capital could also help smooth the infamously volatile equity markets in the Gulf.But bankers doubt that succour from international, index-tracking investors will be forthcoming any time soon.“We have a higher chance of being included next year, but no one is presently placing any bets on it,” says Mr Hammadi."
658;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Oil rules Gulf equities after blow to bourses;;Gulf bourses suffered a blow to their esteem last week when MSCI Barra, the index compiler, said it would not be upgrading the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar to emerging market status.The decision leaves all six Gulf Co-operation Council states monitored by MCSI Barra – the others are Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia – designated as frontier markets.Though the MSCI statement had little direct effect on trading, analysts say the structural problems highlighted by it, including low trading volumes and curbs on foreign investment, continue to hamper the development of local markets.“You still have heavy restrictions on foreign ownership of stocks, and this causes liquidity constraints. Until those constraints are removed, no one expects to see any change in the classifications,” says Matthew Wakeman, managing director for cash and equity-linked trading at EFG-Hermes in Dubai.It had been hoped that an upgrade to emerging market status would trigger a tide of money invested in tracker funds. Local market watchers say that without those funds, things will continue much as they were before.“These classifications are not widely followed by retail investors, and of course most markets in the GCC are still heavily dominated by retail investors,” Mr Wakeman says.In the absence of institutional analysis, GCC markets continue to follow global equity sentiment. Local indices tumbled this week after sharp declines in world markets and a further drop in oil prices, which have slid more than 10 per cent in the last two weeks from a six-month high of $73 a barrel.“At the moment markets are highly correlated to oil,” Mr Wakeman says. “Gulf stocks might follow US stocks, but US stocks are following oil prices, so whichever way you look at it, the tail is wagging the dog.”Market turmoil over the last year has made many countries nervous about pursuing regulatory ref­orms, says MSCI, although it has seen enough improvements to warrant keeping the UAE and Qatar under review for an upgrade in June next year.On Sunday, Doha launched Qatar Exchange in partnership with NYSE Euronext, an international exchanges operator.The Qatari deal follows a similar partnership bet­ween Dubai’s government and Nasdaq to create Nasdaq Dubai.Through its new Scandinavian subsidiary OMX, Nasdaq is also negotiating a contract to help develop the trading system at the Kuwait Stock Exchange, the bourse’s officials said on Monday.The path for foreign and institutional investors has also become a little smoother in certain markets. Saudi Arabia opened a chink in its armour last year by allowing international investors to access its equity market through the use of swaps.“The potential for long-term investors is really quite good, as the scope for economic recovery in the GCC is much greater than that of debt-laden countries,” says an equity analyst based in Bahrain.“Yes, the dominance of retail investors creates volatility, but if you are prepared to put up with a choppy ride, there are some very good opportunities in the market for those with a six-to-12-month view.”
659;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-05-13T15:29:33Z;Spring in the step of Gulf equity markets;;Spring has been good to the Gulf’s equity markets. Over the past three months, all bourses have risen by at least double digits, and all but Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar have now returned to a positive year-to-date performance.Global markets have also rallied, but fund managers in the region say there have been many local catalysts to spur renewed optimism. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, they say, governments are continuing to apply economic remedies, and first-quarter earnings have largely been heartening.Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, has recommended that investors increase their exposure to Arab stock markets, arguing that “despite a sharp cyclical contraction in growth this year due to falling oil revenues, we think the region will be one of the more resilient to the global downturn”.The case is strengthened by the fact that Arab shares are at their cheapest level relative to emerging markets for two years, the investment bank says in a research note.There is still concern over the sustainability of the international equity rally, but the worst is behind the Gulf markets, says Ali Khan, managing director of Arqaam Capital.“The wheels didn’t come completely off in the sectors that were a concern, such as banking and real estate, and there have been some key catalysts that show that we are in a better place than we were last autumn,” he says. “It doesn’t feel like a bear market rally.”Indeed, the lock-step link to global markets eased last month. According to MSCI Barra, the correlation between its world and Gulf Co-operation Council indices was only 8 per cent in April, down from a year-to-date factor of 35 per cent.The correlation between emerging markets and the Gulf has also dropped, from 49 per cent so far this year to 23 per cent in April.However, there are still causes for concern for investors in Gulf markets. As summer approaches, large numbers of locals and expatriates are expected to leave for more amenable climes – leading to a slump in trading volumes.“Markets have done very well recently, but as we move into the hot Middle Eastern summer and then into Ramadan in August, you could see volumes drop sharply and profit-taking,” cautions Emad Mostaque, a fund manager at Pictet Asset Management.Gulf banks still appear more robust than their international counterparts, but most analysts expect non-performing loans to start appearing in second-quarter results, which are due to be released over the summer, and to mount throughout the year. Lending standards have been “lax” in recent years, says Mr Mostaque, particularly in the United Arab Emirates.“The banking sector could be hit by rising non-performing loans, and banking fears could revisit the markets later this year and act as a negative catalyst,” says Mr Khan.Bankers also stress that, while the close correlation between global and Gulf markets has eased lately, negative international news is still likely to affect local sentiment, and investors should still buckle down for a bumpy ride.“Volatility is still with us,” says Jamal al-Kishi, head of Deutsche Securities in Saudi Arabia.
660;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
661;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-04-22T14:45:25Z;Dividend boost for investors unlikely to last;;In addition to enjoying a recent rally in most regional markets, Gulf investors are receiving another welcome boost: dividend payments for 2008.Middle East companies, and Gulf-based corporates in particular, have traditionally been generous with dividends. Leading shareholders often exert great pressure on boards to be generous with dividends, even when management foresees tough times and wants to retain earnings.Thus, while the economic and financial outlook deteriorated sharply towards the end of 2008, it was still overall a bumper year for profits, and boards have disbursed some of this to shareholders.According to MSCI Barra calculations for the Financial Times, the dividend yield for Gulf countries was a healthy 7.1 per cent by the end of the first quarter, and 6.8 per cent for companies in its wider Arabian Markets index. This compares to a dividend yield of about 3.9 per cent for both the MSCI World and Emerging Markets indices.Dividend yield measures dividends paid as a percentage of the underlying share price. In theory, the higher the yield the more investors get for their buck.Fifteen months earlier, Gulf companies were tracking international practice much more closely.The dividend yield of Gulf stock markets was 2.5 per cent in the year ending December 2007, almost the same as the MSCI World Index dividend yield of 2.3 per cent that year, according to MSCI Barra.However, the steep rise in the dividend yield last year is a product of both precipitous share price declines and bumper earnings for the first three quarters of the year. Analysts and money managers warn that shareholders will have to pare down drastically their dividend expectations for this year.“We are only now feeling the full effect of the crisis, and the cash crunch,” says Walid Hayeck, head of asset management at The National Investor, an Abu Dhabi-based investment bank. “Most balance sheets are under cash pressure, so dividends may be cut.”Profits across all industries are expected to fall from their supercharged level of recent years, and expansion finance will be difficult to raise from all banks, analysts say. This will likely spur Gulf companies to seek to retain as much profits as possible.One way to do this would be to increase the amount of bonus share dividends, already popular with regional companies.“Instead of giving it to investors and then trying to take it back, they just retain earnings to raise capital, and give investors bonus shares for the same amount,” says Ahmed al-Hammadi, head of asset management for EFG-Hermes in Qatar.While this makes sense for companies keen on retaining cash, for shareholders it simply acts as a share split as all investors receive the same bonus shares – albeit shares in a better capitalised company, points out Sean Gardiner, head of regional research at Morgan Stanley in Dubai.Analysts expect some industries and companies to issue healthy dividends, such as telecommunications groups and utilities.But the dividend expectations of most investors will have to be “revisited”, according to Mr Gardiner.
662;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-04-05T07:56:49Z;All systems in for a change;;"Risk management has always had an uneasy relationship with asset management, especially in boom times. Risk managers have frequently been treated with near contempt, with some fund managers viewing them as a barrier to higher profits and a more fluid operating system.Yet with markets crashing around the globe, both regulators and traders are asking themselves how their risk management systems got it so horribly wrong, and what should be done to improve them.Top of the review list is value at risk (Var), probably the most widely used measure of the risk of loss on a portfolio of assets. Loosely defined as the maximum potential loss of a portfolio with a certain probability over a given time period, it is now being viewed as largely insufficient as it only deals with standard deviations and does not factor in extreme situations where everything is correlated.Dawid Konotey-Ahulu, a partner at Redington Partners, says Var is not dead as a concept, but it needs to be enhanced and other factors need to play a part in
analysis.He says: “Lately we’ve seen more demand for stress testing and a focus on more micro-factors like asset sensitivity and volatility. Var still works, but we’ve got to go further.”Frank Nielsen, head of Americas analytics research at MSCI Barra, and Andy White, head of Thomson Reuters’ risk division, take harder lines. They see Var as effectively outdated and speak of a risk management system that needs to change both in structure and technique.Mr White says: “You had banking units operating in isolation. One part might do asset-backed securities and in a neighbouring section there might be equities.“Both would have the view that the only risk that could impact them was their own. You had siloed businesses. So it was no surprise that when a CEO would inquire on exposure to something like Lehman, they didn’t have the complete information. They would have to migrate through dozens of departments.”Mr Nielsen believes new risk management programmes will have to find ways to break down these walls and integrate all of the underlying assets.He says: “We’re trying to provide tools that will calculate Var in a number of ways by calculating several factors.“The strength of this approach is that in addition to overall risk, you can also break it down into its different components. It tells you where the risk is coming from and how sensitive certain assets are.”Unfortunately a recent survey from KPMG concluded that banks are not doing enough to revamp their risk management. Figures showed that only 42 per cent of banking executives have made or plan to make fundamental changes to their risk processes.However, Nigel Harman, partner at the firm, says the low figure is not all bad news. “At least the root of the problem is being acknowledged.“In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, many respondents felt it was all too easy to blame a culture of chasing further revenue in a time of easy credit or remuneration policies that did not encourage sustainable, long-term shareholder value.“In some ways, those were red herrings, contributory factors for sure, but factors that should have been addressed, and possibly curtailed, by a robust risk management framework. I believe a key part of the healing process will be to overhaul the whole framework for managing risk, not just to focus on isolated issues.”The banks themselves have preferred not to comment on their current risk strategies and systems, but risk managers at companies like JPMorgan and Citigroup speaking on condition of anonymity have said they have never been busier.Their jobs are possibly the most secure and they speak of their desks being moved from the back office and closer to upper management.It remains to be seen how their risk management systems will change specifically, but it looks set to be a larger part of their business in the coming years."
663;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-01-25T19:32:09Z;‘Quant creator’ says now is a good time to be different;;"Conversation with the co-author of a book entitled Active Portfolio Management: Quantitative Theory and Applications sounds like it could be hard work. As it turns out, Ronald Kahn, who is in charge of developing new active equity strategies for Barclays Global Investors, proves fluent in plain English when we meet at BGI’s London office. (PDF)According to the reviews of the book on Amazon.com, Mr Kahn and co-author Richard Grinold (who is director of research at BGI) “essentially invented quantitative finance in its modern form”, and their book, first published in 1995, is “the bible of active quantitative portfolio management”.Such fan mail is flattering, but Mr Kahn, who is based in San Francisco, says the book pulled together a lot of the ideas around at the time and put them in a rigorous framework, building on the work of William Sharpe, one of the originators of the capital asset pricing model, and Barr Rosenberg, who set up Barra (now MSCI Barra) and Axa Rosenberg, the asset manager now majority owned by Axa.However, Mr Kahn is prepared to take credit for “probably doing more than others” to widen understanding and acceptance of the quantitative approach to active portfolio management, which essentially involves building computer models to pick stocks.However, he says it is not about looking for patterns in historical data, as quant management is sometimes presented. He sums up the approach as being about skill, diversification and efficiency. “You need to develop skill at picking stocks, apply it across a lot of stocks and not apply constraints.” The main constraint to avoid is being long-only, seeking to make money only from rising prices, he adds.Asked about how BGI tests its ideas, he says it is tricky. “You can look at an idea and see how it would have done, but that is not the same as knowing it will work over the next five years.“We look at the economic sensibility of an idea and why the market doesn’t understand it and we do.”He cites the example of an idea about the quality of earnings developed by Richard Sloan in the 1990s when he was at the Wharton School (now on staff at BGI). Mr Sloan found the stock market was slow to differentiate between cashflow and non-cash accruals, such as depreciation and changes in inventory levels. “The economic idea was that cashflow was more persistent and if accruals were growing it was probably not sustainable,” says Mr Kahn.Buying companies with high quality earnings and shorting those most dependent on accruals proved a good strategy “until the market figured it out”, he says.The market is catching up with the quants’ ideas ever faster. A strategy used to work for five to 10 years, he says, but increasing competition and more ideas coming out of academia have changed that.Still, the basic aim remains the same: to produce consistent outperformance through overweighting stocks that go up and underweighting ones that go down. Traditional managers try to do the same, and Mr Kahn acknowledges they have good ideas but says they have a poor way of implementing them. “If you have a 30 stock portfolio and you want to beat the FTSE, you will include bets you hadn’t intended to take.”By contrast, BGI’s flagship market neutral fund invests across many markets and includes more than 1,000 long and short positions, so if something goes wrong with one it has a small impact. “One reason for doing that is because we know we aren’t that great,” says Mr Kahn. “We think we can be right 55 per cent of the time. That’s why it only works if you diversify.”At the overall portfolio level BGI expects to be right three years out of four, he adds. That is a valuable skill, he maintains, even if the outperformance produced is small. “Because if you care about performance over 10 years it is really important if you can add a bit every year.“We don’t have any expectations of being the best performer over one year but over 10 years the hope is we look like the best ever
manager.” BGI was unable to make performance figures available to help make that judgement, however, citing US legal reasons, remarking only that, since inception, the flagship strategy has outperformed its benchmark for 19 of the past 23 years.Fundamental managers claim quants cannot take into account nuances brought to light by detailed research or company visits, such as finding that an important patent is about to expire. Mr Kahn has clearly dealt with this sort of objection before. “We wouldn’t look at a company and say, here is a patent about to expire. But we would say patent expiration is important for pharmaceutical companies and look across the industry at the issue.“We are always trying to figure out how to take qualitative factors and add them to the analysis.”The reputation of quant managers has suffered since the credit crisis hit, with varied strategies being affected in the same way at the same time by market conditions. Mr Kahn says BGI is not in that position. “We’ve done OK – better than lots of others.” But the experience of the credit crisis has renewed the group’s interest in being different.“What we’ve learned is that sometimes if lots of people try to do the same things they will have correlated performance. We focus on trying to do different things. We invest in proprietary ideas and data and are trying to move away from generic ideas because they are hurt the most when you get deleveraging.”BGI will override its models in abnormal conditions, he adds, and did have to make some adjustments as a result of the shorting bans imposed in many parts of the world last autumn.But he reckons the quant approach should work in most market conditions, and says volatile markets can be good for active managers as they throw up opportunities.Mr Kahn is a physicist by academic training, specialising in cosmology. Wall Street has good reason to hire physicists, he says. They are trained in quantitative problem solving, and to identify and focus on what is really important, ignoring the rest.In the book How I became a quant, by Barry Schachter and Richard R. Lindsey, Mr Kahn, who merits a chapter, says: “That skill is . . . even more important where there are typically no underlying laws of nature, and problems are mainly about reasonably approximating reality.”"
664;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-01-21T16:27:32Z;State interventions fail to pay off;;When Kuwait’s government – under pressure from irate, day-trading citizens – announced late last year that it would support domestic equity prices, a Kuwaiti banker observed ruefully: “Moral hazard doesn’t exist in the Gulf.”Oman would seem to agree. Last week the government announced it would proceed with an OR150m ($389m) stock market stabilisation fund to offer succour to the Muscat Stock Exchange, which lost 41 per cent last year.Qatar also decided to intervene last year – albeit in a roundabout way. The Qatar Investment Authority, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, said it would buy stakes of up to 20 per cent in all the country’s banks through fresh share sales, thereby injecting extra capital for lending and extending its gold-plated sovereign guarantee across the sector.But how much has government intervention helped? Not much, according to asset managers and analysts.“Let’s call it [Oman’s move] what it is: an investor bail-out, not a ‘market stabilisation’ fund,” says Zahed Chowdhury, Deutsche Bank’s regional head of research. “It’s a rescue for existing investors, but doesn’t support the market in any way. The extra money just disappears.”Direct government intervention in public markets has been most pronounced in Kuwait, but even there the stock market has lost more than 40 per cent of its value in the past three months, according to MSCI Barra.The bourse has not been helped by the travails of embattled investment companies, but money managers say the clumsy attempt to prop up the stock market has exacerbated the situation by unsettling investors.“Kuwait did it in a confusing way, backwards and forwards, with different figures for the rescue thrown around, and with a lack of co-ordination,” says Fadi Al-Said, regional head of equities at ING Investment Management. “They hoped that a lot of announcements would bolster sentiment – but it has done the opposite. Investors don’t like uncertainty.”Though rescue packages “aren’t a good idea” anywhere, Qatar has handled its intervention better, says Mr Said. “Qatar has beefed up the capital of banks, and this is a cleverer way of doing it. It was done at market prices, didn’t crowd out or save existing shareholders, and will help support growth.”Nonetheless, the Doha stock exchange has continued to tumble, losing more than a quarter of its value already this year. Oman is down a fifth and Kuwait has lost nearly 15 per cent, following record losses last year.Interventions could also do lasting damage to the Gulf’s capital markets by continuing to foster an expectation of government rescues whenever losses mount, says a local fund manager. “Governments are seen as a white knight, but short-term investments only lead to long-term problems,” he says.Oman, with a projected 2009 budget deficit of about OR810m – or about 5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product – would perhaps be wise to hold its fire and spend its capital on more effective measures to support growth than buying public companies.
665;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-01-14T13:19:41Z;Gulf indices likely to be excluded from EM benchmark;;MSCI Barra, the global market index provider, indicated last month that it would not include three large Gulf stock markets in its main emerging markets index, mainly due to “stringent” foreign ownership restrictions.The result of MSCI Barra’s preliminary assessment of the equity markets of the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait doused hopes that an inclusion in the important emerging markets index would bring a flood of passive, index-tracking capital into the region.The UAE’s two main stock markets in Dubai and Abu Dhabi were the premier contenders to join the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.However, the index provider said on 16 December that while the UAE was advanced in terms of market accessibility, the country suffered from a lack of segregation of custody and trading accounts, as well as the severe foreign ownership limits of Emirati companies.Kuwait and Qatar are even less likely to be included despite being the oldest and the best performing stock markets in the region respectively.“Kuwait still exhibits significant shortcomings in terms of market accessibility,” MSCI Barra said. “International investors have particularly expressed serious concerns relative to the disclosure and enforcement of market regulations as well as to the quality of the information flow.”While MSCI Barra expected improvements on the regulatory front in Qatar, the “persistence of … very low foreign ownership significantly limits accessibility of the market.”The index provider said it would continue monitoring developments and consulting with investors, and announce its conclusions no later than June 2009.A senior Dubai-based banker said restrictions on foreign investments were likely to stay. “The mood has swung against foreign capital as people said it was hot money. The perception is that less foreign capital is a good thing.”Early in 2008, overseas investors piled into Gulf stocks, hoping that elevated oil prices would decouple the region from financial woes elsewhere, and as a bet on possible currency revaluations amid rising inflation.However, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September and the worsening of the global financial crisis, international investors have led an exodus out of Gulf stock markets, helping send the MSCI’s Gulf index towards its worst performance in years in 2008.“With foreign investors heading out, there is less focus on corporate governance and less pressure for transparency,” the banker added.This story has been corrected to show 16 December a the date of publication of MSCI Barra’s preliminary assessment.
666;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2009-01-07T18:26:23Z;Reasons to be upbeat amid the gloom;;Last year was a torrid one for Gulf investors, who saw $535bn of stock value evaporate from local markets. They now face a dramatically different financial landscape, but some may glimpse opportunities amid the detritus.According to Markaz, a Kuwaiti investment bank, more than a third of companies in the Middle East and North Africa are now trading below book value. In the Gulf, the average price of equities has dropped to 1.3 times book value, from 3.7 times at the start of last year. Price to earnings ratios have slumped – sometimes to low single digits.Causes for optimism can also be made out through the clouds. Oil prices have rebounded slightly after falling to near a five-year low in December. Volatility – as measured by the so-called Vix index – has dropped to its lowest level since September.MSCI Barra is also considering including the Qatari, Kuwaiti and United Arab Emirates stock markets in its important emerging markets index this year, which could cause passive index-tracking money to flood in. Though economic growth forecasts for the Gulf have been slashed, no one is predicting any recessions.However, experts still urge investor caution. The global financial crisis may have been partially contained, but economists are forecasting severe knock-on effects on the real economy in 2009. This will also affect previously resilient Gulf companies, according to analysts“Investors need to make a fundamental rethink on what companies’ and sectors’ earning power is going to be,” says Sean Gardiner, Morgan Stanley’s regional head of research. “There were excesses built into company earnings” in recent years, he says.Traditional valuation ratios may look attractive, but could be misleading, according to other bankers and analysts. Several are raising questions as to the true worth of balance sheets reported by companies.“I’m not terribly optimistic,” says Anthony Mallis, head of Bahrain-based Securities and Investment Company. “The region is only starting its descent, and the slump in oil prices hasn’t been fully factored in.”The MSCI GCC Countries index may have shed more than half its value, but is still trading at a premium to many other high-growth emerging markets, particularly the Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. This may spur professional investors to look elsewhere.Mark Mobius, a widely followed observer of emerging markets at Templeton Asset Management, said last year he thought prices in the Middle East were high relative to other emerging markets.The price of oil – the Gulf’s dominant export and source of most government revenue – will be vital to the performance of regional equities in 2009, says Mr Gardiner. But few oil analysts expect a big rally with the world economy in the doldrums.The lock-step correlation with world equities may be weaker in 2009 as foreign involvement in Gulf markets has plummeted, but experts advise prudence. “The number of companies going bust will certainly be on the rise during 2009 globally and regionally,” predicts Markaz in a research note.“Capital preservation is still the name of the game,” says Mr Mallis. “There are some bottom pickers buying now, but most professional investors will probably wait until the second quarter.”
667;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-11-09T18:11:00Z;New funds: Nov 10;;● A Finnish steel company, SteelTeam, has launched what it claims is the first steel hedge fund in the world. Investing both in physical steel and futures contracts, the SFS1 fund already has sufficient seed capital to commence trading.Although steel is the world’s second largest physical commodity market after oil, it is not included in any investable commodity index and investors have until now been unable to gain exposure to it. Gustaf Kranck, chairman of the board and chief executive of SteelTeam, manages the fund, while Tommi Kemilä will be head of the fund’s managing company.Dublin-based Trinity Fund Administration will be adminstrator of the fund, while Barclays Capital will act as a clearing broker.● Undeterred by reports of impending global recession, Nordea has launched an Emerging Consumer Fund, aiming to exploit the growth of spending power among the consumers in developing countries.As people move from rural areas to the cities, a global trend expected to continue, they tend to have higher incomes, explained fund manager Leon Svejgaard Pedersen.Within the fund, Mr Pedersen has five strategies covering different segments of the wealth pyramid and invests in both international and domestic players using a top-down approach. The portfolio is managed according to the UN socially responsible investment screening requirements.● In a sign the Gulf region has not yet fallen out of favour with investors, despite falling oil prices, BNP Paribas has launched two exchange traded funds, one covering Kuwait and the other the United Arab Emirates.The Dow Jones Kuwait Titans 30 measures the performance of 30 of the largest and most liquid stocks traded on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, while the Dow Jones UAE Select Index measures the performance of the largest and most liquid stocks trading on the Dubai Financial Market, Abu Dhabi Securities Market and Dubai International Financial Exchange.● db x-trackers has listed the first four ETFs on the long and short Markit iTraxx Europe Financials indices. The four Ucits III ETFs are listed on the Deutsche Börse, allowing European investors to buy and sell credit protection on senior and subordinated financial debt in an ETF format.● Investors in Latin America can now benchmark their Peruvian portfolio, as MSCI Barra has launched its MSCI All Peru Index.This index is designed to reflect the investment opportunity set of the broad Peru equity universe and aims to represent the investment opportunity of listed companies in the broad Peru equity universe.In addition to the parent index, two capped indices are also available.The MSCI All Peru 10/40 Index is designed to accommodate the 10 per cent and 40 per cent concentration constraints on Ucits III funds, while the MSCI All Peru Capped Index allows for the 25 per cent and 50 per cent concentration constraints on funds subject to the Regulated Investment Company limitations.● Standard & Poor’s has launched the S&P/Citigroup International Treasury Bond Index Series, offering a benchmark for investments in sovereign bonds from developed markets other than the US.The new series consists of two indices – the S&P/Citigroup International Treasury Bond Index Ex-US, which includes bonds with a maturity of greater than one year, and the S&P/Citigroup International Treasury Bond Index Ex-US 1-3 Year, which includes bonds with a maturity of between one and three years.
668;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-11-02T20:29:38Z;Islamic investment products offer boost to global exposure;;"As many investors struggle to sell assets around the world, demand for shariah compliant indices is growing as Islamic investors seek to broaden ways to gain global exposure, prompting providers to step up their offerings.The market for Islamic investment products is growing at about 15-20 per cent a year and equity fund assets alone are forecast to jump from $15bn to $53bn (£33bn, €45bn) by 2010, says FTSE Group, which is seeing increased demand for shariah compliant indices across the Middle East, Europe, Asia and South Africa.“With approximately 1.5bn Muslims worldwide, there is huge growth potential for investment vehicles with a faith-based mandate,” says Imogen Dillon Hatcher, managing director of FTSE Group for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Shariah compliant investment is one of the fastest growing new areas of finance globally.”She is seeing strong interest from the Middle East for shariah compliant indices as investors “want to make more cross-regional and sector plays”.FTSE set up the Shariah Global Equity Index series made up of 96 indices earlier this year, including some for developed and emerging markets, the All-World Index series and the FTSE Shariah Multinationals 150 Index. It has also added thematic indices to the family.At index provider MSCI Barra, Christine Chardonnens, vice-president and product manager for MSCI Global Islamic Indices, also sees a growing demand from institutional investors for shariah compliant indexing, particularly in the Middle East and also from Europe.So far, MSCI Barra has more than 400 Islamic indices covering about 50 developed and emerging countries and more than 50 regions such as Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Arabian markets. And it plans to increase its range to more than 1,300 in December to meet institutional investor demand. Emerging market small cap companies and frontier markets will be part of the extended family.Investors use indexing
for benchmarks, exchange traded funds and structured products, although at MSCI Barra about 70 per cent of clients use them for benchmark purposes, says Ms Chardonnens.Standard & Poor’s launched three shariah indices – the S&P 500 Shariah Index, the Europe 350 Index and the S&P 500 Japan – as early as 2006 to track companies in the US, Europe and Japan that comply with Islamic law. “We were keen to see if there was real demand and were amazed at the extent,” says Alka Banerjee, vice-president of global equity indices.Since then S&P has expanded its coverage to 12,000 stocks with 27 major indices covering 55 countries, as well as niche sectors such as global healthcare, property and infrastructure.Most indices are constructed on the basis of existing ones and then subjected to a screening process by shariah experts to strip out companies that do not meet Islamic law requirements. “The objectives are the same [as non Islamic investors] – diversification, risk adjusted returns and transparency but the method is different,” says Ms Banerjee.The FTSE Shariah Equity index series is based on large and mid-cap stocks in the FTSE Global Equity Index series and screened by shariah consultants Yasaar Research. Stocks of companies in the alcohol, entertainment, financial services, pork products, armaments and tobacco fields are excluded, as well as those where debt is more than 33 per cent of total assets.Some countries such as Saudi Arabia have a stricter approach to investing and screening than parts of Asia. Ms Chardonnens believes this lack of standardisation detracts from a more substantial growth. “The market is still maturing,” she says.But although the objectives of Islamic investors using shariah indices are the same as mainstream investors, do they perform as well? “All shariah benchmarks [currently] outperform plain vanilla ones, especially in emerging markets, because they are often better run companies with good governance, less gearing and are less risk averse,” says Ms Dillon Hatcher.Ms Banerjee agrees. “Shariah indices have done better in the current market because the index is narrow and does not include financial stocks, although sometimes the narrowness can create more risk.”The MSCI World Islamic Index outperformed the MSCI World Index between the end of May 2007 and the end of September this year by more than 7 percentage points in dollar terms.Similarly the MSCI EM Islamic index also outperformed its standard counterpart by more than 2 percentage points.There is also an increase in the use of exchange traded funds running against shariah indices as a growing number of ETFs are being launched in Europe. But take up in the Middle East and the rest of the world is slower, say index providers.Dbx-trackers, ETF Securities and BGI have all launched shariah compliant ETFs or exchange traded commodities in the past year. ETF Securities saw trading volumes of its shariah compliant ETCs, which are traded on five European exchanges, reach $1.5bn in the first three weeks of
October.Philip Philippides, head of institutional sales, UK and Ireland at BGI iShares, has seen a flurry of ETF launches but says “we haven’t seen the [expected] level of investment in products yet”. He says investors still need to become more familiar with them."
669;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-11-02T20:29:38Z;Index providers push at global frontiers;;"Crashing markets have an adverse impact on most players in financial services. Index providers are no exception, with revenues affected by falling assets under management in products linked to their indices. But although profits might be dented, they are unlikely to disappear.The financial services industry will face a much tougher year in 2009, says Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE. “But at FTSE we would still expect to see double-digit growth in revenues and profit.” Revenue growth has been about 20 per cent this year, he adds.The index business has seen huge growth in the past two decades, with millions of indices being calculated daily around the world. It is now reaching the limits of its geographic expansion, but there are plenty of other areas to explore.There is a demand for increasingly specialised benchmarks that allow investors and fund managers to monitor performance with more precision, and for indices that take account of ethical or religious beliefs. The growth of structured products, exchange traded funds, and other vehicles linked to
indices has also fuelled expansion.The latest report from the ETF research and implementation strategy team at Barclays Global Investors shows $764bn (£492bn, €611bn) of assets under management in ETFs worldwide. This is forecast to grow to $1,000bn in 2009 and $2,000bn by 2011.Assets under management in ETFs have declined in 2008, by 4 per cent globally to the end of September. But that is much less than the market decline of 25.6 per cent in US dollar terms, measured by the MSCI World Index, according to the BGI report.The report shows Standard & Poor’s is the top index provider to the ETF market, with a 25 per cent share, followed by MSCI Barra with 20 per cent and Dow Jones/Stoxx with 10 per cent.Index providers are at the forefront of change in investment fashions in many ways. They are not innovators themselves, primarily responding to demand from clients in the new indices they construct. “But every time there is a new asset class there is a demand to bring transparency to it,” says Remy Briand, global head of index research at MSCI Barra.There is likely to be a greater demand for transparency in future. “People will want to understand better how products are constructed around indices,” he says.Exchange traded funds are robust products with a high level of transparency, which is probably why they have held up relatively well through the financial crisis, he adds.There are also concerns about the independence of index providers. This is not necessarily about ownership, but conflicts of interest that can arise where a manager runs products linked to an index it has created.In that situation, “you don’t know if the manager is doing its job properly”, says Mr Briand. Where a manager runs a product against an index from an independent provider, it is clear how well the manager is performing.He has support from an unexpected quarter.Fergus Lynch, head of index research at Deutsche Bank, says the current climate should favour independent providers. “People are more aware of the fact that a market benchmark calculated by a bank may not be such a good thing. Third party providers have an advantage now,” says Mr Lynch."
670;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-11-02T20:29:38Z;Investors fuel the drive for innovation;;Stock markets are in freefall, mutual funds face an investor exodus and investment banking products are plagued with mistrust – but exchange traded funds are growing.Net sales reached $43.6bn (£26.7bn, €33.7bn) during the first eight months of the year – a figure the asset management community is certain to be envious of.And, even though ETF assets under management have dropped 4.1 per cent year to date to $764bn because of the bear market, Barclays Global Investors says worldwide assets under management are still en route to reach $1,000bn in 2009 and $2,000bn in 2011.Index providers believe the sector has unique growth potential. Four of them – Standard & Poor’s, MSCI Barra, Dow Jones/Stoxx and Russell – gather 60 per cent of all assets.“In spite of the turmoil, ETFs have benefited from a flight of capital from various markets. Inflows have even increased in the past two months,” says John Davies, senior director for Standard & Poor’s Index Services, the largest player in the market with $187bn.“The underlying theme,” adds Mr Davies, “is a move from active into passive management. It is an efficient tool to manage money.”The number of ETFs has grown exponentially in the past few years – the first ETF was created in 1993 – with a total of 1,499 different products so far. This is set to continue with the planned launch of 601 more.“Because of the growth, it is a very attractive space and there are new players looking to go into it all the time,” Mr Davies says.Household benchmarkers such as MSCI Barra, Dow Jones/Stoxx and FTSE are battling with less-known, niche, aggressive index providers. While large players have been losing assets over the past 12 months, the group of their smallest competitors (less than 0.1 per cent of total assets under management) have grown total assets by 9.8 per cent.This group has also launched a third of all new ETFs for the past 12 months. KLD in the area of socially responsible investment, NMX for infrastructure and FXI on China are some of the new kids on the block.Among all asset classes, fixed income is currently receiving the most interest from investors, fuelling the growth of some specialised mid-sized players. EuroMTS tops the list with a 65.9 per cent growth in its assets year to date.Markit, which manufactures the iBoxx and iTraxx indices, has also had a strong run with 51.3 per cent growth during the same period.Not surprisingly, the key driver for growth in the ETF market is innovation. Many traditional benchmark indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, have been recycled in listed fund vehicles. The onus is now on developing indices that can help with the allocation of multi-asset class portfolios.“There is innovation on access to asset classes and on replicating investment strategies,” says Theodore Niggli, executive director at MSCI Barra. “The challenge for ETF providers is to make them relevant in a portfolio,” he says.Frontier market, short bond, carbon footprint, hedge fund and strategy indices are some of the products emerging at the moment.Niche players are particularly suited to the move. “The choice of the index provider depends on the underlying assets. For certain sectors, some providers would be chosen over others. Niche players can have great expertise in a particular sector or index,” says Danièle Tohmé-Adet, head of ETFs and indexed funds development for BNP Paribas Asset Management.“We pay attention to small index providers,” explains Axel Lomholt, head of ETF products for iShares, the largest ETF provider with $350bn under management. “They provide innovation, which is always attractive when it comes out with the right organisation,” he says.Deutsche Bank, for example, chose small firm LPX to build a private equity index because, explains Manooj Mistry, head of db x-trackers in the UK, it was a leader in the sector.However, in the highly skilled business of indices, large houses can also play to their strengths.“More experienced index providers have knowledge, something that can be applied to all kinds of research,” Ms Tohmé-Adet says.Liquidity is a key element in the selection process. “We would look at the index and have trading simulations to see if there are any issues. There is quite a lot of science going into it,” Mr Lomholt notes.But sometimes it does not work in practice. “It happens frequently that we receive indices that don’t meet our criteria.“It comes back to the fact that you see big daily cash inflows and outflows. And also, if the fund is not liquid, it is difficult for the market-maker to hedge himself,” explains Mr Lomholt.“Index providers sometimes don’t have the real life experience of trading the underlying securities, that is where we use our expertise,” adds Mr Mistry.In order to assess if a good ETF idea can be tradeable with sufficient ease, the index provider, the ETF licensee and the market maker often work together.But the real danger for index providers is elsewhere: not being useful for investors. “There is always a danger that people say it is just a fad. We always try to build indices that have longevity,” says Mr Davies of S&P.“The approach is to ensure there is sustainability behind the investment idea. Some ETF products will lose their attractiveness. But the key thing is to stay on top of innovation.”
671;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-11-02T20:29:38Z;Shrinking horizons are force for change;;Index provision focused initially on domestic equity markets before expanding to cover most of the world. That geographic extension is now reaching its limits. Standard & Poor’s, for example, covers more than 70 markets. “There isn’t much left to trade that hasn’t been indexed,” says David Blitzer, chairman of S&P’s index committee.The most recent expansion has been into so-called frontier markets. Mr Blitzer reports “a huge number of requests for frontier markets” in the first half of 2007. But those have now slowed down, he says, with attention moving to thematic, sector and strategy indices.MSCI Barra confirms this trend. “We spend a lot of effort moving from measuring traditional asset classes to capture more and more strategies within the asset class – what we call factors,” says Remy Briand, global head of index research.Many asset managers are looking at investment through the lens of sectors or other specific factors, he says.At FTSE, which is 50 per cent owned by the Financial Times, chief executive Mark Makepeace says short indices were all the rage until recently. “Now we are just beginning to see demand for leveraged indices, and in the environmental space.”End investors are increasingly looking at environmental, energy and climate change issues, he says. As a result, “pension funds, government funds and sovereign wealth funds see the need or feel under pressure to have clear policies on these matters. Setting up benchmarks is part of that”.Another area coming back into fashion is fundamental indices, according to Mr Makepeace. “They were in fashion, they went out, and are coming back. Our biggest clients are starting to allocate funds in this area.”Traditional indices are weighted by the market capitalisation of the stocks they include. Fundamental indices use other factors, such as earnings, dividends and the book value of companies.Their proponents claim market cap indices are flawed as they inevitably overweight highly valued companies and have less exposure to undervalued companies. Indices compiled on a different basis have the potential to outperform, they say.Mr Briand sees this as part of the demand for ways to tilt portfolios towards particular factors. A fundamental approach provides a value tilt, he says. MSCI Barra is currently looking at using the carbon footprint of companies as a means of introducing a bias to low emitting companies, he adds.Most of these new indices are variants on traditional equity indices, and equities remain the biggest source of revenue for the independent index providers. At S&P, for example, the S&P 500 accounts for a large chunk of the $5,000bn (£3,190bn, €3,988bn) of assets benchmarked to its indices, or did at the end of 2007, says Mr Blitzer. There was $1,500bn tracking the index and another $2,000bn-$3,000bn benchmarked against it.However, S&P has been expanding into other classes in recent years. It bought the Goldman Sachs commodity index in 2007 and is in discussions with users on possible extensions.One idea is to take the basic index but change the standard contract roll period of five days.S&P also calculates the Case Shiller home price indices, covering 20 metropolitan regions across the US, and launched a series of indices tracking the US commercial real estate market in 2007. It also has a few specialised fixed income indices, the biggest of which measures the US municipal bond market.It has recently launched a commercial paper index and plans to roll out a leveraged bank loans index. But Mr Blitzer sees little point in attempting to compete with the Lehman fixed income indices, now owned by Barclays Capital, which are the most widely used benchmarks.“We asked [clients] if there was any concern that the index was run by an investment bank and they said ‘no’. So for us to come in as an independent was not what the market was looking for,” he says.Aside from the Lehman indices, the independent index providers do not regard investment banks as competitors. They are mainly in the business of providing proprietary indices, says Mr Makepeace, although he notes an increasing tendency for banks to turn to the independents to calculate the indices they devise.He says index providers compete on “speed, flexibility and responsiveness to the client”. FTSE clients are “the biggest institutional investors” and the fund managers working for them, who both make a lot of use of customised benchmarks. “We earn more money from active managers than passive because so many use indices for benchmarks,” he says.
672;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-11-02T20:29:38Z;Optimism over areas for growth;;"When banks are collapsing, equities slumping to their lowest levels in years, and established financial entities being forced to run cap-in-hand to their respective governments, it is difficult to talk about innovation in any market.But according to index providers, their market is an exception and the appetite for indices remains undimmed. “The sort of market turbulence we are witnessing will not delay our push to innovate,” says Theodore Niggli, managing director and head of indices at MSCI Barra.“If anything, it will accelerate it,” he adds. “As markets get more difficult investors become more attentive to indices.”Mr Niggli points to two major areas of progress: the search and provision of new sources of beta, or asset class returns, as with the launch of “frontier” market indices; and the search for less correlated assets.This. he says, will see the birth of more currency and infrastructure indices, for example, as investors try to reduce the correlated nature of their holdings. “Sectors have become too correlated and indices will be launched to curb that,” Mr Niggli says.FTSE, the UK-based index provider, also has high hopes for “frontier” markets.At the end of July the firm extended its Global Equity Index Series and brought its FTSE Frontier 50 to market – the provider’s first index to be created from an eligible universe of 23 new frontier markets.Chief executive Mark Makepeace said at the time of launch: “Frontier equity markets today represent over $1 trillion [$1,000bn, £637bn, €797bn] in capitalisation, and are becoming attractive investment destinations for a growing number of investors worldwide.”However, Gareth Parker, director of index research and design at Standard & Poor’s, is less interested in these types of developments. He thinks market innovation will have to come from other sources, such as the target date indices S&P launched in September.“The bog standard stock market indices are just not interesting any more and are no longer an exciting area of development – that section of the market has been done to death,” he says.But Imogen Dillon Hatcher, FTSE’s managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, disagrees. “There are always going to be new parts of the world to explore and so the creation and development of stock market indices will never dry up,” she says.“There is lots of room to expand in this area especially in terms of the ‘frontier’ markets.”What FTSE is not interested in doing, she adds, “is creating benchmarks that are mathematically beautiful but do not offer anything useful to investors”.Last month the UK provider launched its All Africa 40 and All Africa ex South Africa 30 benchmarks in partnership with the JSE, the South African stock exchange.The FTSE/JSE All Africa 40 index is made up of the top 40 companies by market capitalisation from Egypt, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Morocco, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia, while the FTSE/JSE All Africa ex-South Africa 30 index consists of the top 30 companies by market capitalisation from Egypt, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Morocco, Mauritius, Nigeria and
Tunisia.Both indices are designed to be representative of the markets covered and the weighting of any single country is capped at 40 per cent of the indices.“By partnering to form these indices, FTSE and the JSE are improving the visibility of the high quality companies that exist across the continent,” Russell Loubser, JSE’s chief executive, said in a statement.But S&P’s Mr Parker is not convinced. He, like Mr Niggli, points to the proliferation of currency, infrastructure and private equity indices. These areas, he says, are exciting.“New developments will fall under two categories: new markets and asset classes, and new strategies.“Currency, private equity and infrastructure benchmarks will grow in
number as will inflation swap and hedging benchmarks, while, when it comes to strategies, momentum trading will become increasingly prominent and indices will pop up as a result,” says Mr Parker.One area he does agree with Ms Hatcher on, however, is that the current market maelstrom will not slow down the sector’s progress.“We are always busy,” he says."
673;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-10-29T18:03:06Z;Global ties hurt local bourses;;Gulf investors hoping that a rash of healthy third-quarter results would buoy stock markets and provide the spark for a period of stability must be sorely disappointed.Gulf corporations fulfilled their part. On a composite basis, about 230 companies in the region reported net profit growth of 28 per cent in the quarter, with Qatari entities surging ahead with a 67 per cent rise in profit, according to the calculations of Markaz, a Kuwaiti investment bank.Yet bourses remain in the doldrums, connected at the hip to world markets stricken by recessionary fears. As a result the MSCI Gulf index has lost almost half its value this year.“The focus on the [companies’] numbers is weak to non-existent now,” says Hashem Montasser, head of asset management at EFG-Hermes. “People only look at what happens in Europe, US and Asia to see what to do.”Previously, one of the Gulf’s attractions for international fund managers was a historical lack of correlation to world markets due to the preponderance of retail investors who paid little heed to global business cycles, preferring to trade on rumour and internet chatter.Over the past five years, the correlation between the MSCI Gulf index and the MSCI World index is a mere 7.4 per cent, but in the past three months it has incr­eased to 24.2 per cent, according to MSCI Barra. And in the past month, the correlation to MSCI’s emerging markets index has gone to 45.2 per cent compared with 11.8 per cent over the past five years.Most Gulf markets continued to mimic international trends and closed up on Wednesday after enduring days of sharp declines.The linkages between regional and global markets began increasing in 2006 when the region – particularly the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – started attracting heftier amounts of international capital.But it is the recent deepening of the crisis that has brought this correlation to unprecedented heights – even though there is still little foreign investment in the Saudi market, by far the region’s largest.A tremendous sell-off by foreigners – particularly those invested in UAE and Qatari markets – started setting the direction of markets this summer at a time when few locals were around to counter selling orders.However, “the day Lehman [Brothers] collapsed, we moved into lock-step”, Mr Montasser says.Even Saudi Arabia, one of the most insular, retail investor-oriented markets in the world, started moving in synch with investors in Asia and the US.Some analysts attribute the correlation to continuing foreign capital outflows, while others say it is panic among domestic investors.“It’s all Gulf sentiment now,” says Mandagolathur Raghu, head of research at Markaz.Regional money managers say the unhappy relationship to world markets will eventually cool.Sooner or later, the outflow of foreign capital will slow to a trickle, and while analysts are revising down country and company growth forecasts in the Gulf, most agree that the region will continue to outperform most other markets.“Detachment will happen when people understand that fundamentals trump [sentiment],” says Majid Julfar, chief executive of Univest Brokerage.
674;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
675;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-09-14T21:22:08Z;‘Magic formula’ defies all the rules;;"The efficient market hypothesis states that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market by using any information that the market already knows, except through outrageous serendipity. PDFThe growing band of converts to the concept of “minimum variance” equity portfolios would beg to differ from this statement.Geneva-based Unigestion, which was an early minimum variance pioneer, claims its European strategy has outperformed the wider market by more than 4 percentage points a year since 1999, with a five-year rolling per annum return of 13.36 per cent, against 8.90 per cent for the DJ Euro Stoxx 600 total return index and 8.66 per cent for the MSCI Europe on a total return basis.The sister US strategy, launched on January 31 this year, has the unusual distinction of being in positive territory, returning 3.1 per cent as of the end of August, while the S&P 500 total return index fell 5.7 per cent.Others are starting to take interest. State Street Global Advisors plans to launch a US minimum variance product later this month, joining adherents such as Acadian Asset Management, Axa Rosenberg and Robeco. In April, MSCI Barra launched a benchmark index.So, have these houses stumbled on the holy grail of an investment technique that breaks the efficient market hypothesis asunder – fatally undermining passive strategies based on market capitalisation weighted indices in the process?Interest in minimum variance portfolios was kick-started by research by Professor Robert Haugen, a US academic, who in 1995 claimed that a US equity portfolio designed to minimise total risk achieved an absolute return, as well as a risk-adjusted return, above that of the S&P 500.More recent studies appear to confirm the persistence of this apparent anomaly. Andrew Ang, finance professor at New York’s Columbia University, who in 2006 crunched US stock market data from the preceding 37 years, found that stocks with “low idiosyncratic volatility” tended to exhibit relatively high returns, a pattern that held in every decade.Patrick Bloomfield, partner and actuary at consultant Hymans Robertson, says: “Simplistically, any product that can provide the same level of return with a lower risk exposure has to be attractive; it’s a fund management equivalent of turning lead into gold.”The minimum variance technique aims to construct portfolios of stocks that are uncorrelated to each other, just as much as being “low variance” or low beta in their own right.In practice, managers will use filters to optimise their portfolios, although critics argue this layer of complexity is largely designed to justify their fees, which can be 1.5 per cent a year for retail investors, for what is essentially a passive strategy.Unigestion, for instance, strips out illiquid stocks and those with credit difficulties. MSCI’s Global Minimum Volatility index has constraints on the weighting of each stock, sector and country relative to benchmark.Frank Nielsen, executive director of MSCI Barra, says the strategy, backtested to 1995, would have outperformed the MSCI World index in absolute terms, with 30 per cent lower volatility and a Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, of 0.67, versus 0.45 for the index.He envisages growing interest in such “managed volatility” strategies from pension funds and insurance companies, given the increasing need for mark-to-market accounting, and says MSCI Barra is “in discussions” with providers of exchange traded funds keen to replicate its new index.“There’s a lot of people talking about it,” says Churchill Franklin, executive vice-president of Boston-based Acadian, which has $233m (£133m, €167m) in two minimum variance-style strategies, who believes the market correction has made sophisticated investors think about risk as well as return.Jean-François Hirschel of Unigestion, which manages $3bn in its minimum variance strategies, says the concept is “gaining traction”, with “a lot of money coming in” for its US fund. Unigestion has one UK pension fund on board and says it is in discussions with a large Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.However, the uptake may be dependent on market conditions. Minimum variance strategies tend to outperform in relative terms in bear markets, but can undershoot in thematically driven bull markets.""We underperform in a market driven by one thing, such as the bubble in technology. Because the model is looking for low correlation it will stay away from a sector where there is high correlation. 1999 was our worst year,” says Mr Hirschel. “We will do well in a down market because there is usually a lot of diversification then. A good way to make money is not to lose money.”As a result minimum variance portfolios tend to have high tracking error, often as much as 8 to 10 per cent. Further, some critics dismiss minimum variance as just another fundamental strategy benefiting from the outperformance of value and small cap stocks noted by many studies.Lionel Martellini, professor of finance at the Edhec Business School in Nice, believes the strategy has its merits. “We have a massive amount of evidence that minimum variance portfolios outperform market cap benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis. In terms of raw performance they also perform quite well compared to market-cap weighted portfolios.”However, according to Prof Martellini, even minimum variance can be beaten in terms of raw performance and Sharpe ratio in a disarmingly childlike manner – equally weighting every stock in a given universe.“Naive diversification works better than sophisticated diversification, it works better than modern portfolio theory. It’s interesting and perhaps a little bit sad.“But minimum variance portfolios have never been designed to have good Sharpe ratios. It’s about minimising volatility,” – the one area in which they trump naive equally weighted indices, says Prof Martellini."
676;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-08-03T09:56:09Z;Benchmark expert watches market weight shift eastwards;;Mark Makepeace has spent almost all of his working life measuring the performance of stock markets. He has been in charge of FTSE, the index provider, since the London Stock Exchange and the Financial Times created the joint venture in 1995. Before that he was the exchange’s head of indices.Indices have become massively important over the past two or three decades. Increasingly specialised benchmarks allow investors and fund managers to monitor performance with much more precision, and to take account of moral or religious needs.The range of investments that can be measured has expanded: index providers are benchmarking carbon emissions, private equity, infrastructure and real estate. Ethical, religious and green investors can follow socially responsible and faith-based indices.Indices can also be licensed to fund providers for exchange traded products for investors who want to make cheap, diversified bets on sectors or themes without paying managers to pick stocks for them.Competition is hotting up. “Our biggest rival is MSCI Barra,” says Mr Makepeace, a rival that calculates more than 100,000 indices daily, compared to FTSE’s 60,000. “If managers have a beauty parade, then MSCI and FTSE are always in it. S&P is rarely included.” He does not mention Dow Jones, the compiler of perhaps the world’s most famous benchmark, the Dow Jones Industrial Average.“In the US, MSCI is the market leader for historical reasons. In continental Europe, we are neck and neck with MSCI, and in the UK we lead. In Japan, we are getting pretty close.“We are beginning to head into the rest of Asia and China is becoming more important.” FTSE has shifted research capabilities to the region. The Hong Kong office opened in 2001 with three employees. There are now 10 people and he expects there will be 20 to 25 within a year or two.It is part of a trend to distribute more of the organisation’s 250 staff around the world to help them get closer to customers. Numbers in New York should double from 20.Mr Makepeace says there are several ways for index providers to differentiate themselves from rivals. “You compete for service, customisation and range of data,” he says. “There are good reasons that affect performance such as the methodology of design or the depth of coverage. The design of our indices are more modern and are simply better.”The newly fashionable field of frontier markets is an example – countries like Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam where stock markets are so small they fail to qualify as emerging markets, and that are difficult for foreigners to buy into, but have potential to grow rapidly.MSCI last year gave the idea of frontier markets more credibility when it launched a family of tradable frontier markets indices covering 19 countries.But FTSE did not follow suit until last week, when it launched the FTSE Frontier 50. Further regional and country frontier indices will be launched over the next 18 months. Mr Makepeace believes FTSE was right to wait. He believes competitors may have to rebalance their frontier benchmarks, as some markets are proving to be less investable than first thought.“Forty per cent of their frontier markets are going to have to be taken out,” he says. That means extra rebalancing costs for investors who track them.That may be a small sign of bigger things to come. Asian stock markets may have tumbled over the past year, but Mr Makepeace says the long-term trend is clearly towards Asian markets being a bigger proportion of world capitalisation.That, together with strong growth in equity markets in the Middle East, could see the US falling sharply in relative importance, as previously uninvestable markets become accessible to international investors. “Investors are facing the biggest change [in weights] in percentage terms in their lifetimes, even if markets remain stable. Structural changes mean there are going to be big flows out of the US because of changes in benchmarks.”The US, which currently accounts for around 42 per cent of global capitalisation, could drop to around 30 per cent. “This is a huge, huge change in the structure of global benchmarks but more importantly, how is it going to affect international money flows?”One effect might be for investors to compare performance against global benchmarks. Vanguard, he notes, has just launched an ETF based on the FTSE All World index.Most of FTSE’s indices are based on the traditional market capitalisation approach – the bigger the company’s market value, the more weight it has in an index.But critics of market capitalisation say such indices are prone to bubbles. Index-tracking investors have to buy more of the bigger stocks, just because the companies have greater weights in the index. A feedback loop therefore drives up the price further, increasing capitalisation, and creating even more demand for the stocks once their weighting in the index is increased.“There are always issues around market cap,” says Mr Makepeace. “Do markets lead indices or do indices lead markets? Over time we will get a refinement of how we value a company.”As a result, FTSE has pioneered indices that are constructed in a different way, based on methodologies developed by Global Wealth Allocation of the UK and Research Affiliates of the US. For such indices, the weighting is based on fundamental measures favoured by value investors. GWA takes existing FTSE indices and reweights them according to the ability of the companies to create wealth, by looking at net profits, cash earnings and book value.The RA Fundamental Indexation (RAFI) indices choose companies based on the size of their economic footprint, by considering book value, cash flow, sales and dividends. Supporters of both GWA and RA say their methodologies produce better returns than strategies based on conventional indices. But Mr Makepeace says: “Fundamental indexing is not a replacement for market cap indices, but a lot of big asset owners are starting to move assets away from market cap funds, They are saying, ‘We like the theory. Let’s test it’.”
677;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-08-03T09:51:11Z;Appetising openings beyond commodities;;"As the prices of commodities such as wheat, corn, and soyabeans slip from record highs investors are beginning to look for other opportunities in the sector, and the focus is moving to companies involved in food and agriculture.“A lot of fund managers realise commodities have had a good run in the past 18 months and now there is concern this will not continue in the long term,” says Jean-Marc Debricon, head of structuring at Rabobank, the Dutch agribusiness co-
operative bank.Rabobank, which was founded by Dutch farmers over 110 years ago, believes food and agribusiness players will benefit from sustained higher demand for food driven by changing dietary patterns in emerging economies, and from the growth of biofuels. It has launched two new indices focusing on companies in five food and agricultural sectors: agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and seeds, agricultural machinery and equipment, energy crops and commodities, food processing, and protein.The trend is confirmed by the coincidental launch of a set of Agriculture and Food Chain Indices by MSCI Barra, a global equity index specialist. David Brierwood, chief operating officer of MSCI, says: “Food and agriculture is going to be an important part of the portfolio and is being closely watched by investors.”Investor interest has been triggered by rising food prices and the realisation of the increasing difficulties of feeding a rapidly growing world population.This was underlined at the recent United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation summit meeting in Rome, at which Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, said the world needed to invest as much as $20bn (£10bn, €13bn) a year in agriculture to meet global food demands.Carl Atkin, director of research at Bidwells Agribusiness consultancy, says equity indices are the next rational investment step in food and agriculture, following commodities.“It is almost a halfway house between investing in commodities and farmland,” he adds.However, Mr Atkin says it is difficult to find good equity opportunities in agriculture and food at the moment as many large companies are overvalued. “There may be better niches to exploit such as water or, outside equities, investing in farmland,” he says.Rabobank acknowledges that higher costs will squeeze margins in some food and agriculture sectors, but suggests “valuable acquisition opportunities which emerge and help to drive consolidation in these industries will bode well for companies that respond to these challenges
proactively”.In a report titled The boom beyond commodities, the bank also argues that the current commodity cycle is different from those that have gone before due to the emergence of the biofuel industry. Past cycles have seen peaks and troughs, but the addition of fuel, the fourth “f”, to the other factors driving demand, namely food, feed and fibre, means “demand will remain strong over the coming years”.This will support “a base shift in commodity prices” leading to “greater deployment of scarce agricultural resources and a further appreciation of real farm assets”, according to the report.Rabobank’s indices, Rabo Fastracks Asia Pacific Top 20 and Global ex-Asia Top 20, include companies such as K&S, Lindsay Corp, Nufarm and China Yurun Food group. The index focused on Asian companies comes from investor demand in the region and will be traded out of Hong Kong, while the global index will be traded out of London, says Mr Dubricon.The MSCI Barra indices include food distributors and producers of agricultural products, fertilisers and agricultural chemicals, and packaged food and meats. They can be calculated for all MSCI developed, emerging and frontier markets.Both sets of indices provide benchmarks for investors and fund managers and can be used as the basis for structured products or by exchange traded funds.Mr Dubricon believes the indices are a better way of capturing potential growth in the sector than a specialised fund. “Investors will be buying into a specific theme not into the performance of a fund manager or team,” he says.Indices are also more transparent and less expensive than funds. The management fee for a note based on the index will be in the range of 50 basis points, half that of fund management fees which are at least 1 per cent, he says.Initially Rabobank will offer notes linked to the Fastracks indices issued through its structured medium term note programme. Maturities are expected to range between three and 10 years. It is also looking at offering the indices via a Ucits III fund platform and, for retail distribution, in a capital-protected format that would guarantee investors the amount originally invested."

679;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-07-06T16:36:34Z;Finance briefing: Everything you ever needed to know about benchmarks;;"Increasingly, financial services firms are developing innovative and exotic indices. In the fourth of a monthly series, Stephen M Horan discusses the important characteristics of performance benchmarks.Q: Why are performance benchmarks important?
A: Knowing you had a 5 per cent return tells you little in the absence of other reference values. An appropriate benchmark allows one to provide a meaningful comparison of portfolio performance.Q: How is performance interpreted relative to a benchmark?
A: Portfolio returns can be viewed as having three components. The first component relates to returns associated with broad market movements.A second portion of return can also be attributed to a manager’s investment style, which may be in or out of favour compared with the overall market. A small capitalisation value manager may have returns below the overall market but in line with the average small-cap value stock or with returns earned by other investment managers having similar mandates. In this case, the manager’s lacklustre performance compared with the market can be attributed to his investment style. The third component relates to a manager’s choice to weight securities differently from the benchmark portfolio. This part of the return, often called tracking error, is attributable to the manager’s active investment decisions.Q: What are some types of benchmarks?
A: Broad market indices, such as the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, are popular benchmarks. Style indices are also popular. For example, Morningstar uses the FTSE 100 as a benchmark for funds in the UK Large-Cap Blend category.Alternatively, the median investment performance of other managers in a particular investment universe is commonly used by consultants and fund sponsors to evaluate performance, but universe medians may not be considered valid benchmarks.Q: Is one benchmark better than another?
A: Valid benchmarks have certain characteristics. The securities composing the benchmark and their relative weights should be clearly defined and known at the beginning of the evaluation period.The benchmark should also be a viable investment alternative with a measurable return. Finally, it must be consistent with a manager’s investment style or area of expertise, and have similar risk.The performance of the median investment manager in an investment universe meets few of these criteria. Because the identity of the median investment manager cannot be known in advance, it is ambiguous, uninvestable, and may not have a similar investment mandate as the portfolio being evaluated.Q: Do stock market indices make good benchmarks?
A: Indices with the preceding characteristics can be good benchmarks. An important consideration is to determine whether the index matches a manager’s investment mandate.A world index would be inconsistent for a convertible arbitrage hedge fund manager but potentially appropriate for an international large-cap manager.Increasingly, financial service firms are developing specialised indices composed of investments conforming to a particular style, sector, or country.Q: Are fundamentally weighted indexes good performance benchmarks?
A: It depends. Although the identities and weights of the securities are defined, these types of fundamental indices place greater emphasis on value stocks, which would be inconsistent with the investment style of a growth manager or blended manager.A benchmark’s quality is related to its turnover and coverage, which is the proportion of a portfolio’s market value that is contained in the benchmark. Fundamentally weighted indices have higher turnover than traditional indices, which erodes quality.Q: Are there other specialised indices?
A: Yes. For example, the Chicago Board Options Exchange has constructed options-based indices such as the S&P 500 BuyWrite Index, based on a passive strategy of buying the S&P 500 index portfolio and selling near-term S&P 500 Index call options.This index also lacks some desirable benchmark properties. For example, the price at which the call option is deemed to be sold is equal to an average of prices during a half-hour of trading. Because there is no guarantee that investors would be able to sell at this price, the index is not investable.Q: How should fund managers choose benchmarks?
A: A benchmark is acceptable if the manager and investor agree on it. But managers that use benchmarks meeting well-established validity criteria and standards of quality are likely to communicate effectively with clients and manage portfolios in accordance with expectations.Stephen M Horan is head, private wealth and investor education at CFA Institute"

681;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-06-19T18:32:58Z;Korean equities;;South Korea is once again up for promotion to the equities first division. Index provider MSCI Barra this week put the country under review for a switch from emerging to developed market status.These are tough times for Korea to be under the spotlight. Protesters last week took to the streets in a graphic demonstration of President Lee Myung-bak’s below-20 per cent approval ratings. The economy, which Mr Lee pledged to set on course for 7 per cent growth over the long term, is hitting the skids as the currency falls and oil prices surge. The consequent inflationary pressure suggests hoped-for interest rate cuts are off the table. North of the border, South Korea’s nuclear neighbour is as recalcitrant as ever. And the stock market itself, down 18 per cent year-to-date in US dollar terms, has long fallen out of favour with overseas investors. Foreigners have been net sellers for the past 3½ years, and now own just over 30 per cent of the market, down from almost 45 per cent in 2004.Even in more forgiving times there would be no guarantee of Korea making the grade. It has flunked before, most recently when FTSE, another index provider, passed it over for developed status last year. South Korea retains several characteristics that root it firmly in the emerging category. Short-selling is restricted, corporate governance is ropey and the government is not above pressing listed companies into national service – for example, ordering mobile phone carriers to lower tariff rises to temper inflation. But does promotion matter? Korea’s weighting in the MSCI world index would be a mere 1.6 per cent, a sliver of the 13 per cent it now commands in the emerging markets index. Others, most notably Greece in 2001, have won promotion only to watch their market performance wither. Sometimes it pays to be a big fish in a small pond.Post and read comments on this Lex
682;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-02-28T19:49:27Z;The Short View: Brazil’s bull run;;"There’s an awful lot of money in Brazil. This week, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International, whose indices are used as benchmarks by most international money managers, it has taken over as the world’s largest emerging market.A rally for Brazilian stocks combined with falls in China has left Brazil with a slightly larger market value – in terms of the stocks that are available to foreign investors. Now accounting for 14.95 per cent of the MSCI emerging markets, it is also bigger than Korea (13.69 per cent), Russia or India.This owes more to big geopolitical judgments than to any close assessment of Brazil. It is the chief beneficiary of resurgent confidence in the “decoupling” thesis – the notion that demand for raw materials in the developing world will allow emerging markets to grow even if there is a US recession.It also benefits from a belief that commodities provide a hedge against inflation.Further, Brazil’s Bovespa index shows a startling sensitivity to “surprise” interest rate cuts in the US. It was falling until the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate on August 17 last year. Since then it has gained 63 per cent, in dollar terms – while the Shanghai Composite fell 1.4 per cent.The pattern repeated. The Bovespa sold off, but since the Fed’s rate cut on January 22, it has gained 33 per cent, while Shanghai fell 10 per cent. So the trading rule appears to be that when the Fed cuts rates, funds buy countries that export commodities, and sell short the countries that import them.Looking at Brazil more closely, progress towards fiscal reform remains sluggish. Worries about inflation remain intense.Its success over the past six years is unquestionable, but its current valuations look overblown. It has been a beneficiary of the commodity bull market; it may yet be a victim if commodities reverse.john.authers@ft.comwww.ft.com/shortview"
683;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-02-28T03:08:46Z;Henderson shares leap on solid figures;;Shares in Henderson, the fund management group, jumped 21 per cent on Wednesday after it reported a doubling of profits and the dividend, and outlined a programme of headcount cuts for the coming year.Roger Yates, chief executive, said the outlook for the fund management industry during 2008 was grim, but promised the company would “meet or beat” 2007 operating profits.He said: “We are assuming that retail investor confidence remains fragile,” adding that he was cautious about fund inflows.The group plans to cut £20m ($40m) from its £234m cost base, which should shave the cost-to-income ratio to below 65 per cent this year. It has identified a further £10m in possible cuts if markets remain subdued.Michael Sanderson, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: “While 2008 is set to be a much tougher year for conventional asset managers, with cost efficiencies already identified and enacted, Henderson might just prove to be more robust than its current rating implies.”The company’s shares, which before Wednesday’s gains had lost half their value since peaking at 193p last autumn, rose 20¾p to 117p. They are trading at roughly 10 times consensus earnings forecasts for 2008 – a 20 per cent discount to the sector.Assets under management dipped last year to £59.2bn from £61.9bn in 2006, after net withdrawals from funds of £5.3bn. However, management fees rose 17 per cent to £258m and performance fees rose 34 per cent to £50.1m. Fees as a proportion of assets under management rose to 53 basis points against 44bp last year.Operating profits in the year to December rose by a third to £106.7m. Pre-tax profits doubled from £74.4m to £147m after a one-off gain of £32m on a stake in Banca Popolare Italiana.Earnings per share rose from 5.6p to 16.4p, helped by a low tax charge. The company is doubling the dividend from 3.15p to 6.1p. Share buy-backs and a special dividend paid in October took the total pay-out to 27.6p.…………………………………………………Charlemagne profits jump 60%Strong gains in emerging market stocks helped Charlemagne Capital, the specialist fund manager, to deliver a 60 per cent jump in full-year profits, writes Pan Kwan Yuk.Stock markets in emerging economies outperformed developed markets in 2007. The Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index gained 37 per cent last year, compared with the 7.1 per cent increase for the MSCI World Index, which tracks the markets of developed economies.Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 reached $70.6m (£35.4m) from $43.4m last year. Assets under management grew nearly 40 per cent to $6.5bn. A tough January has wiped about $900m off its funds, but nonetheless Jayne Sutcliffe, chief executive, said: “After the initial panic, people are focusing once again on the fundamentals.”Shares in the company, having fallen by more than 20 per cent since the start of the year, rallied nearly 4 per cent to 59 ¾p.
684;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-02-21T21:35:53Z;M Stanley taps ex-executive for risk role;;Morgan Stanley has hired Kenneth deRegt, its former head of fixed income, as part of a shake-up of its risk management unit that will see the departure of Tom Daula, its chief risk officer.Mr deRegt, 52, who left Morgan Stanley in 2002, will join the recently formed office of the chairman where he will advise on risk management, internal controls and strategy.John Mack, chairman and chief executive, pledged to overhaul the Wall Street bank’s risk management after it was forced to take a $9.4bn writedown on subprime mortgage-related investments.Morgan Stanley has been reviewing the position of Mr Daula, as reported by the Financial Times in December. It has now been decided that Mr Daula will step down after a successor is appointed.Some senior executives alleged that Mr Daula was too slow to sound the alarm about the dangers stemming from the bank’s exposure to subprime-related trades. But Mr Daula’s supporters claimed his repeated warnings were ignored.In a memo to staff, Mr Mack said Mr deRegt would primarily work with Colm Kelleher, chief financial officer, who has been given oversight of risk management.“Given his extensive fixed-income and capital-markets experience, Ken will be a valuable addition to our senior management team as we look to navigate challenging market conditions and bolster the firm’s risk management function,” Mr Mack said.Mr deRegt will also work closely with Walid Chammah and James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s co-presidents, on the use of the bank’s balance sheet and with senior management on strategy and internal controls. Mr deRegt, who will start next week, will join the management committee and report directly to Mr Mack.Mr deRegt has been a managing director of Aetos Capital, an asset management company, since he left Morgan Stanley. He is also on the board of Morgan Stanley Capital International, the index company, and KKR Financial.Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said in a note to investors that Mr Mack believed that to make acceptable returns, Morgan Stanley needed to continue to take risk but be comfort-able managing it.Mr Moszkowski added that there was “a rapid shift back to a culture of debate, inter-unit questioning of trade strategy and sharp discipline”.
685;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2008-01-02T20:47:22Z;Quant investing;;Is “quant” a busted flush? Since last summer’s crisis, when fund managers following quantitative strategies started blaming black swans, most have suffered net outflows, while many of the weaker funds have been badly hurt. Even where money has stayed put, no fund-of-funds manager or other investor is looking at quant in quite the same way.Quant strategies have been around in various guises for more than 20 years, but managers have rarely seen anything like the turmoil of that single week in August. The problem was an overcrowded market where a lot of funds had similar positions, especially in US small and mid-capitalisation equities.When some large multi-strategy funds started to liquidate those holdings to cover credit losses elsewhere, prices tumbled, triggering further selling. Markets bounced a week later, but a lot of funds had to take money off the table, and so missed out.An industry this big can survive, however. Globally, there is at least $1,000bn invested in quant strategies, and probably double that. Quant remains attractively simple, in spite of the elastic definition. Whatever the investment horizon, strategies basically boil down to mean reversion: computers grind teraflops of data to unearth relationships between securities that tend, over time, to be stable. Trading is automatic, and executed quickly and cheaply.But in future, investors will be choosier in picking quant managers, and will require better explanations of exactly how returns emerge.Vendors of off-the-shelf packages such as MSCI Barra and Northfield, whose popularity contributed to those strong correlations among statistical models, may struggle to sustain sales at the level they saw before the crunch. As with other strategies, gearing will be tamed: debt to equity of closer to two times, rather than up to 10.The episode is a reminder that computer-driven models work fine, until they don’t. And that in times of high anxiety, reliance on blinking boxes often makes things worse.Post and read comments on this Lex
686;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-11-14T20:02:25Z;Construction and financials forge ahead;;Heidelberg Cement was the vanguard of rising European stocks, gaining 5.4 per cent to €114.11 on Wednesday after the group was added to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Germany index.Shares in Germany’s biggest cement-maker are largely held in private hands and the stock is illiquid so the price spiked as investors piled into the company before it joins the MSCI index on November 30, dealers said.The stock had a further boost when Hochtief, Germany’s largest construction company, said third-quarter profits tripled, beating forecasts. Hochtief rose 3.7 per cent to €89.European equities rallied for a third consecutive day as the banking sector rebound resumed, following reassurances from HSBC and Goldman Sachs over their exposure to credit market losses that eased investor jitters.After paring early gains around midday, European shares gained pace following US data that showed wholesale inflation had picked up less than expected, leaving the Federal Reserve more room to cut rates.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.4 per cent to 1,522.70, after HSBC said it had not suffered significant writedowns on US subprime mortgage debt, giving banks across Europe a shot in the arm.UBS the Swiss wealth manager was up 2.8 per cent at SFr55.15, while Credit Suisse, a domestic rival, rose 1.5 per cent to €69.05.Across the French border, Société Générale advanced 1.9 per cent to €105.10 and BNP Paribas gained 0.5 per cent to €72.74.The banks’ on-again-off-again recovery was still overshadowed by growing and fundamental problems in the US housing market, warned Robert Quinn, European equity strategist at Standard and Poor’s.“Earlier this year we had a liquidity problem and a run on the shadow banking system but now it is the core fundamentals that are affected with foreclosure rates in the US creeping up. The bad news is not over yet,” he said.Irish banks fell after Bank of Ireland reduced its full-year growth outlook. BoI slid 5.7 per cent to €9.80, Anglo-Irish Bank fell 2.4 per cent to €10.15 and Allied Irish Banks plummeted 7.3 per cent to €14.30.France was the best performing market in developed Europe with the CAC 40 gaining 1.4 per cent to 5,613.60.Engineering giant Alstom led the gainers, rebounding 4.8 per cent to €149.5 after dropping sharply on Tuesday.Vallourec also gained 2.2 per cent to €190.69 in continuing its volatile pattern, as many investors remain long on the stock on hopes of an eventual takeover bid, dealers said.Industrial metals were buffed to a shine by forecast-beating third-quarter earnings from France’s Arcelor Mittal, which posted a 12 per cent rise in core profits, helped by cost savings from its merger.ArcelorMittal rose 1.6 per cent to €49.82 and German peer Salzgitter was up 4.5 per cent to €123.34.France’s Alcatel-Lucent rose 4.1 per cent to €5.86 after upgrades from “sell” to “hold” from WestLB and Merrill Lynch.Meanwhile, shares in Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor rose 1.2 per cent to NKr127, outperforming the market, after it announced a sale of shares that realised NKr2.6bn.Swedish peer Teliasonera edged down 0.8 per cent to SKr62.50.Among fixed-line telecoms providers, Spain’s Telefónica rose 0.2 per cent to €22.79. Deutsche Telecom was 0.9 per cent higher at €14.71 and France Telecom lost 0.4 per cent to €25.64.
687;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-11-06T09:17:03Z;Asia rises as commodity shares gain;;Shares across Asia were largely higher on Tuesday, gaining for the first time in three days as subprime worries eased, commodity exporters advanced as gold held near 28-year highs, and Hong Kong calmed after Monday’s tumble.The Morgan Stanley Capital International index of Asia Pacific shares was up 0.5 per cent at 166.14 by 5:14pm in Tokyo, after sliding 3.9 percent over the previous two sessions, Bloomberg reported.Despite the broad gains, the mood was subdued as markets still tried to make sense of the problems at Citigroup that forced its chief executive, Chuck Prince, to resign and refreshed fears about the impact of the US subprime crisis on markets.“In general people are really a bit battered and confused by the changing news about financials in the US,” said a senior trader in Singapore. “The numbers being thrown around are mind-boggling and change every day.”In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average closed almost unchanged but at a fresh seven-week low, down 0.1 per cent 16,249.63. The broader Topix was off just one-half of one point at 1,574.59.Bargain hunters picked up bank shares early after they tumbled on Monday following Citigroup’s announcement of a potential $11bn write-down of mortgage-backed securities. But the rally faded and most banks ended little changed.Exporters such as Nissan, Honda and Sony declined due to concerns that problems in the US mortgage market would spread to the wider economy and weaken demand in their biggest export destination.Honda, which sells more than half its cars in the US, fell 3.3 per cent to Y4,130. Sony lost 1.8 per cent to close at Y5,560, and Nissan declined 2 per cent to Y1,294.In Hong Kong, shares of Alibaba.com, China’s largest e-commerce company, more than doubled on their first day of trading to HK$30. That helped the Hang Seng index rise 1.7 per cent to close at 29,438.13, partly reversing Monday’s 5 per cent fall – the biggest one-day decline since 2001 – triggered by the Chinese premier’s signalling that a plan to let ordinary mainland investors buy shares in Hong Kong would be delayed.South Korean stocks were the region’s biggest gainers after Google said it would join with some of the country’s biggest mobile phone makers to create a free operating system for handsets. The Kospi gained 1.9 per cent to close at 2,054.24. Samsung Electronics added 3.8 per cent to Won548,000 and LG Electronics surged 8.9 per cent to Won98,000.Gold traded as high as $814.63 an ounce, a rise of 1 per cent, to move closer to its record high of $850 an ounce set in January 1980. In Tokyo, the benchmark October gold futures contract rose above the closely watched Y3,000 per gram level for the first time for a benchmark contract since July 1984, closing the day up 1 per cent at Y3,015.The high price of gold helped Australian shares, with the S&P/ASX 200 index closing 0.7 per cent higher at 6,628.00.In Pakistan, stocks swung between positive and negative territory, down 0.9 percent mid-afternoon local time after earlier rising 0.2 per cent. Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s lowered their outlook on the country’s credit rating to “negative” from “stable”. Pakistan stocks fell over 4 per cent on Monday in the wake of the weekend imposition of emergency rule.
688;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-09-27T20:58:20Z;Overview: Equities higher amid US housing woes;;"Global equities remained on an upward track on Thursday in spite of further evidence of the crisis facing the US housing market and lingering concerns about tight conditions in the money markets.Emerging market stocks were particularly strong, offering a fresh sign that investor risk appetite was recovering.The Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging market equity index touched a record high above the 1,200 level, giving it a rise of 30 per cent this year. By comparison, the MSCI World index has risen about 12 per cent in 2007.“The shift to more constructive crisis management by the Fed and other major central banks in recent weeks, coupled with the relatively better-than-expected banks earnings season,
have brought a significant rebound in risky assets,” said Michael Vaknin, analyst at Goldman Sachs.But he added: “A continuation of this trend is now more challenging ahead of further subprime developments and commercial banks’ earnings.”Worries about credit conditions and the outlook for the US economy remained near the surface on Thursday.The European Central Bank said it had lent €3.9bn ($5.5bn) at its penalty rate of 5 per cent, the largest amount since October 2004.This was compounded by news that the three-month London interbank-offered euro rate was fixed at 4.78688 per cent, the highest since May 2001.Meanwhile, US new home sales tumbled 8.3 per cent in August to an annual rate of 795,000, the lowest level for more than seven years.Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics descr-ibed the figures as “just hideous” and suggested the really bad news was that the data largely pre-dated recent market turmoil. “US housing is nowhere near the bottom; neither is its wider impact,” he said.The figures followed news of an unexpected fall in initial jobless claims last week and a downward revision to second-quarter gross domestic product growth.“The claims data perhaps provide the most interesting twist to the morning’s reports, as the figures raise the risk that the September jobs report will reverse much of the August weakness and significantly alter market interpretation of the US growth path,” said Action Economics.On the currency markets, the dollar remained on the back foot, touching yet another lifetime low against the euro and a record low against a basket of currencies. The single currency hit $1.4189, while the dollar index touched 78.159, the lowest since its launch in 1973.The single currency found support from robust eurozone money supply and German inflation figures and news of another fall in German unemployment.John Norman, currency analyst at JPMorgan, said he expected the euro to hit $1.45 by year-end and to peak near $1.48 in the first quarter of 2008 in anticipation of higher US rates later next year.But the European data did little to dent eurozone government bonds as the market focused on the weak US housing data and month end buying.The yield on the two-year German bond fell 1bp to 4.07 per cent. The two-year US Treasury yield was down 4bp lower at 3.95 per cent and there was strong investor demand for new five-year notes. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds rose 5.5bp to a six-week high of 1.72 per cent.There were strong gains for equity markets right across the Asia-Pacific region. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 climbed 2.4 per cent to a six-week high while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong powered through the 27,000 level to a new closing peak. Record highs were also struck in Singapore, Sydney and Mumbai.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.8 per cent to 1,551.49.Wall Street closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 per cent, the S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent.In commodities, oil moved higher amid fresh concerns about tropical storm disruption in the Gulf. November West Texas Intermediate rose towards $83 a barrel.Wheat prices surged to record highs after the International Grains Council cut its forecast for global and Australian wheat production. Gold remained within sight of Friday’s near-28-year high of $739 an ounce."
689;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Overview: Investors fret over US growth, inflation;;Wall Street failed to emulate a buoyant session for Asian and emerging market equities on Monday as investors focused on concerns over US growth and inflation.The dollar set a new low against the euro and flirted with an all-time low against a basket of currencies.Sentiment for the currency remained fragile after last week’s aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said investors seemed to be concerned that the Fed had opened the window for renewed bouts of inflation, especially with a weak dollar and elevated energy prices.“Labour costs are far more critical for inflation pressures, as labour compensation accounts for 70 per cent of US corporate costs, while energy accounts for roughly 7-8 per cent of corporate expenses.”Jim Caron, co-head of global interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley, said: “The Fed has sent a strong signal that they wish to get ahead of market woes.”But he warned: “Pre-emptive actions do not come without a cost, and in our view the Fed is swapping systematic and liquidity risk for longer-term inflation risk.”The dollar remained the chief focus in the currency markets amid widespread expectations of further US rate cuts. Interest rate futures were pricing in a 60 per cent chance of another 25 basis point cut at the Fed’s policy meeting at the end of next month.The euro touched a record high against the US currency for the third day in a row, hitting $1.4130. The dollar index made a low of 78.32, just above its September 1992 low of 78.19.UBS said the market would keep a close eye on speeches this week by Ben Bernanke, fed chairman, for clues about the exact reasoning behind last week’s 50 bp point rate cut.“If it was a pre-emptive move in the absence of solid evidence of a broad weakening in the economy, then the rally in reflation trades and the weakness in the US dollar may be sustained,” said currency strategist Alina Anishchanka.“However, if it is a response to verified weakness in the economy based on information the market does not yet have access to, reflation trades will likely reverse their recent gains. We maintain our view that the extent of the weakness in the dollar is not justified.”On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased an early rally as investors focused on housing data due on Tuesday. Financial and energy stocks led the market lower.General Motors erased a near 4 per cent rise in early trade after the company said United Auto Workers union members had launched a strike.The Dow closed down 0.4 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.5 per cent and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.1 per cent.In contrast, the Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging market equity index broke into uncharted territory as it recouped all the losses incurred during the credit squeeze in July and August.Shares in India, China and Brazil all touched new records.Asian equities set a strong pace, though trading was thinned by the closure of markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.The MSCI International Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index struck a record high as both Hong Kong and Sydney climbed to new peaks and Singapore closed at its best level for two months.European stocks ended flat as strong gains in the mining sector offset weaker financials. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index slipped 0.51 points to 1,545.77.The fall in stocks helped reverse losses in US Government bond prices in early trade, though trading was muted in the absence of key US economic data.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was down 1 basis point at 4.62 per cent, while the two-year yield was 1bp lower at 4.045 per cent.Elsewhere, the 10-year Bund yield was up 1bp at 4.36 per cent and the two-year Schatz yield was flat at 4.06 per cent.In commodities, the price of gold held near last week’s 28-year high of $739 an ounce as the weak dollar continued to offer support to the metal.US crude dipped 67 cents to $80.95 a barrel after hitting a record high last week of $84.10, as fears of disruption from a storm in the Gulf of Mexico proved unfounded.
690;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-07-30T22:04:43Z;Increased liquidity fuels competition;;"Increased liquidity in the international equity markets is driving innovation and intense competition between index providers in what used to be a sleepy corner of the financial industry.MSCI Barra has revealed plans to change its two sets of global equity indices – MSCI Standard and Small Cap – to a new single set of Global Investable Market Indices.The two-phase transition includes an overhaul of the stock selection process, size segregation to remove an overlap between the two indices, and the inclusion of emerging markets in the small cap index for the first time.MSCI claims the new methodology reflects the changing nature of international equity markets and the evolution of investment processes globally. It aims to provide a broader coverage of the investable equity universe.However, the changes have come under scrutiny from all corners of the indexing space because of the potential for rebalancing activity from passive and active managers, with some $3,000bn benchmarked against the MSCI indices.It is the second time in six years that the US-based index provider has given a facelift to its coverage and underlying methodology, having switched to free float-adjusted market capitalisation in 2001.Vijay Sumon, derivative analyst at HSBC, says the new methodology results in significant turnover for no real benefit. “They are forcing index followers to change the composition of their portfolios at a considerable cost,” he says.“We estimate that for a typical portfolio of about $100m, it will cost about 0.5 basis points of the value of the portfolio for developed markets large and mid-caps.”Competitors claim the transformation is merely an attempt by MSCI to stay afloat in an evolving and highly competitive market.“It’s positive that they’ve recognised there were issues with their construction and they’re doing something about it,” says John Davies, senior director, business development, at Standard & Poor’s Index Services.“This set of changes for MSCI moves them forward and towards FTSE and S&P, but it doesn’t get them all the way, so I would question how long it will be before they make another change.”MSCI’s global head of the equity index business, Ted Niggli, supports the transition plans. “I’m not surprised the competition would say something like this because they’re obviously trying to gain some of these assets,” he says.“But because of the detail we have put into this, what we’re hearing from our clients is that they are overwhelmingly satisfied with what we’ve done.”Giacomo Fachinotti, chairman of the MSCI Equity Index Committee, adds: “The transition to this enhancement results for the ACWI (All Country World Index) in a one-way index turnover of 3.4 per cent, which is modest. It is the equivalent of the average turnover in the annual rebalancing over the last three years.”With the MSCI revamp comes the recognition of a convergence of global equity benchmarks.Bernard Nelson, principal at Mercer Investment Consulting, says: “Each time one of them moves, they move closer to each other. They’re trying to be as representative as possible and to iron out anomalies that used to take place, such as the distortions that existed before free float-adjusted market capitalisation.”Indeed, the distinctions between providers are blurring, making it harder for pension scheme trustees to decipher which benchmark best suits their needs.The Russell Global Index covers 98 per cent of the investable global market and is divided into a family of indices covering 63 countries. Kelly Haughton, strategic director, says the sole cut-off between large and small caps across both developed and emerging markets set the firm apart from other index providers.“If you’re a global investor, you look at large and small cap distinctions on a global basis, not a country relative basis,” he says.Both the FTSE Global Equity Index Series (GEIS) and the Dow Jones Wilshire Global Index Family also target 98 per cent of the investable market capitalisation, however in Dow Jones’ case, this reduces to 95 per cent for the emerging markets.When the transition completes on May 30 2008, MSCI will cover 85 per cent of the free float-adjusted market capitalisation in each
market for its standard indices, and 99 per cent of the investable equity universe for its small cap indices.The number of countries covered in the equity indices ranges from 48 (FTSE) to 63 (Russell), with different liquidity screens.Paul Grimes, chief operating officer at FTSE, says: “We’ve developed a rigorous framework for country eligibility. We don’t just look at gross national income or the relative size of the market; we have 22 specific criteria that are transparent to both investors in those markets and the markets themselves.”Clearly the philosophy behind the providers’ approaches varies, with MSCI attempting to strike a balance between size, integrity and country coverage.The trade-off between investability and comprehensive coverage is where disparity between providers is most apparent.Mr Davies does not believe it is possible to have a benchmark that meets both of these demands.“A benchmark is supposed to represent the universe, whereas if you want a highly investable, tradable index, then by definition you’re going to have a much narrower universe of securities,” he explains.“If you’re looking at global equity portfolios, I don’t think you can have one index that meets all of those requirements.”"
691;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New ways to use indices in investment strategies;;"T he attitude of portfolio managers to benchmarks of market performance is constantly evolving.Many active managers still largely track indices with the aim of outperforming them by certain percentages, says Gaurav Shah, managing director of the global product strategy team at Credit Suisse Asset Management. But in the past few years, there has been a move among active managers towards an “unconstrained” approach to managing portfolios.“Unconstrained portfolios are constructed with no reference to market capitalisation weighted benchmarks; that is, the weight of a stock in an index would play no part in the weight of a stock in a given portfolio,” he says.These would offer managers more scope to invest in stocks because they think they are attractive than would an index-hugging approach, he says.The development comes amid a growing debate about whether active managers are generating the extra return that many clients expect.“There is probably more debate today on whether active managers are generating enough alpha or not,” says Theodore Niggli, executive director of MSCI Barra.He says indices provide a useful benchmark for active managers, but “outperformance is also a function of how much leeway is given to the active manager in their investment mandate”.Lillian Goldthwaite, head of equities at FTSE, says active managers are increasingly finding different ways to use indices as part of their investment strategies.For instance, she says, the launch in 2005 of the FTSE GWA index series was in response to demand for alternative indices that break with traditional price-weighted design. These indices try to capture a company’s wealth creation in the form of its net income, cash flow and book value – and not market capitalisation.“It is an enhanced methodology that captures strategies traditionally employed by active managers and such indices can be used by both active or passive managers as a means to consistently enhance returns and reduce risk.”Nonetheless, indices – or benchmarks – remain an integral component of managers’ approach, whether the aim is to outstrip a particular index or not.“Even in a purely unconstrained environment, managers still need to look at benchmarks as reference points,” says Mr Shah. “Some indices still give clients something meaningful to measure the manager’s performance against.”“Choosing the right benchmark is very important to establish the volatility and return parameters for managing a portfolio. Making the right choice also depends on factors individual to each client and strategy.”Indeed, investment management is closely based on guidelines that have been discussed and agreed with the client, including what the terms are for risk profiles, returns, capital growth expectations and cash flow requirements.This means that many managers largely track specific indices and try to outperform them. For complex, multi-asset portfolios, the manager might construct a benchmark that combines different indices, including equity and bond indices.While every index in each asset class provides something different, there are some indices that are seen as industry standards.Fixed income managers often look at indices provided by bulge-bracket investment banks including Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Citi. For equities, managers look at the MSCI series of indices and the S&P, while for commodities managers often use indices by Goldman Sachs, Dow Jones and Deutsche Bank.But Darrell Riley, at T Rowe Price, says: “There are literally hundreds of benchmarks out there and what the active manager decides to use depends on what the client is looking for and the need to satisfy certain requirements, such as tracking error targets or liability matching.“One manager of a large-cap US equity strategy may replicate the characteristics of a particular index, such as the Russell 1000, and another managing a similar strategy may be generally aware of the index with no attempt to replicate its characteristics.”The client’s time horizon is also important. A bond portfolio requiring high liquidity might use a three-month Treasury index as a benchmark rather than something that contains fewer liquidity issues and exhibits greater interest rate sensitivity. Mr Shah says there are several factors when deciding on benchmarks for his group’s long-only enhanced index portfolios, including whether the benchmark contains the full set of securities available for investment, whether the names and weights of securities – along with rules governing the benchmark – are well defined and whether the benchmark is priced daily.Mr Riley says: “In some cases, it doesn’t matter what indices are used. What matters a lot is that the managers know how the active portfolios they are running differ from the benchmarks and they understand the active risks they are taking.“There are different combinations of benchmarks that active managers can use. It’s not a static world and investors can slice it in several different ways.”But he adds: “The worst thing a manager can do is to underperform an index and not give the client the asset class they paid for.”"
692;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Not every index wants to be benchmark;;"For most investors, a handful of long-established indices – the S&P 500, the DAX 30, the FTSE 100 – represent the extent of the index universe. But investment banks and specialist index companies are churning out indices at a rapid rate.In part, index development is driven by banks’ desire to measure and promote their investment strategies. Also, fund managers are keen to show investors that their money is being invested in the most profitable way.“In my world we launch a new index every six weeks,” says John Butler, head of the index strategies group at Deutsche Bank. “We try to populate the risk spectrum so every aspect of risk that is anything to do with interest rates is covered.”Last month, Deutsche came up with the first of a series of indices to give investors access to its equity research analysts’ shorter-term investment ideas. An index for hedge fund returns had launched in May; fixed income and foreign exchange indices in March.Standard & Poor’s, which has a large index business, reckons to calculate 1m indices a day across 78 product families. MSCI Barra says it has 80,000 indices.It is not difficult to get to these large numbers with subsets of large global indices, says Ted Niggli, head of MSCI Barra’s equity index business. “We take the all-country world index and slice it by country, region, sector and market capitalisation. You quickly get a Rubik’s cube of indices.”“A bank may decide that calculating indices is not a strategic function and it will outsource it to us,” says Chris O’Brien, European vice-president for business development in S&P’s index services team. “Or they may ask us to do the back-end calculations for reasons of cost efficiency. Having a third party do the calculations confers legitimacy and helps them jump the regulatory hurdles.”But many banks devote considerable resources to creating proprietary indices that reflect their investment strategies and products based on these strategies.This surge of index creation reflects the increasing sophistication and liquidity of the world’s markets. Indices have become means to outperform, providing alpha. “When a bank can prove that their trading strategy is providing alpha they will make it available to third parties,” Mr O’Brien says.Deutsche creates indices in-house, says Mr Butler. “We regard them as proprietary indices because we have developed an alpha-generating trading strategy that did not previously exist. The index is something that reflects our intellectual capital.”The point at which a proprietary index becomes a generic benchmark can be hard to spot. Becoming a benchmark reflects a general acceptance of a particular index, and their highly specific strategies means that many will never gain wide appeal.Deutsche is keen to promote its new currency return index as “the first investable benchmark for currency markets”. Jason Batt, head of forex index products, says: “People are not so familiar with foreign exchange as an asset class. We realised that to gain penetration we had to step back from proprietary indices and do something that was very simple and generic.”The new index replicates the most widely employed forex strategies – carry, momentum and valuation – and combines them in a non-discretionary, rules-based index. A proprietary index, by contrast, would introduce more options.For example, an index aimed at maximising returns would not, in current market conditions, include an element shorting the yen. But this is included in the Deutsche index to reflect the strategies chosen.Creating benchmark indices can pay off in terms of generating additional trading volumes as well. Growth of the credit derivatives market was boosted in 2004 when two rival indices, backed by competing groups of banks, agreed to merge. Investors had been uncertain which index offered the best liquidity and held back from trading.Index creation can be a long and costly process – up to two years when a radical new asset class is being included – and there is no guarantee that the resultant index will catch on.If an index does gain acceptance, it generates new business. An index that demonstrates it can provide good returns will be used as the basis for a range of new products including investment funds, certificates, notes, swaps and options.If these products are sufficiently popular, their use may be licensed to other banks and that earns fees for the originator."
693;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;If it makes money, measure it;;"If it moves in a market, there is an index for it. Over the past five years, the number and range of indices launched as tools for investors have boomed.From ethical investment to arcane credit derivatives, indices are providing ever more specialised benchmarks against which investors can measure performance.Indices used to be fairly straightforward. Typically benchmarks of equity markets, they provided investors with a gauge of how well or badly things were going.But as investors have expanded their investing horizons, so has the range of indices broadened. As many institutional investors tailor their investment strategies more closely to their objectives, there has been a wave of customisation of indices.In addition, the boom in exchange-traded funds – listed investment vehicles that track a benchmark or an asset – has opened up new areas of index-linked investing.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE Group, says: “The benchmarking industry has changed significantly over the past five years. The big players may be the same – FTSE, MSCI and S&P – but the quality and range of indices offered by them have increased dramatically and the way they do business today bears little resemblance to previous times.”FTSE, which is 50 per cent owned by the Financial Times, calculates more than 120,000 indices a day. It says some 30,000 are customised equity indices produced for investment managers seeking a specific benchmark for their needs. FTSE says some $3,000bn of assets are managed against its benchmark.MSCI Barra, FTSE’s rival, says it calculates more than 130,000 indices a day and some $3,500bn of assets are using them as a gauge.Dimitris Melas, executive director and head of research in Europe, Middle East and Africa for MSCI Barra, says: “We have definitely seen a big increase in recent years in the range of indices on offer to investors.” He adds that the growth of ETFs has been a key driver in this process.ETFs are now available for investors to take a view on markets ranging across asset classes, geographies and niche areas – everything from US healthcare stocks to nanotechnology shares to the Belgian stock market. Most track an index.Morgan Stanley estimates there were some 847 ETFs round the globe by the end of the first quarter, and it forecasts another 543 will be launched before year end. The investment bank predicts global ETF assets under management will reach $2,000bn by 2011 from the current $604.2bn.One of the biggest changes brought by ETFs has been the promotion of “fundamental indices”. These eschew the traditional basis of most stock market ETFs – indices such as the S&P 500 that reflect shifts in share prices and market capitalisation.Instead, they are based on indices of stocks centred on so-called fundamental factors, such as earnings, dividends and the book value of companies. They aspire to avoid the distortions and pricing anomalies arising out of market cap indices. Supporters claim that markets are not always priced efficiently and the top 10 stocks in an index are not necessarily the most attractively valued.The fundamental ETFs have opened a debate about the nature of indices and how they should be used.They have won influential support. Powershares’ FTSE RAFI products are backed by Rob Arnott, the editor of the Financial Analysts Journal. Powershares’ rival WisdomTree is supported by Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor and author of Stocks for the Long Run.The theory is that an extra layer of stock selection can add to superior returns. Mr Arnott says backtesting of a composite of the RAFI indices showed an excess of returns over a market cap benchmark of 2 per cent a year since 1962.Growth has also been driven by bigger investors, such as pension funds, seeking specific benchmarks.“Benchmarks still perform the same function – assisting the investor in forming their asset allocation strategy, setting the boundaries for the portfolio and evaluating the performance of the fund manager,” says Mr Makepeace.“The difference is that the index provider will now customise products to meet the fund’s exact mandate requirements, enabling the request of any type of benchmark excluding or including a selection of economic sectors or particular stocks,”
he says.There has also been growth in indices for investment areas that are often illiquid and difficult to measure, such as hedge funds and property.Mr Makepeace says another growth trend could be multi-asset customised benchmarks.“Currently, bond indices are proprietary products, calculated by the investment banks. As the price sources improve and better prices become available, public index providers will challenge these, and be able to integrate them with equities and other asset classes to bring truly multi-asset customised products to meet specific mandates,” he says.Mr Melas says with more shares changing hands privately, how representative of the value of markets will the traditional indices be?Deals that occur on private inter-bank platforms – known as “dark pools of liquidity” – probably ac­counted for about 10 per cent of share trading in the US last year, a sharp increase from previous years, according to research by the Tabb consultancy."
694;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-06-29T16:09:31Z;Banks at the fore in race to create new benchmarks;;For most investors a handful of long-established indices – the S&P 500, the DAX 30, the FTSE 100 – represent the extent of the index universe. But alongside these old faithfuls, the investment banks and specialist index companies are churning out new indices at a rapid rate.New index development is driven in part by the banks’ desire to create a way of measuring and promoting their clever investment strategies. It is also fuelled by the demands of fund managers keen to show investors their money is being invested in the most profitable way.“In my world we launch a new index every six weeks,” says John Butler, head of the index strategies group (rates) at Deutsche Bank. “We try to populate the risk spectrum so every aspect of risk that is anything to do with interest rates is covered.”Last month Deutsche Bank came up with the first of a series of indices to give investors access to its equity research analysts’ shorter-term investment ideas. This followed an index replicating hedge fund returns launched in May and new fixed income and foreign exchange indices in March.Standard & Poor’s, which has a large index business alongside its bond rating activities, reckons to calculate no fewer than 1m indices a day across 78 product families. MSCI Barra, another provider, says it has 130,000 indices.It is not too difficult to get to these large numbers when you create subsets of large global indices, says Ted Niggli, head of MSCI Barra’s equity index business. “We take the all-country world index and slice it by country, region, sector and market capitalisation so you quickly get a Rubik’s Cube of indices.”“A bank may decide that calculating indices is not a strategic function and it will outsource it to us,” explains Chris O’Brien, European vice president for business development in S&P’s index services team. “Or they may ask us to do the back-end calculations for reasons of cost efficiency. Having a third party do the calculations confers legitimacy and helps them jump the regulatory hurdles.”But many banks devote considerable resources to creating their own proprietary indices that will reflect their own investment strategies and the products based on these strategies that they hope to sell to clients.This surge of index creation reflects the increasing sophistication and liquidity of the world’s markets, with indices becoming a means of actively seeking to outperform, providing alpha. “When a bank can prove that their trading strategy is providing alpha they will make it available to third parties,” says Mr O’Brien“We create our indices in-house,” says Mr Butler of Deutsche Bank. “We regard them as proprietary indices because we have developed an alpha-generating trading strategy that did not previously exist. The index is something that reflects our intellectual capital.”The point at which a proprietary index becomes a generic benchmark can be difficult to spot. It can reflect a general acceptance of a particular index, though the highly specific strategies attached to many means they may never gain wide appeal.In spite of this, Deutsche Bank is keen to promote its new currency return index, as “the first investable benchmark for currency markets”. “People are not so familiar with foreign exchange as an asset class,” says Jason Batt, head of forex index products. “We realised that to gain penetration we had to step back from proprietary indices and do something that was very simple and generic.”This index replicates the most widely employed forex strategies – carry, momentum and valuation – and combines them in a non-discretionary, rules-based index. This is in contrast to a proprietary index that would introduce more options. For example, an index aimed at maximising returns would not, in current market conditions, include an element shorting the yen, but this is included in the Deutsche Bank index to reflect the strategies chosen.Creating benchmark indices can pay off in terms of generating additional trading volumes. Growth of the credit derivatives market was boosted in 2004 when two rival indices, backed by competing groups of banks, agreed to merge. Investors uncertain which index offered the best liquidity had held back from trading.Index creation can be a long and costly process – up to two years when a radical new asset class is being included – and there is no guarantee that it will catch on.If an index does gain acceptance it generates new business. An index that demonstrates it can provide good returns will be used as the basis for a range of new products including investment funds, certificates, notes, swaps and options. If these products are sufficiently popular their use may be licensed to other banks, earning additional fees for the originator.
695;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-05-18T16:53:50Z;The Long View: US maintains grip;;"Conventional wisdom holds that globalisation – the economic links between the developed and developing world – is driving economic growth. It also holds that the US economy is “decoupling” from the rest of the world.These views seem incompatible. But evidence for the first proposition is overwhelming. Globalisation is happening and it has changed world markets. So what is the evidence for decoupling?First, consider US trade figures. Joseph Quinlan, market strategist at Bank of America, shows that the US share of global imports dropped to 14.3 per cent in November last year, the most recent month for which figures are available. That was its lowest share since December 1995, and far below its peak of 20 per cent back in 2000, when the US was the world’s “consumer of last resort”.Mr Quinlan also cites World Trade Organisation figures showing that US imports grew 11 per cent last year. That was less than the other big developed economies (Germany and the UK raised their imports by 17 per cent) and much less than growth rates for the developing world: 20 per cent for China; 25 per cent for India; and 31 per cent for Russia. So the model in which the US spends money that it doesn’t have in order to buy products from the emerging markets is changing.According to John Shin, economist at Lehman Brothers, the trade deficit subtracted 0.5 per cent from annual US economic growth for the 10 years to 2005, while adding half that amount to foreign growth. Last year, he says, trade’s impact on US gross domestic product was essentially zero, and for this year, he expects it to make a contribution.There is other evidence as well that points towards a decoupling. The US economy now appears to have grown by less than 1 per cent in the first quarter. German GDP growth exceeded it. And, of course, China’s economy continued to power ahead with growth of 11.1 per cent in the first quarter.The dollar has tumbled – fuelling the shifts in trade as it falls. That has helped to prompt American investors’ money to pour out of the US, and into the rest of the world.However, decoupling is not evident from world markets. In the last year, as the US economy has lagged further behind, world markets have risen almost exactly in line with the US. The correlation is striking. Using the Morgan Stanley Capital International indices (MSCI), the World index is up 20.3 per cent during the last year.The Europe, Australasia and the Far East or EAFE index – covering the world’s developed markets outside the US – is up by 21 per cent, while its North America index is up by 19.6 per cent. Not much decoupling there.MSCI’s emerging markets index is up 25.5 per cent over that period, but again the correlation is close. Emerging markets are now a more volatile version of the US Standard & Poor’s 500.Albert Edwards, investment strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, points out commodity prices have entered a bear market during the last year – in spite of China’s growth.As for equities, the rally of the last year has been driven by earnings (which are increasingly made by multinational companies subject to many different economies). During the past 10 years, there has been a clear pattern for optimism about earnings per share in the US to lead other developed markets as well as the emerging markets.As he puts it: “Despite the rhetoric of decoupling, it seems to be more an economic event than a market event. The global equity profits cycle and commodity markets seem unable to decouple from problems in the US.”Even in economic terms, “decoupling” is a hard notion to swallow. The rest of the world is not hiding behind protectionist barriers – economic interdependence is higher than ever. What are the new sources of growth, and what accounts for why the US is now lagging?Andrew Milligan, chief investment officer of Standard Life in Edinburgh, suggests world markets are “rebalancing” – not “decoupling” – around two pillars: China and petrodollars. China’s growth is pre-eminently about investment in its domestic infrastructure. Wealth generated by higher oil prices is going primarily to those governments that tend to control the world’s oil reserves. Their spending helps explain the strength of many markets outside the US, argues Mr Milligan.Or perhaps we should look at the property market. The US had a housing bubble for several years. Parts of the eurozone are still experiencing one. Peter Hooper and Torsten Slok of Deutsche Bank point out that housing slowdowns take place when housing becomes harder to afford. Then monetary conditions tighten. That is what has happened in the US.Property in the UK and in places such as Spain and Ireland look more expensive than in the US. European central banks are tightening rates. The housing bust in the US has knocked at least a percentage point off its annual economic growth rate. Far from decoupling from the US, Europe’s economy may simply be waiting for its property market to follow its transatlantic counterpart into a slump."
696;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-03-21T17:53:25Z;The Short View: Power of indices;;"The basic building block of stock market investment is no longer the common stock. It is the index. There now appear to be more indices than common stocks, and it is indices that form the basis of investment decisions.Fund managers work on the assumption that returns can be divided into two: “beta” – the returns of the market; and “alpha” – returns uncorrelated to the market. That means more focus on exactly what goes into beta. And as they are judged almost exclusively by reference to a benchmark, they need an index relevant to them. They might need a benchmark for their particular investment style, for example. That means that indices become more important, and they proliferate. And, try though they will to avoid it, indices no longer track markets – they move them.Many fund managers cannot invest beyond the stocks in their benchmark. Exchange-traded funds, which track indices, make index providers even more powerful. Moves in US small-cap stocks, for example, are dominated by the ETF tracking the Russell 2000 index, which is usually the third most heavily traded ETF. Hedge funds use it as a vehicle to play the entire sector. Google – strong as it was – leapt 7 per cent on the day it joined the S&P 500, which has more money tied to it than any other.We are about to see another test of the power of indices. By the end of this month, Morgan Stanley Capital International, the dominant index provider for international investors and emerging markets, will unveil an overhaul of its indices to include small-cap stocks on a global basis. This will bring the total number of stocks used in MSCI’s indices to 8,000 – and create, incredibly, more than 20,000 new indices, sliced by style, sector, geography, market cap, currency and so on. This will open small emerging market stocks to a range of investors currently barred from buying them.MSCI will do its best not to move the market, and has avoided doing so when it has moved countries in and out of indices in the past. But it is likely to be an event. Just look at how Merrill Lynch is previewing it: “Coming soon: a new stock universe.”"
697;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2007-03-05T18:25:20Z;Market Insight: Rout of the black box traders restores faith in humankind;;"The 1997 chess victory by IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer over Garry Kasparov, then reigning world champion, marked a turning point: the triumph of silicon chip over grey matter.Last week the equities rout, rising yen and credit market turmoil were a rematch. “Black box” computer-driven traders were crushed; human managers mostly limited their losses.The worst hit were the trend followers. These managed futures funds are run by computer programs maintained by an army of maths and astrophysics PhDs, who try to spot trends across futures markets from commodities to foreign exchange to equities.One $300m trend-following fund manager said he had dropped 6 per cent last Tuesday, more than wiping out his gains for the month. Rival funds fell between 4 and 10 per cent.The biggest hedge fund in the area will report today how much it suffered. Man Group’s $17bn AHL managed futures fund is a benchmark. Its ability to raise new money is vital to the profitability of the group.“Whenever this sort of thing happens, the trend followers really get slaughtered,” says Tom Hazuka, chief investment officer of Mellon Capital. Mellon’s own systematic fund, which uses computer-driven fundamental analysis rather than trend-following, fell “very modestly” on Tuesday but is still up for the year, he said.Hedge funds following other strategies broadly performed better than the markets, giving up in two days a third to two-thirds of the gains they had made earlier in February, but mostly still up on the month.According to the MSCI Barra investable index, the average hedge fund was up 0.5 per cent for the month up to and including Tuesday. Systematic trading funds – including trend followers – were the biggest fallers, down an average 0.3 per cent over the same period.All the same, rising volatility could be good for the computers.“A big correction in the market sets up a new set of opportunities,” said one systematic fund manager.The low volatility of the past three years has produced tough trading conditions for the trend-following computers, according to data from Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research. The average managed futures fund produced 2.9, 1.4 and 5.6 per cent in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The four years before that, which covered the 2000 dotcom bubble bursting and the subsequent bear market, produced 13.7 per cent in 2000, then 8.3, 12.2 and 12.7 per cent.The key to performance for the trend followers, the biggest computer-driven funds, is trends. Steady rises or falls are good. If shares, bonds, foreign exchange and commodities are rangebound, they tend to do badly, while unexpected corrections provide the worst pain.Appetite for managed futures will be tested in the early summer when Dexion Capital plans to raise $200m for a London-listed hedge fund run by Winton Capital. The $3bn Winton fund is run by David Harding – the H in AHL before he set up on his own. Like other trend followers, he is understood to have lost this year’s gains in a day last week.Robin Bowie, chairman of Dexion, says these wild swings in returns are to be expected from managed futures funds. While most hedge funds aim for steady positive returns, managed futures aim to be uncorrelated with markets.“Investors know they are going to have months of down 5 or 8 per cent,” he said. “When you buy a normal hedge fund that’s a shock, but for Winton, this is within the expected range of returns.”Investors who have stuck with the managed futures funds over the long term have done well. HFR calculates that the average fund provided double-digit returns every year bar one in the 1990s, and the sector has never had a down year.There are suspicions among some investors that the sector’s sluggishness is due to more than the low volatility, though. Managed futures funds have absorbed a flood of cash since 2000, while the number of funds has increased sharply.Big names such as Winton or Aspect, another fund run by ex-AHL whizzes, are investing heavily in research.Investors will be hoping the computers can find new ways to beat the best brains and stop the successors to Deep Blue bleeding deep red ink."
698;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The Short View: Value investing;;It’s official. The best way of making money last year was the old-fashioned way: to pick cheap stocks. “Value” investing, founded by US academic Benjamin Graham in the 1930s as he took advantage of companies trading for less than their underlying value during the depression, continued to beat more modern strategies. Typified by investors who look for stocks that have low price-earnings multiples, or high dividend yields, the “value” school has now out-performed the market for seven years in a row.This was true across the developed world, and for companies of all sizes. Value clobbered “growth” investing, which picks stocks where earnings are growing fast.According to Morgan Stanley Capital International, its world value index gained 22.2 per cent last year, while its world growth index rose only 13.8 per cent. This disparity was greater, at about 10 percentage points, in North America.However, according to MSCI, its emerging markets value index slightly underperformed growth (by 28 per cent to 30.5 per cent). This was most notable in the Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) index, which covers the countries that drew the bulk of investors’ money last year.In the Brics, growth beat value by 54.6 per cent to 50.8 per cent. If you were to infer that investors in emerging markets are investing indiscriminately, while money in the developed world is being placed by bargain-hunters, you would be right.After the excessive valuations reached by growth stocks in 1999 and early 2000, it was to be expected that the value style would triumph for a number of years while the market regained its equilibrium. But how has value managed to keep out-performing for so long? As with so many other factors in the market these days, when in doubt, blame private equity.Classical value investors look for a “catalyst” to release hidden value. Private equity funds use value screens to find companies that can profitably be bought out for a premium to their current market value. And these funds were probably the catalyst that allowed value investors to triumph.
699;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The Short View: On US consumption;;"Is the US still the world’s consumer of last resort? There have been hopes that the rest of the world was growing less dependent on the appetite of American consumers. But the current world stock rally, and the sharp reaction to last Friday’s disappointing US gross domestic product figures for the third quarter, suggest otherwise.“Consumer discretionary” stocks – companies most dependent on the ebbs and flows of consumer expenditure – have led all others in recent weeks. According to the indices kept by Morgan Stanley Capital International, this sector has gained 6.1 per cent in the past month. Since the market hit a trough in mid-July, the consumer discretionary rise has been spectacular – 19.1 per cent. For the world outside the US, MSCI shows that the rebound in the sector has been almost identical – at about 19.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the world index as a whole is up only 11.8 per cent over the same period.So, US consumption matters. Optimism about it has been fuel for the rally across all world markets. With good reason. Compared with the market’s concerns in early July, it now appears that the Fed will not raise rates above 5.25 per cent; that lower oil prices will return cash to consumers’ wallets in time for the holiday season; and that the housing downturn may not be as bad as expected. All are reasons to believe in renewed US consumer spending.The “headline” GDP growth number, of 1.6 per cent, looked like a strong reason to doubt this scenario. Hence the dollar weakened, bond yields fell, the gold price rose and world equity markets suffered sell-offs which were led by the consumer discretionary sector. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.9 per cent fall on Monday. Honda, Canon and chip maker Tokyo Electron, all at the mercy of US consumers, were hit worst.But the scariest US data may not be the GDP number – which concealed a relatively healthy 3.2 per cent increase in consumer spending – but Wal-Mart’s announcement on Monday that same-store sales growth would be 0.5 per cent in October, the lowest increase in six years. If any one company represents the world’s consumer of last resort, it is Wal-Mart."
700;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-10-27T18:29:16Z;The Long View: On national indices;;It no longer makes sense for investors to look at the world as a series of nation states. Indices, not to mention marketers for fund management groups, have conditioned us to think this way. Funds are either UK or International. If they are foreign, they tend to cover a discrete region of the world. Only very rarely – mostly in the case of the self-evidently global mining and gold businesses – are sectoral funds sold on a global basis.But, at least when it comes to large companies, globalisation has rendered investing within national boundaries virtually obsolete. If large companies now want to grow, they need to do so across international borders.Proliferating new indices have been spawned both by the reality of globalisation and by the need to produce more products that can be used to launch exchange-traded funds. These indices make it possible to see how industrial, not geographical, logic is often the key to getting asset allocation right.Dow Jones Wilshire this week chose the United Nations building in New York to launch a new all-world index, which includes all the stocks from 56 countries – about 12,000 in all. Nifty software allows investors to cut and slice the data more or less any way they like – by size of company, by country, by industry, or by a combination of all of them.The rival indices operated by Morgan Stanley Capital International are only slightly less inclusive. Software from Rimes Online offers the choice of splitting up its world index by standard definitions – mostly regions – or by country or industry. These tell different stories. In sterling terms, MSCI’s all-world index is up 3.2 per cent this year. Cut regionally, the world outside the UK has gained only 2.52 per cent – a monument to the strength of sterling. Its Eurozone index has gained 11.2 per cent.Now look at the year in terms of global sectors. Utilities have gained 11.5 per cent, materials 7 per cent. The great laggard is information technology, down 3.7 per cent, weighed down in particular by semi-conductors, down 14.4 per cent.It soon becomes apparent that the sectoral split is more useful. Both semi-conductors and materials are industries run on a global basis. The dynamics of these sectors matter much more to their performance than the economy of the country in which they happen to have a head office.Over the last 10 years, sectoral divergence becomes spectacular. MSCI’s world energy index is up 143 per cent. Healthcare is up 83 per cent. Telecommunications have done stunningly badly, gaining 5 per cent.The UK’s own FTSE 100 offers further illustration of the limitations of looking at nation states. Less than half the index’s earnings come from the UK, and a look at its composition makes clear that its returns will not correlate particularly with the health of the UK economy. (If you do want to place a bet on the health of UK plc, better to do so through the mid-caps in the FTSE 250.)The biggest FTSE 100 companies, by far, are BP and Royal Dutch Shell, accounting for 16 per cent of the index between them. A UK economic recession would on its own have a minimal effect on either company. Rather, these stocks will move according to the ebb and flow of the world economy and according to the price of oil, arguably the most truly global market there is. Their natural peers are beyond these shores – Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total.Next on the list comes HSBC (7.6 per cent of the FTSE), once known as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The Midland Bank, bought by HSBC in 1992, was a play on the UK economy. HSBC, though based in London, is not. Financial services is less internationalised than oil, but globalisation has had an effect. More than 40 per cent of European banks’ earnings are generated outside their home country.As with the oil majors, a national classification actually gets in the way of deciding how to allocate resources between financial services.The fourth largest weighting in the FTSE-100 is GlaxoSmithKline, a player in pharmaceuticals, another global industry. The index is also overweight in mining companies. So it may be a good way to play the emerging markets, even if it is not a good way to bet on Britain.Sectoral effects also affect valuations. After I said in a Short View column this week that Eurozone stocks looked cheap as the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was trading at an earnings multiple of about 14, one reader wrote in. The letter pointed out that Europe is heavily weighted in financials (about 30 per cent), oil (12 per cent) and telecom (10 per cent), all of which trade at low multiples for good reason. In the emerging markets, nation states are important because political risks tend to be higher. But sectoral biases, or even biases to single companies, can be extreme.Invest in Korea’s Kospi index and fully 14 per cent is in one multinational company – Samsung. In Mexico’s IPC, 40 per cent of the index is made up of the pan-American empire of telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim.Invest in Brazil or Russia and you are betting on resources. Petrobras and CVRD, a steel company, are almost 30 per cent of the Brazilian Bovespa index, while resource groups Gazprom, Lukoil, Surgutneftgaz and Rosneft make up 46 per cent of the RTS 50 index between them.Globalisation has had many casualties.

702;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-10-20T17:48:36Z;The Long View: How adventurous are emerging markets?;;"What are emerging markets? The term has been with us for a quarter of a century, during which many countries have seen fevered development and in which emerging markets as an asset class have outperformed the developed world.But with recent successes for emerging markets investing, definitions of the sector have begun to fragment.At one end of the spectrum, there is the vogue for BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) investing, initially championed five years ago by Goldman Sachs. As far as Goldman is concerned, investing in these disparate countries, singled out for the global influence their size should give them, is “not really emerging markets investing”. They are too inter-connected with the developed world.At the other end, there is growing interest in “frontier” markets – so called because it is not even clear they yet deserve to be called emerging. These have the growth potential originally seen in the first emerging markets in the early 1980s, and almost certainly hide bargains because they are under-researched. Hedge funds have taken to scouring through sub-Saharan Africa.How do we define an emerging market? The term was coined, the literature seems to agree, in the early 1980s by Antoine van Agtmael, then working for the World Bank’s International Financial Corporation. The phrase was defined in terms of economics and levels of wealth. Emerging markets were economies with low-to-middle per capita income.It quickly came to be understood that emerging markets also needed to boost their growth, open their markets, and embark on structural reform. For years the term was synonymous with the Asian tiger economies.To all intents and purposes, the arbiter of emerging markets is now Morgan Stanley Capital International, whose indexes are used as benchmarks by some 90 per cent of emerging markets managers.

703;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-10-20T14:45:01Z;John Authers: An emerging truth;;What are emerging markets? The term has been with us for a quarter of a century, during which many countries have seen fevered development, and in which the “emerging markets” as an asset class have outperformed the developed world.But with recent successes for emerging markets investing, definitions of the sector have begun to fragment. At one end of the spectrum, there is the vogue for BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) investing, initially championed five years ago by Goldman Sachs. As far as Goldman Sachs is concerned, investing in these disparate countries, singled out for the global influence their size should give them, is “not really emerging markets investing”. They are too inter-connected with the developed world.At the other end of the spectrum, there is growing interest in what are now called “frontier” markets – so-called because it is not even clear that they yet deserve to be called “emerging”. These have the growth potential originally seen in the first emerging markets in the early 1980s, and almost certainly hide some bargains because they are under-researched. Hence hedge funds have taken to scouring through sub-Saharan Africa.So, how do we define an “emerging market”? The term was coined, the literature seems to agree, in the early 1980s by Antoine van Agtmael, who was then working for the World Bank’s International Financial Corporation. The term was defined in terms of economics and levels of wealth. “Emerging markets” were economies with low-to-middle per capita income.It quickly came to be understood that “emerging” markets also needed to boost their growth, open their markets, and embark on structural reform. Thus for years the term was synonymous with the Asian “Tiger” economies.To all practical intents and purposes, the arbiter of emerging markets is now Morgan Stanley Capital International, whose indexes are used as benchmarks by some 90 per cent of emerging markets managers. This gives the MSCI huge influence over where flows of money are directed. It favours countries with a dynamic corporate sector and good economic growth.The MSCI Emerging Markets index bears testament to the success of the Asian tigers. Korea and Taiwan between them account for almost 30 per cent.As a region, Asia accounts for 52 per cent of the index, while Latin America, victim of a succession of “lost decades”, makes up slightly less than 20 per cent.

704;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-06-13T16:50:30Z;Hungary’s austerity package burdens companies;;"Few countries have been hit as badly as Hungary in the market turmoil that has forced emerging market shares sharply lower over the past month.The Budapest Stock Exchange index closed down 3.4 per cent on Tuesday, meaning it has now fallen 15.4 per cent since Thursday when the market was unsettled by negative news on the state of Hungary’s state finances. The Hungarian market has fallen 26 per cent since its peak on May 5, and is down 9.5 per cent on the year. The forint has also weakened since Thursday, falling by about 3 per cent to a low this year of 271 to the euro.The Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index, comprising stocks in 25 countries, has fallen 20 per cent since May 8.In Turkey, where the central bank last week hiked interest rates by 175 basis points last week to stop a currency slide, shares fell 5.7 per cent on Tuesday. In Warsaw, central Europe’s largest market, the WIG index fell 3.6 per cent on Tuesday after falling 3.4 per cent on Monday. The market is down 20 per cent from its peak in early May, but is even for the year.Hungary has been one of the hardest hit, partly because of the international backdrop and partly because of domestic factors. It has a spiralling budget deficit – on track to reach 9.5 per cent of gross domestic product – and, like Turkey, a high current account deficit – about 9 per cent of GDP.Last weekend, Ferenc Gyurcsany, Hungary’s prime minister, announced an austerity package aimed at halting this year’s deficit at 8 per cent of GDP, and reducing it to 3 per cent by 2008. Mr Gyurcsany has also pledged long-term reforms of government services and state administration.Analysts were relieved that the socialist-liberal coalition, re-elected in April, had at last begun to address the runaway budget.But the package disappointed the markets: first, because more than 60 per cent of the planned savings will come from higher taxes and, second, because of the lack of detail in areas where spending cuts are planned.Istvan Zsoldos of Goldman Sachs in London said: “Beyond short-term measures they don’t seem to have clear plans for structural reforms.”The package is also expected to harm growth, particularly because it relies so heavily on taxation. Corporate profits tax will rise from 16 per cent to 20 per cent and employer health care contributions will jump from 4 per cent to 6 per cent of gross salaries. Consumption will be hit further by a jump in the lowest value added tax level from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. Subsidies on gas, electricity and medicines will also be cut substantially, further hitting consumer spending.Janos Veres, finance minister, projected on Sunday that growth in 2007 will slow by
2 percentage points. The Hungarian economy grew 4.5 per cent last year and is set to rise by a similar amount in 2006.Kingsmill Bond, head of emerging market strategy for Deutsche Bank, said: “It is encouraging, but clearly, given how much pain seems to be borne by companies rather than government, it is hardly good for the equity market.”However, on the government bond market, there is little sign of long-term investors heading for the exit, even though yields have risen as much as 50 basis points in the past two weeks.“Short-term and leveraged players have decided to reduce their holdings,” said Dwyfor Evans of Bank of America, referring to a gradual unwinding of the global carry trade which has hit countries as far apart as Iceland and New Zealand. “But real money does not seem to be withdrawing.”A sudden withdrawal of bond investors would be more painful for Hungary than an equities sell-off, where the small size of the market – total capitalisation of equities is just €26bn – limits the impact on the forint.Some analysts believe Hungary remains vulnerable to the type of near crisis witnessed last week in Turkey.Others disagree. Mr Evans said: “Turkey is in a far shakier position in relation to debt stocks and debt servicing. And, despite all its faults, Hungary has a tremendous buffer by being in the EU.”"
705;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-06-01T12:37:17Z;Lex: Bank of China;;"What market turmoil? China braved ugly markets to get away the world’s biggest listing in six years, priced it at the top of the range – and still secured a healthy 15 per cent pop on Thursday’s debut.True, Bank of China has much in its favour. Banks are the classic proxy on economic growth, which China has in spades. The retail tranche of BoC’s $9.7bn offering was more than 70 times subscribed, which left plenty of disappointed investors to pile in on Thursday. But immunity to global trends spreads further. In dollar terms, the Shanghai market rose 14 per cent last month, while Asian markets tracked by the Morgan Stanley Capital International index fell 6 per cent.Fundamentally, there is little to set China apart from its emerging market counterparts. It remains an economy in transition, with the attendant woes: volatile capital flows, quixotic government and corruption among them. Instead, technicalities and sentiment are holding sway. Domestic liquidity is strong. Last month’s listing of a modest ports company attracted $23bn from Hong Kong individuals. Investors assume the government will stand behind its spun-off assets. The banks, for example, have already had two “free lunch” bail-outs and Beijing will do what it takes to avoid any economic or other embarrassments ahead of the 2008 Olympics. China now has $100bn-plus companies, which are harder for fund managers to bypass.Alas, Hong Kong money is as fickle as any other, as demonstrated by the collapse of an earlier China bubble in 1997-98. Beijing will be less willing to bail out foreign investors and market capitalisations can shrink; mobile operator China Unicom is half the size it was when it came to market six years ago.

706;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-05-15T17:01:11Z;Market Overview: Jitters over interest rates continue to drag on fortunes for equities;;World markets had another nervous session on Friday as emerging market equities and currencies came under renewed pressure from concerns that higher global interest rates could undermine economic growth.Oil and metals prices also retreated sharply, although the dollar steadied in the wake of its recent decline, and a widely feared rout in US and European shares failed to materialise.In emerging markets, Indonesian, Russian and Turkish stocks were among the day’s worst performers, suffering falls of between 4 and 6 per cent, as the Morgan Stanley Capital International index headed towards its biggest one-day drop for two years.Michael Hartnett, global emerging market equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the massive year-to-date inflows into emerging market stocks warranted a cautious stance but added there was no bubble yet.“It is said that bubbles have three phases of investor psychology: ‘scepticism’, ‘confidence’ and finally, and fatally, ‘certainty’,” Mr Hartnett said. “Does the tidal wave of inflows mean we have reached that phase of ‘certainty’? Not in our view.”He added: “We see no bear market, but we continue to feel less bullish than earlier this year,” he saidSharp falls for commodity prices exacerbated the weakness in emerging markets. US benchmark crude futures dipped below $70 a barrel and gold fell back below $700 an ounce, while copper and zinc led a sell-off in base metals.Those losses triggered falls for mining and energy stocks in the US and Europe, although the markets overall held up quite well.By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent as modest buying emerged following the steep losses seen at the end of last week. The S&P 500 was flat but the Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.3 per cent.Wall Street’s early gains helped European stocks trim their initial losses. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed at 1,345.34, down 1.3 per cent but well off an early low of 1,334.15.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.7 per cent to end at its lowest level for two months as exporters declined on concerns about the strength of the yen. Elsewhere in Asia, the Straits Times index in Singapore fell 3.3 per cent, Hong Kong stocks shed 2.4 per cent and Seoul gave up 2.2 per cent.Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of research at Brewin Dolphin Securities, said the recent equity sell-off in the US and Europe was “perfectly natural” given the strong performance by most markets over the past six months. “It has been virtually one-way traffic in the markets since October,” he said.Mr Lenhoff also said he was broadly positive on the outlook for equities. “The fundamentals still look OK, valuations are not looking terribly stretched and global interest rates are at sensible levels.”The dollar staged a modest rally as it benefited from increasing nervousness about emerging markets and commodities. Slightly disappointing data on US capital inflows also went largely unheeded as the dollar bounced off a fresh one-year low against the euro and an eight-month low against the yen. However, analysts were dubious as to whether the greenback would maintain its upward momentum given the recent re-emergence of worries about structural imbalances in the US economy.Treasury bonds also benefited from the growing risk aversion among investors, with the yield on 10-year paper falling sharply from a four-year high of 5.21 per cent hit in Asian trading.
707;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-05-11T08:52:50Z;Tokyo shares close at a six-week low;;Tokyo shares hit a six-week closing low on Thursday, as investors continued to sell of shares of Japan’s leading exporters due to the continued strength of the yen against the dollar.The benchmark Nikkei 225 average closed down 0.5 per cent to 16,862.14, while the broader Topix index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,711.31.Shares of Toyota, the world’s most profitable carmaker, fell 2.1 per cent to Y6,540 due to the strength of the yen, which was hovering at around Y111.3 to the dollar. The carmaker on Wednesday reported its fourth straight year of record net income and sales. But Merrill Lynch said that the company’s forecast came in as expected. “We think that Toyota stock is no longer inexpensive because Toyota’s premium over the other two big Japanese auto makers has been expanded,” said Tatsuo Yoshida, autos analyst, in a note to clients.Other major exporters also lost ground. Sony fell 1.6 per cent to Y5,450 and Canon fell 0.5 per cent to Y8,500.Shares of several Japanese stocks that were added to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index rose. In total, 21 new Japanese stocks joined the MSCI Barra index, which is tracked by funds as a gauge of portfolio performance. Many funds mirror the changes made to the MSCI indices by buying stocks that have been added and selling those that are dropped. Shares of two new names were particular strong on Thursday: Hanshin Electric Railway was up 3.7 per cent to Y1,025 and Haseko, the construction company, rose 2 per cent to Y456Shares of Don Quijote, the discount retailer, fell 7.8 per cent to Y8,930. Credit Suisse on Wednesday lowered its earnings estimates for the company in the current business year and cut its target price on the stock to Y9,200 from Y9,400 after recent price gains.
708;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-05-08T17:08:33Z;Market Overview: Stocks hit fresh highs;;World stocks hit fresh highs on Monday, although an air of caution began to creep into the markets ahead of tomorrow’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision.The Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index touched a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a six-year peak and the pan-European Eurofirst 300 index closed at its best level since July 2001. However, both Europe and Wall Street gave up the bulk of their early gains.The initial bout of equity strength came in the wake of Friday’s US employment report, which fuelled expectations that the Fed would soon take a pause in its rate-tightening cycle.The US central bank has raised rates 15 times since June 2004, taking the Fed funds target rate to 4.75 per cent. Another quarter-point tightening this week is considered a virtual certainty, and vital for the markets will be the Fed’s accompanying statement.ABN Amro believes the Fed will pause once it has reached 5 per cent, but expects that the hiatus will be brief and monetary tightening will resume, albeit at a slower pace before the end of the year.It cites inflationary risks from the renewed slide in the dollar and stubbornly high energy prices “at a time when only above-average productivity gains are keeping wage increases from boosting unit labor costs”.ABN also sees little evidence that the rate increases so far have slowed down consumer spending, with the economy entering the second quarter with more growth momentum than had been expected.The rate uncertainty left Wall Street struggling for direction after its initial rise. By midday in New York, the Dow was flat at 11,578, having earlier risen to 11,603, within 150 points of its all-time high.The hesitant tone of the market came in spite of a sharp drop in oil prices amid easing concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. On Nymex, June West Texas Intermediate fell below $69 a barrel to a three-week low.The Iranian president said he had written to US President George W. Bush proposing new ways of improving relations between the two countries.European stocks closed at a 4½-year high but well off the day’s best level. The Eurofirst 300 index ending 0.1 per cent higher at 1,399.35, having risen as high as 1,407.08.In Asia, Japanese equity investors returned from the “Golden Week” holiday in bullish mood, and the Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.8 per cent. Seoul ended at a record high while Hong Kong and Taipei closed at 5½-year peaks. Thai stocks hit their best levels for two years amid hopes that an end to the country’s political deadlock was within sight.The dollar managed a modest rally after dropping to one-year lows against the euro, sterling and the Swiss franc, but was stuck at an eight-month trough against the yen.Goldman Sachs pointed out that with the accelerated decline of the dollar against the yen, the debate was back on over whether the greenback was at the start of a big downward move.“As the market has begun to see the seeds of slower domestic demand in the US and a shift in the balance of policy tightening away from the US, cyclical forces are now starting to line up with the structural pressures,” said strategist Dominic Wilson. “Rate differentials are no longer systematically widening in favour of the US and the market is playing less attention to them in any case. “Gold fell back after touching a fresh 25-year high of $684.70 an ounce in early trade, while copper retreated from Friday’s all-time high of $7,800 a tonne.
709;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-02-16T20:49:20Z;Hedge funds see the best returns for five years;;"Hedge funds made a strong start this year, posting their best monthly returns for more than five years last month.After a lacklustre 2005, January saw a sharp recovery in investment returns, even in some of the more beleaguered investment strategies such as convertible arbitrage.The Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index rose by 3.23 per cent in January, propelled by strong gains in funds betting on emerging markets, macro-
economic trends and events such as takeovers.The January performance was the highest monthly return since August 2000 and was not far off half the total rise of 7.61 per cent for all of 2005. The monthly rise compared with a 1.3 per cent gain in the MSCI World Sovereign Debt Index and a 4.5 per cent rise in the MSCI World Equity Index.“There have been some excellent returns achieved by hedge funds in January,” said Jack Inglis, co-head of prime broking in Europe for Morgan Stanley.But industry experts warned that February had been poorer so far, and data showed on Thursday that subdued investment performance in 2005 translated into a sharp fall in inflows into funds.Inflows slowed substantially last year to $11.99bn (€10bn), from $50.34bn in 2004 and $49.69bn in 2003, said MSCI Barra, a provider of index data and risk management analysis.There was an outflow in the fourth quarter of $1.9bn from the 1,300 hedge funds – managing some $265bn of assets – that were surveyed by MSCI Barra.The worst hit area was convertible arbitrage, where hedge funds seek to trade on anomalies in the pricing of convertible bonds – debt instruments that can convert into ordinary shares. Amid a spate of closures of such funds, the sector showed outflows of $5.34bn in 2005.Ironically, this might have helped the performance of surviving funds in January by reducing competition.Mr Inglis said some had benefited from the recovery in convertible bond prices that had been depressed by forced selling last year from funds that were experiencing redemptions.Credit Suisse/Tremont said convertible arbitrage fund managers reported a 2.75 per cent gain in January, the strongest monthly performance in three years. The rise compared with a fall of 2.55 per cent for all of 2005.Other hedge fund areas to do well were emerging markets (up 5.76 per cent) and long-short (up 4.18 per cent). Event-driven funds also benefited from the rise in mergers and acquisitions."
710;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2006-01-23T17:19:57Z;Gulf counties get first benchmark indices;;The increasing importance of the Gulf countries in the international investment community became apparent on Monday when MSCI Barra became the first index provider to launch benchmark indices across the region.The 17 equity indices will cover the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.These are the first brand new countries to be added by MSCI Barra since the MSCI Russia index was created in 1998.Remy Briand, global head of core research at MSCI Barra, said the main demand for the new indices had come from investors in the GCC region who wanted a benchmark for their investments in the region.There had also been interest from other international investors.“We are really the first index provider to provide an index for the region,” he said. “There are already stock market indices for each country, but nothing that spans the region and that is built on a systematic basis.”Mr Briand noted that Saudi Arabia, the region's biggest market, was not open to international investors but was open to investors from other GCC countries. The other countries were open to international and other GCC investors, although they imposed some investment restrictionsThat is why MSCI Barra has created two index series.One reflects the investment restrictions applied to a GCC-based investor, and the other reflects the restrictions applied to a domestic investor.Because of the restrictions, MSCI Barra is not currently planning to add any of these countries to its MSCI Emerging Markets Index.Stock markets in the Gulf have seen strong rallies, helped by the recycling of petrodollars on the back of high oil prices, and there has been enormous demand for new share issues.Khalid Ghayer, managing director and global head of research at MSCI Barra, said: “The region’s capital markets have become quite sizeable. We estimate the full market capitalisation of these equity markets to be around $1,000bn based on November 30 2005 data.”There have been significant rallies in other Middle Eastern markets. Egypt was the top performing MSCI equity index last year, returning over 154 per cent, while Jordan came third with a 71.72 per cent return.The new indices will be available to clients from Tuesday.
711;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2005-12-09T13:38:46Z;Duma loosens foreign ownership rules for Gazprom;;Russia’s lower house of parliament on Friday voted to lift the ban on foreign ownership of shares in state gas monopoly Gazprom.The Duma passed the bill in its second and third readings, marking a key step in liberalising the company’s share ownership and establishing it as one of the world’s leading emerging market stocks.The move could make Gazprom the heaviest-weighted stock in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) emerging market index, which is followed by investors managing more than $3,000bn.The upper house is expected to back the change on December 14 enabling President Vladimir Putin to sign it into law by the end of the year.Under current law foreigners cannot own more than 20 per cent of Gazprom, Russia’s largest listed company and the world’s largest gas producer. The company’s local shares, which only Russians are allowed to buy, trade at a discount to its American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which are open to all.Just 4.5 per cent of the company is officially available to foreign investors through ADRs traded in London.The amendments will lift these restrictions and there are also plans to ease rules governing the exchanges on which Gazprom shares may be traded. Currently trading is only permitted on the St Petersburg Stock Exchange and forbidden on the country’s two leading markets, the Russian Stock Exchange and the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange.However, the changes also seek to cement state control of Gazprom, stating that the government should hold at least 50 per cent plus one share, either directly or through companies under government control. Any transaction that would bring the government interest below this level would then be subject to clearance by a federal law.After loosening control in the 1990s, the Russian government has this year built its stake in Gazprom back up to 51 per cent.
712;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Chunghwa Telecom in sale mode;;Chunghwa Telecom, the state-owned former telecoms monopoly in Taiwan, is to invite investment banks to pitch for a role in the sale of a 17 per cent government stake in the company as early as next week.The move will bring the island's largest phone company one step closer to bringing the government's holding in Chunghwa to less than 50 per cent.?We issued the request for comments on Tuesday,? Hochen Tan, Chunghwa chairman, said. The request for comments gives politicians, unions and financial institutions five days to suggest changes. Then, a request for a proposal, or invitation to banks to pitch, will be issued.Part of the Chunghwa stake is expected to be sold through an offering of American depositary receipts. If the whole 17 per cent is sold as ADRs, it could become Taiwan's largest secondary offering.The cabinet has said it wants the sale to take place before the end of June to take advantage of an expected improvement in market sentiment after Morgan Stanley Capital International increases Taiwan's weighting in its benchmark indices on May 31.Mr Hochen said he expected Chunghwa Telecom to choose financial advisers for the deal within three weeks. However, he cautioned that the share sale could still be blocked if the government failed to reach agreement with the company's unions. ?The employee side is still demanding stronger social guarantees from the government,? Mr Hochen said.The cabinet is negotiating with the opposition over potential amendments to the privatisation law that would allow the government to spend part of the proceeds on early-retirement programmes.
713;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2004-11-30T16:54:18Z;Taipei stocks unmoved by MSCI weighting rise;;An increase in Taiwan's representation in Morgan Stanley Capital International's benchmark indices caused no more than a blip in the island's stock market on Tuesday, as expectations it could bring huge additional foreign fund inflows failed to materialise.The anti-climax reflected investor caution about the potential impact of a downturn in the technology sector, weaker global economic growth and political uncertainties on the island, analysts said.The Weighted Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed 1 per cent higher at 5844.76 points on Tuesday, leaving it down marginally for the year. After directionless trading over most of the day, foreign institutional investors rushed into MSCI index stocks during the last minute of trading.The global index provider, whose moves are keenly followed by international fund managers, raised the weighting of Taiwanese stocks in its benchmark indices from 55 per cent of their market capitalisation to 75 per cent as of market closing yesterday. The weighting will be increased to reflect full market capitalisation on May 31 next year. The changes reflect Taipei's removal of most restrictions on foreign investors.Analysts had expected passive funds - which automatically track the MSCI benchmark indices - could redirect up to US$10bn into Taiwan from South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore and other Asian markets, with active funds investing up to 10 times this amount. But this could prove overly-optimistic.“Net foreign buying has been US$4.9bn this month and last, and while there will be more MSCI-related flows over the next week, the total will fall short of our estimate of US$10bn,” said Peter Sutton, head of research at CLSA in Taipei. “But this only reflects the willingness to be underweight as growth turns weak.”Foreign investors bought a net T$250bn over the past four months, according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange. It is unclear how much of this anticipated the MSCI changes. “Most of this money came from active funds”, said Arik Reiss, equities derivatives analyst at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.The passive flows - estimated by Merrill Lynch at US$1.66bn for the first phase of MSCI's reweighting - had not taken place in full as would be expected from passive funds in developed markets, he said.Due to widely diverging estimates of how much money actually follows MSCI's indices, analysts disagree over the composition of net foreign inflows in recent months. However, most expect foreign funds willgradually buy more Taiwanese stocks.Many investors are expected to wait for the result of December's legislative elections. Once this uncertainty is resolved, analysts believe international institutional investors will invest in Taiwan more actively, as the MSCI upgrade has left many of them severely underweight in the country.

716;MSCI;MSCI Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
