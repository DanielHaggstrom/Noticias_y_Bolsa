0;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-03-07T10:00:26Z;Bubble bursts for US make-up market;Sales down as ‘cake face’ falls out of fashion and product fatigue sets in;When beauty blogger-turned-entrepreneur Huda Kattan was shooting an advertising campaign for her new skincare line, she chided staff for airbrushing her to perfection.“You took away my zits, put them back!” she recounted in a recent Instagram video. “I want photos to be as real as possible.”Few have had their finger on the pulse of the US beauty market like Ms Kattan, who over the past seven years has built a make-up business — Huda Beauty — valued at more than $1bn by championing a heavily made-up look she dubbed “cake face”. That the 36-year-old has now moved into skincare reflects concerns about how the once-booming US beauty market — the world’s largest — has gone into reverse.High-end make-up sales fell 7 per cent to $7.6bn last year, contracting for the first time in a decade, according to NPD Group. The market research firm tracks department stores and speciality retailers such as Sephora and Ulta Beauty but not mass-market outlets such as Target. In contrast, US skincare sales rose by 5 per cent to $5.9bn, outpacing make-up for the third year in a row. This dynamic is already having repercussions for everyone, from the sector’s biggest players L’Oréal, Estée Lauder and Coty to newer independent brands such as Anastasia Beverly Hills and ColourPop Cosmetics. Ulta Beauty, a US chain of beauty stores, lost almost a third of its market value in a single day last August after it issued a profit warning and predicted continued weak demand for make-up.Industry executives said that a shake-out is looming that will cull so-called “indie” brands and challenge established companies. Players are scrambling to adapt to an environment where the latest face mask is more coveted than a new eyeshadow palette. “In the boom years everyone was winning in make-up, but now you’re likely to see a gap open between the winners and losers,” said Chris de Lapuente, chief executive of LVMH-owned Sephora. “We’re going to see which of the new independent brands have long-term sustainability and which end up being fads.”Sephora is unlikely to add as many new make-up brands as in the past, said Mr de Lapuente: “If the category isn’t growing, then we will have to be more discerning than before.”While Sephora is pressing on with plans to open up to 100 stores in the US this year, skincare and haircare products — rather than make-up — will get more of the prominent display space near the front of stores. As the US stutters, cosmetics sales have been growing at a double-digit rate in much of Asia in recent years, while Europe has been flat to slightly up.Several reasons explain the US make-up slowdown. Industry executives and analysts said they range from aesthetic considerations to the typical cyclical swing between skincare and make-up. Many think fatigue has set in among women who simply bought too many products.One thing is clear: the foundation-heavy look is no longer in vogue. The “contouring” technique, which involves applying several shades of product to parts of the face to subtly enhance certain features, has been replaced by a more natural look. Brought to the market by influencers such as Kim Kardashian, contouring spawned a cottage industry of make-up tutorials on YouTube and Instagram, which underpinned sales during the boom.The change was reflected in the rise of the “VSCO girl”, a teenage fashion trend that went viral last year. Named after the photo-editing app VSCO, and known for a relaxed and natural look, VSCO girls favour lip gloss and facial sprays — a marked contrast to the high-maintenance Kardashian aesthetic. Piper Jaffray’s annual survey of teens showed that last year spending on cosmetics fell to 19-year lows, down by a fifth to reach $106 spent per person each year. A growing number of wealthier teens indicate they are not wearing make-up at all — up from 12 per cent to 20 per cent in the past five years.Women are increasingly shifting their spending from make-up to skincare products such as face masks and serums, or opting for hybrid products such as tinted moisturisers that blur the lines between the categories. That dynamic has helped the big companies such as L’Oréal and Estée Lauder — which also have strong skincare offerings — weather the downturn in make-up. But it has left many independent cosmetics brands rushing to launch skincare lines, like Kylie Jenner’s brand did last year.L’Oréal chief executive Jean-Paul Agon said in an interview that the return of a more natural look was forcing some of the indie brands it had acquired in recent years to adapt. L’Oréal’s NYX and Urban Decay were emblematic of a certain “very spectacular, visible and a bit heavy” look that was now out of favour, he added. “The brands just need to evolve,” said Mr Agon. “Our teams in the US are working to launch new products that correspond more closely to what consumers want now.” The drag from these brands caused L’Oréal’s North American sales to decline 0.8 per cent last year on a like-for-like basis, ending more than a decade of consecutive yearly growth. Meanwhile in February Estée Lauder booked $777m of impairment charges related to weaker performance of its make-up brands in the US, where sales fell by 5 per cent to $4.7bn in the year to June 30.Brands that advocate a more natural look are thriving. Direct-to-consumer player Glossier has become among the most successful since it launched a decade ago by popularising a “skin first, make-up second philosophy”.Ali Weiss, head of marketing at New York-based Glossier, said it created its Futuredew oil-serum hybrid product to respond to women’s desires for a barely there clean look. It is “all about healthy hydration, glow and dew,” she said.Larissa Jensen, a beauty analyst at NPD Group, predicted that future make-up sales would be driven by so-called “clean beauty” products that emphasise natural ingredients paired with more sustainable packaging and manufacturing. “We think this will be big,” she said. Others think the depressed demand for make-up reflects a more profound shift, and that the “less is more” spirit is here to stay. In videos posted on YouTube, influencers such as Jeffree Star recount their “anti-hauls” that explain what they did not buy, and discuss “editing” their massive make-up collections. Others post to Instagram about “project pans” in which people choose products from their make-up collection and chart their progress to the bottom of the vial or bottle. On online chat platform Reddit, members of a group dubbed MakeupRehab post about their experience doing “no-buy” challenges in which they aim to go months or years without adding to their collections.One blogger wrote about overcoming a Sephora “addiction” that was costing her $4,000 a year. Eventually, the desire to buy faded, she said. “I realised today . . . Each dollar I spend, each minute I take consuming make-up media is one taken from somewhere else.”
1;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-02-28T07:55:32Z;JAB appoints fresh leadership for cosmetics company Coty;Luxury veteran Pierre Denis, chief executive of Jimmy Choo, will join make-up group by summer;Cosmetics firm Coty has named its fourth chief executive in five years as it seeks to deliver on a long-promised turnround under the majority ownership of investment group JAB Holdings.Pierre Denis, a luxury industry veteran who heads Jimmy Choo, will take over after a transition period. He will replace Pierre Laubies, who joined in November 2018 and who will stay until this summer when Coty finishes the sale process of its professional business.The changes come after a tumultuous period at the maker of CoverGirl make-up and Wella hair colour that was marked by repeated profit warnings during the difficult integration of its $12bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands in 2015. Coty’s consumer beauty division, its largest, has struggled as its mass-market brands lose share to “indie” make-up companies often fronted by charismatic influencers.To right the ship, JAB turned to Mr Laubies, a consumer industry veteran who spent decades at Mars Inc. Mr Laubies set out a four-year turnround plan in July 2019 that promised to cut costs, trim staff ranks, and simplify its product lines so as to stem market share losses.More recently during his tenure, Coty kicked off an auction of its professional hair and nail care division that brings in about 20 per cent of sales, and acquired a majority stake in US celebrity Kylie Jenner’s make-up company for $600m.“In less than 18 months, Pierre Laubies and his team have implemented a number of strategic initiatives to position the company for sustainable growth and long-term success,” said Peter Harf, Coty’s board chairman and JAB’s chairman, in a statement.Mr Harf welcomed the incoming chief, saying Mr Denis brought “a wealth of experience in cosmetics and luxury in developed and developing markets, including Asia”.Pierre-André Terisse, chief financial officer, will take on chief operating officer duties, including managing supply chain and delivering on promised cost cuts.JAB has a lot riding on fixing Coty because it is one of its oldest investments, and it doubled down last year by spending $1.7bn last year to take back majority control of Coty’s share capital.Like-for-like group sales were down 3.5 per cent in the financial year to end of June 2019, while the consumer business was down 10.6 per cent. Those trends improved in the second quarter, with sales down 1.4 per cent, and consumer down 6.7 per cent.Coty shares have fallen 12 per cent in the past year compared with an 11 per cent rise for market leader L’Oréal.To replace the two departures on the board, Coty has named two non-executive directors: Isabelle Parize as an independent, and Justine Tan, a partner at JAB.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi
2;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-02-06T20:03:19Z;France’s L’Oréal says coronavirus to weigh on sales in Asia;World’s biggest make-up company posted strong fourth-quarter despite US weakness;France’s L’Oréal warned the outbreak of the coronavirus would cause a temporary slowdown in the beauty market in China, a key driver of its growth, and also affect travel retail, although it was “too early to assess” the extent of the risk. Strong demand among Chinese shoppers for high-end cosmetics such as the Lancôme brand and Yves St Laurent perfumes powered the world’s biggest cosmetics maker to 9.6 per cent comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter, ahead of analyst expectations. The strong finish helped L’Oréal achieve 8 per cent like-for-like sales growth last year, an improvement over the 7.1 per cent in 2018. Asia’s 25 per cent like-for-like sales growth last year more than offset weakness in North America, which declined 0.8 per cent on a like-for-like basis, contracting for the first time since the 2009 financial crisisBeauty products have proved a rare bright spot in the global consumer goods sector in recent years, bucking malaise that has hit food and beverage makers that have struggled to cope with changing tastes and the rise of commerce. Although the advent of Instagram and the rise of celebrity influencers has led to an onslaught of new independent beauty brands, market leaders like L’Oréal and Estee Lauder have withstood the challenge better than mass-market players such as Coty.“We have outperformed the market in a spectacular way,” said L’Oréal’s chief executive Jean-Paul Agon. “This confirms that our strategy to focus on Asia, skincare, and luxury has paid off.”Earnings per share came in at €7.74, slightly less than the €7.78 forecast by analysts. The company will propose a dividend of €4.25 per share, up 10 per cent from 2018.The coronavirus has killed more than 500 people in China and led to widespread travel restrictions. L’Oréal did not issue specific guidance on the impact of the outbreak, saying only that it would “outperform the beauty market” and grow sales and profits. In contrast, Estee Lauder earlier on Thursday trimmed its fiscal 2020 forecast for earnings per share by about 4 per cent, blaming the coronavirus outbreak in China, a key market for its Clinique skincare products.Citi analyst Cedric Besnard wrote in a note that L’Oréal’s large exposure to Asia meant the duration of the coronavirus-related slowdown will be key to its profitability this year. “Given the now total skew of the L’Oréal model . . . every incremental month before the crisis is solved will probably lead to implicit downgrades, albeit on a higher and best-in-class earnings base,” he said. L’Oréal shares are up 23 per cent in the past year, outpacing a 13 per cent rise in the MSCI Europe consumer staples index, but trailing smaller rival Estee Lauder’s 34 per cent rise. 
3;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-11-18T16:55:17Z;Coty buys into Kylie Jenner start-up to burnish Instagram appeal;Deal puts $1.2bn valuation on make-up business founded by youngest Kardashian sister ;Coty is buying a controlling stake in Kylie Jenner’s cosmetics company for $600m in a bet that the youngest Kardashian sister’s celebrity and social media savvy will help revive growth at its flagging beauty business.Owned by investment company JAB Holdings, Coty will hold a 51 per cent stake in Kylie Cosmetics once the deal closes later this year*. For Ms Jenner, selling a chunk of her four-year old company at a rough valuation of $1.2bn cements her status as a mogul at the age of just 22. Earlier this year, Forbes magazine crowned her “the youngest self-made billionaire ever” as her eponymous company grew in notoriety and revenue.The deal is another sign of how the beauty industry is changing in the social media era as celebrities like Ms Jenner and pop star Rihanna mint new brands seemingly overnight, appealing to younger consumers with little loyalty to old brand names.“With a single social media post, Kylie is able to reach double the number of people who watch the Super Bowl every year, and she is the seventh-most followed person on Instagram,” said Coty chief executive Pierre Laubies, who joined the company a year ago.Companies including L’Oréal and Shiseido have been on acquisition sprees in a bid to remain relevant amid the boom in upstart brands. Also on Monday, Estée Lauder said it would buy the two-thirds of Korean skincare company Have & Be Co that it did not already own for $1.1bn. Coty will take on additional borrowing to finance the acquisition, adding to its already heavy debt load of $7.4bn, which represented a net debt-to-ebitda ratio of 5.5 times at the end of September. Coty expects the Kylie Jenner deal to add “more than 1 per cent” to annual net revenue growth for its fragrance, cosmetics and skincare products over the next three years, and for the deal to boost its earnings per share after one year. Kylie Cosmetics is on track to reach $200m in sales this year, growing at roughly 40 per cent annually. Ms Jenner’s business has an ebitda margin of more than 25 per cent, Coty said.The Jenner move is also a sign that Coty’s new management and its backers at JAB are not afraid of embarking on additional acquisitions, despite the company’s track record of destroying value with such moves. It was forced to write down a quarter of the $12bn value of its 2015 acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands, and recently sold off Younique, a social selling platform for make-up, for $78m about two years after paying $600m for it.Coty is still in the midst of a four-year restructuring effort to put the company on firmer footing after several torrid years marked by management changes, supply chain mishaps, and market share losses. It recently put its haircare and professional beauty businesses up for sale, which account for nearly a third of its $8.6bn annual revenue. Coty said at the time that the divestment was supposed to cut debt and create a smaller, more profitable company.*This story has been amended since original publication to note that Coty will have a 51 per cent stake in the company after the deal closes.
4;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-10-21T15:12:34Z;Coty plans sale of professional beauty division ;Shares rise as maker of Wella and Clairol aims to cut debt and focus on turnround;Cosmetics maker Coty is exploring the sale of its professional hair and nail products business, including Wella and Clairol, as it seeks to cut debt and simplify its structure after a series of setbacks at the company.Shares in the US-listed group rose nearly 15 per cent on news that Coty, which is majority owned by investment company JAB Holdings, had hired Credit Suisse to run a sale process for the units. The division caters to professional salons and is expected to generate $2.7bn in revenue this year.Other brands in the portfolio that Coty is putting up for sale include Good Hair Day (ghd) and OPI nail care products. It is also seeking to sell its Brazilian operation and aims to complete the sales by mid-2020.Coty hoped to fetch at least $8bn-$9bn from the transactions, one person added, and thought that rival companies in the sector and private equity bidders would be interested in all or parts of the businesses.The mooted sale is the latest effort by Coty’s backer JAB to fix the business, which has been among the weakest in a portfolio that also includes Keurig Dr Pepper and Pret A Manger.Coty botched the integration of its 2015 acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands for $12.5bn and was forced to write down a quarter of the value of the deal. It also suffered supply chain problems last year, prompting its share price to slide and JAB to replace management.Coty chief executive Pierre Laubies said the asset sales would “reposition Coty as a more focused and agile company, deleverage our balance sheet, and improve our ability to invest in areas with the greatest growth potential”.If the professional business is sold Coty will be left with its consumer beauty division, which has been struggling with declining sales as mass-market brands such as CoverGirl lose favour with young buyers, and its luxury business that makes fragrances under licence.The disposal would unload some of the P&G brands as well as undo a series of acquisitions going back to 2010. The professional division brought in about a fifth of Coty’s annual sales of $8.65bn in the year to the end of June.Shares in Coty, which has net debt of $7.4bn, struggled over the past year and had fallen below the level of their 2013 initial public offering. Monday’s gains pushed its market value to $8.7bn.The company’s lower profit margins and weaker growth have left it trading at a significant discount to larger rivals L’Oréal and Estée Lauder, which have seen their shares rise 26 per cent and 47 per cent respectively in the past year.The company said that proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to reduce its net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from more than 5 times to around 3 times. Additional proceeds would be returned to shareholders, including JAB.JAB, which manages the wealth of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, increased its shareholding in Coty to 60 per cent from 40 per cent in April as it attempted to draw a line under a difficult period. The problems at Coty also played a role in the departure of Bart Becht, a managing partner at JAB who left the group in January and who had previously served as Coty’s chairman. 
5;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-08-28T18:04:07Z;Coty suffers worsening sales at its biggest division;Company controlled by JAB Holdings looks to 4-year turnround plan for a makeover;The head of Coty has said there will be “progress as of this year” in its efforts to fix long-running problems at its biggest division, which sells mass-market make-up brands including CoverGirl and Max Factor, after reporting a drop in annual sales.Supply chain disruptions and the loss of distribution at mass-market retailers caused comparable sales in the year to June 30 to contract 10.6 per cent at the division. That was a marked deterioration from the year before, when the consumer unit appeared to be turning a corner with like-for-like sales falling only 4 per cent compared with a 10 per cent decline in fiscal 2017.That led net revenue to shrink further than it had the previous year, falling 8 per cent to $8.6bn, Coty said on Wednesday, which was largely in line with expectations.The consumer beauty unit accounts for roughly 40 per cent of Coty’s revenues, and has been the company’s weak spot even as its professional beauty supplies and luxury fragrances continue to attract shoppers and retailers.The results showed how Pierre Laubies, who joined the company in November as its fourth chief executive in five years, is mired in a difficult turnround. In July, Coty unveiled a $600m four-year restructuring plan that aims to improve operating margins by 4 percentage points.“We face a credibility deficit at Coty, and we are starting to close it by talking to investors” to explain the plan, Mr Laubies told the Financial Times. “We will need to be persistent and consistent for change to occur.”Coty has been the problem child in the portfolio of JAB Holdings, the investment company that has spent more than $50bn on acquisitions in the consumer sector in the past five years. The difficulties stem largely from when JAB engineered the acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty products portfolio for $12.5bn in 2015, doubling the size of Coty in terms of revenue and bringing together 20,000 employees in 41 countries. But it took far longer to integrate the P&G business than planned, and a series of problems in the supply chain and operations began to drag on performance. Meanwhile, troubles at the consumer division deepened as Coty’s products lost relevance with consumers, who were increasingly turning to upstart brands from influencers such as Kylie Jenner.Fourth-quarter sales fell 8 per cent to $2.12bn, while Coty swung to a net loss of $2.8bn largely because of previously announced writedowns on the value of its consumer beauty division. Quarterly organic sales growth, which strips out the effect of currency and asset sales and acquisitions, fell 4.1 per cent, slightly worse than the 3.7 per cent decline in the third quarter. Coty shares rose roughly 5 per cent in morning trading in New York, but they are still languishing below their 2013 initial public offering price and barely a quarter of where they traded before the P&G deal. Nevertheless, JAB is standing by Coty, which is one of its oldest investments having begun in 1992. It spent $1.75bn in a tender offer to take back majority control of Coty earlier this year, raising its stake from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. 
6;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-07-01T16:32:04Z;Cosmetics maker Coty takes $3bn writedown in four-year restructuring;Longtime owner JAB Holdings has much at stake after taking back majority control;Cosmetics company Coty will spend $600m over the next four years to restructure its lossmaking operations and take a $3bn writedown on the botched $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands three years ago.As part of a turnround plan unveiled on Monday, Coty made a deal with its creditors to provide it with funding to carry out the overhaul, which will reduce staff, simplify product lines and reorganise the company into distinct geographical businesses. Investors seem unconvinced, sending shares down 17 per cent to $11.02 at their lowest point in New York trading.The plan is the latest effort to fix the mess at the maker of CoverGirl cosmetics and Wella haircare products, which is on its fourth chief executive in five years.Its woes have been a headache for investment company JAB Holdings, which has been Coty’s backer since 1992 and engineered the P&G deal in the hopes that it would vault Coty into the beauty industry big league. Instead, the acquisition, which doubled Coty’s size in an effort to compete with industry leaders L’Oréal and Estée Lauder, foundered during a complex integration process that involved 20,000 employees in 41 countries, working across 70 brands, and 16 manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, Coty’s largest division, which sells mass-market consumer make-up brands like Max Factor and accounts for 40 per cent of sales, began to lose market share to new brands.Revenue has stagnated, and the shares have halved since the P&G deal was announced in mid-2015. Before Monday’s announcement Coty had already taken a $965m writedown on the deal. Pierre Laubies, chief executive, acknowledged that times had been tough but said a new stronger company would emerge from the process. “Our turnround plan will enable us to build a better business in the coming four years, while we gradually prepare for growth,” Mr Laubies said. “We will focus our strategic efforts and investments on fewer brands globally while simplifying our operations and organisation.” As part of the plan, Coty management will move from New York to Amsterdam. The company will also increase its spending on research and development from 1.9 per cent of sales to 2.3 per cent, in an effort to boost sales of its premium and luxury products, which have held up better in recent years. But that still falls short of the 3.4 per cent of sales that L’Oréal spends on R&D.Despite Coty’s problems, earlier this year JAB spent $1.75bn to raise its stake from 49 to 60 per cent. Since the closing of the tender in late April, the shares have risen nearly 24 per cent, supported in part by JAB and Coty executives purchasing big blocks of shares. Peter Harf, JAB chairman, alone increased the size of his Coty holdings by 60 per cent, to 11m shares, worth $147.6m.By the end of the 2023 fiscal year on June 30, Coty is aiming to reach operating margins of between 14 and 16 per cent, up from 10.6 per cent currently.It has also promised free cash flow of about $1bn, against $200m to $300m now, and to cut debt to reach a net debt-to-ebitda ratio of less than four times. Its leverage ratio stood at 5.7 times at the end of the third quarter.Joe Lachky, Wells Fargo analyst, said the 2023 targets seemed “ambitious”, especially considering Coty’s recent execution challenges. “It is now up to the new management team to deliver,” he said.
7;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-05-08T12:07:21Z;Coty revenues worse than feared on mass market weakness;Chief executive says more work needed to turnround business;Cosmetics maker Coty on Wednesday said its revenues fell more than expected in its fiscal third quarter, weighed down by weaker demand for its mass market beauty products, and admitted more work needs to be done to turnround the business.The company, whose brands include CoverGirl make-up and Wella hair products, said revenues fell 10.4 per cent from a year ago to $1.99bn in the three months ended in March. That missed analyst expectations for $2.06bn, according to a Refinitiv survey. Like-for-like revenues declined 3.7 per cent.Coty said problems in its supply chain related to distribution centers in Europe and the US, which had knocked its results in recent months, had been “largely resolved” but still weighed on sales.Moreover, its consumer beauty business continued to see a double-digit decline as its mass beauty brands face market share losses and weakness in both Europe and the US.Meanwhile, in its luxury division revenues slid but like-for-like sales were up 2.8 per cent supported by strength in its Burberry, Gucci and Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss brands.Despite the decline in revenues, Coty’s net loss narrowed to $12.1m from $77m in the year ago quarter as it curbed expenses. That translated to a loss of 2 cents a share, improved from the 10 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, a penny above estimates.Gross margin fell 70 basis points from a year ago to 62.8 per cent.“While we have achieved good profit delivery, the weak top-line result demonstrates that there is still much to be done to turnround the business,” said chief executive Pierre Laubies.“We must capitalise on the solid results of the luxury and professional beauty divisions, and address the weakness of the consumer beauty division’s performance via shelf productivity, product range simplification, and brand investment at scale.”Coty botched the 2016 integration of the $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands, which was aimed at challenging established beauty leaders such as L’Oreal and Estée Lauder. Earlier this year the company acknowledged the difficulties in turning around some of those beauty brands and took a nearly $1bn writedown on the assets.It has also failed to keep up with brands that rely on social media influencers like Kylie Jenner to quickly build a following.The company has appointed a new senior management team following the abrupt departure of its chief executive last year and its finance chief earlier in 2019 and Mr Laubies said he was “very pleased with how the new management team has coalesced”.JAB Holdings, the firm that invests the wealth of one of Germany’s richest families, the Reimanns, took back majority ownership of the cosmetics maker and now owns 60 per cent of Coty.Coty shares, which are up more than 80 per cent year-to-date, fell 4 per cent in pre-market trade.
8;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-04-29T11:37:20Z;JAB takes back majority control of Coty with tender offer;Investment firm garnered strong demand for deal;JAB Holdings successfully boosted its stake in problem-plagued cosmetics maker Coty, taking back majority control after strong investor response to its tender offer.The investment firm that has been on a $50bn-plus deal spree across the consumer sector said in a statement on the preliminary results of the offer that 217m shares had been tendered. JAB will buy 150m of them, taking its stake to 60 per cent from 40 per cent currently.The deal shows how JAB, which also owns Keurig Dr Pepper and Pret A Manger, is doubling down to support Coty, one of its oldest investments after a particularly difficult stretch. Not only has Coty been buffeted by disruption hitting the beauty sector, it botched the integration of a blockbuster $12.5bn deal to buy Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands in 2015.A new management team is now in place, and is expected to unveil a turnround plan later this year for Coty, whose brands include CoverGirl make-up and Wella hair products.Coty shares closed on Friday at $11.26, far off the $32.45 peak they hit in June 2015 just before it won the auction for the P&G brands and below their initial public offering price of $17.50 in 2013.

10;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-04-01T13:56:29Z;JAB poised to take back majority control of Coty;Investment group likely to end up with 60% of cosmetics maker after strong response to tender offer;JAB Holdings, the investment firm that has been on a $50bn-plus deal spree across the consumer sector, looks set to take back majority ownership of problem-plagued cosmetics maker Coty after the response to its tender offer proved very strong.In a statement on Monday, the Luxembourg-based JAB said it would extend the deadline to April 15 for the tender offer for up to 150m shares of Coty at $11.65 per share, so as to allow time to secure regulatory approval in Russia.But given that 282.3m shares have already been offered up for sale, far exceeding the maximum threshold, JAB is likely to finish up owning 60 per cent of Coty. It currently owns a 40 per cent stake.The deal shows how JAB, which also owns Keurig Dr. Pepper and Pret A Manger, is acting decisively to support one of its oldest investments after a particularly difficult stretch.Shares in Coty, whose brands include CoverGirl make-up and Wella hair products, fell by more than 60 per cent in the 12 months before the tender offer was unveiled on February 7. The company botched the integration of the $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands, which closed in late 2016. It has also struggled to keep up with new nimbler brands in make-up, which rely on social media influencers like Kylie Jenner to quickly build a following.To secure board approval for the tender offer, JAB agreed to a standstill agreement that means it cannot buy more than an additional 9 per cent of Coty in the three years after the deal.Coty shares fell 2.3 per cent in early trading on Monday, giving the company a market value of $8.44bn.
11;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-03-18T21:04:20Z;JAB takes a step closer to majority control of Coty  ;Cosmetic company’s independent directors win provisions to protect minority shareholders;"JAB Holdings moved a step closer to taking back majority control of Coty, the problem-plagued cosmetics company, after a special committee of independent directors recommended on Monday that its tender offer be allowed to proceed once a set of measures to protect minority shareholders was agreed. JAB, a Luxembourg-based investment company, is already Coty’s largest shareholder, with a 40 per cent stake, having initially backed the manufacturer of CoverGirl make-up and Wella professional hair products in 1992. In February, it made an offer to buy an additional 150m shares of Coty at $11.65 a share, which would take its stake up to 60 per cent.A special committee of three independent directors was given the task of examining the offer to determine whether it treated all shareholders fairly.The Securities and Exchange Commission filings on the amended tender offer published on Monday provided a glimpse into the negotiations between the special committee and JAB. The committee did initially seek a higher price from JAB but was quickly rebuffed by Olivier Goudet, managing partner.But JAB did eventually agree to a standstill agreement that limits its ability to buy additional shares of Coty for a three-year period after the tender offer; it can buy only 9 per cent more of the company’s shares in that period. It also agreed to raise the minimum threshold for the tender offer to go ahead from 50m shares, which would give it a 47 per cent stake, to 75m shares, which would give it 50 per cent. In a further concession, JAB agreed that, if it wanted to take Coty private in the future, then such a deal would be subject to a full independent review and would need to be approved by a vote of the minority shareholders. JAB also pledged to keep at least four independent directors on the board in the future. There are four independents on the nine-member board now; two more independent directors will be added by September 30. The tender offer will expire on March 29 but could be extended by JAB. Coty’s shares plummeted last year to lose 60 per cent of their value as the company struggled to digest the $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands, which was finalised in October 2016. Coty’s mass-market consumer brands such as CoverGirl have also been losing share as more women choose upstart make-up brands such as the millennial-friendly Glossier and Fenty, which is backed by the singer Rihanna. In November, JAB moved to replace the entire Coty management team in an effort to turn the company round, prompting a partial share recovery. Pierre Laubies, the new chief executive, has promised a new strategic plan over the summer. Coty shares rose 3.4 per cent on Monday to $11.26, which is the closest they have traded to the offer price since the tender was announced. But they are still trading far below their 2013 initial public offering price of $17.50 and far below their peak of $32. That was reached shortly after the P&G deal was announced in mid-2015.For its part, JAB has cast its tender offer as a vote of confidence in one of its oldest investments at a time when some question Coty’s ability to succeed in a fast-changing make-up market."
12;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-02-12T18:41:42Z;Coty/JAB: facelift;A public stock with mismatched horizons among shareholders;A premium offer is not always what it seems. On Tuesday JAB, the huge investment vehicle of the Reimann family, said it would pay as much as $1.7bn to raise its stake in cosmetics group Coty as high as 60 per cent. The price it is paying per share, $11.65, is about 50 per cent more than Coty’s 30-day trading average. That seems robust enough — except that the company’s stock has fallen as much as 80 per cent since its peak in 2015. In 2016, Coty finally closed a $12bn combination with Procter & Gamble’s beauty business that soon went sour. A turnround may finally be afoot. JAB’s big tender offer bet is a sign of an upswing. JAB has been a Coty investor for decades and will probably remain one for decades. Other shareholders without that patience will be smart to take the offer to capture a premium or mitigate existing paper losses.JAB has a deserved reputation as a savvy dealmaker across consumer industries from coffee to sandwiches. But the 2016 stock merger with the P&G beauty business — with assets such as CoverGirl and Max Factor — put the company in a deep hole. Mass-market brands sold through drug stores have given way to upstarts that market through Instagram and sell at speciality shops such as Sephora. In fiscal year 2018, revenue at Coty’s consumer beauty unit — its largest with around 40 per cent of group turnover — dropped 4 per cent. The shortfall can be attributed to the integration of the P&G business, which brought in undermanaged brands and supply chain problems. Coty’s debt to ebitda leverage has spiked to nearly six times, putting its dividend in peril.Leverage can work both ways. Thanks to a new chief executive and promising recent numbers, the stock has rallied. Coty’s share price is an interesting paradox. Obviously, JAB would like it to be high rather than low and performance to be strong rather than weak. However, JAB’s patience as a large long-term owner can create a mismatch with other investors. As such, when JAB is offering liquidity at a premium, it should be hard to pass up. Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers.

13;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-02-12T15:33:53Z;JAB Holdings offers up to $1.75bn to take back control of Coty;Investment group’s move underscores its determination to turn around maker of CoverGirl;"Investment group JAB Holdings has offered to pay up to $1.75bn to take back majority control of Coty, the problem-plagued cosmetics company in which it has been a longtime shareholder.The move by JAB, which has been on a $50bn deal spree in the consumer sector since 2012, is a sign of how determined it is to fix the mess at Coty that has dragged down the value of its portfolio.Coty’s share price plummeted 60 per cent last year as it struggled to digest a $12.5bn acquisition from Procter & Gamble that was engineered by JAB. Revenues have been declining sharply at its largest division, mass-market beauty, prompting JAB to replace management in November. On Friday, Coty wrote down the value of the P&G assets, which include CoverGirl and Max Factor, by nearly $1bn.JAB chairman Peter Harf told the Financial Times that the tender offer was a sign of the faith he and his partner Olivier Goudet have in Coty. The duo, who recently parted ways with Bart Becht, are responsible for investing the wealth of Germany’s Reimann family, as well as billions raised from outside investors in recent years.“We decided to do it because we believe Coty is a good investment and a good company that will prosper long-term,” said Mr Harf in an interview.Given that JAB has decades-long time horizons, it wanted to give shareholders who do not believe that Coty can succeed in its turnround, or who do not want to wait so long, a chance to exit.“It’s very important for our reputation that we turn Coty around as a public company,” said Mr Harf.JAB owns companies in coffee, beverages and casual dining including Keurig Dr Pepper, Pret A Manger and Panera Bread.It has offered to buy up to 150m Coty shares for $11.65, nearly 21 per cent higher than the company’s closing price on Monday. The offer is conditional upon at least 50m shares being tendered, which would take JAB’s stake from 39 per cent to 47 per cent. If it acquires the full amount, JAB would own 60 per cent of the company.JAB said it had sufficient financing to fund the offer, including debt commitments from BNP Paribas, HSBC and UniCredit.The tender offer is subject to conditions, including the approval of the independent directors of the company and their recommendation that shareholders should accept.The bid is the second strong positive jolt to Coty’s shares in recent days. On Friday, it reported earnings ahead of expectations and predicted it would return to profitability in the second half, sending its shares up about 30 per cent.Coty shares surged nearly 18 per cent to $11.35 in pre-market trade on Tuesday. But the stock is still languishing far below the 2013 IPO price of $17.50.Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink called the bid a “peace offering” from JAB to Coty shareholders. “We see the announcement as a clear commitment by JAB, symbolic in that it positions JAB in a controlling role,” she wrote in a note.“We would expect investors who were buying sub-$8 will see this offer as compelling; for investors buying during 2018 where the average share price was $14.20, the offer is more a peace offering to minimise losses on a rolling basis.”"
14;COTY;Coty Inc;2019-02-08T16:22:26Z;Coty takes near $1bn writedown on P&G beauty brands;Shares jump 27% on promise of return to profit in second half of fiscal year;Cosmetics maker Coty acknowledged difficulties in turning around the beauty brands acquired from Procter & Gamble in a blockbuster 2015 deal, and was forced to take a nearly $1bn writedown on the assets.The problems at Coty are a headache for JAB Holdings, the serial dealmaker that invests the wealth of one of Germany’s richest families, the Reimanns. It is one of JAB’s oldest investments, but now needs a major overhaul if its precipitous share price decline is to stop dragging down the value of JAB’s portfolio.The $12.5bn acquisition of P&G’s beauty brands, which included CoverGirl and Clairol, doubled Coty’s size by revenues and was aimed at challenging established beauty leaders such as L’Oreal and Estée Lauder.But integrating the P&G assets has proven challenging and time-consuming, and those challenges have weighed heavily on Coty’s results in recent quarters. In November it announced the abrupt departure of its chief executive Camillo Pane.In the fiscal second quarter, Coty slumped to a loss of $956m, with the bulk of that driven by goodwill writedown on assets acquired from P&G.Pierre Laubies, a food industry veteran who took over as chief executive, is working on a strategy plan to be unveiled in the coming months. But he admitted on an analyst call on Friday that it would take time to get Coty on “a path of sustainable growth” given “the difficult trajectory of our Consumer Beauty division.”CoverGirl’s woes are emblematic of the challenge, and Mr Laubies admitted that last year’s relaunch had not been successful, “There are some issues with how we market the Cover girl brand, and the team is taking stock. The brand deserves better and we’ll work strongly to turn it round.”Still investors appeared to take heart from the company’s promise to return to profit in the second half and sent Coty’s bruised shares sharply higher.The stock, which has shed over two-thirds of their value since mid 2015, jumped more than 27 per cent on Friday to $9 and was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500. However it remains well below its 2013 IPO price of $17.50.The problems at the consumer beauty division were underscored by Coty’s latest earnings. The division suffered a 15 per cent drop in sales during the final three months of last year as brands like Cover girl and Bourjois, which are often sold in supermarkets and grocery stores, lose out to trendier, newer ones marketed on social media and sold in specialist make-up stores like Sephora.Such has been the decline that the unit has now been overtaken by the luxury beauty business as Coty’s biggest by sales.Total group revenue for the quarter came in at $2.5bn, a near 5 per cent year-on-year decline but slightly better than the $2.46bn that the market had expected. Stripping out the $965m in impairments, adjusted earnings of 24 cents also came in ahead of forecasts for 22 cents.Stephanie Wissink, analyst at Jefferies, cautioned that while Coty’s results came in ahead of expectations, that was largely driven by temporary factors, such as the lift provided by its new partnership with Burberry.Instead she said management would need to provide “a pathway to improvement in the consumer beauty division” and “clarity around the recovery curve” if the turnround in sentiment is to hold.
15;COTY;Coty Inc;2018-11-15T04:00:57Z;JAB needs more than cosmetic improvement at Coty;Investment group aims to fix problems from a $12.5bn purchase of P&G brands;A new flagship store in New York’s Times Square is the latest attempt to revive Covergirl, a 60-year-old make-up label that is struggling to compete in a market where social media influencers mint new beauty brands overnight.The success or failure will help determine the future of the cosmetics group that owns Covergirl — Coty — and affect the reputation of its controlling shareholder, JAB Holdings, the voracious group that manages the wealth of Germany’s Reimann family.Led by Bart Becht, the well-respected former chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, JAB has gone on a roughly $50bn deal spree across the consumer sector in the past five years. Its biggest bets are now on the coffee market, where it recently combined Keurig Green Mountain with Dr Pepper Snapple, and in casual dining with Panera Bread Company and Pret A Manger.But it is Coty, a much older deal, which JAB acquired in 1992, that is causing doubts. The group’s shares are down more than 50 per cent this year, below their 2013 IPO price. On Monday, Coty replaced its CEO unexpectedly, naming its fourth boss in five years.Covergirl was just one of a portfolio of 43 beauty products that Coty acquired two years ago from Procter & Gamble for $12.5bn. The performance since has raised questions about JAB’s model of combining companies via often pricey acquisitions and then seeking to improve performance by stripping out cost.The value of JAB’s 39 per cent stake in Coty has fallen by 60 per cent to $2.5bn since the P&G deal closed in October 2016 — a notable decline even given JAB’s decades-long investment horizons.“The shine has come off the JAB story,” said Rosie Edwards, an analyst at Berenberg who covers Coty. “When they bought the P&G brands, investors had faith they would work their magic. Now, no one really thinks JAB has all the answers.”Nobody questions that the scale of the job at Coty is considerable. The company doubled in size with the P&G deal, bringing together 20,000 employees in 41 countries, working across 70 brands, and 16 manufacturing sites. The integration has proven time-consuming and difficult.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Becht hit back against the critique that the P&G deal had gone wrong. “As this is one of the most complex transactions JAB has done, we said from the very beginning this would be a five-year project,” he said.“The integration is largely complete but the business transformation is not,” he said, acknowledging that Coty’s consumer beauty division still needed to be fixed. “But the other two divisions, professional [salons] and luxury, are doing actually very well.”JAB has long cast itself as a better manager and steward of capital than its big consumer packaged goods rivals. But it is now competing in categories such as coffee and make-up, where powerful incumbents such as Coca-Cola and L’Oréal are trying to seize and protect market share.Some of the problems now plaguing Coty stem from the extraordinarily long 15 months it took to close the P&G deal. The deal was structured as a so-called Reverse Morris Trust, which allowed P&G to spin out and sell the assets to Coty without paying capital gains tax. During the transition, the brands were stuck in limbo, and Covergirl, Rimmel and Wella lost market share.“P&G put them in a tough spot by cutting marketing spend and losing shelf space in stores,” said Mark Astrachan, analyst at Stifel. “But Coty bit off more than they can chew in the mass-market: the category has slowed, competition from new, niche brands is intense, and they do not have the marketing knowhow their larger rivals do.”All the blame cannot be laid at P&G’s feet. Critics argue that Coty overpaid for a series of legacy brands that do not really appeal to young people. Growth slowed in the mass market just as Coty was increasing its exposure: its largest division, consumer beauty, which accounts for 45 per cent of sales, had like-for-like revenues decline by 10 per cent in the year ended June 2017, and 4 per cent in the year to June 2018.Coty has also botched three recent integration projects, including a supply hub in the UK and a German warehouse, which were part of changes made to deliver on the promised $750m cost-savings from the P&G deal. The mistakes led to supply chain disruptions that left Coty unable to meet demand for its luxury, professional and consumer products in the US and Europe. It ended up having to pay fines to retailers for not meeting contractual obligations.“The risk is that in its rush to cut costs and reorganise the group, Coty cut too fast, too far and is now paying the penalty,” said Société Générale analyst Mitul Girotra.Coty’s troubles come as the cosmetics business has been in a period of rapid change as consumers increasingly shop online or via speciality stores such as Sephora or Ulta Beauty where buying make-up is more of an experience. New brands like e.l.f or pop star Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty can be built faster than ever with the help of online armies of influencers.“The market has moved on, it’s not about selling mass-market brands better into retail channels like Walgreens or Boots,” said one industry consultant who has worked with cosmetics companies. “It’s more about developing fast make-up like fast fashion.”To that end, cosmetics giants such as L’Oréal and Estee Lauder have eschewed mega-deals such as the one Coty is trying to pull off, and instead have bought small, founder-led brands just as they are starting to show traction.With chief executive Camillo Pane resigning this week, the task of turning round the company will now fall to Coty’s new chief executive Pierre Laubies, a coffee industry veteran chosen by JAB for his expertise at overseeing merger integrations. Mr Laubies has not worked in the beauty business before, however.Shareholders may be hoping that JAB will come to their rescue by buying up shares in Coty. It has been restricted since the P&G deal in the amount of shares it could buy, but those limits expired in October.Asked whether JAB would buy more shares, Mr Becht said: “We have been buying shares regularly in the past two years, so clearly we like the asset. We have been strong supporters of the company and will continue to be.”JAB traces its roots to the German businessman Johann Adam Benckiser, who in 1823 bought a chemicals factory in southwestern Germany. With the help of a chief scientist named Ludwig Reimann, who later married into the family, the Benckiser company grew into a major maker of industrial chemicals. Several generations of the Reimanns ran the business, which eventually made them into one of Germany’s richest families.The last of the Reimanns to be actively involved in the day-to-day running of Benckiser was Albert junior, Ludwig’s great-grandson, who inherited the company in 1952 and pushed it in the direction of consumer goods. He died in 1984, leaving equal stakes to his nine adopted children. In 1997, the family took Benckiser public and two years later engineered a merger with the British consumer goods group, Reckitt and Colman, to form Reckitt Benckiser.Four of the descendants eventually bought out the others, and they remain the owners of most of JAB today. Over time the family handed over JAB to professional managers, who began to turn it into the investment vehicle it is today.Peter Harf, Bart Becht and Olivier Goudet are the trio at the helm. Mr Harf started at Benckiser in 1981, while Becht joined in 1988. Mr Goudet, a former Mars executive, joined in 2012.The managers make suggestions to the family members on possible investments, which they then discuss, with the family having the ultimate say. The trio have also invested some of their own capital into JAB.In recent years, JAB has been ploughing billions into the coffee sector and casual dining chains in the US and Europe. In coffee, it has real ambitions to unseat Nestlé as the market leader, and it wants to play a role in the global consolidation of what is a rapidly growing, yet fragmented sector.At the same time, JAB has also unwound its luxury investments by selling shoemaker Jimmy Choo, clothing brand Belstaff, and Swiss brand Bally, in which it retains a minority stake. It has also steadily been selling down its stake in Reckitt Benckiser to reach 1.64 per cent currently.JAB now sees itself as having three main areas of focus: coffee and beverage, beauty, and casual dining. It disclosed total assets of €23.3bn at the end of June 30 2018.
16;COTY;Coty Inc;2018-11-12T13:44:37Z;Coty replaces chief and names new chairman;Cosmetics group has struggled to integrate $12.5bn acquisition of brands from P&G;Cosmetics and fragrance maker Coty abruptly replaced its chief executive only days after reporting a disastrous quarter in which supply chain disruptions stemming from the integration of a major acquisition knocked sales and profits.Camillo Pane, a Reckitt Benckiser veteran who had been running the company since July 2016, resigned for “family reasons”, Coty said in a statement on Monday. He will be replaced with immediate effect by Pierre Laubies, who was most recently chief executive of Jacobs Douwe Egberts, a coffee company owned by Coty’s largest shareholder JAB Holdings.Coty has become a problem child for JAB Holdings, the Luxembourg-based investment company that manages the wealth of Germany’s reclusive billionaire Reimann family. The value of JAB’s 38.6 per cent stake in Coty fell by €1.3bn in the six months to June 30 — a notable decline even given JAB’s decades long investment horizons.The problems have stemmed largely from Coty’s struggles to integrate the acquisition two years ago of a large portfolio of cosmetics brands from Procter & Gamble for $12.5bn. The deal, which doubled the size of Coty by revenue, was the brain child of JAB chairman Bart Becht, the former chief executive of consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser. He ran the enlarged Coty for almost two years before handing over to Mr Pane.“We are very grateful for Camillo’s many contributions to Coty during his time as CEO,” Mr Becht said in a statement. “His leadership was critically important during Coty’s integration of the P&G speciality beauty business.”The brands lack resonance with millennials. I have questions around the quality of the brand portfolio, and whether Coty can really compete in the new reality of beauty marketFurther boardroom changes will see Mr Becht give up his chairman’s seat to another of JAB’s trio of managing partners, Peter Harf. Mr Becht will remain on the board, however. Coty also said that the board planned to recruit “two new independent board members with deep commercial and financial experience”.Investors have become impatient with Coty’s poor results. After the supply chain problems, Coty declined to give further financial guidance for the year, leading investors to wipe a fifth off the company’s market value.The P&G deal, which gave Coty brands such as Cover Girl make-up, Gucci fragrances and Clairol hair dye, helped catapult the company from the world’s seventh-largest cosmetics group to the third, behind L’Oréal and Estée Lauder.But the acquisition was struck at a time of deep change in the mass-market beauty and personal care industry. Social media and the rise of influencer marketing have made it easier than ever to start new brands and challenge the old stalwarts. It remains to be seen if Coty will have the resources and knowhow to revitalise the 41 brands it took on from P&G, some of which are in structural decline, while ensuring its own brands like Rimmel and nail polish OPI remain relevant.“The brands lack resonance with millennials,” Rosie Edwards, an analyst at Berenberg Research, said in an interview last week. “I have questions around the quality of the brand portfolio, and whether Coty can really compete in the new reality of beauty market.”Responsibility for the turnround will now fall to Mr Laubies, who is a known quantity to the JAB executives from his time at JDE. In its statement and an accompanying biography, Coty talked up Mr Laubies’ skills in overseeing merger integrations, which were honed when he oversaw JDE’s combination with Mondelez’s coffee business. Mr Laubies contributed by “fully realising the associated synergies, reducing the debt and driving strong financial performance”.
17;COTY;Coty Inc;2018-11-07T12:58:48Z;Coty shares slump as supply-chain disruptions hit sales;Problems persist as group struggles to integrate portfolio two years after $12.5bn P&G deal;Cosmetics and fragrance maker Coty lost roughly a fifth of its value on Wednesday after it said that serious supply-chain disruptions at US and European warehouses had hit quarterly revenue and profit.The company, whose largest shareholder is the investment vehicle and prolific dealmaker JAB Holdings, said the issues would continue into the second quarter and their financial impact would be felt all year.The difficulties at the warehouses, which were first flagged in August, were compounded by new problems that cropped up at the luxury business, including packaging shortages and a hurricane in the US that affected a North Carolina factory.The troubles are the latest sign of how Coty is still struggling to digest the acquisition of a large portfolio of beauty brands from Procter & Gamble that closed two years ago. The $12.5bn deal, which included the CoverGirl and Clairol brands, doubled Coty’s size by revenues and was aimed at challenging established beauty leaders such as L’Oreal and Estée Lauder. But integrating the P&G assets has proven challenging and time-consuming, and investors have begun to question when the promised brighter future for Coty will be realised.Even before the weak results for the first quarter of Coty’s 2019 financial year, the shares were down 40 per cent this year, while L’Oréal’s are up 10 per cent and Estée Lauder’s are 8 per cent higher.Coty shares were down 20 per cent at $8.92 in late morning trade on Wednesday.The supply-chain issues were caused by changes intended to make the enlarged company more efficient and deliver on the promised $750m cost savings from the P&G deal.Camillo Pane, chief executive of Coty, admitted that the execution of three projects, including a supply hub in the UK and a German warehouse, had simply been poor. “It’s clear we set very ambitious goals for the transformation plan, and all did not go as expected on these specific projects,” he said.As a result, Coty “was unable to meet demand and created a backlog that will take some time to clear”, he said, referring largely to luxury fragrances and professional hair and nail products.The disruptions meant that like-for-like sales fell 7.7 per cent compared with a year earlier on quarterly revenue of $2.03bn. Coty reported a net loss of $12.1m compared with a loss of $19.7m in the same period last year. Gross margins also contracted 70 basis points to reach 60.2 per cent in the quarter.Without the supply-chain problems, the company said like-for-like sales would have fallen by only 2.5 per cent, and two of its three divisions — luxury and professional — would have actually increased sales.Nevertheless, the consumer division, which is its largest, continues to lose market share despite having relaunched several of its biggest brands this year, including CoverGirl and Max Factor. Organic revenue shrank 14 per cent in the quarter, and even without the supply-chain problems the decline would have been 9 per cent.Rosie Edwards, an analyst at Berenberg, said the “biggest concern” was the return of such weak performance in consumer beauty, which saw organic sales decline 4 per cent in the last financial year. “Further earnings shortfalls have been created in the quarter which continues to raise questions about the outlook for margins and the extent to which synergies will fall though to the bottom line,” she said.Mr Pane said that Coty needed further time to assess whether to revise its annual guidance that predicted operating profit and margin growth.JAB, which has also invested in coffee and casual dining chains such as Pret A Manger, owned 38.6 per cent of Coty as of June 30. In August, it bought an additional 2.6m shares for about $32mn, according to SEC filings.
18;COTY;Coty Inc;2018-10-04T19:32:22Z;Chinese spending fears hit beauty stocks;Estée Lauder and Coty shares slip as analyst warns of cooling spending by tourists;"Estée Lauder and Coty were among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Thursday as an analyst warned Chinese travel spending in the beauty aisle has cooled.Estée Lauder shares fell 5 per cent to $136.22, while Coty shares fell nearly 8 per cent to $11.51 — leading the decline on the S&P 500.The drop came as Stephanie Wissink, an analyst at Jefferies, noted that spending in travel retail’s beauty segment — which accounts for 35 per cent of travel retail purchases — had cooled in the third quarter, while spending on spirits and confectionery had accelerated.Her report was released amid hints that the Chinese government is cracking down on the “daigou” industry, in which a network of Chinese tourists and Chinese nationals living overseas sells on highly sought-after consumer goods purchased abroad at prices lower than in shops in China.Social media images of airport inspections of returning tourists over the past few days triggered a sell-off in Japanese beauty products companies earlier on Thursday.Underscoring the influence of Chinese shoppers on the beauty industry, Ms Wissink noted 70 per cent of dollar growth in the travel retail segment over the past year had been directly linked to the Chinese traveller.But China’s government data showed that beauty retail spending was up only 7.8 per cent in July and August, down from 11.5 per cent in June and 22.7 per cent in March, Ms Winnick pointed out.The news could augur a tougher time for Estée, behind brands like Mac and Too Faced, which has credited part of its success to “strong growth” in the travel segment, including airports.Estée said on its earnings call in August, that it gained share across all categories in travel retail in the 2017 calendar year and became the “top ranked beauty company in Asia/Pacific airports and reinforced our global leadership position in skin care and make-up”.The company added its travel strategy had benefited from higher global passenger traffic and noted that Chinese tourists were important shoppers in this channel. “Their increasing travel helped meet growth across our portfolio,” the company said on its last earnings call.The Jefferies note suggested several reasons for the slowdown in Chinese travel spending.“Currency devaluation has become a concern in recent months,” Ms Winnick noted. China’s onshore renminbi has been hurt this year amid uncertainty about the US-China trade spat, and has declined more than 5 per cent year-to-date.“This has tracked toward a more moderate rate of growth alongside China traveller data to pan-Asian countries also slowing,” Ms Wissink said. “Data from Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Korea points to China passenger traffic growth moderating quite significantly in recent months.” Moreover, this drop hasn’t translated to higher spending in mainland China.Ms Wissink added that in Europe, within the beauty segment, “make-up sales have slowed most precipitously; skin care (self purchases) are still growing, but at a slightly slower rate than 2017”.Before Thursday’s drop, Estée shares were up 13 per cent year-to-date. Coty shares were down more than 36 per cent over the same period."
19;COTY;Coty Inc;2018-08-21T12:03:42Z;Coty sales miss on trucker strike, P&G brand integration;;Beauty group Coty shrank its full-year losses, but narrowly missed analysts’ expectations for quarterly sales as disruption from its 2016 acquisition of brands from Procter & Gamble remained a drag and a trucker strike in Brazil disrupted supplies.A net loss for the year to June of $169m was better than the $422m recorded a year ago, with loss per share improving to $0.23 from $0.66.Sales for the final quarter of the year rose to $2.3bn, but analysts had expected a rise of $2.32bn according to data collated by Reuters. Like-for-like, sales growth in the final quarter was below the full year average, at 0.3 per cent compared to the average of 0.4 per cent. That saw Coty shares slip 6 per cent in pre-market trade.Coty’s luxury business was a standout over the year, while its professional beauty division, which includes brands like OPI and Wella, has delivered solid performance.The consumer beauty division has been a drag since the acquisition of P&G’s beauty brands, however, with integration proving a challenge. While luxury reported a 6 per cent rise in full-year like-for-like sales and professional beauty 1.7 per cent growth, revenues in the consumer beauty business dropped 4 per cent.In the fiscal fourth quarter, growth in both the consumer and professional beauty segments was hit by the Brazilian trucker strike. But “short term supply chain disruptions” caused by consolidating warehouses and other facilities in North America and Europe as part of the P&G integration also played a part in holding back revenues.Chief executive Camillo Pane said Coty had made “good progress” over the year, “although much remains to be done”. The group had delivered its target of modest like-for-like net growth, he said, and improved its adjusted operating margin in the second half of the year.“Transformation after an immensely complex merger takes time,” Mr Pane said. “While we work on the full turnround of the new Coty, we are pleased with the significant progress we have made in under two years and expect the integration to be largely completed by the end of FY19.”Supply chain disruptions are likely to continue, however. The impact would peak in the first quarter of the 2019 financial year, the three months to September, with a smaller impact in the second quarter. Mr Pane said that disruption would have a “significant impact” on both sales and profits. Combined with a programme to cut the number of brands in the Coty stable, that would lead to a “low teens” decline in its first quarter adjusted operating income, he warned.After the first half of the year, Coty should have overcome the disruption, however, and said it would start looking to cut its net debt ratio from 5.27 times adjusted earnings to 4 times by the end of 2020. But to boost revenue growth and operating margins, the company said it would also start a new cost savings programme that would mean restructuring charges of $250m to deliver up to $150m of gross savings over a three-year period. After some of those savings were reinvested, total net savings were expected to be $60m over the next three years.“We view FY19 as an important step in the right direction to achieve our medium term ambitions,” Mr Pane said. “As we complete the final stages of our integration and deliver the associated synergies, we are focused on rejuvenating our core business and amplifying our growth potential.”Coty on Thursday also said chief financial officer Patrice de Talhouët is leaving the company to “pursue other opportunities”. Ayesha Zafar, the company’s senior vice-president and group controller, will serve as interim finance chief and Coty is retaining an executive search firm for Mr de Talhouët’s successor.
20;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Coty shares shine as P&G acquisitions begin to pay off;;Coty’s makeover is speeding up a little as the US cosmetics group upgraded its full-year sales forecast on Thursday after a better-than-expected second quarter.The stock jumped nearly 9 per cent in pre-market trading.The group, which is turning around the beauty brands it bought for $11.6bn from Procter & Gamble in 2016, said it expected “modest” growth in second half net revenues, having previously said these would be flat.Camillo Pane, chief executive, said the integration of the P&G brands, which include Max Factor and CoverGirl make up and Clairol hair care, was complex and would take time but that “we are fixing and improving.”Organic net sales rose by 2.8 per cent in the three months to the end of December which was better than analysts’ expectations of no growth.The acquisitions of Younique, an online cosmetics start-up and Burberry fragrances contributed to net revenues of $2.6bn, which were 15 per cent higher, or 10 per cent at constant currencies.Net income of $109m was more than double the same quarter last year and was 6 per cent higher excluding costs mainly related to the P&G acquisition.The better performance was driven by luxury brands, including Gucci Bloom and Tiffany’s fragrances, contributing to a 29 per cent rise in the unit’s adjusted operating income.There was also improvement in the problematic consumer beauty unit which accounts for almost half - 48 per cent - of group sales, which includes most of the P&G brands. Revenues rose by 10 per cent and adjusted operating income by 19 per cent.But profits fell by 10 per cent in the professional, mainly haircare, division, despite a 14 per cent increase in net revenues.Mr Pane said early signs of the recent launches of CoverGirl and Max Factor were “encouraging.”He said:Fiscal 2018 continues to be a year of stabilization and this is what our results have shown so far. While I am pleased with our performance, there is still much work to be done before we achieve the consistency that we seek as we still need to relaunch many brands, deliver our synergies and continue with our integration of the P&G Beauty business.(Photo: Reuters)
21;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-12-06T15:37:08Z;ECJ rules in favour of Coty over online sales ban;Court says luxury groups can prohibit marketplaces such as Amazon selling their products;Europe’s highest court has ruled that luxury goods makers can ban online sales of their products on Amazon and other online marketplaces to preserve their “aura of luxury”.The European Court of Justice decided on Wednesday that US beauty group Coty did not break competition laws when it prohibited Parfümerie Akzente, one of its authorised German distributors, from selling its products on Amazon.de.Luxury goods have a special exemption to competition rules which allows high-end brands such as Gucci and Dior to limit sales of their products to only those physical stores which maintain their luxury image, so-called selective distribution.The court noted that high-end products rely on both the material aspects and the image to create the “aura of luxury” essential to distinguish their items from other similar goods.Coty welcomed the decision which it said “confirms that the character of luxury brands necessitates and justifies selective distribution, whatever the distribution channel”.Luca Solca, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “This is positive for the luxury goods industry, as it allows brands to control the distribution of their products better and to maintain perceived exclusivity.”However, the case also involved mass-market brands. Coty owns more than 77 mainstream brands, including Chloé, Covergirl, Rimmel and Calvin Klein, half of which it in bought from consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble for $12.bn in 2015.Despite the ruling in favour of Coty, Kai Renchen, chief executive of Parfümerie Akzente described the judgment as “a clear success for us”. He said it meant manufacturers of “so-called luxury products” would only be able to restrict internet sales if “the conditions are necessary and reasonable for preserving the luxury image”.Stephen Kinsella, head of EU competition practice at law firm Sidley Austin, noted that “the court has carefully manoeuvred to confine the ruling so far as possible to luxury goods”.But luxury can be difficult to define and some observers worry the case may embolden more mass-market brands to prevent sales on online marketplaces.Alfonso Lamadrid, of lawyers Garrigues, said he expected more disputes to come before national courts “where outcomes might hinge on the nature of the products at issue and, in the case of luxury, on what luxury really means”.Jakob Kucharczyk, of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said that while the judgment was “not a carte blanche for manufacturers to impose absolute marketplace bans for all goods”, it was likely to cut consumer choice and online competition.“It’s a major setback for small firms across Europe that are trying to develop their online business, while protecting major mass-market brands,” he added.Online marketplaces are “an important sales channel for small and medium-sized retailers” in Europe according to the European Commission’s ecommerce sector inquiry, particularly in Germany and the UK. The same report found that almost one in five retailers reported they were already restricted in how they could use online marketplaces.On Wednesday the commission said it welcomed the ruling, saying it “provides more clarity and legal certainty to market participants that had been facing diverging views on the legality of their distribution practices”.“The judgment will also facilitate a uniform application of competition rules across the EU,” it said. “Specifically, the court confirmed the possibility for the luxury industry to operate certain selective distribution systems without infringing EU competition rules.”Amazon declined to comment.
22;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Luxury brands may block online sales, EU courts rule;;Luxury goods makers may be able to stop retailers from selling their products on Amazon and other online marketplaces, after European judges said that cosmetics group Coty had not broken EU rules by blocking online sales on certain platforms.The European Court of Justice decided on Wednesday that US cosmetics and fragrance group Coty – which has a portfolio of brands such as Calvin Klein, Rimmel and Marc Jacobs – did not break competition laws when it prevented Parfümerie Akzente, one of its authorised German distributors, from selling its products on Amazon.de.The case sets a precedent that could allow other luxury brands to stop their distributors selling their goods on Amazon, eBay and other online marketplaces.Luxury goods have a special exemption to competition rules allowing high-end brands like Gucci and Dior to limit sales of their product to only those stores that maintain their luxury image.Online platforms and some antitrust specialists have expressed concern that this case could extend those bans more widely, beyond the very high-end luxury products. That extension could threaten an important distribution channel for many small and medium sized retailers of mid-range branded products.
23;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-08-22T11:35:52Z;Coty falls after revealing quarterly loss;;Coty offered a mixed batch of quarterly results in the June quarter, revealing a quarterly loss but generating sales that topped Wall Street expectations.The company, whose brands include Cover Girl and Rimmel make-up, said its revenues came in at $2.24bn in the fiscal fourth quarter. That represented a 5 per cent year-on-year increase on a constant current basis when the sales from Procter & Gamble’s beauty division are added into the prior year’s results.However Coty logged a quarterly loss of $304.8m or 41 cents a share as the company ramped up marketing spending and was hit with higher costs related to the acquisition of the P&G business.Adjusting for one-time items, Coty broke even on a per-share basis.The market had forecast sales of $2.16bn and adjusted net income of 9 cents a share.Coty’s shares dropped 3.1 per cent in pre-market trading. They have been under pressure since the end of last year as the integration of the beauty business it acquired from Procter & Gamble last year for $12.5bn proved more complicated than expected.While the move has propelled Coty into the world’s third-largest cosmetics seller, the deal came at a time of fierce competition in the mass beauty and personal care industry. Investors have been concerned about whether Coty would have the resources needed to revitalise the 41 brands it took on from P&G as well as invest in its own brands such as Rimmel.Camillo Pane, chief executive, said:Fiscal 2017 was a transformational year for Coty. We completed the incredibly complex acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, fully reorganised into a product and customer focused organisational structure, successfully reached significant milestones in our integration efforts, and boosted our brand portfolio through the additions of Younique, ghd, and the agreement to acquire the Burberry Beauty license.
24;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-06-12T20:17:43Z;Coty jumps on broker upgrade for cosmetics group;Technology stocks remain under selling pressure for the broader market;Coty, the US cosmetics group, got a swipe of lipstick to gloss its share price on Monday.The company, whose brands include Rimmel, Calvin Klein and Davidoff, was the among the day’s top gainers on the S&P 500. The shares rose as much as 4.9 per cent — its biggest one-day advance in a month — to $19.66 after Société Générale initiated coverage of the stock with a “buy” recommendation.SocGen analyst Chas Manso de Zuniga reckoned Coty could trade at $21 within a year, implying a 12 per cent gain on last Friday’s close. Including SocGen, Coty now has three buy recommendations, nine holds and two sell, according to Bloomberg data.The note from SocGen provided a much-needed boost to Coty, which despite Monday’s gain, has seen its shares shed more than 27 per cent over the past 12 months. This has reflected integration of the beauty business it acquired from Procter & Gamble last year for $12.5bn proving more complicated than expected.While the acquisition has catapulted Coty from the world’s seventh-largest cosmetics group to the third, the deal came at a time of fierce competition in the mass beauty and personal care industry.Investors have expressed concern over whether Coty would have the resources needed to revitalise the 41 brands it assumed from P&G as well as invest in its existing product lines such as Rimmel.In addition to the P&G deal, management also has to contend with the addition of Hypermarcas, the Brazilian beauty business it bought for $1bn and Ghd, a London-based maker of hair straighteners and curlers it acquired last year for $510m.Camillo Pane, Coty’s chief executive, had warned that 2017 would be a transitional year while Bart Becht, the chairman, had blamed the “massive distraction” of integrating the P&G assets for a fall in fiscal first-quarter sales.But in a sign that a turnround could be taking hold, the company reported stronger than expected sales for its fiscal third quarter that ended in March.Revenue for the first three months of the year came in at $2.03bn — up 5 per cent compared with a year earlier and ahead of the $1.94bn the market had forecast thanks to strong demand for high-end perfumes such as Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein.By the close of trading, Coty shares settled to trade 3 per cent higher at $19.30.Elsewhere, investors are betting that Stephen Curry mania would bolster the shares and profits of sportswear Under Armour.The company, which has a partnership with the NBA star to make sneakers, saw its shares jump 5.8 per cent to $23.14 amid hopes that a win on Monday night by Curry’s Golden State Warriors over the Cleveland Cavaliers for the NBA championship title would give a lift to sales.In the broad market, technology stocks remain under selling pressure, extending Friday’s sell-off.The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.5 per cent to 6,175.46 while the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,429.08 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.2 per cent at 21,235.67.
25;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-05-10T17:57:59Z;Coty sales rebound in first sign of turnround;US cosmetics group is banking on reviving brands bought from P&G;Sales growth at Coty bounced back in the quarter to the end of March as the US cosmetics group showed the first signs of a turnround in its recently-acquired raft of Procter & Gamble beauty lines.However, Camillo Pane, chief executive, reiterated that the company was in a “transitional” year as it digested the $11.6bn acquisition, completed in October, that gave Coty brands such as Cover Girl make-up, Gucci fragrances and Clairol hair dye.The P&G beauty acquisition catapulted Coty from the world’s seventh-largest cosmetics group to the third — after L’Oréal and Estée Lauder.Mr Pane said the integration of the P&G business was “making good progress” but warned that performance would fall back in the next quarter, the final one in Coty’s financial year, which ends in June.“Luxury will show an improvement compared to the first half. Professional will continue to have consistent positive performance but consumer beauty will take time,” he said.Revenues in the three months to March 31 of $2.03bn were up 5 per cent on the same quarter last year. This was above analysts’ consensus forecasts of $1.94bn, thanks to strong demand for high-end perfumes such as Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein, in the group’s luxury unit.The shares, which had lost one-third of their value over the past 12 months, leapt nearly 14 per cent.The group reported a net loss of $164.2m after booking $213.5m of restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the quarter. Without these charges, net income of $110.3m was more than double the amount in the same quarter last year.Rosie Edwards, analyst at Berenberg, said: “Whilst growth in the quarter was better than expected, Coty aren’t yet out of the woods,” adding that a turnround of the consumer beauty business would be “critical to future performance of the group”.Coty has said that it would make synergies of $750m from the P&G acquisition at a one-cost of $1.2bn over four years.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningConsumer beauty, comprising mass-market brands Cover Girl and Max Factor, is Coty’s biggest business, accounting for half of group sales. Its underlying revenues fell 6 per cent in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter there would be “some weakening in terms of top line”, Mr Pane said.He added: “Some of the P&G brands we inherited were not nurtured so when you are dealing with big brands that will require repositioning and new launches, that is a significant undertaking that will take time.”The deal with P&G came at a time of fierce competition in the mass beauty and personal care industry, and investors have been concerned about whether Coty would have the resources needed to revitalise the 41 brands it took on from P&G, while investing in its own brands such as Rimmel.Coty’s biggest shareholder is JAB Holding, the investment vehicle of the Reimann family, which holds a 37 per cent stake. The cosmetics business is one of two core businesses for JAB, the other being a coffee empire that includes Keurig Green Mountain and Jacobs Douwe Egberts.JAB recently put Jimmy Choo and Bally shoemakers up for sale, marking a retreat from the luxury goods business to focus on its two main areas of investment.
26;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-04-16T04:00:32Z;All-male boards in the US face investor backlash;LGIM will target directors at companies without any women on their boards;"Britain’s largest asset manager has pledged to start voting against directors at US companies that have failed to appoint a woman to their board, as investors become increasingly frustrated by the continued prevalence of male-dominated boardrooms.Legal & General Investment Management, the London-based fund company that oversees $1tn of assets, has toughened its voting stance after deciding that simply urging US companies to take action on board diversity has not delivered results.LGIM began pushing for better board diversity in the US seven years ago. It will vote against nomination committee chairmen at any company in the S&P 500 index that still has an all-male board from 2017 onwards.Clare Payn, head of corporate governance for North America at the UK fund house, said: “We feel there really should not be any all-male boards at this stage, as investors have been talking about this for so many years.”According to S&P Dow Jones, the index provider, four S&P 500 companies still have an all-male board: Coty, the beauty products manufacturer; Dentsply Sirona, the dental equipment company; PayChex, a provider of human resources services; and TransDigm Group, the manufacturer of parts for commercial and military aircraft.Another 177 companies in the S&P 1500 index, and 18 companies in the MSCI USA index of America’s 622 biggest businesses, have no female directors. Join us on April 19 for a conversation about women in the corporate worldLGIM’s stance goes further than most of its competitors. Several of the world’s largest fund companies, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity and Aberdeen, are pressing for greater gender diversity on boards, but have not committed to voting against directors at companies with all-male boardrooms.Helena Morrissey, a leading campaigner for gender equality in the workplace, urged other investors to harden their approach to the remaining companies lacking female directors.Ms Morrissey, who will become head of personal investing at LGIM next month after leaving Newton, the investment boutique, earlier this year, said she felt “exasperated” by the lack of progress on board diversity in the US.She said: “If a company doesn’t change [its board structure], then [investors] ultimately should vote against at least the chair of the nomination committee. It is bizarre that you would not [apply a tougher voting policy]. It is a failure.”A spokesperson for PayChex said a female director had recently resigned, and that a “search is actively under way for her successor”, while Coty said it planned to add a woman to its board before July. A spokesperson for Dentsply Sirona said: “We see [diversity] as a priority in future board member selection.” TransDigm did not respond to requests for comment.Investors are concerned about the lack of female directors in many of the world’s largest economies. Numerous academic studies have suggested companies with diverse boardrooms perform better, are less prone to scandal, and avoid groupthink.Women account for 20 per cent of directorships in the US, compared with 25 per cent in the UK and Australia, and more than 35 per cent in France and Norway, according to figures from MSCI, the data provider.Last week Hermes EOS, an influential adviser to large investors, urged Rio Tinto shareholders to vote against the re-election of the Anglo-Australian mining company’s chairman at its annual general meeting because of slow progress in improving the diversity of its board.LGIM decided to vote against all-male boards at Britain’s largest companies in 2015, and extended that policy to include FTSE 250 companies last year. Aviva Investors, the London-headquartered asset manager, also decided to vote against all-male boardrooms in the UK in 2014.Since these voting positions were adopted, a number of UK-listed companies, including Glencore, the mining company, Jimmy Choo, the luxury shoemaker, and JD Sports, the retailer, have appointed female board members.Abigail Herron, head of responsible investment at Aviva Investors, said the fund house plans to extend its UK voting policy to companies with all-male boards in North America, Europe and Japan.She said: “Having a voting policy against all-male boards is a very useful tool. It is such a powerful way to drive change.”Ms Payn added: “Of course it would be helpful if other [investors] took a tougher stance on all-male boards. I will not sit here and tell them how they should vote, but if we collectively came together, that would push companies even further.”ConvaTec, the UK provider of healthcare products that floated last October, is the only company in the FTSE 100 without a female board member.The number of companies in the FTSE 250 without a woman on their board has more than halved since 2015, to nine. The remaining companies with all-male boardrooms include Euromoney Institutional Investor, the financial publishing business; MetroBank, the challenger bank; and Centamin, the gold miner. "
27;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-04-03T15:00:19Z;Burberry licenses make-up and fragrances to Coty;US group to pay £130m for global rights and £50m for assets as fashion house ends in-house experiment;Burberry has thrown in the towel on a four-year experiment to develop its fragrance and beauty business in-house, by franchising the operations to Coty — the fast-expanding US cosmetics group.Coty is to pay £130m for the global licence and a one-off £50m for the assets. The unit has annual revenues of £203m, of which 92 per cent is from fragrances.Burberry is the first big franchise win for Coty since it acquired the licence to make Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrances as part of its $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business, which completed last year.That acquisition has made it the world’s third-largest cosmetics group by sales, after France’s L’Oréal and Estée Lauder of the US.Burberry’s decision was welcomed by analysts as freeing it to focus on improving returns from its retail operations, after a year of upheaval.Helen Brand, analyst at UBS, said: “We see this deal as an incremental positive for the stock as the beauty division has been underperforming and was likely a drag on management time.”Rogerio Fujimori, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Burberry had recognised “the challenges to develop the business internally in a highly competitive category and against much bigger competitors like Chanel or Dior”.Burberry paid £144m to take back the licence to its fragrance business in 2013, but as Ms Brand noted: “A licence income of £25m-£30m previously has fallen to less than £10m of earnings before interest and tax today, as there was more ‘clean-up’ required than hoped.”For Coty, the Burberry deal goes some way to compensate for missing out on the licence for Dolce & Gabbana fragrances, which went from P&G to Japan’s Shiseido.It also lessens Coty’s dependence on celebrity fragrances. Camillo Pane has emphasised expansion into luxury brands since becoming chief executive last October.Mr Pane said: “Celebrity fragrances remains part of the market and our portfolio. Our growth strategy, however, is more focused on the prestige fragrance market and Burberry will be a great addition.”Burberry tried to relaunch its make-up division this year with a major campaign headed by model Iris Law, daughter of actors Jude Law and Sadie Frost. The British fashion house said it expected sales of make-up to rise to 15 per cent of beauty revenues from 8 per cent currently.John Smith, who stepped down in January as Burberry’s chief operating officer but remains an executive director, said the new licence was “unusual” as it gave Burberry creative control over everything customer-facing, including imagery, point of sale marketing and the faces of its beauty advertising campaigns.As part of the rebranding of its beauty business, Burberry cut the number of points of sale from 3,500 when it took over the licensing agreement in 2013, to just 35.Luca Solca, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “We welcome the choice of a first-class partner to develop the Burberry beauty business — we never liked the idea of Burberry managing its beauty business directly, as beauty is an FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] business where you win on the back of global reach.”
28;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-02-09T21:33:47Z;Coty slides on pessimism over declining sales;US stocks rally as all three big benchmark indices hit record highs;Investors soured on Coty shares after the US cosmetics group’s latest results showed that it is struggling to stem the tide of declining sales in its own portfolio and its newly acquired stable of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands.Coty shares slid 8.6 per cent to $18.32 after the owner of Covergirl reported a 7 per cent drop in revenues for its fiscal second quarter.The result is the first to include the sales of Clairol and 42 other beauty brands that Coty acquired from P&G for $12.5bn and the weak performance is expected to raise questions over the timing of the deal, given the competition in the mass beauty and personal care industry.“The business was impacted by significantly higher than anticipated inventory levels in the market on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division and the distraction associated with the merger integration efforts,” said chief executive Camillo Pane.Revenue for the combined businesses fell to $2.29bn for the three months to end of December, below expectations of $2.36bn as the strong dollar exacerbated the sales drop in its luxury and consumer beauty divisions.Coty had a particularly rough quarter in the US, where weak demand dragged revenues in North America 12 per cent lower.7%Drop in revenues for the fiscal second quarter at CotyOverall net income tumbled to $46.8m from $89m “reflecting lower operating income and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower tax expense”.Stripping this out, adjusted net income rose 45 per cent to $223.3m — albeit still be low forecasts for $245.3m.The sell-off in Coty shares came alongside a rally in US stocks that saw all three major benchmark indices hit record highs.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.6 per cent to 2,307.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 20,172.4 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 5,715.2.Teradata was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the big-data software maker said it swung to a profit in the fourth quarter and issued an upbeat sales outlook for the current quarter.The Atlanta-based company posted profits of $58m, or 44 cents a share, in the three months ended in December, compared with a loss of $49m, or 37 cents, in the year ago quarter.$58mTeradata profits in the three months to end-DecemberAdjusting for one-time items earnings of 67 cents a share, topped estimates. However, sales slid more than expected to $626m, impacted by the 2016 sale of its Marketing Applications business.For the fiscal first quarter, the company projected sales of $500m that beat Wall Street expectations of $485.4m.Teradata’s shares rose 8.5 per cent to $32.74.Meanwhile, data and analytics company Dun & Bradstreet was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, tumbling 16.8 per cent to $101.88 after posting weaker than expected fourth-quarter profits and downbeat guidance.The New Jersey-based company reported adjusted earnings of $2.99 a share that missed Wall Street projections of $3.03. Sales climbed 4 per cent to $517.1m and were ahead of projections for $513.4m.The company also said that it expects earnings per shares to decline in a range of 4 to 9 per cent year on year in fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased interest expense, citing the impact of a possible two to three rate rises by the Federal Reserve.The company also said it expected organic revenue growth in a range of 1 to 3 per cent. This was weaker than the mid-single digit growth that some analysts were looking for.
29;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-02-09T14:18:41Z;Coty drops as P&G deal weighs on sales growth;;Bad decision? Bad timing? Either way, investors are not reacting kindly to Coty’s latest earnings results, which show the US cosmetics group struggling to stem the tide of declining sales in both its own portfolio and its newly acquired stable of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands.Shares in Coty fell more than 5 per cent in pre-market trading after the owner of Covergirl reported a 7 per cent drop in revenues for its fiscal second quarter.The result is the first to include the sales of Clairol and 42 other beauty brands that Coty acquired from P&G for $12.5bn and the weak performance is expected to raise questions over the timing and wisdom of the deal given the fierce competition in the mass beauty and personal care industry.“Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter,” said chief executive Camillo Pane.“The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division and the distraction associated with the merger integration efforts.”Revenue for the combined businesses fell to $2.29bn for the three months to end of December, below expectations of $2.36bn as the strong dollar exacerbated the sharp sales drop in its luxury and consumer beauty divisions.Coty had a particularly rough quarter in the US, where weak demand for consumer beauty products dragged revenues in North America 12 per cent lower.“There are some changing dynamics in cosmetics where consumers look at brands and products and trends, and want innovation more frequently, so we need to adjust the positioning of some of our brands, [we'll be] changing the innovation process in colour cosmetics to be faster to market,” Mr Pane said, adding that pushing the company’s ecommerce strategy of of key importance as well.Overall net income tumbled to $46.8m from $89m “reflecting lower operating income and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower tax expense.” Stripping this out, adjusted net income rose 45 per cent to $223.3m – albeit still low for forecasts of $245.3m.Last quarter Bart Becht, Coty chairman, blamed the “massive distraction” of integrating the P&G assets for a fall in Coty’s first quarter sales.On Thursday the company said it remained on track to complete its P&G beauty business integration, with a $750m synergy target by 2020 and said it expects the revenue decline to slow down for the second half of fiscal 2017.“It’s a transitional year and we were somewhat expecting these results,” Mr Pane said. “We need to remind ourselves that this is not an integration but a new organisation, and we believe the new company will be much stronger than the previous organisation, one with larger scale . . . with better people, and can attract stronger people.”
30;COTY;Coty Inc;2017-01-10T17:48:25Z;Coty buys $600m stake in online cosmetic retailer Younique;;Coty, the US cosmetics group, has begun the New Year with its appetite for acquisitions undiminished. It announced on Tuesday that it would pay $600m for a controlling stake in Younique, a four-year old start-up.Younique’s sibling founders, Derek Maxfield and Melanie Huscroft, will retain a 40 per cent stake in the online cosmetics retailer, which they will continue to run as a separate business within Coty’s consumer beauty division, reports Scheherazade Daneshkhu in London.Coty is to pay $600m cash for a 60 per cent stake, funded through a mix of cash on hand and debt.Younique, which had net revenues of $400m last year and is profitable, sells cosmetics online, mainly on mobile devices, and said it had 4.1m consumers in 10 countries.It is also an online version of Avon, the door-to-door retailer, having recruited 200,000 online staff who earn commission on sales.The acquisition follows that of London-based Ghd, the haircare business, Coty bought for $510m in October.Coty has spent more than $15bn on beauty assets – reducing its dependency on fragrances – since July 2015 when it acquired Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands for $12.5bn.Bart Becht, Coty chairman, in November blamed the “massive distraction” of integrating the P&G assets for a fall in Coty’s first quarter sales.He said he expected “similar revenue trends” for the following quarter. Coty’s shares have lost 20 per cent of their value over the past 12 months.Nevertheless, Coty’s acquisitions have doubled the size of the business and put the New York group on course to challenge L’Oreal, the industry leader, which is three times bigger than Coty in annual revenue terms.The French group also hit the acquisition trail on Tuesday by spending $1.3bn on three Canadian skincare brands, while Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group has also been buying up high-end personal care brands, as it seeks to reduce its dependence on its slow-growth food business.Mr Becht is also chairman of JAB Holding, the group privately-held by Germany’s billionaire Reimann dynasty, which is Coty’s controlling shareholder.JAB has also been spending lavishly on building a coffee empire to rival Nestle, with acquisitions that include Keurig Green Mountain, Peet’s Coffee & Tea and Caribou Coffee.
31;COTY;Coty Inc;2016-11-09T19:13:26Z;Coty suffers record drop on weak sales outlook;;Coty is going to need a lot of lipsticks to dress up its fiscal first quarter results.Shares in the US cosmetics group dropped by the most on record on Wednesday after it delivered a surprise slide in sales and warned that the weak trend is expected to continue into the current quarter.For the September quarter, sales fell 3 per cent to $1.08bn, confounding Wall Street expectations for a modest increase to $1.135bn, from the $1.11bn recorded in the year ago period.That was led by a 10 per cent decline in sales in its two biggest division – fragrances and colour cosmetics. The company blamed the drop on “distractions” from the time and energy it spent closing the $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty brands.Bart Becht, Coty’s chairman, said:As discussed prior to the closing, the resources which normally work on the business, have also been working on closing the transaction, and setting up and preparing for the future of the combined company. The resulting distraction as well as the recent change in management teams in our headquarters, regions and countries, have contributed to a decline in Coty stand-alone revenues and profits in Q1.The company said it expected “similar revenue trends” for the current quarter, although this should improve in the second half of the year.Coty shares fell by as much as 15.6 per cent before bouncing back to trade 9.3 per cent lower at $19.84. The drop still makes it the stock’s biggest one day decline since the company went public in June 2013.Coty broke even during the quarter, compared with a profit of $125.7m or 34 cents a share in the year ago period, when earnings were bolstered by a one off $113.3m favourable tax settlement. Earnings during the quarter were also held back by a $24.4m jump in net interest expenses.Adjusting for one-time items the company posted earnings of 23 cents a share, shy of analysts’ estimates for 33 cents. Coty, which was only added to the S&P 500 last month, has seen its shares down 24 per cent so far this year.
32;COTY;Coty Inc;2016-10-17T21:47:42Z;Coty snaps up Ghd for $510m;UK acquisition comes on top of at least $14bn that the US group has spent since June last year;US group Coty continued its spending spree on Monday, this time snapping up London-based Ghd, which makes hair straighteners and curlers, for $510m.The acquisition comes on top of at least $14bn that the US cosmetics and fragrances group has spent since June last year, in deals that have put it on a trajectory to challenge France’s L’Oréal in the global beauty industry.Coty, whose brands include Rimmel, Calvin Klein and Davidoff, last year bought Procter & Gamble’s beauty assets in a $12.5bn transaction. It spent another $1bn on Hypermarcas, the Brazilian beauty business, as it sought to bolster its overseas presence.Ghd — Good Hair Day — is being bought from Lion Capital, the private equity group, with a mixture of cash and debt, Coty said. It sells hair dryers and other electrical hair tools, including straighteners and curling tongs.Camillo Pane, chief executive of Coty, said the acquisition would “strengthen our professional haircare business through the addition of innovative market-leading brands”.Mr Pane, who became chief executive this month after the completion of the P&G deal, joined Coty last year from Reckitt Benckiser, the Dettol-to-Durex consumer goods group, which used to be headed by Bart Becht, now chairman of Coty.Ghd generated £178m in revenues last year and has operations in Australia, the US, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Its chief executive Anthony Davey, will continue to run the business as a standalone operation within Coty’s professional beauty division.The sale gives Lion Capital an exit from Ghd, which it bought three years ago from rival Montagu Private Equity for £300m. Lyndon Lea, partner at Lion Capital, said Ghd had increased its sales by 30 per cent over the past three years.Coty’s acquisition spree has more than doubled its annual revenues to $9bn, making it the world’s biggest seller of fragrances and the third-largest company in colour cosmetics.The dealmaking has been regarded favourably by investors. Coty’s shares have risen 34 per cent since 2013, when it raised $1bn in its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. It now has a market value of $17bn.JAB Holding, the group privately held by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, is the controlling shareholder in Coty.L’Oréal, the world’s biggest cosmetics group, is almost three times bigger in terms of sales with annual revenues of €25bn and a market value of €93bn.
33;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US cosmetics group Coty to join S&P 500;;Coty shares popped in extended trading after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would replace Diamond Offshore Drilling on the S&P 500.Shares in the US cosmetics group climbed as much as 5 per cent in extended trading after the index provider said Coty would join the S&P 500 after the close of trading on Friday.Meanwhile, Diamond Offshore Drilling will join the S&P MidCap 400, replacing Polycom, which was acquired by Siris Capital on Tuesday.The offshore rig operator has seen its shares fall more than 67 per cent since crude prices began their protracted slump in mid-2014. The company, which now has a market valuation of $2.2bn, saw its shares slide 0.7 per cent in extended trading.“Diamond Offshore Drilling is ranked at the bottom of the S&P 500 and has a market capitalization more representative of the mid-cap market space,” S&P Dow Jones Indices, said.
34;COTY;Coty Inc;2016-05-03T17:00:43Z;Coty upbeat on cost savings from P&G beauty deal;Bart Becht predicts group will generate industry-leading margins;Coty, the US cosmetics group with ambitions to expand rapidly, has sharply increased its estimate of cost savings from the beauty assets acquired from Procter & Gamble last year in a transaction valued at $12.5bn.However, acquisition-related costs of $37m contributed to a net loss of $26.8m in the three months to March 31, compared with net income of $75.5m in the same quarter last year.Coty shares, which have outperformed the S&P 500 this year, were down more than 5 per cent by lunchtime in New York, after earnings per share missed analysts’ expectations.The group, whose brands include Rimmel, Calvin Klein and Davidoff, said on Tuesday it expected to make $780m of cost savings annually from the P&G brands — at a one-off cost of $1.2bn.The savings, to be made over the next four years, equate to 16 per cent of revenues acquired from P&G, up from Coty’s previous estimate of $550m of savings at the time of the deal last July.The P&G deal will double Coty’s annual revenues to more than $9bn, making it the world’s biggest seller of fragrances and the third-largest company in colour cosmetics. Brands such as Wella will also give it a sizeable presence in the haircare market.Bart Becht, chairman and acting chief executive, said the savings would boost Coty’s operating profit margins by 6 percentage points, making it “industry leader from an operating margin point of view with margins of approximately 18 per cent”.Mr Becht, who acquired a formidable reputation in his previous job in transforming Reckitt Benckiser into one of the world’s best-performing consumer products groups, emphasised the management challenge in what he described as “the highly complex transaction”.“You are buying a carve-out, so you get a piece of the staffing, not the whole staffing. On top of that, P&G is run differently from Coty — they have more central services, for example,” he said. “Making sure we have the right people on board and that they are clear about what needs to be done, is going to be key to success.”He said there was “no timetable” for finding a full-time chief executive until “we are much more comfortable that the P&G integration is on the right track”.Mr Becht was charged with steering the integration process last year, a decision that led to Coty paying a $1.8m severance package to Elio Leoni Sceti, a former Reckitt colleague of Mr Becht, who had been anointed chief executive before the P&G deal was struck.Mr Becht is also chairman of JAB, the Reimann family holding company which is the controlling shareholder in Coty. JAB aims to forge a parallel empire to cosmetics in coffee through acquisitions, such as last year’s $13.9bn purchase of Keurig Green Mountain.Net sales rose 1.8 per cent to $950.7m. Sales of fragrances, Coty’s biggest business by revenue, fell 4 per cent — the seventh consecutive quarterly fall — while sales of colour cosmetics rose 11 per cent.In February, the group closed a deal to buy Hypermarcas, the Brazilian beauty business, for $1bn as it continued to boost its overseas presence.Hypermarcas had $14.3m in sales during the quarter, but reported an operating loss of $6.6m, due to charges relating to its integration.Coty’s expansion comes at a challenging time for the global cosmetics industry, especially in the US, as consumers increasingly choose to buy online rather than from the department stores that have been the backbone of distribution.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said: “While organic growth trends remain lacklustre, company has and should continue to aggressively use its balance sheet to transform its business into one of three clear, pure-play leaders in the global beauty industry.”
35;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
36;COTY;Coty Inc;2015-07-09T17:06:57Z;Procter & Gamble sells beauty arm to Coty in complex deal;Tax driven arrangement valued at $12.5bn or more delivers one-time gain of $5bn-$7bn;Procter & Gamble has agreed to spin off Clairol and 42 other beauty brands to Coty in a complicated $12.5bn-plus deal that largely completes the divestitures promised by the world’s largest consumer goods company as it narrows its focus on its biggest businesses.P&G has proposed to execute the split off — which includes the sale of its salon professional and retail hair care and colour, cosmetics and fragrances businesses — via a so-called Reverse Morris Trust transaction.This enables P&G to minimise tax and will result in a one-time gain of $5bn-$7bn, depending on the deal’s value when it closes. P&G shareholders will exchange some or all of their current holdings for 52 per cent of the company created by the deal, with Coty shareholders owning 48 per cent.P&G also announced that it would return $70bn to shareholders over the next four years in addition to its existing buyback programme.P&G has sold billions of dollars of brands it considers non-core in an attempt to raise its competitiveness and improve shareholder returns after years of struggling sales growth since the global financial crisis.AG Lafley returned for a second run as P&G’s chief executive in 2013, and has sought to focus the group on 10 categories and 65 brands. Jon Moeller, chief financial officer, said P&G had shed 60 per cent of its brands during the process but retained 85 per cent of its $83bn revenues and 95 per cent of pre-tax profit.“This [deal] represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio . . . that best leverage P&G’s core competencies,” Mr Lafley said in a statement.Coty already owns brands including Rimmel and Philosophy, but the deal will double its annual revenues to more than $10bn, making it a “global leader” in fragrances, improving its share of the cosmetics market and expanding its footprint in countries including Brazil and Japan, Coty said. P&G’s beauty business generated $5.9bn in revenues last year.Coty expects the deal to realise cost cuts of $550m and add to earnings once it closes in the second half of 2016.Procter & Gamble shareholders have a decision to makeContinue reading“We have the opportunity to create a highly focused, pure-play leader and challenger in beauty,” said Bart Becht, chairman and chief executive of Coty, in a statement.The deal, which is still subject to regulatory clearances and works council consultations, values the 43 brands that are to be merged with Coty at about $12.5bn excluding debt.The new company will assume between $1.9bn and $3.9bn in debt, depending on how Coty’s shares move before the deal closes, within a range of $22.06 to $27.06 per share. The higher Coty’s share price moves within that range, the less debt the new entity will assume.Coty’s shares, which had jumped in June on the prospect of the deal, traded down 4.7 per cent on the news, and stood at $30.03 by close of trading. P&G’s shares fell 0.4 per cent at $80.66.P&G shareholders will be invited to swap none, some or all of their P&G shares for those of the new entity.International companies and billionaires have made a series of acquisitions in the consolidating consumer sector in the world’s largest economy, with Brazil’s 3G and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year taking control of Kraft via Heinz.The P&G deal comes just weeks after Coty said it had decided to keep Mr Becht on as chief executive, paying his supposed successor Elio Leoni Sceti $1.8m in severance even before he had started in the job for which he had been recruited.Mr Becht earlier led Reckitt Benckiser, the UK consumer group whose biggest investor is the JAB investment vehicle of Germany’s wealthy Reimann family.JAB Cosmetics — which owns all of Coty’s Class B common stock, representing about 97 per cent of the votes — has approved the transaction and agreed to convert its shares into Class A common stock. This will leave JAB owning about 33 per cent of the new entity.A number of other deals have deployed the tax saving Reverse Morris Trust structure, including Dow Chemical’s sale of part of its chlorine business to Olin. P&G used the structure when it sold its Folgers coffee business in 2008.Now that most of P&G’s divestitures have been agreed, investors’ focus will shift to how long Mr Lafley remains at the helm. Speculation has grown that the leading internal candidate to succeed him is David Taylor, who oversees the global beauty, grooming and healthcare business which accounted for more than 40 per cent of annual sales, including the business split off announced on Thursday.
37;COTY;Coty Inc;2015-06-23T23:03:12Z;Coty reverses CEO decision amid deal talk;Severance package of $1.8m paid to Elio Leoni Sceti after move to keep Becht in role;US beauty firm Coty will pay Elio Leoni Sceti, who was due to start as its chief executive next week, a $1.8m severance package following the board decision to keep Bart Becht on as interim chief executive, amid deal speculation.Mr Sceti’s, whose appointment was announced two months ago, was the chief executive of EMI’s recorded music division for 18 months until 2010 when he left there by mutual agreement.The decision to part ways with Coty was revealed in an SEC filing on Tuesday. In a separate press release, Coty said it had decided to stick with Mr Becht — its long standing chairman and former head of UK consumer group Reckitt Benckiser — on the basis that “leadership continuity is critical in ensuring the continued success of [its] strategy implementation”.The company, whose branded perfumes include Calvin Klein and Davidoff, said: “We certainly understand his decision not to join Coty as planned, thank him for his professionalism throughout this process and we wish him all the best in his future endeavour.”Analysts said the unexpected decision might have been related to speculation Coty is close to sealing a deal to buy $12bn worth of beauty assets from Procter & Gamble.“It would be a transformational acquisition, doubling the size of the company overnight,” said Jason Gere, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “It would be a huge undertaking with huge integration challenges. Becht would be the right person to lead the charge.”Linda Bolton Weiser, an analyst at B. Riley, said that the severance payment suggested it was Coty’s decision to part ways. Ms Weiser offered a “few theories” on the possible reasons for the reversal of the appointment.These scenarios included that a possible deal with P&G deal may be larger than anticipated and required Mr Becht’s expertise, or that Mr Sceti would not support the potential purchase of three of P&G’s beauty businesses.Describing Mr Becht as “a proven superstar CEO”, Ms Weiser said if the 58-year-old Dutchman decided to make his role permanent, it would provide a big fillip for Coty.The view was echoed by Mark S. Astrachan at Stifel, who called Mr. Becht’s experience running large consumer products companies and implementing M&A strategies “a unique asset.”Coty did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The beauty company’s shares closed up 1.2 per cent at $31.80.
38;COTY;Coty Inc;2015-06-16T18:39:10Z;Coty’s Bart Becht demonstrates deft touch;Investors hope former Reckitt Benckiser chief will repeat success at cosmetics group;A pattern seems to be developing around Bart Becht and sudden share price movements.On Tuesday, $500m was added to the value of Coty, the cosmetics company of which he is chairman and acting chief executive.When Mr Becht announced his departure from his last job in 2011, an ego-boosting £2bn was wiped off the company’s shares in one day.Investors in that company — Reckitt Benckiser — were reluctant to see him go after 11 years because the Dutchman had presided over a fivefold increase in the market value of the maker of Finish dishwasher tablets and Durex condoms.Then he had transformed RB into a consumer goods powerhouse and now Coty investors hope he will pull off a similar trick in the world of beauty.Mr Becht has a reputation as a tough, results-driven businessman with a demanding style.After receiving a £92m pay packet for his pains from RB, Mr Becht’s interests broadened from condoms to coffee and cosmetics.The common link between the three is JAB Holdings, an affiliate of Joh A Benckiser Group, the private equity and family holding company of the billionaire Reimann family.It has investments in RB, Coty and DE Masterblenders, the maker of Senseo and Douwe Egberts coffee brands that is chaired by Mr Becht.The 58-year-old is Coty’s acting chief executive, pending the arrival next month of Elio Leoni Sceti, until recently chief executive of Iglo, the frozen foods group.Mr Sceti is a former RB colleague who is also a director at Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer which has a results-driven management style frequently compared to that of RB.Since Mr Becht’s arrival at Coty and DE Masterblenders within the past three years, he has overseen big changes at both companies.Coty floated on the New York Stock Exchange two years ago and Mr Becht now appears ready to step up its transformation if the bid for P&G’s assets succeeds.In coffee, he is challenging Nestlé’s dominant position through the recent merger of DE Masterblenders with the coffee business of Mondelez to form a new group named Jacobs Douwe Egberts.

The addition of P&G brands such as Olay, Christina Aguilera Perfumes and Wella would transform the group, which failed to acquire Avon Products three years ago for $14bn, into a major beauty company.Details of the deal’s structure were not immediately clear and one person involved in the negotiations cautioned that although Coty had offered the highest bid it was not guaranteed it would win all the assets.“It’s not done until it’s completely done,” this person said.Coty has secured financing from a number of banks including JPMorgan Chase, according to another person.The transaction also represents an important step forward for P&G as the world’s biggest consumer goods company seeks, under chief executive AG Lafley, to refocus on a smaller number of brands after its portfolio became unwieldy, dragging down its total revenues.Several companies took part in what has been an extremely competitive auction, according to a number of bankers.A deal with Coty would be a setback for Henkel. The German consumer goods group had been seen as a frontrunner for P&G’s haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands and has been valued at up to $7bn by people involved in the negotiations.According to Bloomberg, Henkel pulled out of the race after it was told that its offer was no longer being considered.Clayton Dubilier & Rice, a buyout group that controls several consumer product companies, and Warburg Pincus, a private equity group with a large healthcare and consumer goods portfolio, were also competing for some of the P&G assets.P&G and Coty could not be reached for comment.The New York Post first reported that Coty had won the auction to acquire control of the P&G assets using a tax-efficient “Reverse Morris Trust” structure in which P&G would spin the operations off, giving its own shareholders a majority stake in the new entity.A Reverse Morris Trust transaction is named after a 1966 case that decided the tax law on spin-offs. A deal is tax-free so long as shareholders of the selling company end up with more than 50 per cent of the separated business.
40;COTY;Coty Inc;2014-10-07T20:58:08Z;Coty eyes Chanel’s Bourjois;Chanel to take 16% stake in US beauty group as part of offer;Coty, whose brands include Rimmel, Calvin Klein and Davidoff, has made a binding offer to Chanel for its cosmetics brand Bourjois, in an all-share deal that would extend the US beauty company’s international expansion efforts.Chanel has been offered 15m Coty shares, worth around $240m, for the ‘masstige’ colour cosmetics group, which is sold in 50 countries. ‘Masstige’, a portmanteau of ‘mass’ and ‘prestige’, is a term used to describe an increasingly critical sector of the luxury industry that offers premium products at accessible price points to mid-market consumers.Coty and rivals L’Oréal and Estee Lauder have been scrambling to consolidate their foothold within the space to capitalise on the squeezed middle in mature markets trading down from higher-end brands, while emerging markets spawn a booming middle class keen to make entry level luxury purchases.“We intend to examine the offer in more detail and enter constructive talks with Coty,” said Chanel. The privately held French luxury group would own approximately 14 per cent of Coty’s Class A shares, or 4 per cent of Coty’s total equity, which would give it a voting stake of less than 1 per cent.The bid is the latest move by Coty to rebalance its portfolio and product mix to better capitalise on growth opportunities within the global beauty market. Its attempts to date have met with mixed success.After it failed to buy door-to-door cosmetics seller Avon in 2012 for more than $10bn, the company launched an initial public offering to build a war chest for acquisitions and international expansion. But the $1bn IPO in June last year has failed to excite investors. Coty shares traded at $16.22 on Tuesday, down from the $17.50 IPO offer price.“This offer for Bourjois is no surprise. Like Elizabeth Arden, Coty is a company that has a great deal of exposure to the weaker product lines and distribution channels of the beauty market, including personality-driven cosmetics and struggling US retailers like Walmart and Target,” said Rahul Sharma, an analyst at Neev Capital.“Shareholders are acutely aware of these shortcomings. The focus now will be boosting its prime beauty brands portfolio, avoiding duplication and streamlining retail operations across markets.”The spending power of a booming middle class in emerging markets continues to hold allure for Coty, despite headaches involved with its $400m acquisition of a stake in Chinese skincare brand TJoy in 2010. In February Coty and Avon unveiled a plan to sell Coty fragrances through Avon’s sales representatives in Brazil.Bart Becht, Coty chairman and interim chief executive, said the acquisition of Bourjois would help the company reach new consumers in western Europe, where it is one of the market leaders, as well as the Middle East and Asia.“We are looking forward to having the Bourjois brand as part of our portfolio of leading beauty products, as well as welcoming Chanel as a Coty shareholder,” Mr Becht said.Mr Becht took the helm last month after the abrupt departure of Michele Scannavini, who left citing personal reasons. It marked the second change at the top in a little over two years. Bernd Beetz, Coty’s long-time chief, stepped down in 2012, about eight months after Mr Becht became chairman, and took a position in the spotlight in the public battle to acquire Avon.
41;COTY;Coty Inc;2014-05-14T16:38:46Z;Avon calling for Coty’s Brazilian boost;;Coty, the maker of perfumes for brands such as Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs, was boosted after the company joined up with Avon to expand in the Brazilian market and reported surprise growth in southern Europe.The company, which floated its shares in the US last year, said that it had struck an agreement with Avon to use the company’s 1.5m independent sales representatives in the country to sell some of its fragrances in the world’s largest perfume market.“The agreement is favourable to Coty in that it provides access to Avon’s large representative base in Brazil . . . improving the company’s distribution in a large, growing fragrances market with minimal cost and risk,” Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said.The company also reported a 1 per cent rise in revenues from a year earlier to $1bn, helped by an 8 per cent advance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.However, the key US market was weak with revenues dropping to $382m from $431m as its nail polish business struggled, a trend highlighted by peer Elizabeth Arden this week.Shares in Coty advanced as much 7 per cent before falling back to end just over 2 per cent higher at $15.77, while Avon climbed 2.58 per cent to close at $13.89.Shares in US department store Sears ended 5.85 per cent lower at $40.70 after the company signalled a potential retreat from Canada, saying it was examining options for its 51 per cent stake in Sears Canada.“In connection with those efforts, Sears Holdings intends to engage an investment banking firm,” the company said in a statement.The company, which is run by chief executive Edward Lampert, is one of the best-known retailers in Canada with more than 100 stores. However, the market is facing fresh competition from the US, including the entry of Target and the expansion of Walmart.Rival Macy’s initially advanced as much as 2 per cent after the company increased its dividend and share buyback programme despite a bruising first quarter. The stock closed roughly unchanged at $57.83.The chain’s same-store sales in the quarter to May 3 fell 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, missing Wall Street forecasts for a 1.3 per cent increase.Terry Lundgren, chief executive, put much of the blame on the weather.However, the company added that sales trends improved in April and that its full-year sales forecast of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent growth should be attainable.“The company’s recent performance shows that it has the brands consumers want and has the ability to work with those brands to withstand margin pressure,” Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez said.Deere, the maker of construction and farm equipment, slipped on Wednesday after the company trimmed forecasts as orders for agriculture-related products weakened.The company said sales within its agriculture and turf business, whose equipment includes grain and sugar harvesting equipment, fell 12 per cent. The division’s operating profits fell from $1.6bn to $1.2bn.With those pressures set to remain, Deere forecast that equipment sales would drop 4 per cent, slightly weaker than the 3 per cent fall predicted in February. Its shares dipped just over 2 per cent to end at $91.70.Fossil Group, the maker of Burberry, Michael Kors and its own namesake watches, led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500.Shares in the company fell 10.27 per cent to end at exactly $100 after it offered lacklustre second-quarter guidance.Fossil said it expected to earn between 90 and 97 cents in the second quarter compared with Wall Street expectations for $1.16.Overall, US equity markets coasted near record highs as earnings season inches to a close.Of the 458 S&P 500 listed companies that have reported quarterly results, 78 per cent have met or exceeded expectations.The S&P 500 fell 0.47 per cent to 1,888.53 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.61 per cent to close at 16,613.97. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.72 per cent to end the day at 4,100.63.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @EricGPlatt
42;COTY;Coty Inc;2014-02-17T00:01:12Z;Vespa and Coty promote road scents;;Vespa, the cheeky Italian scooter brand, is set to unveil an innovative model. But instead of giving its owner a ride, the new version will come out of a bottle – as a perfume.Coty, the US maker of perfumes and toiletries, will announce on Monday that it has signed a licensing agreement with Piaggio, Vespa’s Milan-based manufacturer, to produce fragrances under the Vespa name.Anyone who loves a whiff of diesel will be disappointed.“No gasoline, no diesel, just the smell of freedom – what you smell when you ride a Vespa in the beautiful Italian countryside or along the Riviera,” said Michele Scannavini, chief executive of Coty.The group, which floated last year, produces scents for Calvin Klein and celebrities such as singers Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé and footballer David Beckham.Coty hopes to overcome the potential problem of basing a perfume on a motor vehicle by capitalising on its stylish image and association with Hollywood glamour.The scooter has starred in more than 150 movies, including 1950s classics. Audrey Hepburn rode on Gregory Peck’s Vespa in Roman Holiday, and the bike featured in Federico Fellini’s La Dolce Vita. John Wayne, Marlon Brando and Julia Roberts have all been snapped riding on one.“Vespa is not just a motorbike but the icon of a specific lifestyle, the Italian lifestyle of la dolce vita,” said Mr Scannavini. “It stands for fun and optimism.”Vespa is not the first automotive-related scent for Coty. It has produced fragrances under licence since 2008 for Lamborghini, the Italian sports car owned by Volkswagen. The latest version – Classico – was launched last year and sells in Europe, Asia and Latin America.Branded fragrances are a way for companies to reach a wider consumer market, even when the association between nose and product appears unpromising.Carmakers Jaguar and Ferrari each have a line of scents, as does Zippo, the cigarette lighter, in a container opened with a flick of the thumb.However, motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, beloved of leather-clad bikers, was unable to make a success of its fragrance, launched in the mid-1990s, and also had trouble extending its brand to white wine coolers.Vespa appeals to men and women, said Mr Scannavini, which is why the scent will be released in May in him and her versions. “We will focus it on Europe first, and depending on its performance, will roll it out to the rest of the world,” he said.
43;COTY;Coty Inc;2014-02-16T16:45:37Z;Coty: earnings blemish;Shares at the celebrity beauty products group are in need of some treatment;Ugly results, beautiful stock rally. At Coty, a maker of celebrity perfumes, nail polish, Rimmel cosmetics and the “philosophy” skin care brand, sales and earnings fell in the three months to end-December. That is the all-important holiday season. And yet in spite of this, the company’s shares rose 7 per cent on Friday.Net revenue was a smidgen above expectations – down 4 per cent to $1.32bn versus consensus of $1.3bn. But the impetus behind the stock gains looked to be relief (and short-covering) because the reflection in the mirror was not more hideous. Coty had warned of a deceleration since September, just months after its initial public offering. Mass market retailing, which sells many of Coty’s products, was particularly tough in the US during the holiday period and marked by some heavy discounting. Rival Elizabeth Arden reported an 11 per cent drop in its revenues during the same period, for example.Coty also insists that it will return to top-line growth over the next two quarters. The company is painting a prettier picture based on factors that include accelerating growth in emerging markets, new products and marketing of key brands. Last quarter, its revenues in emerging markets grew by 6 per cent, driven by southeast Asia, Brazil and South Africa. In December, Coty formed a distribution joint venture in the United Arab Emirates. The company also announced a $200m buyback programme. The market capitalisation is $6bn, but at least someone could be buying if things get more unsightly from here.Since going public in June at $17.50, Coty’s shares are down about 15 per cent. Currently at $15, they fell as low as $13 at one stage. After Friday’s rally, they trade at 19 times 2014 earnings estimates – and that’s for a company with no top or bottom line growth, at least now. Coty trades at a glitzy multiple. But the reality is far plainer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
44;COTY;Coty Inc;2013-09-17T15:48:32Z;Asian sales help Coty beat expectations;Group posts narrowed losses in first results as public company;Coty reported better than expected adjusted earnings in its first results as a public company, boosted by strong Asian sales growth for its range of branded perfumes.However, the US beauty group also warned investors that it expected current quarter net revenue to decline from the same period in 2012, showing a slowdown in the core markets of North America and Europe.Coty, which creates fragrance lines for brands such as Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs as well as celebrities including Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez, said its revenue this quarter rose 3.9 per cent to $1.06bn, driven by 11 per cent sales growth in Asia.Its net loss narrowed to $62.3m, or 16 cents per share, down sharply from $357.3m, or 95 cents per share a year earlier. Last year’s results included $473.9m worth of writedowns after Coty overpaid on the acquisitions of skin companies Philosophy and TJoy Holdings in an attempt to increase its market share in the sector.Just over half Coty’s 2012 total revenue of $4.61bn – 53 per cent – came from branded fragrances. In Tuesday’s earnings, its fragrances division posted a 5.6 per cent rise in revenue, while cosmetics reported a 0.3 per cent slip. Skin and body care revenue was up 6.3 per cent, an area in which Coty is keen to make gains given its popularity with consumers in southeast Asia.“We are very pleased with our fourth quarter top-line growth, especially given market conditions in the US and Europe,” said chief executive Michele Scannavini.“We now plan to focus growth efforts in key emerging markets like Brazil, southeast Asia and The Middle East, where we have made great progress in recent months, as well as investing in product innovation.”Despite Coty’s forecast for a short-term revenue slowdown, Mr Scannavini added that the company expects to return in the second half of the fiscal year to its long-term target to grow in line or faster than the markets and segments where it competes.“While Europe is entrenched in recession, we believe that the climate in the US is more positive. We need more visibility into back to school and the holiday periods, but I continue to expect low single-digit market growth in the US over the next fiscal year,” he said.Coty’s adjusted earnings per share, which do not include items such as expenses related to private company share-based compensation, were better than expected at 3 cents per share.Analysts had expected average adjusted earnings of 1 cent per share and revenue of $1.05bn, according to data compiled by Thomson ReutersCoty’s June IPO in New York raised $1bn, almost a year after the company abandoned its high-profile bid to take over larger rival Avon for $10.7bn.Shares in the company slipped 4.9 per cent to $15.46 in early afternoon trading in New York.
45;COTY;Coty Inc;2013-06-13T20:35:28Z;Coty shares slip takes gloss off IPO;;"Coty slipped on its stock market debut on Thursday, after raising $1bn from what was the largest consumer products initial public offering on the US market for more than a decade.Shares fell by as much as 3.5 per cent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange before slightly rebounding, after the fragrance and beauty group sold 57.1m shares at an offering price of $17.50.Coty, which makes perfumes for luxury labels such as Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein and owns nail polish brands including OPI and Sally Hansen, finished 0.8 per cent lower giving it a market value of $6.6bn.The first-day jitters reflected investors’ concerns over whether Coty was priced at a multiple that was only slightly cheaper to its publicly traded competitors. Investors also pointed to Coty’s flat revenue growth in its most recent year as potential source of weakness.“Everyone is looking to Coty and pondering its growth potential,” says Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo, a New York-based investment banking firm.He added: “Recent luxury IPOs may have gone extremely well but that doesn’t necessitate a warm reception from the markets. Investors will be looking for clear signs that the company is able to continue sustainable growth in all aspects of its business.”The New York-based company will not receive any proceeds from the 19 per cent float. Joh A Benckiser, Coty’s controlling shareholder and the holding company for Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, is drawing down its stake in the company while retaining voting control.Minority shareholders Berkshire Partners, the Boston-based private equity group, and Rhône Group, the private equity firm, have also used the IPO to reduce their holdings.Coty’s owners have been seeking to capitalise on booming global demand for cosmetics and fragrances, particularly from growing middle classes in developing markets.Research from Goldman Sachs estimates that the prestige cosmetics market is worth $46.4bn, which constitutes around 15 per cent of all luxury sales.Beauty purchases by middle-class customers – particularly those in emerging economies who are becoming increasingly sophisticated and concerned with personal care – are considered a gateway to higher spending and the largest future influencer on luxury shopping.“The industry is seeing a seismic shift not unlike the one witnessed within the apparel sector several years ago,” says Robert Burke, a New York-based luxury retail consultant.“The aspirational consumer is increasingly looking for a seamless lifestyle experience from a beauty brand; any company able to harness that is likely to see considerable return on its investments.”The company’s public offering is the largest in the personal consumer products industry since the Carolina Group raised $1.1bn from an IPO in January 2002, according to Dealogic."
46;COTY;Coty Inc;2013-06-13T16:29:02Z;Coty: smelling sweet;IPO was at a heady valuation and is the US’s third-largest this year;Coty, along with fragrances and cosmetics, also makes toiletries, including deodorant. Good thing. The investors who sold shares in the company’s initial public offering – none of the proceeds will go to the company – must have been sweating profusely in the weeks leading up to the pricing on Wednesday night. The recent stock market rally has rolled over since May, after sending the shares of Coty competitors Estée Lauder and L’Oréal up by a fifth and a third, respectively, in just six months. If the euphoria had passed before Coty got to market, it would have been hard to mask the sour smell of missed opportunity.The company ended up selling $1bn of shares at $17.50 apiece. That makes it the third-largest US IPO this year, according to Dealogic data. And the deal was done at a heady valuation: 22 times trailing earnings, even if, as the deal prospectus proposes, share-based compensation expense and various one-time items are backed out. Put the share compensation back in and the price/earnings ratio rises to 24 times. Yes, Estée Lauder and L’Oréal trade even higher, with p/e ratios of 26 times. Both of those companies have grown faster than Coty in recent quarters though. Coty, which did not increase revenues at all in the nine months ending in March, is suffering for its heavy exposure to weak European markets. Coty also brings with it a slight odour of mismanagement. In 2012 it took half a billion dollars in writedowns, due to fumbled 2010 acquisitions of the US skincare brands Philosophy for $930m and China’s Tjoy for $400m. Maybe it is lucky that Coty’s halfhearted $13bn bid for Avon never went through.The IPO price was the midpoint of the anticipated range and the shares traded slightly down when the market opened. So this was no blowout deal. So far in the second quarter, the number of IPOs pricing above-range has fallen, relative to both the first quarter and a year ago. The IPO market is far too lumpy to draw solid conclusions from this. But it is certain that the Coty deal, now that it is away, smells sweet to the sellers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
47;COTY;Coty Inc;2013-06-12T23:37:50Z;Coty raises $1bn from float;;Coty raised $1bn from an initial public offering as the beauty products group became the second-largest consumer products company to float its shares on the US market during the past decade.The company, which creates fragrance lines for luxury brands such as Calvin Klein and Bottega Veneta as well as A-list celebrities including Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez, sold 57.1m shares at $17.50 a piece, the midpoint of its expected range of $16.50 and $18.50.The New York-based company will not receive any proceeds from the IPO. Joh. A Benckiser, Coty’s controlling shareholder and the holding company for Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, is using the float to sell down its stake. Minority shareholders Berkshire Partners, the Boston-based private equity group, and Rhône Group, the private equity firm, are also reducing their holdings.For the offering, the company forged a new share class that will give investors just one vote to every 10 held by existing stakeholders. Both share classes will receive an annual cash dividend of 15 cents a share.Shares in Coty are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.The offering comes a year after Coty abandoned its high-profile bid to take over larger rival Avon, after having its $10.7bn offer for the door-to-door cosmetics group rebuffed. The company also shelved preliminary plans for an IPO last October, saying new chief executive Michele Scannavini needed time to settle into his new position after long-time leader Bernd Beetz unexpectedly chose to step down.Although the company has seen rapid growth in recent years, the past few quarters have seen revenues remain flat as Coty struggled to diversify its product portfolio.Attempts by Coty to expand its skincare offerings in order to gain market share from rivals such as Estée Lauder and L’Oréal, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, resulted in $573m worth of writedowns after it overpaid on the acquisitions of skin companies Philosophy and TJoy Holdings in 2010.Coty’s public offering is the largest in the personal consumer products industry since the Carolina Group raised $1.1bn from an IPO in January 2002, according to Dealogic.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are leading the underwriting for the offering.
48;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Coty seeks to raise $1bn in IPO;;Coty is seeking to raise $1bn in an initial public offering as it looks to move past a failed attempt to buy Avon, the departure of its longtime chief executive and the discovery that a subsidiary potentially violated US export laws with sales to Syria.The beauty products company, which recently disclosed large writedowns on two acquisitions that swung it into a net loss last year, said in an updated securities filing that its business had recovered in the nine months to the end of March.Coty has also disclosed in filings that it faces a potential fine that could result in a “material loss” after it took remedial action to cease a United Arab Emirates-based subsidiary from selling certain products to Syria.In a US listing expected for mid-June, Coty said it would offer up a 18.9 per cent stake, or 57.1m shares, at a price of $16.50 to $18.50.Valued at the midpoint, the IPO would raise $1bn for the company’s selling shareholders including majority-owners Joh. A Benckiser, the holding company for Germany’s Reimann family.The company’s two private equity stakeholders – Boston-based Berkshire Partners and Rhône Group – which initially invested in January 2011, will also draw down on holdings of 7.1 per cent each.Coty, best known for its high-end designer fragrance business that creates perfumes for celebrities as well as for luxury brands, said it would not receive proceeds from the listing.Shares purchased via the offering will carry just 2.3 per cent of total voting control with the rest remaining in the hands of existing stakeholders, the company said.The offering comes a year after the company abandoned its high-profile bid to take over larger rival Avon, after having its $10.7bn offer for the door-to-door cosmetics group rebuffed.Months later, the company postponed plans for a US listing saying it wanted to allow Michele Scannavini, its recently appointed chief executive, time to settle in after the retirement of longtime head, Bernd Beetz.Mr Beetz, a well-respected executive in the beauty industry, also stepped down from the company’s board at the start of May. Mr Beetz’s received a $44m payout following his retirement, although there has been speculation that his exit was prompted by a dispute with the company’s owners.A string of filings since October have revealed that Coty overpaid on the 2010 acquisitions of Chinese skincare group TJoy and high-end US beauty label Philosophy. Writedowns related to those purchases came to $573m, swinging the company to a loss in 2012.Coty said net profits in the nine months to March 31 were $230.3m, up from $32.9m during the same time a year earlier and before it disclosed the writedowns. Net revenues were flat in the period at $3.6bnBank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters on the offering. The company is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COTY”.
49;COTY;Coty Inc;2013-05-07T18:56:16Z;Coty prepares for a very public close-up;;An investor roadshow promoting Coty’s forthcoming initial public offering is expected to kick off in the coming weeks, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley leading the share offering.Founded in Paris in 1904 by François Coty, the company has grown into a global operation employing 12,000 people and generating $4.6bn in sales in the year that ended on June 30.Coty, which has its headquarters in New York, last year signed pop star Katy Perry to develop her own line of signature fragrances. Ms Perry joins Coty’s stable of celebrities and luxury brands that includes Calvin Klein, Chloé, Marc Jacobs and Playboy.But for the privately owned cosmetics and fragrance group behind some of the world’s highest-profile beauty brands, the question is whether it is finally ready for its public close-up.Last year it spent months in the spotlight amid its ultimately unsuccessful $10.7bn pursuit of larger rival Avon.The ambitious move was the latest in its rise to becoming a market leader alongside the world’s top cosmetics brands. But as the potential deal collapsed – Avon believed it was worth more money – Coty watched its profile splattered across the world’s front pages.Soon the company realised it faced its own makeover. One year into his chairmanship, Bart Becht, the former Reckitt Benckiser chairman, had to find a replacement after the unexpected retirement of longtime chief executive Bernd Beetz last July.Mr Beetz, a former LVMH executive, had spent the previous 11 years building up Coty through acquisitions. He said it was the right time to step down, and a $44m sweetener in the event of his retirement surely helped ease the way.However, others say his retirement was highly unusual given his expertise in the field, and suggested his exit may have had something to do with a dispute over the size of his ongoing stake in Coty. The company declined to comment.The task of guiding the group fell to Michele Scannavini, who was brought in to fill Mr Beetz’s shoes. After a decade leading Coty Prestige, the group’s luxury – and most profitable – arm, Mr Scannavini was given time to deal with the aftermath of some of Mr Beetz’s legacy investments.A string of security filings since October has revealed that Coty overpaid on two acquisitions in 2010 that resulted in $573m in writedowns.On the face of it, a hasty attempt to expand into skincare was understandable. Coty lacks firepower in Asia, where consumer appetite for western beauty brands is booming and skincare is king. Skincare in the region currently represents 63 per cent of the beauty market, compared with just 32 per cent in the US. Competition from rivals such as L’Oréal and Estée Lauder is fierce.But TJoy, the Chinese skincare group which Coty bought for $352m, failed to provide the foothold in the region that management hoped for. Coty has since blamed the unit’s dismal performance on the “earlier than expected departure of the TJoy” chief executive as well as the “sudden and unexpected departure of certain other key employees”.A $930m acquisition of the US-based high-end Philosophy label also failed to meet the company’s expectations.For potential investors, the concern must be what other surprises await the company as it expands into new brands and new markets.At the same time, it seems its majority stakeholder, Joh. A. Benckiser, the German family holding group that represents the $20bn interests of the reclusive Reimann family, is in the mood to sell some shares.
50;COTY;Coty Inc;2013-05-07T17:16:08Z;Coty scents fresh appetite for IPO;;Coty, the beauty products company that failed to buy Avon for $10.7bn last year, is making a renewed effort to launch an initial public offering in what would be the largest float by a US consumer retail business since Michael Kors listed in 2011.Coty would attempt to raise $700m as early as next month as it taps investor appetite for new US listings at a time when the S&P 500 has pushed into record territory, people close to the situation said. Coty declined to comment.The move comes after a series of setbacks for Coty, which has annual sales of $4.6bn from fragrance licences to luxury houses Bottega Veneta and Calvin Klein and some of the world’s biggest celebrities, including David Beckham and Beyoncé.Despite the public backing of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Coty, which is 82 per cent-owned by Joh. A Benckiser, the holding company for Germany’s Reimann family, abandoned its bid for Avon last May after the cosmetics direct seller repeatedly rejected its overtures.Coty had lined up financing from Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan.In the subsequent months, the company endured a tumultuous period marked by management upheaval, a postponed IPO and large writedowns on the value of two acquisitions made in 2010.Bernd Beetz, who built the company into one of the top cosmetic companies in the world, unexpectedly retired as chief executive and was replaced by Michele Scannavini, a Coty executive and former head of Fila sportswear.Weeks after Mr Scannavini took the helm, Coty blamed a sluggish IPO market and management changes for its decision to postpone its flotation.But in a series of securities filings, Coty then revealed $573m in writedowns linked to its $352m purchase of TJoy, a China-based skincare group, and its $930m acquisition of Philosophy, a skin-product brand.The impairments swung Coty to a $324m net loss for fiscal year 2012, a stark reversal from the $61.7m net profit it had made in each of the two years before.One person familiar with the deals said Coty did insufficient due diligence before making those purchases and called both acquisitions “bad apples”.The renewed IPO attempt comes as net profits at the company appear to have improved. In the six months to December 31, Coty reported income of $210m, up 5.8 per cent from the same period a year before.A successful listing will provide an exit avenue for the Benckiser group and minority shareholders including Boston-based private equity group Berkshire Partners and Rhône Group.Mr Beetz, who has remained on the company’s board, controls 3.7 per cent of Coty’s shares. He received total compensation of $56m in his two final years as chief executive and was entitled to a $44m payout upon his retirement, according to filings.Michael Kors raised $1.1bn from its 2011 IPO.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are leading the share offering.
51;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Coty postpones $700m IPO amid slowdown;;Coty, the cosmetics group, has delayed plans to raise up to $700m in an initial public offering that had been set to be this year’s biggest consumer retailer debut.The New York-based company, which filed documents with US regulators at the end of June, is now planning to launch its IPO sometime in the first half of next year, according to people familiar with its plans.The decision comes several weeks after the company named Michele Scannavini, a Coty executive and former head of Fila sportswear, as its chief executive and amid signs of a market slowdown in North America and Europe.A sluggish IPO market in the US has made it difficult for companies without strong sales growth to debut, equity capital market bankers have said.Coty, which produces scents carrying the brands of celebrities such as Beyoncé Knowles and David Beckham, said the bulk of its sales come from the two continents. Only about a quarter of its revenue derived from emerging markets, where the company seeks to expand.Analysts highlighted cautious sales guidance by Estée Lauder and L’Oréal as indications of weakness in the broader cosmetics sector.Pablo Zuanic, consumer goods analyst at Liberum Capital, said: “There are some concerns that the prestige segment is slowing down.”Estée Lauder warned that it had seen weakness in “certain western European countries” and blamed continued global economic uncertainty for a possible slowdown.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters for the IPO, according to its June filing. The banks and Coty declined to comment.Coty hired the banks to launch a public offering soon after the group withdrew its bid for cosmetics direct seller Avon, bringing to an end a six-week stand-off between the two companies.“It might make more sense for Coty to wait, do a deal to get larger and get bank financing, then later when it has a more compelling story and a more fleshed out company strategy it can go for an IPO,” Mr Zuanic added.The proceeds of the IPO are intended for existing shareholders and not for the company’s useJoh A Benckiser, a family holding company based in Luxembourg, holds an 80.5 per cent stake in Coty, while entities affiliated with Berkshire Partners, the Boston-based private equity firm, hold a 7.5 per cent stake, as do affiliates of private equity firm Rhône Group, the filing said.
52;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-07-25T18:04:01Z;Coty names new chief ahead of IPO;;Coty, the cosmetics group that tried to buy Avon, will launch its planned initial public offering under new leadership after Bernd Beetz, its chief executive for 11 years, announced he would step down.He will be replaced by Michele Scannavini, a Coty executive and former head of Fila sportswear, as the company prepares for a share listing in New York that is expected to give it a market value of up to $700m.“It’s a good crossroads as we embark on the IPO,” Mr Beetz told the Financial Times at Coty’s head office in New York.Coty, which produces scents carrying the brands of celebrities such as Beyoncé Knowles and David Beckham, filed IPO documents with US regulators at the end of June as it sought to move on from a failed $10.7bn takeover bid for rival Avon.Mr Beetz, who will remain on the Coty board, declined to comment on the timing of the IPO. He also did not comment on whether Coty would launch another bid for Avon, a troubled group that consistently stonewalled approaches from Coty.Pablo Zuanic, consumer goods analyst at Liberum Capital, said: “The company needs the IPO to get the exposure as it seeks to grow through acquisitions …$700m in the scheme of things is a drop in the bucket, but it is about raising their profile in order to get better known by the investment community.”A division head at Coty for the past decade, Mr Scannavini will become chief executive on August 1.Bart Becht, Coty’s chairman and former chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, said in a statement that Mr Scannavini “is the key architect behind Coty’s designer brand licences and the growth of our fragrance business.“Michele has also successfully led the integration of acquired businesses, including UCI from Unilever and American Designer Fragrances from LVMH.”Mr Scannavini was previously chief executive of Fila and before that reported to Mr Beetz when both men worked at Procter & Gamble.Joh. A Benckiser, a German family holding company, has an 80.5 per cent stake in Coty, while entities affiliated with Berkshire Partners, the Boston private equity firm, own 7.5 per cent, as do affiliates of private equity firm Rhône Group.Since Mr Beetz joined as chief executive in 2001 Coty’s annual revenues have increased from approximately $1.5bn to more than $4.5bn as it has created new perfume and nail polish brands and acquired others, including OPI, Calvin Klein and Sally Hansen.In the IPO Coty shareholders will sell some of their existing stock. The company, which was founded in Paris in 1904, does not plan to issue new shares in the offering and will not gain any proceeds from the IPO.
53;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-06-29T02:41:45Z;Coty files for $700m IPO;;Coty, the cosmetics group, has filed documents with US regulators to raise as much as $700m in an initial public offering as it seeks to move on from its failed $10.7bn takeover bid for rival Avon.The filing on Friday did not disclose a price-per-share target for the IPO, but said it would offer Class A shares being sold on behalf of existing stockholders. While the shareholders will be able to cash in some of their holdings, Coty itself will not see any proceeds from the IPO.Joh. A. Benckiser, a family holding company based in Luxembourg, holds an 80.5 per cent stake in Coty, while entitites affiliated with Berkshire Partners, the Boston-based private equity firm, hold a 7.5 per cent stake, as do affiliates of private equity firm Rhône Group.Former chairman Peter Harf holds 2.2 per cent of the stock, while chief executive Bernd Beetz holds 1.6 per cent and current chairman Bart Becht owns 1.2 per cent.New York-based Coty did not wish to comment.Bank of America Merrill Lynch,JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley will advise Coty on the offering.Coty hired the banks just after the group withdrew its raised bid for cosmetics direct seller Avon, bringing to an end a six-week stand-off between the two companies.Coty, which produces scents under the brands of celebrities such as Beyoncé Knowles and David Beckham, walked away after the deadline it had set for Avon to respond to its raised bid expired.Mr Becht said in a letter to the Avon board at the time: “It is time for Coty to move on and pursue other opportunities.”Coty posted net income attributable to Coty of $32.9m on revenue of $3.58bn for the nine months ended March 31. It said in its IPO filing that it anticipated more than $4.5bn in revenue for the fiscal year 2012.The company intends to list its common stock either on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COTY”.Coty, which competes with companies such as Estée Lauder and L’Oreal, made a steady stream of acquisitions in recent years to become the world’s 12th largest beauty company based on retail sales, according to Euromonitor.In 2010, it bought nail care company OPI Products and beauty products company Philosophy, both for about $1bn, as well as Dr Scheller Cosmetics of Germany and China’s TJoy Holdings. It also acquired the perfume licences for a clutch of designers, including Calvin Klein, from Unilever in 2005.Mr Becht, who joined Coty last year, has been known for his ambitious and transformative strategies and a successful public offering would be a victory for the former chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, the household products maker he previously led.
54;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-05-20T23:39:52Z;Pressure on new chief for Avon makeover;;"By turning its back on Coty’s unsolicited $10bn-plus bid, and staying that way for six weeks, Avon Products sent a clear message to the market – it believed it could create more shareholder value by turning round the company than accepting Coty’s “opportunistic” offer.Avon got what it asked for. Coty, the fragrance maker, withdrew its bid in frustration last week. Now the pressure is on Sheri McCoy, Avon Products’ new chief executive, to revive the fortunes of the troubled 126-year-old cosmetics direct seller.Ms McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive once seen as a possible successor to retiring chief executive William Weldon, was brought in by Avon last month, after Coty made its initial offer. She replaced Andrea Jung, who stepped down after 12 years as chief executive and remained chairman.Yet from the start, Ms McCoy’s job was more complex than simply defending her new company from Coty’s bid. Avon is plagued by multiple regulatory investigations and waning profitability. It has spent more than $200m on fees associated with an investigation into possible violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and could face big fines if found guilty.“Sheri has some fires to put out,” said Connie Maneaty, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. The company faces challenges over “execution issues, greatly diminished morale, bribery investigations, the secular decline of sales representatives, sales, and lack of cash flow generation in the US, and the future of Avon in China.”Almost all of Avon’s cash is held outside the US, making it difficult for the company to use without paying steep repatriation taxes. Meanwhile, Ms Jung took home more than $70m in compensation over the past six years. All of which makes Ms McCoy’s new job one of the most difficult in the industry.“I don’t think the new chief executive has a magic wand that she can wave to fix all of Avon’s problems,” said Mark Astrachan, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “The company needs to look at every aspect of the business from product categories to assessing the markets they are in and what their consumers want.”After reporting poor first-quarter earnings earlier this month, a week after starting in her new role, Ms McCoy said “stabilising the business” and rebuilding confidence and trust in the brand were her priorities. She said she would aim to tackle operational issues, address commodity costs, assess changing demographics and review the company’s product portfolio in her first few months.Ms McCoy acknowledged Avon’s woes. “It has lost market share; missed expectations; it has operational and strategic issues; the rate of growth has declined; and cash generation and cost management needs to improve,” she said.Such bleak assessments from the company itself left some analysts and shareholders wondering why Avon did not engage with Coty. Shares in Avon are down 19 per cent since Coty withdrew its bid, shrinking the company’s market capitalisation to $7.4bn. The stock now trades below its price directly before Coty’s first bid.“Clearly the market has spoken in terms of how much investors think Avon is worth without a bid,” said Ali Dibadj, analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “The Coty offer looks extraordinarily attractive now.”Coty itself was exasperated by Avon’s unresponsiveness. Though its bid was unsolicited and never went hostile, Coty lined up financing from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, and publicly asked Avon to allow it to perform due diligence in order to determine a final offer price.Avon steadfastly rebuffed Coty’s advances, adopting what one person close to the situation described as a “bunker mentality”.After Coty raised its bid from $10bn to $10.7bn earlier this month, Coty chairman Bart Becht personally tried to reach Ms McCoy, Ms Jung and Fred Hassan, Avon’s lead independent director, according to people familiar with the situation. None of Mr Becht’s phone calls was returned.At least two law firms have now announced investigations into alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Avon’s board in rejecting the bids, hoping to drum up support for possible class action lawsuits. Yet Avon won a vote of confidence of sorts from institutional shareholders when they re-elected the board at the company’s annual meeting this month.With Coty gone for now, Ms McCoy will try to increase sales and reduce expenses as part of Avon’s previously announced strategic review. Analysts believe a turnround could take years.Yet Avon may remain an attractive target, especially given its diminished market capitalisation. Richmont Holdings, a private Texas group, is said to be interested in acquiring Avon. And Coty has hired banks to prepare for a public offering this year that could value it at $8bn, leading some to suggest it could come back for Avon soon.“The company is very much in a state of flux,” said Mr Dibadj. “There are rumours of other bids. Will they find a strategy that works for them on their own? These are questions that are very much still there.”"
55;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-05-15T17:45:48Z;Avon’s long road ahead as Coty walks away;;When Bart Becht left household products maker Reckitt Benckiser and became chairman of fragrance giant Coty, he might have thought the days of detergents and cleaning agents were behind him.But with Coty’s withdrawal of its unsolicited $10.7bn bid for cosmetics direct seller Avon late on Monday, Mr Becht walks away from perhaps the biggest mess of his otherwise sparkling career.Coty made its initial bid for Avon in March, after talks between the two companies about a possible Avon takeover of Coty went quiet. “We turned the tables and made a bid for Avon,” Mr Becht told the Financial Times last month. “But the initiative was always on the Coty side.”It was an ambitious gambit from the start. With $11bn of sales, Avon is more than twice the size of Coty. The US group is also plagued with operational and regulatory problems.Avon’s difficulties have include disgruntled sales representatives, slumping US sales and order fulfilment problems in Brazil. It also faces fallout from bribery allegations in China and Latin America that are being probed by US regulators.Investors and analysts believed that if anyone was capable of pulling off a deal, it was Mr Becht. He became chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser when Benckiser merged with Reckitt & Colman in 1999 and made the company one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 with brands like Woolite and Vanish. He was rewarded for his work, taking home £90m in 2009.As chairman of Coty – which is majority owned by Joh. A Benckiser, a family holding company based in Luxembourg that also holds a significant stake in Reckitt Benckiser – Mr Becht saw similar opportunities for value creation.He launched Coty’s bid on April 2 with a letter to Andrea Jung, who was then Avon’s embattled chief executive. The “Dear Andrea” letter laid out the rationale for the deal and offered $23.35 per share for Avon, a 27 per cent premium over the stock’s three month volume weighted average price.But Coty also said it had no intention of going hostile by making a tender offer or pursuing a proxy battle for control of Avon’s board.That move struck many observers as a sign of half-heartedness, yet Coty maintained that it needed to perform due diligence to fully understand the state of the business, and the potential regulatory liabilities.Avon shares jumped on news of the bid, but the company immediately rejected Coty’s initial $10bn offer as too low, calling it “opportunistic” and complaining that Coty had not secured financing for its bid.A week later, it announced the appointment of former Johnson & Johnson executive Sheri McCoy as its chief executive and reiterated its desire to remain independent.Coty came back two weeks later, saying it had lined up $5bn in equity financing and was confident it could raise another $9bn in debt. In a conference call with investors, Mr Becht told shareholders that “this week is the time to act and express their opinion to the Avon board”. Avon quickly dismissed Coty’s promises of financing and held its ground.Last week Coty raised its bid to $10.7bn and brought in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as an equity investor. Coty had been advised by BDT – a firm founded by Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs partner known to be Mr Buffett’s favourite banker – which was also providing equity financing.The alliance with Mr Buffett was seen as a way for Coty to force Avon to the table, and Coty said it would withdraw its offer if Avon did not engage in discussions by Monday night. On Sunday Avon said it needed another week to respond.If Avon thought Coty was bluffing with its deadline, it was wrong. Late Monday night Coty withdrew its bid, expressing frustration that Avon would not return phone calls over the weekend.“Avon shareholders should yet again be truly exasperated with Avon’s board and management,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “Coty’s actions all seemed to suggest that it was serious about Avon. Avon’s actions did not return that sentiment.”Avon now faces a long road ahead as it attempts to fix its business and grapple with regulators. With Avon stock down 10 per cent on Tuesday, below the undisturbed price before the Coty bid, shareholders can only hope Ms McCoy finds success.Coty, meanwhile, came a long way only to walk away at the last minute. For Mr Becht, who made a career of knowing what people want to buy, and offering it at the right price, Avon may be the one great deal that got away.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson
56;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-05-15T07:28:33Z;Coty drops $10.7bn bid for Avon;;Coty has withdrawn its unsolicited $10.7bn bid for Avon, bringing to an end a tense six-week stand-off between the fragrance maker and the direct seller of cosmetics.The withdrawal of the bid came as the deadline Coty set for Avon to respond to its sweetened offer expired. Last week Coty raised its bid and brought in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to help provide financing, saying it would give Avon until Monday night to enter into discussions about a possible deal.Avon on Sunday said it would consider the raised bid and respond to Coty within a week. It gave no explanation why the additional time was needed, and Coty said in its letter that it had not been able to reach Avon management despite multiple attempts over the weekend.“As our deadline to begin discussions expired today, our proposal is withdrawn,” Bart Becht, Coty’s chairman, said in his letter to the Avon board. “It is time for Coty to move on and pursue other opportunities.”The bid was a distraction for a group already facing a host of business and regulatory challenges.“Avon shareholders should yet again be truly exasperated with Avon’s board and management,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “Coty’s actions all seemed to suggest that it was serious about Avon. Avon’s actions did not return that sentiment.”But the end of Coty’s interest is likely to be welcomed by Avon’s management and new chief executive Sheri McCoy, who had expressed their desire to keep Avon independent.Coty’s withdrawal also signalled a rare defeat for Mr Becht, who became a stock market favourite as chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, the household and personal goods company, where he consistently trumped his own and market earnings guidance over more than a decade at the top.When he left last year and became Coty’s chairman, he was not moving far – Coty is majority-owned by Joh. A Benckiser, the holding company for Germany’s Riemann family, which also has a minority stake in Reckitt Benckiser.Mr Becht had wanted to combine Coty’s strength in fragrance and nail products in developed markets with Avon’s make-up and skin products and its emerging markets presence.Before Coty withdrew its bid on Monday some major Avon shareholders said the new bid was getting closer to the right price and, with the backing of Mr Buffett, was a more credible offer.“It’s an OK price, but not great,” said Jason Subotky of the Yachtman Funds, Avon’s sixth-largest shareholder with 3.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg.However, Mr Subotky also said that, while he would need another 10 per cent to start to be persuaded, the Yachtman Funds had built its position only recently and other shareholders might be happy to take what money was available.“We believe that we provided a compelling and well-financed proposal for a business facing multiple challenges,” Mr Becht said in his letter. “We received encouragement from many of your shareholders, research analysts and others in the financial community. Despite this support, your total lack of engagement with us leads us to believe that you remain reluctant to explore a friendly, negotiated combination on a reasonable timetable. Two months is enough.”Additional reporting by Anjli Raval and Dan McCrum
57;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-05-11T20:05:51Z;Avon board has weekend to ponder offer;;"Avon’s directors are in for a sleepless weekend. On Monday they have to give the green light to allow Coty, the maker of celebrity perfumes, to begin due diligence – or wave goodbye to its unwelcome suitor and, possibly, its own bid-fuelled share price.Privately-owned Coty spent last week filling its war-chest as it stepped up its $10.7bn unsolicited takeover bid.Parent JAB Holdings raised $2bn from the sale of part of its stake in Reckitt Benckiser, the household and personal care goods company, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway also agreed to put up funding.Coty further burnished its suit by raising its conditional offer from $23.25 a share to $24.75 and holding out the potential carrot of “an opportunity to provide significant and certain immediate value to Avon’s shareholders” if the direct-seller of cosmetics agreed to open its books.Avon, which has so far rebuffed all advances, said it would review the new offer “in due course”.Its long-suffering shareholders will want to be sure of the company’s own turnround plans if it closes the door on talks with Coty. Avon has been plagued with operational and legal troubles in recent years. In the summer of 2008, it began an internal investigation of possible violations in China of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the US law that forbids bribery of officials overseas to win or retain business.Last October, Avon revealed a second investigation by US regulators, this one to determine if the company had violated rules around selective disclosure in its communications with financial analysts.Adding to its problems, Avon had its credit rating downgraded by the three ratings agencies last week; Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday brought up the rear with a downgrade from A3 to Baa1, or three notches above junk status."
58;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-05-10T13:56:26Z;Coty boosts bid for Avon to $10.7bn;;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is to help finance Coty’s sweetened $10.7bn unsolicited bid for Avon, as the fragrance company steps up pressure to snare the direct seller of cosmetics.Coty raised its $23.25 a share offer to $24.75 a share, in a letter addressed to the Avon board of directors, and delivered a three-day deadline of Monday for the troubled company’s response.Avon posted the letter on its website on Thursday morning, saying it would review the offer “in due course”.In a further attempt to get Avon’s long-suffering shareholders on side, Coty promised that if discussions began it would work to “determine whether there is an opportunity to provide significant and certain immediate value to Avon’s shareholders”.Coty did not reveal how much equity financing Berkshire Hathaway was prepared to provide. However, Coty has been advised by BDT – a firm founded by Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs partner known to be Mr Buffett’s favourite banker. BDT is also providing equity financing.The latest bid comes hours after Coty’s parent, the privately owned JAB Holdings, raised about £1.2bn in financing through the sale of a 4.9 per cent stake in Reckitt Benckiser, the UK-listed household and personal goods group that is its anchor investment.Coty said that it would withdraw its proposal if Avon did not engage in discussions by Monday night. It added that it was prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement and a standstill provision to prevent it from taking further public steps to acquire the company if Avon allowed it to conduct due diligence. It added that it could revise its final offer up or down depending on what it discovered in such a process.Avon shares gained 9.3 per cent to $21.60 on Wednesday on news of Coty’s new financing but then fell 3.3 per cent to $20.89 by market close on Thursday.Ali Dibadj, analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said Avon could be in potential breach of fiduciary duty if it refused to enter talks. “Given the last quarter’s results were just so terrible, Avon really needs to take this bid more seriously,” he said. “Because even if they fix the company it’s going to take time.”Victoria Collin, analyst at Atlantic Equities, said any offer below $25 a share was “opportunistic”. But she said Avon shareholders might put pressure on the board. “They have been without management direction since they announced a chief executive search in December,” she added. “ The last quarter’s earnings were significantly below expectations so frustrated shareholders may be willing to cash in on Coty’s increased bid.”Last month, Avon rebuffed Coty’s unsolicited bid. It subsequently strengthened its defences by recruting Sheri McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, as its new chief executive, taking over the role from Andrea Jung who remains chairman.The company has been plagued with operational and legal troubles in recent years. In the summer of 2008, it began an internal investigation of possible violations in China to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the US law that forbids bribery of officials overseas to win or retain business.Last October, Avon revealed a second investigation by US regulators, this one to determine if the company had violated rules around selective disclosure in its communications with financial analysts.On Thursday, Moody’s Investors Service also downgraded the long-term ratings of Avon Products from A3 to Baa1, or three notches above junk status, following similar downgrades by S&P and Fitch earlier in the week.
59;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-05-09T19:41:37Z;Coty owner to raise $2bn in Avon battle;;Coty strengthened its hand in the $10bn battle for fellow cosmetics group Avon after its parent unveiled plans to tap the markets for some $2bn.JAB Holdings, the privately held vehicle that owns Coty, said it would sell 36m shares in Reckitt Benckiser, the UK-listed household and personal care company. Based on Wednesday’s close, the 4.9 per cent stake would be worth some £1.3bn.Shareholders in Avon were quick to interpret the move as a sign that Coty was building up its resources in readiness for a bid, driving the share price of the direct-sales group up 9.3 per cent to $21.60. Avon’s management has rebuffed the offer, which it sees as undervaluing the troubled company.“We see this as a way for JAB to help Coty fund the bid for Avon or for other companies that Coty may decide to pursue,” wrote Pablo Zuanic, analyst at Liberum Capital, in a note.JAB said the share sale reflected a “desire to diversify its portfolio and invest in new opportunities” and added that Reckitt Benckiser remained its most important investment.Avon and Coty both declined to comment.Avon has been grappling with a host of financial and legal troubles, including bribery allegations and a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the company over its contacts with analysts.Speaking last month, Bart Becht, chairman of Coty and former chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, said Coty had lined up $5bn in equity financing and was confident of raising a further $9bn of debt to fund its $10bn unsolicited bid for Avon and subsequent refinancing.Analysts have suggested that further equity infusions could come from 3G Capital, founded by the controlling Brazilian shareholders of Anheuser-Busch InBev, and the global brewer itself.3G recently raised $1.4bn from the sale of its stake in Burger King. The trio of companies are linked by Peter Harf, chief executive of JAB, who last year stood down as chairman of ABI and has served as a director of Burger King. Moreover, add Bernstein Research analysts, Mr Harf brought Mr Becht into Reckitt Benckiser and Mr Becht succeeded Mr Harf as chairman of Coty.Although it is liquidating part of its stake in Reckitt Benckiser, JAB stressed its support for the maker of Finish dishwasher tablets and Nurofen painkillers.Reckitt consistently outperformed its peers under Mr Becht but began losing momentum shortly before he passed the baton to Rakesh Kapoor last year. Mr Kapoor has subsequently stamped his own strategic imprint on the company, and its shares have outperformed the broader market in the past few months.JAB said it is a strong believer in Reckitt Benckiser’s new management team and recently announced strategy. JAB aims to keep board representation and a minimum shareholding of at least 10 per cent.Avon has rebuffed the smaller Coty, calling the approach “opportunistic” and the $23.25-a-share offer inadequate.It strengthened its defences last month by announcing the appointment of Sheri McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, as its new chief executive, underlining its determination to stay independent.Avon has contended with operational and legal troubles that have weakened the direct cosmetics seller’s brand. In the summer of 2008, Avon launched an internal investigation of its adherence in China to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the US law which forbids bribery of officials overseas to win or retain business.The direct-marketing company said later that year it had contacted the SEC and Department of Justice, which both began investigations. In 2010, Avon suspended four executives in relation to the probe.Last October, Avon revealed a second SEC investigation into the company. It said it had received a subpoena requesting information relating to the company’s communications with financial analysts as part of an inquiry into selective disclosure. Andrea Jung’s resignation from the post of chief executive followed two months later.
60;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-04-16T22:19:42Z;Coty lines up financing for Avon bid;;Coty, the privately owned beauty company, has lined up $5bn in equity financing and is confident it can raise a further $9bn of debt to fund its $10bn unsolicited takeover bid for Avon, strengthening its hand in the battle for the door-to-door cosmetics seller.Speaking on a conference call to hundreds of Avon shareholders, Bart Becht, chairman of Coty, urged investors to persuade the Avon board to engage in discussions.“For shareholders, this week is the time to act and express their opinion to the Avon board,” he said. “Call today and convince them to engage with us so we can …give you our best price.”Avon has rebuffed the smaller Coty, calling the approach “opportunistic” and the $23.25-a-share offer inadequate. It strengthened its defences last week by announcing the appointment of Sheri McCoy, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, as its new chief executive, underlining its determination to stay independent.But Mr Becht, the former head of Reckitt Benckiser who is leading the bid as Coty’s chairman, raised the stakes by unveiling funding for the bid, which will require $4bn of debt refinancing on top of the $10bn equity value.He said that the group had more than $5bn in equity commitments – although he stopped short of revealing who was supplementing money put up by Joh A Benckiser, the family holding company that owns Coty – and a “highly confident” letter from JPMorgan Securities pledging $9bn in debtThe conference call, organised by independent research house Bernstein Research, followed a further letter to Avon in which it said it would not increase the price without access to its books, promising to devote “no more than a couple of weeks” to confidential discussions.Mr Becht wrote to Andrea Jung, Avon’s chairman: “Without being invited to complete due diligence, we have no way of knowing the best price we can ultimately pay to Avon shareholders.”On Friday, Avon shares closed at $23.52, above Coty’s offer of $23.25 a share – a sign that Wall Street is expecting a higher bid to come from Coty or another potential buyer.Avon responded quickly with a statement: “As we said on April 2, Avon’s board of directors concluded that Coty’s indication of interest at $23.25 per share is opportunistic and does not reflect the fundamental value of the company and its global beauty care and direct-selling franchise.”Mr Becht warned shareholders that Coty would not wait forever and that, when it quit the table, so would the takeover premium – the pre-bid three-month average share price was about $18.He added that Avon had a fiduciary duty to engage in discussions, but reiterated that Coty would not go hostile given the extent of legal and operational issues facing the company. These, along with synergies, could only be evaluated following due diligence, he said.Avon is grappling with operational and legal troubles, including an investigation into bribery allegations in China, which have weakened the door-to-door cosmetics brand, opening the way for the Coty bid.
61;COTY;Coty Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
62;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-04-09T22:16:14Z;Avon turns to J&J for new chief;;Avon Products has appointed Sheri McCoy, a Johnson & Johnson vice-chairman, as its new chief executive in a move that underscores its determination to fend off an unsolicited $10bn takeover approach from Coty.The appointment of Ms McCoy, once a contender to be J&J’s chief executive, is likely to complicate the next move by Coty. The privately owned fragrance group is planning to start wooing Avon investors to put pressure on the board, which quickly rejected Coty’s bid last week.Avon has been searching for a new chief executive for three months while contending with operational and legal troubles that have weakened the door-to-door cosmetics brand, opening the way for a Coty bid that Avon dismissed as opportunistic.Shares in Avon closed down 3.1 per cent at $22.69 after the announcement on Monday of Ms McCoy’s appointment, falling back beneath Coty’s $23.25 offer price, in a sign that in Wall Street’s eyes the deal was less likely to happen.Last week Bart Becht, the Coty chairman who is leading the bid, said it would not be helpful for Avon to appoint a new chief executive to replace Andrea Jung, who said in December she was ready to step down.“It’s not productive to [appoint a new chief executive] when you’re smack in the middle of exploring alternative options and I’m not sure they would do that,” Mr Becht said.“Would we fundamentally change our approach? No, unlikely. But it just wouldn’t be helpful.”Ms McCoy, 53, joined J&J in 1982 and since January last year has led its pharmaceutical and consumer businesses, which make up more than 60 per cent of its $65bn annual revenue.But analysts noted she does not have first-hand experience of retailing.Ms McCoy had been considered one of two possible successors to William Weldon, J&J’s chief executive who stepped down in February, but the company gave the job to Alex Gorsky and analysts speculated that as a result Ms McCoy might look for a job elsewhere.The Coty deal was now probably off the table, said Lauren Lieberman, analyst at Barclays Capital.“Unless there’s something notable [in Ms McCoy’s contract] in terms of what she’s entitled to if she sells the company, it’s a pretty definitive statement they’re not interested. It’s unlikely she’d leave [J&J] for something that isn’t a real job,” she said.Ms Jung, who was Avon’s chief executive for 12 years, will remain as chairman. Under her leadership Avon was beset by difficulties including falling US sales, problems fulfilling orders in Brazil and bribery allegations in China that are being investigated by US regulators.Fixing Avon’s problems was a “burdensome challenge”, said Les Berglass, chairman of Berglass & Associates, an executive search group.“The last thing you need is for a troubled company to have a new leader and be distracted by a takeover bid,” he said.
63;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-04-06T18:03:54Z;Coty seeks to woo Avon investors;;Bart Becht, the Coty chairman who is trying to buy Avon Products, plans to start wooing the door-to-door beauty group’s shareholders in the next two weeks to put pressure on its reluctant board.Mr Becht, who is leading a $10bn bid for Avon, told the Financial Times: “The next steps are really to convince their shareholders that they should talk to the board and have the board engage with us.”Avon, a legendary brand that has fallen on hard times due to a string of management and legal problems, swiftly rejected the bid from Coty, a privately owned fragrance group, after it was made public on Monday.“We’re just amazed and we also don’t understand how their board comes to this conclusion of not interacting with us. That’s the key thing,” Mr Becht said in a telephone interview. Avon dismissed the offer as cheap and “opportunistic”.The acquisition of Avon and its army of neighbourhood saleswomen would create a new rival to the global beauty giants L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble, whose brands include Olay and CoverGirl.Coty’s $4.5bn sales last year were dominated by celebrity-branded perfume and nail polish in the US and Europe, while Avon’s $11bn came mainly from make-up and skin products in emerging markets.But Mr Becht stressed how little Coty knew about the extent of Avon’s troubles, which have included disgruntled sales representatives, slumping US sales, order fulfilment problems in Brazil and bribery allegations in China being probed by US regulators.He said he would not go hostile by making an offer direct to investors and snubbing Avon’s board, because that would leave Coty unable to get answers to vital questions from the company. “We could be off by miles in terms of our assumptions, so without thorough due diligence it’s just not possible.”Mr Becht became Coty chairman in November after more than a decade leading Reckitt Benckiser, the household products group.This week Mr Becht said at least 25 per cent of Avon’s shares had changed hands, as many retail investors and some buy-and-hold institutions sold their stock while hedge funds waded in.“We need to let it settle down a bit,” he said. “We will start talking to shareholders probably not next week, but the week after.”Avon shares on Friday stood at $23.42, above Coty’s $23.25 offer, a sign that Wall Street expects Coty to raise its bid or, more improbably, a rival bidder to make a counter offer.Before the bid Avon shares had fallen 30 per cent in the previous 12 months while the US market rose more than 5 per cent.Mr Becht said Coty would be willing to raise its offer in a letter on Monday to Andrea Jung, Avon’s chairman, who the board is looking to replace as chief executive.But he told the FT that unless Avon allows Coty to look at its books and talk to its executives: “It is very difficult for us to adjust the price, up or down, because we’re missing very material, critical pieces of information.”Avon said: “The board has been clear that it carefully considered the indication of interest and concluded that it was an opportunistic approach that fails to reflect the full value of the company.”
64;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-04-02T22:36:36Z;Avon rejects $10bn offer from Coty;;"Avon Products has rejected an unsolicited $10bn cash offer from Coty, the privately owned US fragrance group, as the door-to-door cosmetics seller seeks to stay independent while searching for a new chief executive and grappling with financial and legal troubles.Coty said it did not intend to make a hostile offer direct to Avon investors, but opinion among analysts was divided on whether its move would attract other suitors and spark a bidding war. Coty is led by Bart Becht, former chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, who became Coty’s chairman in NovemberAvon reported poor results in the final quarter of last year and is being investigated by regulators over bribery allegations and its contacts with financial analysts. It is looking for a replacement for Andrea Jung, chief executive, who said in December she was ready to step down after 12 years.“With no clear CEO candidate at this point – being fairly rudderless – Avon has fewer options than other companies in a similar situation,” said Lauren Lieberman, analyst at Barclays Capital.By going public with his offer, Mr Becht is performing a so-called bearhug manoeuvre that is designed to encourage shareholders to put pressure on a target company’s board to negotiate, but stops short of taking a hostile offer direct to investors.Coty, which has annual sales of $4.5bn and produces fragrances for celebrities including Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé Knowles, made its approach public on Monday to alert Avon’s shareholders to the move. It said three previous approaches to Avon last month had been rebuffed.Avon, which had sales last year of $11bn, rejected the bid within an hour, saying it was “opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon’s shareholders”. Avon has struggled to solve management and financial problems in the US and Brazil, its two biggest markets by sales.The offer marks a potential bright spot in a quiet year so far for dealmaking. Global merger and acquisition volumes in the first quarter were down almost 35 per cent on the first three months of last year and fell about 15 per cent from the already-quiet fourth quarter, according to Mergermarket.Avon’s troubles began more than three years before it said last December that it was looking for a new chief executive to replace Andrea Jung, write Helen Thomas and Kara Scannell.In the summer of 2008, Avon launched an internal investigation of its adherence to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in China, the US law which forbids bribery of officials overseas to win or retain business.The direct-marketing company said later that year it had contacted the US Securities and Exchange Commission
and Department of Justice. Both began investigations. The probes have since expanded to payments made in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, India and else­-where and now includes fees paid in the 1990s, a person with knowledge of the matter said.In 2010, Avon suspended four executives in relation to the probe.The group earns almost half of its revenues in Latin America and another fifth from emerging Europe and Asia – desirable growth markets. Avon’s woes were compounded in 2011 when it reported weaker than expected sales and operational problems in Brazil and Russia.Last October, Avon revealed a second SEC investigation into the company. It said it had received a subpoena requesting information relating to the company’s communications with financial analysts as part of an inquiry into selective disclosure. Ms Jung’s resignation followed two months later.Avon’s US sales have fallen in each of the past 14 quarters and the group reported a loss of $400,000 in the three months to December 31 due to a writedown.Ali Dibadj, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said of the proposed deal: “It’s certainly odd because Coty is smaller than Avon, but makes sense from a strategic perspective. Avon is [strong in] emerging markets while Coty is in developed markets; [Avon] is colour and skin, while Coty is fragrance and nail.”Avon derives more than two-thirds of its revenues from emerging markets, in spite of recent problems with its order management and supply chain in Brazil, while at Coty the figure is only 26 per cent.Coty said its proposed offer of $23.25 a share was a premium of 27 per cent more than Avon shares’ three-month volume-weighted average price.Shares in Avon rose 15.9 per cent to $22.43, below the offer price, suggesting scepticism among investors that Coty will be able to put pressure on its target’s board. Recipients of an unsolicited bid often see their stock trade through the offer price, as investors eye an improved offer down the road.Ms Lieberman at Barclays Capital said the offer “firmly puts Avon in play”. However, Victoria Collin, analyst at Atlantic Equities, was sceptical. “It’s down to Coty themselves to raise the bid and gain board approval,” she said.Coty is 80 per cent owned by Joh. A Benckiser, the German holding company of the Benckiser family, and is a former subsidiary of Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group. Mr Becht was the most highly paid head of a FTSE 100 company until his retirement last year as chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods group in which Joh. A Benckiser holders a 16 per cent stake.Avon is facing an investigation into bribery allegations involving its Chinese business as well as a regulatory probe into its contacts with financial analysts.Coty said it had “held extensive discussions with its financing sources about obtaining the debt and equity financing necessary to complete this transaction, and is confident that such financing will be available”.Coty’s advisers are JPMorgan, Blackstone and BDT, a firm founded by Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs partner known as Warren Buffett’s favourite banker. Avon is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview."
65;COTY;Coty Inc;2012-04-02T18:04:19Z;Coty can’t resist the call of Avon;;"It reads like a hostile bidder’s dream team: David Beckham on attack; and R&B songstress Beyoncé Knowles hitting the high notes.Coty can only hope it is. The privately owned company behind branded perfumes from celebrities including David Beckham, Beyoncé Knowles and Kylie Minogue has launched an unsolicited bid for Avon, its US peer that has so far shunned its overtures.The bid is bold. Avon, with sales of $11bn, is more than double the size of Coty. But Bart Becht, chairman of the board of directors of Coty and leader of the bid, is no stranger to ambitious and transformational deals.As chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser – a partial stablemate of Coty in Joh. A Benckiser, a family holding company based in Luxembourg – Mr Becht ran the household and personal goods company from its merger in 1999 until he stepped down last year.Such was investors’ faith in Mr Becht, who oversaw a number of acquisitions and consistently outpaced his competitors, that news of his departure wiped almost £2bn off Reckitt’s market value.Yet Avon could prove a bigger nut to crack. It has far greater reach into emerging markets, which account for 68 per cent of revenues. The fact that a relatively meagre quarter of Coty’s revenues come from these markets is as much a challenge as it is an attraction, say analysts.“Even though this deal would make sense in terms of synergies and growth potential there are challenges, and they are quite big challenges,” says Oru Mohiuddin, senior company analyst in beauty and personal care at Euromonitor, the data consultancy.“If they don’t think these through properly they may very well swallow something that they are not able to digest.”The challenges include integrating two very different sales models – Coty sells through retailers, Avon famously sells directly through agents – as well as serving distinctive geographies.Coty is undeterred. Its products may not be available in these markets due to lack of infrastructure but they “already have good levels of awareness”, as Mr Becht put it in a letter to Avon.“Distribution of appealing Coty mass beauty brands via Avon’s door-to-door distribution channel will therefore create new and attractive growth and earnings opportunities for ‘Avon-Coty’ and its 6.4m account representatives,” he wrote.Coty itself has an impressive record on M&A. In November 2010 it bought nailcare company OPI Products and beauty company Philosophy, both for about $1bn, and Dr Scheller Cosmetics of Germany. The following month it paid $400m for China’s TJoy Holdings.It acquired the perfume licences for a clutch of designers, including Calvin Klein, from Unilever in 2005. Coty paid the consumer goods conglomerate $800m, or roughly 1.3 times the previous year’s sales.Such deals have made Coty the world’s 12th biggest beauty company based on retail sales according to Euromonitor, and belie its humble origins as a perfumer started by a Corsican orphan in Paris in 1904.While Coty has grown 7 per cent per year on a like-for-like basis for the past two years, according to the company, it has flunked some targets. Speaking to the FT in 2008, Bernd Beetz, chief executive, said the group was targeting sales in excess of $5bn by 2010; but at $4.5bn current sales remain below that level.The strategy has also seemed confused, swinging between a desire for local products and international ones – such as celebrity perfumes – that can be marketed across the globe.Hence it sold its Chinese business Yue-sai, formed as a joint venture in 1996, to L’Oréal. But some six years later in 2010 it took a $400m step back into local cosmetics in the country by taking a majority stake in TJoy Holdings.The acquisitive Coty is itself no stranger to being passed around different owners. It was bought by Pfizer in 1963 and, nearly three decades later, by Benckiser Consumer Products, the US arm of Joh. A. Benckiser.It remains there today, alongside other assets held by the family members of Johann Benckiser. These include a 15.7 per cent stake in Reckitt Benckiser, manufacturer of Finish dishwashing tablets and Nurofen painkillers.More recently, the family firm bought shoe brands Bally International and Jimmy Choo in two separate deals through its Labelux Group, which plans further luxury acquisitions.Ironically, it was luxury that proved the original Coty’s downfall, when buyers baulked at pricey perfumes in the wake of the Great Depression.That may provide a clue to the latest deal. This time round, depressed consumers cover less than half the globe. Brazilians, Russians and Indians are more likely to answer the door when Avon comes calling and stump up for the latest celebrity-endorsed bottle of scented water."
