Does that seem fair to you?”Constellation Brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We’re about to see the unimaginable in terms of an economic, legal and institutional crisis,” said Juan Francisco Torres Landa, a trade lawyer and partner at Hogan Lovells. “A bullet in the brain would be less damaging than what they’re doing.”Mr López Obrador, who has admitted his cabinet was split on the issue, insists the people are “wise”.“Of course we care about investment and . . . job creation but we have to take account of the will of the people and protect our natural resources. It’s not a case of growth for growth’s sake,” he said.Opposition to the facility had centred on its proposed water use in a semi-desert area. The brewery was given the thumbs down even though the voting slip told residents that the plant would spur economic development and jobs, that it was limited to only using 0.2 per cent of the total water in the region and that Constellation Brands had committed to additional investment in water management and replacement.The result means the group will not be granted water permits “and the government will immediately contact the company about compensation”, said Diana Alvarez, interior ministry under-secretary.Voter turnout of 36,781 was a fraction of the 1m population of Mexicali. Ms Alvarez said 76.1 per cent opposed the project compared with 23.2 per cent who voted in favour.Constellation Brands, which is headquartered in New York state, has said it needed the new plant to meet US demand. More than half of its 9,000 workers are in Mexico and it has invested $9bn in six years and created 32,000 direct or indirect jobs in the country, Daniel Baima, president of Constellation Brands Mexico, told the president in a letter earlier this month appealing for the project to go ahead.

Industry executives say spiked or “hard” seltzer taps into 20 and 30-somethings’ desires for healthier drinking options with fewer calories and carbohydrates, and little in the way of artificial ingredients and colourings. It is also further evidence of the shrinking appeal to this age group of mass-market beer, which has been losing share in the US for years. Analysts at UBS expect spiked seltzer as a category to grow rapidly from $550m this year to reach $2.1bn in three years. The say White Claw currently has 53 per cent of market share by value, followed by Boston Beer’s Truly with 31 per cent.Now some of the world’s biggest beer companies are scrambling to respond with their own products.Constellation Brands said it would roll out a Corona-branded alcoholic seltzer in four flavours next year, including tropical lime and mango, while MillerCoors is already selling Henry’s Hard Sparkling Water. Dozens of craft breweries have also launched hard seltzers this year. Anheuser-Busch InBev and Constellation Brands admitted that summer beer sales were hurt by the seltzer craze. AB InBev said it lost 0.85 percentage points of market share in the third quarter in the US, its biggest market, largely for this reason. Nevertheless, AB InBev chief executive Carlos Brito said the emergence of spiked seltzer was good for the brewer of Budweiser and Bud Light in the long run, and allowed it to appeal to different types of customers.The company’s three-year-old Bon & Viv brand is marketed to women in their 30s, while the more recently launched Natural Light Seltzer uses a well-known light beer brand to appeal to more price-conscious young men. A seltzer version of Bud Light is planned for early next year. “Spiked seltzer is very positive for us and the industry because it’s a growing, very profitable category that is bringing in new customers,” said Mr Brito. He shrugged off the idea that AB InBev was playing catch-up to White Claw and Truly: “It’s like craft beer was ten years ago, we came from behind in that market too and caught up. We have similarly big ambitions for seltzer.” Spiked seltzer is so far a largely US phenomenon, although a few small brands have popped up in the UK, such as Balans and Bodega Bay. But analysts expect that the big beer companies will eventually bring the product to international markets and that it would appeal to consumers in other mature beer markets such as the UK and Australia. AB InBev said it was studying international expansion, but had no firm plans.Sanjiv Gajiwala, a marketing executive at White Claw, declined to say whether the company was looking to launch abroad. “Our number one objective is to supply the US market where we’ve had shortages for the past year or so,” he said. But the company has been registering the brand in various countries, including the UK. One hurdle in Europe is that people do not use the word seltzer for fizzy water, so there might be initial confusion over the product, said Caroline Levy, an analyst at Macquarie investment bank. But the increasing popularity of ready-to-drink cocktails in cans means that the concept is likely to travel well, especially once big beer companies with international distribution put their marketing muscle behind it.James Watson, an analyst at Rabobank, said it was obvious that the big beer companies would want a slice of the growth. “It’s a totally new category that is not weighed down by past associations with beer, so you have a new ability to brand it to both men and women,” he explained. “For beer giants, that’s a win.”

Licences are granted on a prescription-by-prescription basis only.Paul Steckler, managing director of Canopy’s European business, said the MHRA licence and Canopy’s ability to store the drug in bulk will mean that it could send cannabis products out the next day, as it does in Germany where medical cannabis has been legal since 2017.The Canopy announcement comes a week after analysts at Jefferies downgraded its shares from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’, citing poor customer feedback on its main products and high levels of inventory on the balance sheet suggesting a lack of demand.Canopy’s Buckinghamshire warehouse, which is in a secret location for security reasons, can store enough cannabis to supply 5,000 patients a month. However, the strict regulations mean that only 1,765 prescriptions have been issued since last November.The company’s share price rose more than 2,700 per cent from its flotation in 2014 to highs in October 2018 as the wider market soared. It has since fallen more than 65 per cent as investors have become concerned about its ability to deliver profits.Shareholders were further spooked by the sudden departure of co-founder and chief executive Bruce Linton in July. Mr Steckler said the company was now in “phase two, where we’re more focused on driving revenue and profitability”. In August, Canopy said it would first turn a profit in 2022. Rival Aurora expects to become profitable next year.Canopy is backed by Constellation Brands, the maker of Corona beer, which owns a 35 per cent stake. Mr Steckler said Canopy was “not even looking” at recreational cannabis opportunities in Europe. “It’s enough of a challenge getting product to patient where it is actually legal,” he said.Canadian group Tilray was the first company to import medicinal cannabis into the UK, while British start-up Grow Biotech was the first to import it in bulk.This article has been amended to reflect that Canopy is the first company allowed to import medicinal cannabis directly into its own UK facility.

It also marked down $839m in the value of its investments in the company.“Canopy’s business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will probably be volatile as they continue to focus on their paths to profitability,” said chief financial officer David Klein, on the company’s earnings call.Constellation shares fell as much as 7.6 per cent before trimming their losses to trade 5 per cent lower and eyeing their worst one-day showing in four months.In July, Canopy parted ways with co-chief executive Bruce Linton and announced a management shake-up a month after Constellation said that while it was happy with its investment in the company, it was not pleased with Canopy’s results. The company has invested heavily in Canopy as traditional makers of beers and spirits look to what they believe is the next big market for consumers seeking a buzz.In an effort to lure customers the company also said it was pushing into the alcoholic seltzer business, which has seen “aggressive growth”, under the Corona brand. The Corona hard seltzers will come in four flavours, including tropical wine, mango, cherry and blackberry lime“The refreshment characteristics of Seltzer’s perfectly matched Corona refreshment DNA,” said chief executive William Newlands.Constellation swung to a net loss of $525.2m in the three months ended in August, from a profit of $1.15bn in the year ago quarter. That translated to a net loss of $2.77 a share compared with a profit of $5.41 a share in the year ago quarter. However, adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of $2.72 a share, ahead of expectations for $2.60.Still, Constellation’s beer business, which includes Corona and Modelo, performed well with sales rising 7.4 per cent from a year ago to $1.64bn. However, its wine and spirits business, which includes Svedka Vodka and Mondavi wines, continued to disappoint, with sales down 8.9 per cent from a year ago to $703.6m.Looking ahead, the company said it expects adjusted fiscal 2020 earnings of between $9 to $9.20 a share, excluding Canopy, up from its previous outlook for earnings of between $8.65 to $8.95 a share.Constellation shares were up 29 per cent year-to-date as of Wednesday’s close.
4;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2019-10-03T17:32:15Z;Constellation/Canopy: herbal strife;Brewer laid low by cannabis business ;Pot and beer may seem like a sure fire way to get high. But in the case of Constellation Brands, its bet on Canadian cannabis farmer Canopy Growth is leaving investors with a massive downer.The US-based brewer of Corona beer is slashing the fair value of its 38 per cent stake in Canopy for the second time this year. It said on Thursday it was taking a $839m charge for the weed producer. This follows the $828m reduction Constellation disclosed during its first-quarter earnings in June.Constellation transformed over the past decade from a boxed-wine seller into a $38bn beverage giant. It then went looking for a different kind of thrill. It decided to add a hit of marijuana to its portfolio of beer, wine and liquor brands. It has invested about C$5.2bn ($3.9bn) in Canopy since 2017.In hindsight, Constellation should have stuck with what it knew best: booze. Weed stocks, after a meteoric rise last year, have mostly struggled to live up to the hype. Canopy’s shares are down some 55 per cent over the past 12 months. It booked a C$1.3bn loss in its latest quarter.This has translated into a near $500m loss on Constellation’s books. Between this and the writedown, Constellation was forced to sharply lower its earnings guidance on Thursday. It expects full-year earnings to come in at between 55-75 cents a share. That compares to the $4.95 and $5.25 range it gave just three months ago. Its shares are no longer good value at 23 times forward earnings. The Canopy writedown was a low point in an otherwise strong quarter for Constellation. Outside its weed investment, Constellation’s core beer business still fizzes. The unit, which accounted for around 85 per cent of operating profits last year, has been bucking the industry trend of sliding volumes thanks to the popularity of its Mexican beer offerings: Corona, Modelo and Pacifico.After rallying over a fifth this year, Constellation’s valuation looks heady given the hangover to come from Canopy.
5;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2019-07-03T12:23:05Z;Cannabis group Canopy announces management shake-up;Co-chief executive to stand down as board seeks leader for ‘next phase of growth’;Canadian weed producer Canopy Growth on Wednesday said Bruce Linton, who helped grow the world’s largest publicly traded marijuana company, will step down as co-chief executive effective immediately.Mark Zekulin will now become the sole CEO of Canopy and he will work with the board to “identify a new leader to guide the company in its next phase of growth”. The search will include both internal and external candidates.“Creating Canopy Growth began with an abandoned chocolate factory and a vision,” said Mr Linton. “The board decided today, and I agreed, my turn is over.”He added: “Mark has been my partner since this Company began and has played an integral role in Canopy’s success. While change is never easy, I have full confidence in the team at Canopy — from Mark and Rade [Kovacevic’s] leadership to the full suite of leadership — as we progress through this transition and into the future.”Corona beer maker Constellation Brands has invested heavily in Canopy as traditional makers of beers and spirits look to what they believe is the next big market for consumers seeking a buzz.However, Constellation said last month that while it is “happy” with its investment in the “cannabis space and its long-term potential”, it is “not pleased with Canopy’s recent reported year-end results”. Canopy reported a bigger than expected loss in its most recent quarter.Canopy has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2013 to boast a market capitalisation of C$18.1bn (about $14bn) and last month said it would buy US company Acreage in a $3.4bn deal, contingent on the US legalising marijuana at the federal level.Canada has already legalised recreational marijuana use and while pot is still illegal under US federal law, 10 states and the District of Columbia have approved recreational (and medical) marijuana use in the US. Twenty-three states have legalised medical marijuana.Interest in the pot industry has surged with venture capital investments in the cannabis market hitting a record high in the first five months of 2019. The US cannabis market saw $1.26bn through 80 deals by mid-May, according to data from a report by MGO and Ello, a cannabis investment banking and advisory firm.Canopy on Wednesday also said Mr Kovacevic, a member of the team leading Canadian operations and strategy for its recreational arm, will assume the role of president.US-listed shares in Canopy, which are up nearly 50 per cent year-to-date, were down more than 7 per cent to $37.35 in pre-market trade. Constellation Brands shares were down 1.1 per cent to $196.51.
6;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2019-06-28T14:08:48Z;Solid beer sales drive guidance upgrade for Constellation Brands;;Constellation Brands boosted its adjusted earnings forecast for 2020 after strong demand for beer, particularly its Modelo brand and higher-end Corona offerings, helped the company top Wall Street’s quarterly sales estimates.That helped push shares up almost 14 per cent in early trade on Friday, as investors looked past a decline in wine and spirits sales and a swing to a net loss for the first quarter.Victor, New York-based Constellation said it expected reported earnings in the range of $4.95 to $5.25 a share, down from previous guidance of $8.47 to $8.77 a share, and stemming from equity losses on its investment in cannabis group Canopy Growth. The company reported earnings of $17.57 a share in fiscal 2019.Adjusted earnings, excluding the impact of Canopy, were bumped up to $8.65 to $8.95 a share in 2020, an increase of 15 cents at both ends of the range compared to previous guidance.Constellation held steady its forecasts for net sales and operating income for its beer division to increase between 7 per cent and 9 per cent, but also said it now expected a shallower decline in sales for wine and spirits.For the first quarter ended May 31, net sales increased 2.4 per cent from a year ago to $2.1bn, and above the median estimate of $2.07bn among analysts in a Refinitiv survey.Within its main divisions, net sales of beer rose 7.4 per cent from a year ago, while sales of wine and spirits fell 7.8 per cent. In April, Constellation agreed to sell about 30 lower-end brands from its wine and spirits portfolio for $1.7bn in an effort to focus on premium drinkers.Bill Newlands, chief executive, said he was pleased with the company’s start to the year. “Our wine and spirits transformation strategy is working . . . In addition, our iconic beer portfolio continues to be a cornerstone of growth in the US beer industry driven by double-digit growth for Modelo Especial and Corona Premier.”Constellation swung to a net loss of $1.30 a share in the first quarter, which it said would have been a profit of $2.40 a share if not for equity losses related to Canopy Growth. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.21 a share, higher than the median market forecast of $2.04.Constellation shares were up 5.7 per cent in early trade on Friday morning at a one-month high, having pulled back from a gain of as much as 13.7 per cent. The stock is up 23.7 per cent in 2019.
7;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2019-04-03T21:30:40Z;Corona maker to shed 30 low-end wine and spirits brands in $1.7bn deal;;Constellation Brands is refocusing to go after premium drinkers as it agreed on Wednesday to sell about 30 price-conscious brands from its wine and spirits portfolio for $1.7bn.The New York-based brewer of Corona and Modelo beers said it signed an agreement with E & J Gallo Winery to divest 30 brands such as Estancia, Ravenswood and Clos du Bois that have a retail value of about $11 a bottle and below, along with related facilities in California, New York and Washington.“One of the hallmarks of our success over the years has been our ability to evolve and stay on the forefront of emerging consumer trends,” said Bill Newlands, chief executive at Constellation Brands. “This decision will help enhance organisational focus on a more premium set of wine and sprits brands that better position our company to drive accelerate growth and shareholder value.”That leaves Constellation’s wine and spirits portfolio with more upmarket wine brands like Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine, Meiomi, Ruffino and Svedka Vodka. Its portfolio also includes high-end brands like Schrader Cellars, Mount Veeder Winery and High West Whiskey, among others.The deal comes after Constellation in February said it was looking to sell a chunk of the low end of its wine and spirits portfolio, noting that “consumers are trading up” and “the fun is in the high ends”.Constellation has also splashed nearly $4bn to lift its stake in Canadian pot producer Canopy Growth to 38 per cent as it pushes into the hot marijuana market, which is taking off thanks to the spreading legalisation of weed.The transaction is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approval, and is expected to close at the end of its first quarter of fiscal 2020.Constellation Brands shares, which are up nearly 12 per cent year-to-date, were down 0.4 per cent in after-hours trade to $178.99.
8;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2019-01-09T15:16:35Z;Side effects: Marijuana bet prompts Constellation to cut profit outlook;;Constellation Brands’ bet on Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth is leaving investors feeling low.Shares in the Corona brewer tumbled more than 10 per cent on Wednesday after it cut its full-year profit outlook, citing higher interest costs related to last year’s investment in Canopy.The US’s third-largest beer company said it now expects earnings per share for the year to come in between $9.20 and $9.30 on an adjusted basis, a sharp leg down from its previous forecast of $9.60 to $9.75 per share and missing analysts’ expectations of $9.43 a share.Constellation splashed nearly $4bn last August to lift its stake in Canopy to 38 per cent in a push to capitalise on the spreading legalisation of cannabis in Canada and in the US.The deal was financed with debt and Constellation said on Wednesday that interest expenses of around $55m are expected to shave 25 cents off its earnings for the year.The surprise guidance cut come as the beer giant also reported a slump in third-quarter profit.While revenue for the three months to end of November 30 were up 9 per cent at $1.97bn thanks to soaring demand for Modelo and Corona beers, net income came in at $303.1m, a 36 per cent decline from the year ago period.Profit was hit by higher costs for everything from transport to aluminium, which knocked operating margin down 60 basis points to 37.3 per cent during the quarter.Shares in Canopy, which fell by more than a fifth during the quarter, also resulted in a $164m paper loss for Constellation and further weighed on the beer group’s bottom line.Stripping out this out, net income came in at $2.37 per diluted share, topping the $2.06 per share expected by analysts.
9;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
10;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2018-10-17T22:02:31Z;CEO of beer giant Constellation Brands to step down;;Constellation Brands announced Rob Sands will be stepping down from his role as chief executive at the brewer behind Corona beer.His successor, Bill Newlands, will be the first outsider to run the family-controlled company, which is also known for its wines — of both the bottled and boxed variety — and has more recently turned its attention to marijuana.Mr Newlands, who joined the company in 2015 and has been chief operating officer since 2017, takes the reins on March 1, 2019. On that same date, Mr Sands will assume the role of executive chairman from his brother Richard, who will become executive vice-chairman.“Bill has made a significant impact on our company, finding ways to leverage our unique capabilities as a leading total beverage alcohol provider to meet consumers’ evolving needs and accelerate growth,” Rob Sands said in a statement “Bill understands what it takes to succeed in this rapidly evolving market and he’s the right person to lead our company going forward.”One of tasks Mr Newlands will face is navigating Constellation’s foray into the nascent marijuana market, which is taking off thanks to the spreading legalisation of weed, and has prompted a number of traditional food and beverage companies to explore tie-ups with pot producers.In August, Constellation splashed nearly $4bn to lift its stake in Canadian pot producer Canopy Growth to 38 per cent thanks, having taken an initial 10 per cent slice last year. Earlier this month, Constellation raised its outlook for adjusted earnings in fiscal 2019, even before taking into account any benefits from its investment from Canopy. The departure of Mr Sands also continues a recent trend of management turnover among major US food and beverage groups. Indra Nooyi stepped down as chief executive of PepsiCo at the start of this month, while several companies including Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, Mondelez International, Hershey and Starbucks have all replaced their chief executives since the start of 2017. Campbell Soup, whose bet on fresh food failed to improve its fortunes, is still looking for a new chief.
11;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Corona beer maker lifts earnings outlook;;Constellation Brands, the beer maker betting on the marijuana market, on Thursday raised its full-year earnings outlook and posted upbeat second quarter sales driven by strong demand for its Modelo and Corona brews.The company raised its outlook for adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings to a range of $9.60 to $9.75 a share, up from $9.40 to $9.70 previously. This excludes benefits from its additional $4bn investment in Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth in August.The rosy outlook accompanied upbeat quarterly sales, which jumped 10.1 per cent from a year ago to $2.3bn. That topped analyst expectations for $2.25bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts.Beer sales grew 10.5 per cent from a year ago — with the company noting that its business was the biggest share gainer in the US beer industry — while wine sales were up 9.3 per cent.Net income more than doubled to $1.15bn, or $5.41 a share, in the three months ended in August, up from $501.6m, or $2.30 a share, in the quarter last year. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.87 a share topped expectations for $2.59 a share.“The double digit EPS growth we delivered in the second quarter is top-tier for consumer product companies,” said chief executive Rob Sands.“Constellation remains the high-end leader and the most significant growth contributor in the US beer market, and we’re seeing strong growth trends for the super-premium plus segment of our wine portfolio.”Constellation has doubled down on its bet on the emerging cannabis market, boosting its stake in Canopy Growth in August, as more than a dozen countries have legalised medical marijuana and several others are evaluating decriminalising weed consumption. While it is still illegal under US federal law, nine states have approved recreational use.A number of beverage groups have been exploring this market, with Coca-Cola saying last month it is examining the market for cannabis-related products amid slowing consumption of its core range of soft drinks.Constellation Brand shares, which were down nearly 8 per cent year-to-date as of Wednesday’s market close, were up 4 per cent in pre-market trade.

However, a spokesperson for the Atlanta-based company told the FT that no decision had been taken about a deal yet.The report also lifted other pot stocks. US-listed shares in Tilray were up 6.8 per cent at pixel time. Shares in Green Organic Dutchman climbed as much as 7.7 per cent before paring back its gains to trade 3.5 per cent higher.

Diageo has also been exploring investment opportunities in the sector.
13;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2018-08-15T11:45:52Z;Constellation spends $4bn to lift stake in cannabis group Canopy;Brewer of Corona doubles down on its bet on marijuana ahead of Canadian legalisation;Corona beer maker Constellation Brands doubled down on its bet on the budding marijuana industry, pumping just under $4bn into a Canadian group that has sought to capitalise on the spreading legalisation of weed.The company said it would buy 104.5m shares of Canopy Growth at C$48.60 apiece, lifting its stake to 38 per cent. The investment, which also includes warrants that could lead to it increasing its stake by a further $3.4bn, follows Constellation’s acquisition of 10 per cent of Canopy last year.The transaction between Constellation and Canopy is the latest in a wave of pot deals, as traditional makers of beer and spirits eye what they believe is the next big market where consumers will get their buzz. Smaller marijuana companies have also agreed to a string of tie-ups, each trying to establish a lead in the rapidly expanding business.The deal comes roughly two months before Canada legalises recreational cannabis use on October 17. More than a dozen countries have legalised weed for medical purposes, including Germany and Australia, and several others are evaluating decriminalisation.While pot is still illegal under US federal law, more than half of the 50 states have legalised its medical use. Nine states, including California, Colorado and Massachusetts, as well as Washington DC have approved recreational marijuana. Analysts with Arcview and BDS Analytics expect global cannabis spending to reach $32bn in 2022, up from $9.5bn last year.This was the right move and further solidifies Constellation’s first-mover advantage as many of the major brewers are now pursuing cannabis as a potential growth driver“This is really rocket fuel,” Bruce Linton, Canopy chief executive, said of the investment by Constellation. “I don’t think it’s appreciated yet how quickly things are opening up in Europe, Latin America, and even likely the US.”Constellation described the investment as the “largest to date in the cannabis space”, which it hopes will offset stagnant beer sales in key markets such as North America. Rob Sands, chief executive of the $39bn beverage group, said he saw a “tremendous growth opportunity” in the cannabis market.“We look forward to supporting Canopy as they extend their recognised global leadership position in the medical and recreational cannabis space,” he added.The investment has already paid off for Constellation — even before Canada’s recreational marijuana sales begin. In June, the brewer reported a healthy rise in profits thanks in part to its Canopy stake.Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said she would not be surprised if Constellation eventually acquired all of Canopy. If Constellation exercises all of the warrants it has received as part of Wednesday’s deal, its ownership would top 50 per cent.“This was the right move and further solidifies Constellation’s first-mover advantage as many of the major brewers are now pursuing cannabis as a potential growth driver,” Ms Herzog said. “While there could be some cannibalisation risk for Constellation’s beer [and] alcohol portfolio, we believe the strategic partnership will ultimately be incremental to [its] core business.”Consolidation in the industry is up more than fourfold from 2017, with deals worth more than $8bn agreed this year, according to Dealogic. That includes several acquisitions by Canopy, as well as Aurora Cannabis’s $2bn takeover of MedReleaf in May, which was the largest deal in the industry at the time.Canopy’s New York-listed shares jumped more than 20 per cent to $30.95, giving the company a market valuation of $6.6bn, while its stock traded in Toronto climbed to C$39.58 by mid-afternoon. Constellation shares dropped 7 per cent to $205.50.
14;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2018-06-29T17:08:16Z;Pot, not beer, provides an earnings hit for Constellation;;For once, it was not Mexican beer sales that added fizz to Constellation Brands’ quarterly earnings. Instead, it was the beer giant’s investment in a Canada cannabis group that provided the high.Constellation took a nearly 10 per cent stake in Canopy Growth last October. Since then, shares in Canopy have more than tripled in the run-up to Canada’s decision to legalise pot this month. That investment generated a paper gain of $258m for Constellation in the three months to end of June and helped drive net income to $743.8m, up from $398.5m during the same quarter last year.Stripping out that and gains from an asset disposal, net income came in at $2.20 per diluted share, a 5 per cent drop from the prior year period and below the $2.44 a share that Wall Street was expecting.Constellation took in over $2bn in sales during the quarter, a 6 per cent rise from last year, as the company continues to ride the wave of demand for Corona and Modelo beers. However, profits took a hit as rising costs for everything from transport to aluminium, ate into operating margins, which fell 230 basis points during the period.Shares in Constellation, which hit a record high of $236.62 earlier in April, were down 3.8 per cent on Friday.
15;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Corona brewer shares hit record high after profit jump, guidance lift;;Shares in Corona-owner Constellation Brands were fizzing on Thursday, opening at a new record high after the US brewer delivered better-than-expected second quarter earnings and raised its guidance for the year.Net income at the beer group climbed 39 per cent to $499.5m in the three months to August helped by bumper sales of its Mexican Modelo brand over the key summer selling season. Margin gains from its breweries during the peak production period, favourable selling prices and foreign currency benefits also pushed up earnings.Reported earnings per share reached $2.48 in the group’s second quarter, prompting the group to boost its full year earnings outlook for the second time in less than four months. It now expects full year comparable earnings per share to be a range of $8.25 to $8.40, up from previous guidance in June of $7.90 to $8.10.The New York-based company has ridden a wave of enthusiasm for high-end beer, where Constellation’s business drove more than 60 per cent of the category’s growth in the latest quarter, it said. It expanded its portfolio, which also includes Pacifico beer, with the acquisition of Florida-based craft beer maker Funky Buddha.Shares climbed as much as 6 per cent from Wednesday’s close, hitting $213.4 dollars per share. Constellation’s shares are up more than 500 per cent over the past five years.Sales in the beer division, which accounts for two thirds of total sales at the group, rose 13 per cent in the latest quarter. That more than offset declines in the wine and spirits portfolio, which includes the Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and SVEDKA vodka brands. Total net sales increased 3 per cent to $2.085bn.
16;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Corona owner’s shares hit record high after strong results;;Strong demand for premium beers helped US brewer Constellation Brands deliver another quarter of frothy profit growth and prompted investors to bid up the stock to a record high on Thursday.The company, best known for Mexican imports like Modelo and Corona, saw its shares climb as much as 7.5 per cent to a new lifetime high of $197.41 after it cruised past expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings and raised its outlook for the year.New York-based Constellation said it now expected earnings per share of between $7.90-$8.10 for the 2018 fiscal year ending February 28 on a comparable basis, up from its previous guidance of $7.70-$8.00 as the company also benefits from falling hops and grains prices.“We’re off to a great start for our new fiscal year,” said chief executive Rob Sands. “Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays led to significant share gains.”The third-largest beer company in the US, Constellation, which boasts a market value of $38.bn, also imports Mexican beer Pacifico and owns winery Robert Mondavi and SVEDKA vodka.For the three months to end of May, net sales rose 3.4 per cent to $1.94bn — in line with forecasts. Beer sales, which account for nearly two-thirds of total group sales, rose 8 per cent during the quarter and helped offset a 4 per cent sales drop in its wine and spirits division.Net income jumped more than a quarter to $402.8m — ahead of of estimates for $392.8m — thanks to falling input costs and it had to make a smaller provision for income taxes.The results caps a stunning run for Constellation, which saw its shares sold off heavily back in the wake of Donald Trump’s election in November. Investors had been concerned that Mr Trump’s anti-Mexico rhetoric and protectionist stance would result in steep import tariffs being imposed on Mexican goods — including Corona beers.But with the White House proving to be more pragmatic than expected, shares in Constellation have rallied more than 33 per cent from their December lows.

19;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2016-10-26T18:34:04Z;Brewing: Craft beer comes of age;It is a bright spot in an otherwise stagnant sector. But is the market at ‘peak craft’?;"James Watt, co-founder of BrewDog, says he would rather “shoot himself in the head” than sell out to “big beer”. The imagery is extreme but there is no doubting the passion of the craft brewer from Aberdeen, who this year inserted a clause into the company’s rules to prevent a sale to “a monolithic purveyor of bland industrial beer”.It was a defensive move to ward off the attentions of the big brewers. But holdouts like Mr Watt have become rarer after multinational beer companies — including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors and Constellation Brands — have spent billions buying up smaller craft brewers in the US and Europe in recent years.The attraction is clear: the craft sector’s explosive 8 per cent compound growth over the past five years, according to Plato Logic, the market research group, has come largely at the expense of the big brewers’ mass production offerings like Budweiser and the Miller brands. Private equity has also sought a piece of the action with firms such as LNK Partners buying 15 per cent of Dogfish Head last year and Encore Capital acquiring Full Sail Brewing.Jean-François van Boxmeer, chief executive of Heineken, last month spelt out the potential for growth in the craft sector. “In the US, the craft market is 12 per cent of volume and more than that of profits . . .[But] you see it not only in the US and Europe,[craft is] also popping up in big cities in emerging countries like Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo or Mexico City. You see it in Shanghai, you see it everywhere.”The shift in tastes to local brews particularly in the US and Europe has led to an explosion of microbreweries over the past decade, while at the other end of the industry the large brewers have grown even bigger. The consolidation culminated this month with the completion of AB InBev’s £79bn takeover of SABMiller — the biggest beer deal ever — which highlighted the polarisation in an industry grappling with stagnant growth.In some ways, the backlash against lager-style, easy-to-drink beers represents a return to a brewing tradition dating back to the 1870s, rather than a break with the past. “Once upon a time, nearly all beer was beer with attitude — hoppy all-malt lagers, ales, wheat beers, Abbey beers, and stouts,” says Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Research. “Consumer preferences in the US and countries such as the UK, moved towards lighter styles of beer. Over time, tastes evolve and it seems inevitable that consumers would want to differentiate themselves from the mainstream.”The rapid rise of craft beer has changed the landscape of cities from Chicago to Denver, London and Dublin as microbreweries and tap rooms dominate the streets of hip neighbourhoods. Even dive bars and more conventional taverns can carry a vast range of beers.The $22bn craft sector represents 21 per cent of the value of the $106bn US beer market, according to the Brewers Association, up from just $8.8bn six years ago. As the craft sector squeezed the bigger brewers’ market share on one side, so did wine and spirits on the other. Muscling in on their smaller brewing rivals, whose beers command higher prices and greater margins, was the obvious place for big beer to shop for growth.AB InBev has been particularly acquisitive. After buying Chicago’s Goose Island in 2011 it has snapped up another 11 craft brewers in the past two years, ranging from Blue Point in New York to Elysian on the west coast in Seattle, and Camden Town Brewery in the UK. Molson Coors, which following SABMiller’s merger with AB InBev bought SAB’s stake in their MillerCoors venture, has acquired four craft breweries in the past year.Despite these deals, craft beer still accounts for just 1 per cent of AB InBev’s US volumes. But Goose Island is now the fifth-biggest contributor to the group’s overall volume growth in the US, according to Bernstein Research. Earlier this year, AB InBev chief executive Carlos Brito told investors that despite being one of the leaders in US craft beer “it is one [area] where we are under-represented”.Each time a craft brewer is bought out, there is an outpouring of grief and anger on social media from fans for whom craft is not only about taste but about the ethos of small, iconoclast microbrewery Davids against the Goliaths of the beer industry. When Jasper Cuppaidge, founder of Camden Town Brewery, announced the sale of the UK company best known for its Hells lagers, to AB InBev in December, one former fan tweeted: “What’s the going rate for a soul these days?”———–Indies go mainstream ISELECTED AB INBEV ACQUISITIONS: Goose Island Beer Co, Chicago, acquired March 2011; Blue Point Brewing Co, Long Island, New Jersey, February 2014; Elysian Brewing Company, Seattle, January 2015; Breckenridge Brewery, Colorado, December 2015; Camden Town Brewery, London, December 2015; Bosteels, Buggenhout, Belgium, September 2016———–It is an attitude BrewDog’s Mr Watt, who on Twitter calls himself a “dystopian puppet on a mission to save the world from bad beer” appreciates. He has been particularly critical of big beer’s cheque book invasion into craft brewing, accusing them of having “bastardised and commoditised beer over the past 50 years”.He refuses to stock brands brewed by companies bought out by larger corporations at the 44 bars his business owns. Under the ownership of a big multinational, the “beer might be OK for a while, maybe a year but ultimately the beer’s going to go downhill and the brewery becomes a pawn in these big mega-corporation games,” he says.Larry Bell, founder of Michigan-based Bell’s Brewery, one of the top 10 craft brewers in the US, has also resisted approaches from outside investors. He believes the takeovers — said to be worth close to $2.5bn globally — have sapped the soul of the industry as some breweries become more focused on the top line. The camaraderie among independent brewers also has been eroded, he says.Some have raised concerns over whether the quality of the beer and ingredients declines once a large company takes over.Benj Steinman, president of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication, thinks those fears are overblown. “I don’t think the big guys have screwed with the taste,” he says. “Actually, they’re trying pretty hard. They’re looking to invade the space, so looking to keep [their] craft brewers good at what they’re doing.”Some craft brewers believe they have found a halfway house where they can retain control but secure investment to boost their export operations. Having previously denounced rivals who sold their companies as “selling all of one’s best friend’s careers, their hearts, the portion of their lives they spent working for you”, Lagunitas’ founder Tony Magee last year sold half the brewer to Heineken for an unconfirmed amount, estimated by analysts at $500m.Mr Magee wanted to expand his export business and needed a partner with an extensive distribution network. He was also thinking about his brewery’s ownership when he retired, he explained in an extensive blog post. Twelve months on “nothing has changed”, says Karen Hamilton, spokesperson for Lagunitas, adding that it now exports to France, Denmark and Mexico, and will be shipping to Italy and other countries soon.“We were in overseas markets so we knew what we were up against” when it came to exporting without knowing the language or market, says Ms Hamilton. “We can do things so much faster now.”After years of strong growth, however, there are signs that the craft beer boom is maturing. Sales growth is slowing and M&A activity is cooling. Mr Bell, who intends to pass his business on to his children, says that at one point he was fielding inquiries from private equity groups twice a week but interest has died down. One analyst says that valuations are reaching a plateau.———–Indies go mainstream IIMILLERCOORS ACQUISITIONS: Hop Valley Brewing, Oregon, July 2016; Terrapin Beer Company, Athens, Georgia, August 2016.

There has also been a slowdown in the number of breweries opening. This year, Ibisworld, the research group, expects the total figure for the US to reach 4,114, a 6 per cent increase from 2015, which saw a 26.5 per cent increase. That compares with 1,512 establishments a decade ago.There are several reasons for the slowdown in craft beer. As the base gets bigger, a slower but more sustainable level of growth is inevitable, analysts say.The Brewers Association’s definition of craft beer will also have a short-term impact on the sales data as it disqualifies any group that is more than 25 per cent owned by a larger corporation from the category. That criteria has removed a number of the recent acquisitions from the sector.Some US markets may also be reaching saturation point. While craft beer only accounts for 12.2 per cent of the US beer market in volume terms, in certain cities, such as San Francisco or in areas of the Pacific Northwest, it has won as much as half of the entire market, according to Lagunitas.Craft brewers are also competing with other alcoholic drinks, such as bourbons and whiskies, that have equally compelling stories of local production and authenticity that attract drinkers. With per capita consumption of alcohol growing at very low levels and craft beer prices often relatively high, competition to win consumers is intense.Analysts expect craft beer sales to continue growing but at a more sustainable pace. However, says Euromonitor’s Mr Malandrakis, there will be casualties: “I expect slowly to start seeing many of them falling by the wayside. And I do expect that in the next couple of years, there will be loads of bargain stills and fermentation banks available on the second-hand market.”Many analysts, though, believe that even if the US industry has reached peak craft in the US, the brewers remain attractive targets for the multinationals. Consolidation between craft brewers — something that has already begun — is also expected to pick up pace.Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers’ Association, believes tie-ups between craft producers will provide a noble exit for founders who do not want to sell out to the large brewers.“We certainly have seen craft companies banding together,” he says, “forming partnerships, either through private equity or on their own to get scale purchasing.”That consolidation, say analysts, will leave the industry facing an existential dilemma. “If it becomes too big, then it is not craft any more,” says Euromonitor’s Mr Malandrakis, “that is the paradox at the core of the craft proposition.”Defining a sector that encompasses everything from Blind Pig IPA to Human Blockhead and Kilt Lifter is a difficult challenge.The clearest definition comes from the US Brewers Association, the trade body in the world’s largest craft brew market. To meet its criteria of craft, a beer must be produced from a small brewery — producing no more than 6m barrels (or 7m hectolitres) of beer a year. The brewery must be independent — it no longer qualifies as a craft brewer if 25 per cent or more is owned by a larger corporation. Finally, the ingredients and brewing methods must be largely traditional — the BA does not regard flavoured malt drinks as beer, for example.Plato Logic, the market research company that compiles beer industry statistics, stretched that definition when it developed what it calls a “craft-style” segment, within premium beers. This includes premium ales and speciality beers, such as wheat beers, whether brewed by a microbrewery or not. According to this definition, craft accounted for 3.2 per cent of the global beer market last year — 10.6 per cent in the US and 2.1 per cent in the rest of the world.In the UK, the rise of craft has led to turmoil over what type of brewer can join which type of industry group. The Society of Independent Brewers defines craft brewers in terms of size, independence and quality. “Breweries must be truly independent of any larger brewing interest, be producing less than 200,000 hectolitres per year, and agree to abide by SIBA’s Manual of Good Brewing Practice,” says Neil Walker, SIBA spokesperson.Meanwhile, the UK’s Campaign for Real Ale, representing breweries and pubs, is having an existential crisis. It was founded in 1971 to defend cask beer against cheap, fizzy products sold in kegs or cans. But a lot of craft beer is now sold in kegs and bottles. Camra is canvassing views from its members about its future."

21;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Constellation climbs on strong beer sales;S&P 500 moves back into positive territory for year so far;Constellation Brands’ stock gained 4.5 per cent as a rise in beer sales helped the US drinks company boost full-year earnings guidance and beat third-quarter earnings estimates.Constellation, known for its Corona and Modelo beers, reported net income of $222m or $1.10 a share in the three months ended November 30, compared with $211m or $1.07 a share in the year-ago period. Sales gained nearly 7 per cent to $1.54bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.12 a share, on sales of $1.52bn. Adjusted earnings of $1.23 a share topped estimates for $1.14 a share.Constellation’s third-quarter results were driven by a 16 per cent increase in beer sales. Meanwhile, sales in the wine and spirits category were flat because of lower wine volume and higher promotional spending.Constellation is the top pick among beverage makers for analysts at Evercore ISI, because it is “a play on positive Hispanic-American demographics and increasing disposable income, along with improving beer margins, deleveraging, and the return of cash to shareholders”, said Robert Ottenstein, an analyst at Evercore ISI.The company now sees full-year earnings in the range of $4.25-$4.35 a share, topping forecasts of $4.24.Shares in Constellation Brands rose to $107.64 and are up more than 40 per cent in the past year.An upgrade from Morgan Stanley pushed shares in fast-food chain Wendy’s up 2 per cent to $9.68.Analysts raised the stock from “underweight” to “equal-weight” and boosted their price target from $7.50 to $10.The upgrade was driven by the restaurant’s “potential to further increase refranchising . . . which is not yet priced into the shares,” said John Glass, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.Mr Glass also attributed the upgrade to its ability “to maintain peer average or better same-store sales trends”, and because Wendy’s has a more attractive valuation as it trades at a discount to most quick service restaurants.Aéropostale shares surged nearly 24 per cent after the mall-based teen retailer said it achieved higher than expected margins and that it now expects a smaller quarterly loss.The New York-based retailer expects a fourth-quarter loss in the range of 25-31 cents a share, driven by better than expected margins and expense management. This compared with Wall Street forecasts for a loss of 42 cents a share.Aéropostale reported a 9 per cent decline in same-store sales, a key metric among retailers, in the nine-week holiday period, compared with a 15 per cent decline a year ago.Ford shares gained 2.5 per cent to $15.42 after the US carmaker announced a 20 per cent increase in its first-quarter dividend to 15 cents a share.The US benchmark moved back in to positive territory for the year on Thursday and was led by materials and IT stocks.The S&P 500 gained 1.8 per cent to 2,062.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.8 per cent to 17,907.87 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8 per cent to 4,736.19.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
22;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2014-10-02T17:15:00Z;Constellation falls on earnings miss;Constellation said it earned $1.11 a share, shy of expectations for $1.15;Constellation Brands shares were under pressure on Thursday after the company fell short of second-quarter earnings expectations and cut its cash flow outlook.The maker of Corona beer, Svedka vodka and Robert Mondavi wines reported net income of $196m or 98 cents a share in the quarter ended August 31, down from $1.5bn or $7.74 a share a year ago. The year earlier included gains from its acquisition of Grupo Modelo’s beer business.When adjusted for one time items, Constellation said it earned $1.11 a share, shy of expectations for $1.15. Sales of $1.6bn also fell short of consensus forecasts.The company also lowered its free cash flow forecast for the year as it plans to acquire a glass production plant in Mexico from Anheuser-Busch InBev for $300m.Analysts with RBC said the guidance was “realistic and conservative”, and the investment bank maintained its rating.“All the dynamics that have created uncertainty over the stock (especially for those that do not own the stock) such as glass buying, more capacity, impact from the beer recall and long-term targets have now been put on the table,” said Nik Modi, an analyst with RBC.Constellation shares fell 1 per cent to $84.40.GoPro shares declined 7 per cent to $85.46, after the company said late Wednesday that founders Nicholas and Jill Woodman’s charity had been freed from a lock-up restriction.The founders will give 5.8m shares to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation. Shares of GoPro have surged more than 160 per cent since its public offering earlier this year.Twitter climbed after analysts with JPMorgan raised their rating on the stock to ’overweight’ from ‘neutral’ and lifted their price target from $54 to $64. Shares of the social media site rose 4 per cent to $51.85.“Twitter is a primary beneficiary of the shift toward mobile advertising – a $30bn market in 2014 – and we are increasingly confident in the company’s ability to grow users over time,” said Doug Anmuth, an analyst with JPMorgan.Mr Anmuth said Twitter had worked to increase user engagement and would over time narrow the gap with Facebook on what it earns per user.Shares of Wayfair, the online furniture and home furnishings retailer, soared 30 per cent to $37.72 in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange.The company raised $319m in an initial public offering on Wednesday, valuing Wayfair at $2.4bn. Following Thursday’s gain, the company’s market valuation neared $3bn.The company and selling shareholders sold 11m shares at $29 apiece, above a previously targeted range between $25-$28.Wayfair’s debut on public markets comes as traditional retailers seek more of their growth from the internet as consumers do more shopping online.Earlier this week, Zalando, the Berlin-based ecommerce shoes and clothing specialist, listed shares publicly, valuing the six-year-old company at €5.3bn.Overall, the S&P 500 closed unchanged at 1,946.17 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell was also little changed at 16,801.05.

23;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2014-07-02T17:13:09Z;Constellation cheered by Modelo results;;Constellation Brands was toasted by investors as the $5.3bn acquisition of beer maker Grupo Modelo, completed last year, showed further signs of paying off.Shares in the wine, beer and spirits company jumped 2 per cent to $90.45 on its results for the quarter, continuing an upward trend since Constellation acquired the Mexican business.Its market value has risen 76 per cent during the past year.A marketing campaign for its newly acquired beers, including Model Especial and Corona, had lured consumers as the summer began, the brewer said.Constellation raised its annual profit forecast to between $4.10 and $4.25 a share, up from an earlier estimate of $3.95 to $4.15.The group, which is based in New York, secured Modelo’s US business after regulators forced larger rival Anheuser-Busch InBev to offload it.AB InBev was seeking approval to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo.Sales more than doubled to $1.53bn in the quarter from a year earlier while profits followed a similar upward path, climbing to $215m.Ahead of the bank earnings season, shares in Bank of America rose 2 per cent to $15.85 after Deutsche Bank upgraded its target value from $16.50 to $18.Analyst Matthew O’Connor noted that shares in the lender were almost 10 per cent below recent highs after investors had priced in a “slew of disappointments”, including weaker first-quarter results than expect, an accounting error that halted capital deployment plans and the US Justice Department mortgage settlement.“These issues are well known at this point,” Mr O’Connor wrote.“[Earnings per share] power has an upward trajectory and if macro conditions improve, EPS and valuation should both benefit.”He concluded that there was less litigation risk for the bank, apart from remaining mortgage issues, than for some of its peers that face action over Libor manipulation, foreign exchange trading and money laundering scandals.Shares in Delta Air Lines fell 5 per cent to $38.24 after it reported lower growth than expected in passenger revenue per seat available.The measure increased 4.5 per cent in June, year on year, but was less than expected because of lower international yields.Domestic demand had been strong, Delta reported, but business demand to Latin America was lower because of the World CupShares in Tyson Foods rose 3 per cent to $38.96 on news that it had sealed its deal to acquire Hillshire Brands for $8.55bn after beating rival bidders.Tyson’s acquisition of Hillshire had been only a matter of time after a bidding war with Pilgrim’s Pride forced the price up to $63 a share – about 70 per cent higher than Hillshire’s value before the battle erupted.For the acquisition to happen, Hillshire had needed to extricate itself from a promise to buy Pinnacle Foods.Tyson disclosed on Wednesday that it had paid Pinnacle a $163m termination fee on behalf of Hillshire to shelve that deal.Shares in Hillshire were little changed while Pinnacle Foods was down 2 per cent to $31.48.Harley-Davidson fell 4 per cent to $67.80, after broker Raymond James downgraded the motorcycle company from “strong buy” to “market perform”.Overall, US equities remained on a modest upward march. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,974.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1 per cent upwards to 16,976.24 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.02 per cent to 4,457.73.
24;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2014-05-20T15:25:37Z;Treasury Wine: the wrath of grapes;Australian group rejects KKR offer despite struggling;A fine name with a good heritage, although recent vintages have had a sour aftertaste. Still, poor tasting notes have not dissuaded KKR from launching a A$3.1bn offer for Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates, one of the world’s largest pure play winemakers. Treasury rejected it, and has also recently denied reports that it was in talks to sell its US business to either Pernod Ricard or Constellation Brands. But industry consolidation is in the air. Last month, LVMH bought the Clos de Lambrays vineyard in Burgundy and Pernod Ricard bought Kenwood Vineyards in California.Treasury would be a larger swig than either of those deals. The company has struggled of late. Although revenues have grown a fifth since 2010, costs have risen at double that rate so profits have fallen. Treasury has already taken remedial action in the US. And new chief executive Michael Clarke plans to improve things further with a 50 per cent increase in consumer marketing spend, to be financed by A$35m of cost cuts.The attractions for a buyer lie in two areas. First, restore Treasury’s margins. And second, push its brands, which include Lindeman’s, Wolf Blass and Penfolds. Half of the company’s sales are in Australia and New Zealand, but according to Euromonitor this is one of the weakest regions in the world in terms of forecast wine market growth (less than 1 per cent a year over the next four years). North America, Latin America and other parts of Asia, growing at 2 per cent, 3 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, are where the action is. There are opportunities for anyone with the finance and patience to push the brands hard.KKR’s A$4.7 per share offer gives Treasury an enterprise value of 11 times next year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Large drinks groups, such as Constellation Brands, Diageo and Pernod Ricard, are all on 13-15 times. Even if KKR fails, it will not be long before other tasters are sniffing and swilling their way around Treasury’s cellars.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
25;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2014-04-09T17:47:13Z;Constellation Brands: raise a glass to InBev;Half of fourth quarter net sales were added from the consolidation of Crown Imports;Shareholders of Constellation Brands may want to raise a glass to rival beverage maker Anheuser-Busch InBev. As part of the latter’s purchase of Mexico’s Grupo Modelo last year, Constellation was able to gulp down beer assets that have helped both its shares and its operational performance.Constellation’s net sales surged 86 per cent in the fourth quarter to the end of February. Nearly $600m (or about half of the total) was added from the consolidation of Crown Imports, the importer of the Modelo portfolio in the US. Constellation gained full ownership of Crown last year as part of the AB InBev/Modelo deal. But the deal’s benefits for Constellation did not end there. To appease antitrust regulators, InBev also agreed to sell Constellation its Piedras Negras bottling plant and the US rights to the Corona and Modelo brands. Little wonder that at Constellation’s beer segment (which contributed 46 per cent of the group’s revenues in the quarter) sales increased by 13 per cent.Life is not so cheery on the wine and spirits side of the bar, however. It generates 54 per cent of group sales and includes such brands as Robert Mondavi and Svedka Vodka. Sales were flat in the last quarter. Spirits were up, but wine fell amid a difficult pricing environment. This year, the company thinks wine and spirits net sales will rise in the low to mid single-digit range.No matter. The beer business is flowing enough to make up for that at the moment. Constellation’s shares have risen 15 per cent in the year to date and are up nearly two-thirds in the past 12 months. They slipped 1 per cent Wednesday – perhaps a bit of a headache coming on after the boozy run. Earnings per share are expected to rise 22 per cent this year. At about $81, the shares trade at 20 times those earnings. That is not cheap, but this party does not look like it is over just yet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The benchmark S&P 500, which started the day lower, rebounded in late afternoon trade to close 0.6 per cent higher at 1,563.04, with only telecoms in negative territory.The S&P 500 telecoms sector has gained more than 25 per cent in the past 12 months, outperforming the broader measure by 12 percentage points.“The markets are due for a healthy pullback, as some sectors have got ahead of themselves lately. For example, utilities and telecoms have attracted buyers who are looking for bond-like securities, that is high-dividend paying income stocks,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential.“But while fundamentals are important and pullbacks allow investors to reassess them, the overwhelming accommodative policy from the Fed is underpinning the markets and will continue for some time,” she added.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which dipped in and out of positive territory, finished 0.6 per cent higher at 3,222.25.Consumer discretionary stocks gained ground, however. Shares in JC Penney and Macy’s rose as the two rival department stores returned to court to resume a trial over the rights to sell some of Martha Stewart’s merchandise after failing to come to an agreement. Shares rose 2.7 per cent to $15.87 and 1.4 per cent to $43.99 respectively. JC Penney shares jumped 10 per cent in after-hours trading after CNBC reported that Ron Johnson was ousted as CEO.Constellation Brands rose 1.5 per cent to $48.57, after it emerged that as part of Anheuser-Busch InBev and Mexico’s Grupo Modelo’s agreement to resolve a government’s antitrust lawsuit, AB InBev will sell an additional $2.9bn of assets to Constellation Brands.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, gained 0.3 per cent to 14,613.48.Shares in Alcoa closed 1.8 per cent higher at $8.39, but were trading slightly lower in after-hours market, as the company’s revenues missed expectations.Alcoa announcements are often seen to set the tone for the rest of the companies, but some analysts argue that its importance as a trendsetter is overstated.“Alcoa is no longer an industrial bellwether as it is often portrayed,” said Marty Leclerc, chief investment officer and portfolio manager of Barrack Yard Advisors.“It is also not a particularly good company – their profits in the past five years combined were not as good as in the past seven to eight years,” he added.Homebuilders were one of the bright spots in today’s markets. PulteGroup added 3.1 per cent to $19.73, while luxury homemaker Toll Brothers rose 2.9 per cent to $33.09.Natural gas producers were in focus. Noble Energy shares rallied 3.6 per cent to $115.59, Cabot Oil and Gas added 1 per cent to $68.64, and Peabody Energy Corporation was up 0.8 per cent to $20.34.Shares in Occidental Petroleum dropped sharply after the oil and gas company announced that Ray Irani stepped down as chief executive but will remain executive chairman of the board until the end of 2014. Stephen Chazen, current chief operating officer and president, will take over as chief executive. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $81.12.Johnson & Johnson shares sold off, falling 1.5 per cent to $80.79 after analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “neutral”.
28;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2013-02-20T23:55:05Z;AB InBev delays suit over Modelo deal;;Anheuser-Busch InBev and the US Department of Justice agreed on Wednesday to delay litigation and engage in discussions involving the brewer’s proposed $20bn acquisition of Grupo Modelo.Last month the US moved to block the deal, arguing that it would lead to price increases, harm consumers and deter competition.AB InBev promised to fight the lawsuit but earlier this month made concessions in hopes of moving the deal forward. AB InBev agreed to sell its Piedras Negras brewery and grant perpetual licenses of Corona and other Modelo brands to Constellation Brands, which can sell them in the US.“The plaintiff is investigating whether the revised transaction resolves the competitive concerns alleged in the complaint,” the DoJ said in court filing.AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer by revenues, already controls a 50 per cent stake in Modelo and regulators argued that because the combined company would control 46 per cent of the market the deal would harm smaller competitors.Craft brewers have been fearful that if AB InBev has more leverage with distributors it will make it more difficult for them to get their products on the shelves at retailers.AB InBev, Constellation and Modelo all warned that the discussions with the DoJ could still fall through.The litigation is delayed until March 19.
29;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2013-02-14T23:13:25Z;AB InBev offers Modelo deal concessions;;Anheuser-Busch InBev has offered to offload assets and licences in a bid to win regulatory approval for its $20bn takeover of Grupo Modelo, the Mexican brewer.The world’s largest brewer by sales has offered to sell a high-tech brewery in Mexico and offload its US perpetual rights over the Corona and Modelo beer brands in response to the US Department of Justice’s lawsuit to block the takeover on antitrust grounds.It also intensified its estimation of revenue and cost benefits by $400m to $1bn annually in the process. Carlos Brito, chief executive, said he believed the changes addressed DoJ concerns. “And the deal is even better because we uncovered more synergies,” he said.Analysts reckon the revisions mean the deal is more likely to win over the US government, which is now expected to withdraw its lawsuit and issue a consent decree, blessing the much awaited deal under the new terms.“It’s certainly putting the deal into a much more positive light,” said Dirk Van Vlaanderen, an analyst at Jefferies International in London. “It addresses pretty much all of the concerns the DoJ has. On the basis of that, the deal now goes through . . . I can’t believe the DoJ has any quibbles any more.”According to one person close to the Leuven-based brewer, AB InBev has closely negotiated the deal with the US regulator behind closed doors. “They wouldn’t have made an announcement without the blessing of the DoJ,” the person said.In a sign of investor confidence that the deal was now set to run, the share price of Constellation brands, the wine company that will acquire the perpetual US rights to the Corona and Modelo brands, was up 37 per cent in morning trading.The regulator last month threw one of the biggest cross-border deals of 2012 into doubt when it said AB InBev’s acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent stake in Modelo would lead to price increases, harm consumers and deter competition.The DoJ lawsuit followed the intervention by five US senators who sent a letter to the US regulator in October warning about AB InBev’s growing power.AB InBev’s Bud Light is the best-selling beer in the US and Modelo’s Corona Extra is the top import. A combination of the two companies would control 46 per cent of the $80bn a year US beer market.AB InBev, the Brussels-listed company, on Thursday said it would sell its Piedras Negras brewery and dispose of the US rights to the Corona and Modelo brands to Constellation Brands, the wine company, for $2.9bn. It had previously resisted selling the high-tech bottling plant close to the Texas border.AB InBev then plans to sell Modelo’s 50 per cent stake in Crown Imports, its US joint venture, to Constellation for $1.85bn.However, despite the sale of the state of the art brewery, several analysts said the deal continued to make sense as it would help the AB InBev enter the lucrative and under-developed Mexican beer market.“Following the concession the deal still makes sense because for us the upside to this deal was always primarily about Mexico’s domestic market and to some extent exports outside the US,” said Trevor Stirling, an analysts at Sanford Bernstein.This view was reinforced by the brewer’s announcement that, thanks to the new proposal, it had increased its initial estimate of the annual synergies of the deal from $600m to $1bn.AB InBev shares closed up 5.6 per cent at €69.25.Lazard was lead adviser to AB InBev on the deal
30;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2013-02-14T18:30:15Z;AB InBev: the quiet life;Extra savings mean rejigged Modelo deal should please not just the DoJ;“OK, OK, enough with the moaning already.” AB InBev is evidently sick of the US Department of Justice carping about its proposed acquisition of the 50 per cent of Modelo that it does not already own. Faced with a lawsuit, the brewer has rejigged the deal into something that it hopes the DoJ will like. It will sell a brewery and brand rights to Modelo’s beers in the US (which include Corona) to Constellation Brands for $3bn. It has also found an extra $400m of cost savings down the back of the Modelo sofa.So is the new deal better or worse for AB InBev? The assets going to Constellation generated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $310m in 2012, or 13 per cent of Modelo’s total. The $3bn cash receipt offsets the lost earnings, but at nine times ebitda Constellation is paying a lower multiple for them than the 13 times AB InBev is paying for Modelo. Not ideal then.At least shareholders can console themselves with the extra savings. AB InBev originally promised $600m, so it is a chunky increase. Taxed and capitalised, the $1bn of savings are worth $7bn, making the $4bn market capitalisation premium it is paying look like a steal. That said, AB InBev usually does well on cost savings (it found 50 per cent more than promised when it bought Anheuser-Busch) so it is possible to see the increase as confirming something that might have been expected.The increased savings demonstrate why the deal still works, even without the assets that are being sold to Constellation. The benefits mainly rest on cost savings in Mexico and wider international distribution of Corona. With a 40 per cent share, AB InBev has plenty of exposure to the US market. The revised deal is not as attractive as the original but, as Thursday’s jump in the AB InBev share price shows, sometimes it is worth paying the price for a quiet life.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
31;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2013-01-17T22:31:11Z;American hangover for AB InBev;Regulatory concerns could damage Modelo deal;"AB InBev is not having a great January. Any joy the brewer might have felt after raising $4bn of debt at rates as low as 0.8 per cent this week will have been tempered by regulatory woes on both sides of the Atlantic. In the UK, it was told that it has to share the Budweiser name with rival Budvar. More seriously, in the US it is haggling with regulators over its $20bn acquisition of Modelo, whose brands include Corona.The big issue is market share – the combined company would have a 55 per cent share of the US beer market by volume. AB InBev’s attempt to soothe regulatory concerns by handing control of Crown Imports (which distributes Modelo’s drinks in the US) to Constellation Brands – limiting the combined market share to 49 per cent – might not be enough. It may also have to give up its option to buy Crown, which can be exercised every 10 years. And if that is not enough, it might have to tweak its supply agreement with Crown or even allow another brewer to produce some of Modelo’s drinks.Problems with US regulators need not be fatal to the deal, whose benefits rely largely on cost savings in Mexico and wider distribution of Corona. But exports are 40 per cent of Modelo’s sales, and about
two-thirds of exports go to the US, so it is a sizeable chunk of business. Bernstein estimates that being forced to lose some of Modelo’s production could strip $75m out of the deal’s cost savings of $600m. That said, AB InBev has overdelivered on savings promises in the past, so $600m might still be achievable.Worries about the deal are weighing on the shares. Since it was announced last June, AB InBev has underperformed rivals SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg. The company hopes that the deal can be completed in the first quarter of 2013. If the uncertainty drags on, the risk is that the shares will lose more of their fizz.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
32;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2012-08-28T15:47:51Z;Chinese banks step up lending in the US;;China’s top banks are stepping up their lending activities in the US as large US companies diversify their funding sources and seek to penetrate more deeply into the world’s second-largest economy.Chinese banks’ share of US syndicated lending has risen to 6.1 per cent of the total market so far in 2012, up from 5.1 per cent last year, according to data from Dealogic. So far this year, the total value of syndicated loans from Chinese banks into the US has reached $51bn.Liao Qiang, Chinese banking analyst at Standard & Poor’s, said: “Many global banks have been deleveraging as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis and the debt crisis in Europe. Their retreat in lending markets provides opportunities for Chinese banks to deepen relationships with the multinational companies and steadily increase their international presence.”The increased syndicated lending by Chinese banks comes as their balance sheets compare favourably with US counterparts.Standard & Poor’s last year upgraded the long term credit ratings of Bank of China and China Construction Bank from A- to A. The credit rating agency maintained the rating of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) at A. At the same time, the long-term credit ratings of Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were cut to A-.Among the latest deals, Bank of China is involved in a $1.4bn syndicated loan to Zimmer Holdings, the medical device company, and Bank of East Asia is part of a $575m loan syndication to Constellation Brands, the wine and beer group.Industrial and Commercial Bank of China took part in an $11.8bn syndicated loan for Walmart, the US retailer.Bi Mingqiang, general manager of ICBC’s New York branch, said the bank was seeking long-term lending relationships with US companies which had a presence in China and elsewhere. The bank provides credit to United Parcel Service, Pfizer and Dell.UPS said linking with a Chinese bank had made it easier to conduct business in renminbi, while Dell said it had developed relationships with Chinese banks for the same reason.CCB’s clients include General Electric, and the bank has also had discussions with Caterpillar, Walt Disney, Tiffany and Cargill.John Weinshank, head of corporate banking at CCB, added that lending was only a starting point to extend into other businesses, such as deposit and trade finance.CCB’s lending business in the US has risen from $600m in 2009 to $2bn this year, while ICBC, which established a New York branch in 2008, had made more than $1.3bn of loans to US companies at the end of 2011 compared with zero at the start of 2009.Last year, ICBC, Bank of China and China Merchant Bank participated in a $6bn syndicated loan to Duke Energy – the first time the North Carolina-based energy group borrowed money from Chinese banks.“There’s a global relocation of capital from the west to the east. This is an evolution process,” said Mr Weinshank. “Nowadays, the Brics banks [in Brazil, Russia, India and China] have a seat at the table.”He said ratings upgrades of Chinese banks represented a turning point for large US companies to consider Chinese groups as lenders.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
34;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2012-08-07T17:37:12Z;Yields on US junk-rated debt hit new lows;;Demand for US junk-rated debt has propelled yields towards new lows, as investors seeking returns in a low-interest rate environment have been attracted by a record number of deals so far this month.The Barclays High Yield index has dropped to 6.63 per cent, just 2 basis points shy of its all-time low of 6.61 per cent set in May 2011. So far this year, high-yield bonds have returned 9.9 per cent, on pace to more than double last year’s gain of 4.2 per cent.The prospect of further easing in September by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has boosted market sentiment, while last week’s US jobs report has soothed near-term worries about the economy.The $9.36bn of junk-rated deals sold so far this month represent a record pace for August, according to Dealogic data that goes back as far as 1995.“We are seeing some investors sell investment-grade debt and buy high-yield at a time of strong inflows into the market,” said Wesley Sparks, fund manager for global high-yield at Schroders. “Investors have a lot of cash and there is a lack of supply.”This is illustrated by a slew of new deals at the start of this week, including Constellation Brands, MarkWest Energy, Advanced Micro Devices and SandRidge Energy, trading higher in price and lower in yield after they were sold. New issues have strongly outperformed the broad market, providing investors with outsized returns.“High yield new issues have outperformed the US High Yield Index or the appropriate quality index by approximately 1.8 per cent year-to-date,” said Barclays.Further deals were due on Tuesday, led by Iron Mountain pricing $1bn of debt.But some doubt that the rally in junk can extend much further. Many companies are facing pressure on their margins and struggling to cut costs.“While the bid for high-quality yield is understandable in this environment, we question the extension of this reach into the economically and risk appetite-sensitive portions of the credit spectrum,” said Oleg Melentyev, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.With investment grade debt yielding an average of 2.8 per cent, investors are eyeing higher average yields of 5.25 per cent for double-B rated debt and 6.1 per cent for single-B rated companies.One missing part of the junk-bond rally has been companies with triple C ratings, or those in the highly speculative range and which yield about 10.1 per cent.“If the rally continues, we need to see investors stretch for the riskier part of the market, not remain focused on double-B rated companies,” Mr Sparks said.

The rally this week has propelled the benchmark index to its first positive monthly gain of 4 per cent since March and the best June performance since 1999. That leaves the S&P higher by 8.3 per cent so far this year.Analysts said the market’s strong performance was also a function of the final trading day for June and the second quarter, with investors buying stocks in order to bolster their portfolio returns.“Another aspect of [Friday’s] rallying markets has to do with the fact that it’s the end of the quarter and the first half year,” said Ms Krosby. “Managers are trying to enhance the performance of their portfolios,” she added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 2.2 per cent gaining 1.9 per cent over the week to 12,880.09. The Nasdaq Composite index also jumped 3 per cent to 2,935.05 and registered a 1.5 per cent gain for the week.US stocks shrugged off weak economic data on Friday, with consumer spending flat and incomes ticking up a meagre 0.1 per cent.Industrials and energy stocks were boosted by soaring oil prices on the back of the EU deal to help Spain and Italy recapitalise their banks and bring down bond yields.The S&P energy index was the best performing sector this week with a gain of 4.2 per cent.Among big winners this week were the oil and gas drillers Newfield Exploration and Pioneer Natural Resources. Newfield Exploration was 11.5 per cent higher on the week to $29.31, while Pioneer climbed 5.6 per cent over the week to $88.21.Financials also rose sharply on Friday, enabling the S&P sector to gain 1.7 per cent over the week. Major US banks were bolstered by the news that European banks will be stabilised after EU leaders took steps to creating a banking union.Citigroup rallied on Friday but fell 2.7 per cent over the week to $27.41. Bank of America rose 1.8 per cent to $8.18 and Wells Fargo added 1.4 per cent to $33.44 this week. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase fell 0.9 per cent this week to $35.73 as investors priced in larger losses from its credit derivatives activities.The S&P technology sector lagged behind others to register a 0.5 per cent rise on the week.One of the biggest gainers in the tech sector was Oracle, up 5 per cent to $29.70 this week. Another notable gainer was Amazon, up 2.6 per cent over the week to $228.35.In corporate deal news, Constellation Brands gained 39.5 per cent to $27.06 after the world’s largest wine company agreed to buy the other half of its Crown Imports joint venture with Grupo Modelo. The deal would turn Constellation Brands into the sole US importer of top-selling Corona beers.Anheuser-Busch InBev also ticked up a weekly gain of 12.6 per cent to $79.65 after agreeing to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo for about $20.1bn. The world’s largest brewer by sales gained 3 per cent over the week.Among the biggest losers, Research In Motion shares fell 24.6 per cent over the week to $7.39 following first-quarter results showing profit declines. Investors were also disappointed to learn that the launch of the BlackBerry 10 smartphone had been pushed back to early next year.In other corporate earnings news, Ford shares fell 6.7 per cent this week to $9.59 after the US’s second-largest carmaker pre-announced quarterly results, warning that its pre-tax profits would be “substantially lower” as revenues were hit in Europe, South America and Asia.Nike’s earnings results came in lower than expected on Thursday after the market close. The sports goods maker’s shares fell 11 per cent to $87.75 this week.KB Home announced a loss which was narrower than anticipated. The stock climbed 19.66 per cent over the past week to $9.80, with most of the gains coming on Friday.Coty, the cosmetics group, has filed for an initial public offering on Friday in an attempt to raise about $700m.
36;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;AB InBev / Modelo: no cheap round;Both sets of shareholders should give it a warm salud;Drinkers of Corona beer sometimes like to wedge a slice of lime into the tops of their bottles. Shareholders in Grupo Modelo, which owns the brand, have absolutely no need for such gimmicks.They have just agreed a deal under which AB InBev is to buy the 50 per cent of Modelo that it does not already own for $19bn, a tasty 30 per cent more than the Mexican company’s undisturbed share price.At first sight, the price looks frothy. AB InBev is paying a $4bn market capitalisation premium for half of Modelo and promises to generate annual cost savings of $600m within four years. Taxed and capitalised, those synergies are worth $4.2bn, only slightly more than the premium it is paying.But the company has impressive form here. When InBev bought Anheuser-Busch in 2008, it promised $1.5bn of savings per year, but says it is now delivering $2.3bn. Overdelivery on a similar scale this time round would create annual savings of closer to $900m, worth $6.3bn today. There are a lot of ifs in there but the company’s record suggests that investors should give it the benefit of the doubt.The deal could have been even sweeter for AB InBev if it had been able to control the marketing and distribution of Corona in the US. But that distribution is controlled by Crown, a joint venture between Modelo and Constellation Brands. AB InBev has agreed to sell Modelo’s share to Constellation for $1.9bn. The move is possibly designed to mollify the competition authorities, but it will deny AB InBev the chance to push Corona through its US distribution platform and reap huge benefits in the process.No matter. This was an acquisition waiting to happen. AB InBev is promising to beat the deal’s cost of capital within three years. Both sets of shareholders should give it a warm salud.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Significantly warmer weather in March throughout the US also helped boost pent-up demand for spring clothing, he said.Shares in Bed, Bath & Beyond gained 9.2 per cent to $71.85 for the week, the fourth best-performing stock on the S&P 500 over the shortened period. The home goods and appliances retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings per share above analyst projections and revised up its forecast earnings per share for its first quarter of this year.The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.48, beating analyst projections of $1.32.“This was 15 cents above the high end of guidance,” said Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “Bed, Bath & Beyond has beaten the high end of its guidance range for 13 consecutive quarters dating back to the February 2009 quarter,” she noted and raised the price target for its shares to $73.Kate McShane, analyst at Citigroup, also increased her price target for the company but warned that earnings per share growth may decelerate as competition from online retailers increased. Shares in Bed, Bath & Beyond have gained more than 24 per cent in the year to date.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent for the week to 1,398.08 after it had touched a post-financial crisis high on Monday above the 1,420 points mark. The benchmark US index remains up 11.2 per cent in the year to date.Many stocks on the main market turned negative on Tuesday as investors interpreted the release of the minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee as suggesting that a third round of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve would be unlikely.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2 per cent to 13,060.14, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.4 per cent to 3,080.50.Avon Products, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, was the biggest riser on the S&P 500 after it rejected a $10bn takeover offer by Coty, the private fragrance group. Shares in Avon rose 22.1 per cent to $23.42 over the week but were still down almost 15 per cent in the last year.But not all retailers managed to notch up big gains. Constellation Brands, the world’s largest wine company, tumbled 8.5 per cent to $21.61 and was among the week’s worst-performing equity’s on the main US market.The decline came after Constellation said earnings per share would come in below analyst projections. A Bloomberg survey had put 12-month EPS at about $2.23, but the company warned that it would likely be between $1.93 and $2.03 instead.Groupon, the daily deal and offers website, sunk 22.9 per cent to $14.18, its lowest point since shares debuted on the main market in November. Investor confidence in the company, which reported last week that its internal accounting controls were subject to “material weakness”, was shaken by the news and shares fell well below their initial offer price of $20 this week.American International Group, the insurance company that was rescued by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, added 9.9 per cent to reach $32.89. Shares in AIG rose this week as news broke that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was considering a sale of its Maiden Lane III portfolio, which was created when the central bank rescued the insurer.JPMorgan Chase fell more than 3.5 per cent to $44.34 as it said chief executive Jamie Dimon earned $23.1m in 2011 and as it agreed to pay a $20m penalty to settle regulatory allegations that it mishandled customer accounts.In its annual report, JPMorgan said Mr Dimon received $1.4m in salary, a bonus of $4.5m and $17m in stock and options compared to James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, whose pay package totalled $10.5m in 2011.Shares in Morgan Stanley lost 6.4 per cent to $18.39 this week but are still up more than 21 per cent in the year to date.
38;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2012-01-05T22:31:57Z;US oil refiners in sharp sell-off;;US oil refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins.Tesoro fell 5.9 per cent to $22.60 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 5.5 per cent to $31.92, and Valero Energy, down 3 per cent to $19.81.The rising price of California crude turned a third-quarter discount of $6 a barrel into a premium of 5 cents a barrel at Tesoro’s California refineries, which account for 40 per cent of its output.The group cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which are 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.“The level of weakness at Tesoro was unexpected and investors have taken it as a signal to exit all refiners,” said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer.Elsewhere, US stocks reversed early losses to end the day in positive territory, with banks leading. Bank of America climbed 8.6 per cent to $6.31, topping $6 for the first time since November, on its best one day gain since October.Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed their profit estimates for BofA citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits.Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December, without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 7.7 per cent to $7.04.That may also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform. SunTrust was up 5.4 per cent to $19.66, and Regions Financial climbed 4.2 per cent to $4.52, while some investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, sat out the rally. Goldman Sachs slipped 0.2 per cent to $94.58.The S&P 500 remained above its 200-day moving average for a third day, a sign of bullish sentiment, while Goldman Sachs reported that one-month realised correlation between the S&P 500 and its sectors, excluding financials, has fallen to its lowest level since August. That is an indication that macro concerns, which tend to shift all stocks in the same direction and increase realised correlation, weighed less on US investors in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off a fraction at 12,415.70.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,669.86, as stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied after Seagate Technology said fourth quarter shipments had been strong, a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected.Seagate climbed 6.4 per cent to $17.90 as it raised guidance, while rival hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $32.76.LSI Corp, which makes semiconductors used in hard drives, rose 7.7 per cent to $6.70 as Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Wedbush securities, recommended clients buy the stock on the Seagate results.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions. Gap fell 3.2 per cent to $18.27 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, climbed 5.9 per cent to $50.42 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.JC Penney fell 2.7 per cent to $33.97 after the department store chain lowered fourth-quarter profit guidance to 70 cents a share from above $1 a share, while Constellation Brands, which sells imported wines and beers, fell 6 per cent after slightly missing earnings estimates.Barnes & Noble slumped 17.1 per cent to $11.24 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Consumer discretionary stocks had led the S&P 500 on Wednesday as investors piled into the sector in anticipation of strong December sales, which overall were up 3.6 per cent year on year, according to data from Retail Metrics. “It’s not surprising to see investors buy the rumour and sell the news,” said Richard Jaffe, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.Shares in seed maker Monsanto rose 5.5 per cent to $76.68 as the company posted strong earnings, boosted by rising demand from South America.MetroPCS slumped 8.9 per cent to $8.01 as the mobile phone network’s pace of growth slowed. The company added 197,000 subscribers in the last three months of 2011, a third lower than the same period in 2010, and substantially beneath analysts’ expectations.Fertiliser manufacturer Mosaic climbed 1.9 per cent to $53.30 as the company posted solid results and said the prices for phosphate-based fertilisers had bottomed following output cuts and a rally in grain prices.
39;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2011-01-14T19:27:04Z;Off-trade drinkers lift sales at C&C;;Home drinkers of Magners cider helped C&C Group survive – and even benefit from – last year’s harsh winter weather.Volumes of Magners shipped to licensed venues in the UK fell nearly a fifth in December, but a 52 per cent rise in off-trade volumes – as the weather “[appeared] to have encouraged consumers to stay home” – meant overall UK Magners shipments were still 24 per cent higher than in December 2009.The Irish company said it expected to match operating profit forecasts of €102m-€106m (£86m-£89m) for the year to February 28 in spite of the effects of snow on pub sales.Last summer, a new management team at C&C reversed declines at the premium cider brand for the first time in three years – a trend continued in the three months to November 1, the company said on Friday. Worldwide Magners volumes rose 5.6 per cent in the quarter, bringing nine-month growth to 2.7 per cent.Meanwhile, volumes for Bulmers cider, sold in Ireland, moved into the black in the quarter but remain down for the full nine months. Net cider revenues were down 3.4 per cent for the nine months, due in part to the deflationary environment in Ireland, but analysts pointed to an improving trend.“The whole investment case is a business recovery story with bid potential,” said Phil Carroll at Shore Capital. “They’re trading in challenging conditions, as everyone knows, but they’re making it more efficient. You see so many companies blaming the snow. Not to be changing your expectations is pretty good.”The shares rose 1.2 per cent to €3.59 on Friday.Mr Carroll also expects sales of Gaymers, the UK cider business C&C bought from Constellation Brands in December 2009, to have gained from snow, thanks to high exposure to supermarkets and other off-trade venues.Gaymers’ revenues and those brought in by the company’s purchase in August 2009 of Tennent’s lager business, were not included in Friday’s management statement because there were no prior-year comparatives.C&C also said on Friday that “a cash neutral position is anticipated for year end” – an achievement made possible by its €300m sale of the William Grant & Sons spirits and liqueurs business last July.
40;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2010-12-23T19:20:48Z;Constellation to sell Australian and UK wines stake;;Constellation Brands has agreed to sell a majority stake in its Australian and UK wines business to a Sydney-based private equity group for $230m.Under the terms of the agreement, Constellation will retain a 20 per cent stake in the business, putting a total value of $290m on the deal. The buyer, Champ private equity, based in Sydney, owns Manassen and a variety of infrastructure-related businesses.Among the wine brands that will be transferred to Champ are Stowell’s, which is best known in the UK for introducing the concept of boxed wines, as well as Hardys and Banrock Station.For the past two years, Constellation has improved its earnings even as its sales have flagged. The company reported $4.2bn in sales for fiscal 2010, down from $4.7bn in 2009, even as it swung from a loss in 2009 to net income of $99m for 2010.In its most recent quarter, Constellation reported sales of $863m, most of which came from its wine businesses. In North America, wine sales of $601m were up 5 per cent from the same period a year earlier, while the company’s Australian and European wine sales were $207m, down 14 per cent from a year earlier, largely due to currency fluctuations.Constellation’s wine business in Australia and the UK have been buffeted by the surging Australian dollar, a glut of wines down under and new UK taxes on imports.“During the last two years, Constellation has implemented a strategy focused on driving profitable organic growth through premiumising its world-class brand portfolio and improving margins, return on invested capital and free cash flow,” said Rob Sands, Constellation’s chief executive, in a statement. He added that the wine business being sold “continues to be faced with challenging market conditions”.Since 2007, Constellation has tried to move away from its “all things to all people” approach to the wine business, and focus on upscale brands that carried a stronger operating margin. While it has invested in brands such as Robert Mondavi and Ravenswood in the US, it has sold off mass-market brands such as Almaden and Inglenook.Following the announcement of the deal, Moody’s upgraded its credit rating on Constellation’s debt, moving it from “stable” to “positive”.Rothschild served as an adviser on the transaction.Even after the sale, Constellation’s primary business will remain wine. Its spirits brands include Black Velvet Canadian whisky and Wild Irish Rose. The company also markets Corona beer and Negro Modelo through an agreement with Grupo Modelo of Mexico.In its most recent quarter, Constellation’s spirits sales, at $55m, dropped 15 per cent from the same period in 2009.
41;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2010-07-13T15:30:08Z;Mexican brewers;Beer groups provide a cautionary tale of dysfunctional duopolists;"There are cautionary tales galore from the Mexican beer market. Strategy, of course, is ever-important: ponder the divergent paths of Mexico’s two brewers controlled by separate clans. Femsa became a conglomerate, taking on debt, surviving a Mexican debt crisis in the 1980s only then to buy a bank and again struggle for capital. Market share for the neglected brewing business CCM fell from 60 per cent in 1985 to 45 per cent in 2003, calculates Credit Suisse. Meanwhile Modelo avoided debt, launched an export business and steadily expanded at home to become a larger and more profitable beer maker.But Mexican brewing is more a case-study in partnerships. Last week Modelo lost an arbitration case against Anheuser-Busch InBev; it had argued that the change in ownership of the maker of Budweiser meant Modelo could wriggle free of Anheuser-Busch’s 50 per cent economic stake. Modelo’s future now seems firmly part of AB InBev.Meanwhile when Femsa was finally forced to sell its brewing arm to Heineken this year, the Dutch beer maker also erred. CCM relies on exclusive beer distribution through Femsa-owned convenience chain Oxxo for about 14 per cent of its sales. In 2020, that exclusivity expires, meaning Heineken will have to pay up to retain a significant portion of its sales, lest a competitor secure a distribution deal with Oxxo – perhaps AB InBev.Finally, it is surely inevitable that AB InBev wants all of Modelo for itself. Cost-savings abound and there is a ready market for Bud Light in northern Mexico. But again a strained relationship may prevent Modelo extracting a full price. Modelo may have to buy-out its joint-venture partner in US distribution, Constellation Brands, to make the investment necessary to improve sales and justify a decent valuation.

Many are still uncertain of this recovery.”Small-cap stocks that are cheap relative to their earnings are best positioned to benefit from the current environment, he said.The S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,194.37 on Friday and 1.4 per cent firmer on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,454.05, advancing 2.1 per cent since the start of the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 10,997.35 and 0.6 per cent over the five days. All week the gauge has threatened to break the 11,000 level – the last time it achieved this was September 2008.JC Penney rose 1.7 per cent to $31.52 on Friday as the department store chain was added to the “conviction buy” list at Goldman Sachs in spite of missing narrowly its March sales expectations. The broker raised its share price target from $32 to $37.Alcoa moved 3.2 per cent lower on Friday to $14.39 as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan Chase. The aluminium producer is set to kick off the official earnings season next week.Chevron was up 2.4 per cent to $79.50 on Friday as the company said its first-quarter earnings were likely to be better than its fourth-quarter results but the oil company did not cite specific numbers.Atlas Energy advanced 20.2 per cent to $38.25 on Friday on news that India’s Reliance Industries is to invest $1.7bn in a joint venture that will give it a 40 per cent stake in the Marcellus Shale gas project.Constellation Brands, a global alcoholic beverages group, on Friday lost 2.5 per cent to $16.43 as it forecast lower full-year earnings estimates than analysts had forecast. It expects to make $1.53-$1.68 per share compared with consensus estimates of $1.77.Rob Sands, chief executive, said the forecasts were because of “an uncertain economic environment, continuing pressures on the Crown joint venture and the Australian and UK operations”, as well as investments in marketing and technology. However, its profit for the past quarter beat expectations.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, lost 0.6 per cent on Friday to $55.07 on news that it had cut prices on more than 10,000 products. It follows a drop in sales in its US stores last quarter.Media group AOL was up 10.4 per cent on the week to $27.99 after it announced a potential sale or shutdown of Bebo, the social networking website that it bought less than two years ago.Bebo has been losing market share to rivals and analysts expect it to reach a significantly lower price than the $850m AOL paid.Palm rallied 32.3 per cent over the week to $5.16 amid rumours that the smartphone manufacturer may be bought.Speculation that HTC Corp, a Taiwan-based smartphone maker, may be a potential buyer sent the Palm shares 11 per cent higher on Friday. The company declined to comment.Solid March sales figures released late in the week boosted retail stocks.Over the week, clothing retailer Gap was 5.2 per cent higher at $24.85, department store chain Macy’s gained 5.2 to $23.51 and Nordstrom rallied 2.5 per cent to $42.55. All beat their analyst sales estimates.Shares of coal producer Massey Energy slumped 11.9 per cent to $46.72 over the week following an explosion at its mine in West Virginia that killed at least 25 people.
43;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;C&C pays £45m for Gaymers cider;;C&C, the Irish drinks company that owns Magners cider, has bought the Gaymer cider company from Constellation Brands. The deal is its second big acquisition since a change of management in November last year.C&C is paying £45m ($74m) for the company, which owns the Blackthorn, Olde English and Gaymers brands. Together, the three brands sell almost twice as much cider as Magners in the UK.The Gaymer cider company achieved sales of £64m in the year to February 2009, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about £5.4m.The purchase, which will be financed with a new £60m bank facility, will bring C&C’s net debt to ebitda ratio to close to 3 times, analysts say.It follows the £180m acquisition in August of Tennents, the Scotland-based lager business. That deal was granted approval from the Office of Fair Trading on Monday.C&C did much to raise the profile of cider in the UK, taking on Bulmers, which is now part of Heineken.Magners was once hailed as a marketing success, turning a drink once seen as downmarket into a premium-priced product.But it overexpanded and was forced to mothball capacity at its Clonmel crushing and fermenting plant and write off stock.The new management team, led by John Dunsmore, chief executive, has sought to abandon its position as a niche cider maker and expand into other alcoholic drinks.Joe Gill, analyst with Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin, said: “Coming shortly after the purchase of Tennents, this deal will certainly stretch management resources.”Investor confidence in the new management was knocked in July when the company admitted that what it had claimed was a rise in revenue was in fact a fall. Stephen Glancey, the finance director who along with Mr Dunsmore had joined from Scottish & Newcastle, called it “human error” saying “there’s nothing wrong with our accounting systems”.
44;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2009-11-02T17:26:19Z;Constellation Brands eyes Australian stake;;Constellation Brands, the world’s biggest wine group, is in talks to buy a stake in Australian Vintage, the owner of the McGuigan wine brand, to boost profits during a long-running wine glut.The move comes as the US company, whose Australian brands range from the relatively cheap Banrock Station to the more expensive Brookland Valley, struggles to complete a planned sale of three wineries and more than 20 vineyards.“The majority have not been sold because of the challenging conditions in Australia,” Constellation said, claiming the Australian wine industry was facing “unprecedented negative operating conditions.”Australian Vintage, which has a market capitalisation of A$44m (US$39m), on Monday confirmed the discussions, which it said may lead to the US company taking “a substantial but non-controlling” interest in the Australian company. A potential deal would see the two companies operate a standalone wine group listed on the Australian stock exchange.Shares in Australian Vintage, which have tumbled 47 per cent in the past 12 months, closed down 6 per cent at 32 cents.The Australian group, whose brands include lesser-known names like Nepenthe still wines and Passion Pop sparkling wines, has suffered from higher costs and lower demand, reporting a loss of $127.8m in the six months to December.Constellation owns and operates 11 Australian wineries and derives one-tenth of its total sales from Australia, New Zealand, and the UK (it imports Australian wines into the UK.) It owns six of the top-selling 25 wine brands in Australia and is the largest producer of box wines. It also imports Australian wines into the UK.It does not break out its Australian earnings but sales from Australia, UK and New Zealand were $165m in the six months to the end of the August, down from $196.5m a year earlier.Although some analysts believe the global wine industry is poised for a rebound after years of supply exceeding demand, many winemakers are still battling to make ends meet, particularly in Australia.Australia produced record grape harvests in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and a bigger-than-expected harvest in 2008. An oversupply of grapes, combined with rising costs for water and a stronger Australian dollar, has made Australian wines more expensive than wines from other New World producers like Chile, Argentina and South Africa.Australian exporters have also seen their profit margins squeezed in the UK due to higher taxes and tougher competition from retailers’ own-label ranges.A new marketing group called Australia’s First Families of Wine was established in the UK two months ago to try and improve the image of Australian wine, which has been damaged by the proliferation of cheap brands.The group - which includes upmarket vineyards like Taylors, Henschke and Howard Park - plans to pitch their brands as “high end, quality wines with real character.”Constellation’s shares rose 0.25 per cent in morning trading in New York on Monday to $15.86. Its shares have outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past 12 months as it has cut costs globally, rising 24 per cent.
45;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2009-10-01T20:37:05Z;Wall Street suffers worst day since July;;Wall Street on Thursday suffered its biggest daily loss since early July after disappointing data on jobs and a surprise slowdown in manufacturing left investors concerned about economic recovery.The US government’s weekly jobless claims report showed that 551,000 Americans filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week. The figure was up from a revised 534,000 in the previous week and worse than economists’ forecasts of 535,000.The Institute for Supply Management’s index dropped to 52.6 last month from 52.9 in August. Analysts had been expecting a rise to 54.However, personal spending and personal income figures were slightly better than expected.The S&P 500 closed down 2.6 per cent at 1,029.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 9,509.28. The Nasdaq lost 3.1 per cent to 2,057.48.“Usually you get to about this stage in an overall recovery and you are subject to a correction and so, from a psychological standpoint, it’s not surprising to see the market trying to reassess what’s really going on and how strong the recovery will be,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“We were primed for that anyway and some of the news more recently has been a little bit disappointing.”Materials and financial stocks dragged the market lower. United States Steel lost 4.8 per cent to $42.26. After falling 1.4 per cent on Wednesday on fears about economic recovery, Alcoa was down 1.5 per cent at $12.92 even after Deutsche Bank advised buying the shares.Ken Lewis, Bank of America’s chief executive, announced that he was retiring, leaving the country’s biggest lender without a successor. The shares were down 4.2 per cent at $16.21.Mr Lewis’ surprise departure, announced on Wednesday night, draws to an end his turbulent eight-year tenure at the bank and comes days after Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo made sweeping changes to their top ranks.JP Morgan lost 5.6 per cent to $41.37.The technology sector also suffered, with the Nasdaq reporting its biggest daily loss June.Cisco Systems agreed to buy Tandberg, the Norwegian video conferencing company, for $3bn in cash, presenting a further challenge to Microsoft as it pushes deeper into the online collaboration business. Cisco’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $23.09.Goldman Sachs removed Microsoft from its “conviction buy” list, citing some degree of risk to first-quarter earnings, but retained a “buy” rating on the company. Microsoft shares fell 3.3 per cent to $24.88.Elsewhere in the sector, Comcast denied a report that it had struck a deal to buy General Electric’s stake in NBC Universal but reports suggested talks were ongoing about a joint venture. France’s Vivendi holds the remaining stake in the media conglomerate. Comcast’s shares fell 7.2 per cent to $15.67.Teradyne, which supplies automatic test equipment, lost 4.9 per cent to $8.80 following initial gains sparked by a raising of its third-quarter outlook.Late on Wednesday, Ascent Solar Technologies said it would offer 4m common shares in a public offering in order to raise cash for expansion. The shares dropped 23.8 per cent to $2.15.Penske announced, also late on Wednesday, it had broken off talks with General Motors to buy the Saturn brand. Its shares fell 16 per cent to $16.12.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Vical lost 5.9 per cent to $4.01. The shares had initially risen after the company said it had signed a $1.3m contract with the US Navy’s medical research centre to work on the development of its vaccine for H1N1 flu.Consumer groups, however, offered some relief. Diamond Foods, which sells nuts and snacks, posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings late on Wednesday. Higher snack sales offset lower demand for walnuts. The shares rose 4 per cent to $33.00.Constellation Brands, which owns wine brands such as Banrock Station and Clos du Bois, swung to a quarterly profit after restructuring efforts paid off. The shares gained 5.4 per cent to $15.97.
46;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2009-08-27T19:32:03Z;Romance survives recession, says Diageo chief;;Paul Walsh, Diageo’s chief executive, refuses to concede that the recession has destroyed romance.The idea that consumers, wearied by the rising cost of living, want only “value” in the products they buy holds no truck with him.The kind of products Diageo sells – whiskies, gins and coffee liqueurs – still appeal to consumers’ emotions, he says, putting the drinks group in a different position to other consumer goods companies, such as the makers of shampoo and cat food. “[Drinks] are much less functional,” he argues in his offices in central London, pulling out a slender bottle of Shanghai White, the vodka it launched last month in Hong Kong. “There’s more romance.”The brand, a joint venture with China’s Sichuan Chengdu Quanxing group, sells for about £40 ($65) and tries hard to be romantic. The frosted-glass bottle is patterned with cherry blossoms and pictures of Shanghai inspired by 1930s Art Deco images.Other consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever, have been far more prosaic in the recession, stressing the need to “stretch” their brands down the price ladder to appeal to cost-conscious consumers.Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, said this month he believed consumers were increasingly “value conscious” and that this mentality was unlikely to change in the near term.But Mr Walsh claims he has seen no “fundamental” changes in the consumer psyche. “We have not seen any structural changes which will have a long-term impact on the sector.”Consequently, although Diageo is making more of an effort sell cheaper drinks brands, such as Popov vodka, by displaying them more prominently at supermarket checkouts, it does not plan to add more of these brands to its portfolio.“I think our business model is viable and our strategy is the right strategy,” Mr Walsh says, adding that Diageo will continue to focus on premium brands, which include Johnnie Walker Red whisky and Smirnoff vodka.Some analysts dispute Diageo’s notion of “premium”, with research group Euromonitor including Smirnoff – which sells for about $12 – in the economy or value segment of the market. The research group says 66 per cent of the US white spirits market by sales volume are economy brands, with just 22 per cent considered premium.The US’s Sazerac group holds the dominant position in the economy spirits market, owning brands including Platinum vodka and Sazerac rye whiskies. If Smirnoff is included as an economy brand, Diageo’s economy brands are bigger than Sazerac’s, according to Euromonitor.Excluding Smirnoff, Diageo is roughly the same size as the next biggest specialist company in economy brands, Heaven Hill. Other companies participating in the economy market include Constellation Brands, McCormick Distilling, and Pernod Ricard (which has Seagram Gin.)Diageo says that, while people are trading down from super-premium brands such as Johnnie Walker Blue (which sells for about £150 per bottle), and buying less of them in pubs and bars, they are still buying cheaper brands. It also claims people are still drinking Johnnie Walker Blue in bars – by the glass rather than the bottle.“People will drink on premise because they can have a glass for £15,” Mr Walsh says. On premise sales account for 28 per cent of Diageo’s total sales in the US, but around half of the group’s sales in the UK.Diageo has been introducing smaller bottles this year for many brands to make them more affordable.Although consumers’ “wherewithal” to buy brands has moderated, their “aspiration” to buy them still exists, Mr Walsh says.
47;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2009-07-01T20:26:38Z;US stocks start quarter on strong note;;"US stocks began the second half of the year on a positive note on Wednesday with shares in prominent food and drink manufacturers leading the market higher.General Mills, which makes Cheerios, reported better profits than expected, lifted by lower commodities prices and strong sales of new brands.The company also raised its forecast for earnings in 2010, and the shares picked up 3.9 per cent to $58.18.Constellation Brands, which owns several alcoholic drinks brands, including Robert Mondavi wines, kept costs sufficiently low to beat profit expectations in spite of falling revenues. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $13.61.A weaker dollar boosted shares in multi-national brands. Coca-Cola, which Credit Suisse had said could soon see double-digit earnings growth, picked up 2.5 per cent to $49.18, while rival Pepsiadvanced 2.8 per cent to $56.52.Elsewhere in the sector, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut and KFC, gained 5 per cent to $35.02 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares, saying its overseas businesses would probably exceed its target of 10 per cent growth in profits.Commodities stocks rallied strongly in the morning but fell back as the price of raw materials dropped during the day. Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, finished 0.9 per cent higher at $50.57.The price of oil briefly rose above $71 a barrel, but then fell back in the afternoon. After a strong morning, Chevron closed 0.4 per cent higher at $66.52 while Exxon Mobil climbed 0.9 per cent to $70.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at 923.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,504.06 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.6 per cent to 1,845.72.Investors remained focused on commodities and the dollar rather than economic data released during the morning, including two early indications on job losses.The market initially took confidence from the Challenger jobs report, which said that companies announced 9 per cent fewer job cuts in June than the previous year, the first annual decline in planned cuts since February 2008.This was counterbalanced by data from ADP Employer Services, which said companies cut more jobs than expected in June.Investors also took a near 20 per cent fall in mortgage applications during last week in their stride.“People are starting to dismiss some of the negative data and focus on the positives,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.But with the more closely watched data on initial jobless claims and the official unemployment rate due out this morning, the markets slipped as investors became more cautious.“I was surprised by the reaction to the data this morning,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “But people have taken some of the gains off the table as we get closer to Thursday’s unemployment reports.”Pfizer gave up 0.7 per cent to $14.90 after the company said it would not continue a late stage trial of its cancer drug Sutent after disappointing results.But rival Biogen Idec climbed 3.6 per cent to $46.77 after it acquired the rights to market an experimental drug made by Acorda outside the US for a fee that could rise to $550m.An analyst at JPMorgan warned that the deal would make it less likely that Acorda would be taken over however, and its shares fell 14.9 per cent to $23.99.There was further concern for the hotel industry after Barclays said a recovery in lodging stocks would lag behind a broader recovery, and the bank downgraded shares in Choice Hotels.This came the day after Wachovia downgraded Starwood Hotels, saying similarly negative things about demand in the sector.Choice lost 2.3 per cent to $26.01. Starwood added to Tuesday’s losses, falling
4 per cent to $21.31.A second initial public offering in less than a week reinforced optimism about demand for new equity, as shares in LogMeIn, a newly listed software maker, rose 25.1 per cent to $20.02 on its first day of trade."
48;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Goldman outlook dulls appetite for Cadbury;;Cadbury and Unilever were among the laggards on Thursday as sector rotation saved the FTSE 100 from registering a fifth straight fall.The food and drinks makers retreated after Goldman Sachs advised clients to switch into more economically sensitive stocks such as industrials. Cadbury slid 3.4 per cent to 517p and Associated British Foods was down 3.3 per cent to 628½p, while Unilever fell 2.2 per cent to £13.02.“Recent data makes us more confident the worst in the economic cycle is past, and we further move towards cyclicals from defensives,” strategist Peter Oppenheimer said.“While we believe that consensus needs to come down significantly, we think that the buy-side is already using more conservative numbers, so even if there are downward revisions and/or negative surprises, they might be met with a positive market response.”Mr Oppenheimer’s team turned more positive on the travel companies such as Thomas Cook, which bounced 9.3 per cent to 262¾p. The stock was also helped by news that Arcandor, its biggest shareholder, had made enquiries about receiving state aid ahead of a debt repayment in June.Meanwhile, Diageo lost 1.2 per cent to 772½p following Wednesday’s profit warnings from sector peers Pernod-Ricard and Constellation Brands.Separately, investors and analysts played down concerns that Diageo might be looking at a deal with Brown-Forman. While the US distiller looks increasingly like a merger candidate, Barcardi would be the obvious partner, they said.The FTSE 100 closed 58.19 points, or 1.5 per cent, higher at 3,983.71. That trimmed the benchmark’s weekly loss to 1.1 per cent.Banks were lifted on Thursday after Wells Fargo beating earnings estimates. Lloyds rose 10.9 per cent to 79½p and Royal Bank of Scotland was up 11.1 per cent to 29p.Barclays was 12.5 per cent higher at 177½p on confirmation it will sell iShares to CVC Partners for £3bn.British Land rose 7.4 per cent to 449½p amid hopes it was nearing the sale of half of its Broadgate estate for about £2.3bn.“A potential 50 per cent Broadgate disposal would be great for British Land,” JPMorgan said. “It would remove 100 per cent of debt from the balance sheet, reduce City office exposure and free up cash for acquisitions. In addition, it would send a bullish signal to the market.”Miners ticked higher along with base metals prices, which were helped by a reduction in London copper inventories. Vedanta was the day’s biggest gainer, up 13 per cent to 873½p after an in-line production report.Xstrata rose 9.3 per cent to 572½p after Glencore, its biggest shareholder, launched a refinancing with $5.5bn of loan syndications.Anglo American climbed 6.8 per cent to £13.96 after De Beers, 45 per cent owned by Anglo, said it should be profitable this year.Among the energy stocks, BG Group was up 2.3 per cent to £10.55 on word of a new discovery at its Santos Basin field in Brazil. Among the industrials, Invensys rose 1.8 per cent to 168p in spite of a Cazenove downgrade following this week’s profit warning from US rival Emerson Electric.With defensives out of favour, Centrica lost 0.4 per cent to 228½p in spite of a SocGen upgrade to “buy”.There were suggestions that Centrica may offer assets to EDF as it tries to renegotiate the price tag on its agreement to buy part of British Energy. Centrica’s majority stake in SPE-Luminus, the Belgian electricity supplier, is one asset rumoured to be on the table.“If Centrica walks away from the [British Energy] deal and goes instead for another acquisition in North Sea gas assets with financial discipline, we would expect the market to applaud,” said Société Générale.“In our view, taking over Venture Production makes perfect sense so long as it’s done below 950p.” Venture, in which Centrica owns a 23.6 per cent stake, was up 2.4 per cent to 820p.Mid-cap peer Salamander Energy climbed 16 per cent to 175¾p after test drilling at its Bualuang oil field boosted reserve estimates.

The deal, which would be paid for using Pulte stocks, valued Centex's shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 27.6 per cent to $9.72, while Pulte fell 4.3 per cent to $10.31.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3 as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar benefitted from that strength, gaining 10.9 per cent to $7.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index managed to find moderate gains after two loss-making sessions, rising 0.7 per cent to 821.26 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,832.97 points and the Nasdaq Composite index lifted 1.5 per cent to $1,584.31.Alcoa was the first major company to report its first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of $0.59 per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices. This was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell in post-market trade on Tuesday. But it recovered during Wednesday morning’s trade, with many analysts saying the results could have been even worse. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $7.86.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that the disappointing results from Alcoa were unlikely to spook investors. “The company tends to disappoint and is unlikely to move the market,” he wrote.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results. The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by disappointing demand in Europe and Australia over the winter festivities. Its shares lost 3.4 per cent to $11.24.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made $0.60 per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after the company said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. They gained 5.8 per cent to $34.55.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of $0.55 per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of $0.44 per share. Its shares picked up 19.2 per cent to $30.41.“It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market.”Mr Cook also said the results for consumer companies were encouraging, even though ABC figures showed that consumer confidence declined during the week ending April 5. “We are seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying,” said Mr Cook.The agricultural company Mosaic reported particularly disappointing results however, although it did not prove a major drag on the equities market as it is not listed on any of the best known market measures. The company made $0.18 per share compared to analysts’ estimates of $0.22 after prices tumbled last year. Its shares lost 1.2 per cent to $42.42.Many analysts are scrambling to lower their estimates on companies before the earnings season gathers pace next week. Wednesday saw Morgan Stanley fall after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the company’s first quarter earnings from $0.37 in profits per share to $0.59 in losses. Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 2.5 per cent to $22.73.Energy stocks were the major drag on the index however, as the price of oil continued to fall. Early in New York, oil was trading $0.89 lower at $48.26 per barrel of US crude. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped 0.8 per cent to $68.18 and $67.84 respectively.European stocks were mixed early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.1 per cent higher at 761.15 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, with the Nikkei 225 average closing 2.7 per cent lower at 8,595.01 points.Bond yields were down. The yield on the two-year Treasury note dropped 1 basis point to 0.899 per cent and that on the ten-year note fell 4bp to 2.858 per cent.The dollar was up against most major currencies except the yen early in New York. It gained 0.5 per cent to $1.3202 against the euro.Gold was trading $0.89 higher at $880.15 per troy ounce.

Microsoft was the exerted the greatest pull, gaining 2.3 per cent to $19.19.Alcoa was the first leading company to report first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of 59 cents per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices.That was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell before recovering some ground on Wednesday, and closed 3.5 per cent up at $8.06.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results.The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by falling demand in Europe and Australia over the Christmas period.

51;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2009-03-11T20:06:55Z;Spirits;;"How particular someone is over their choice of hooch tends to depend on whether it is their first, or their 10th drink. But the base assumption of the spirits industry is that, once the hangover is past, a drinker will return to his favourite brands. Yet with value seen to be the consumer touchstone of this recession, it would seem natural for high-end spirit brands to be affected as well. So far, though, there has been no change of tack from the spirits makers.Indeed, US-listed Constellation Brands disposed of its low-end spirit lines in January. Last week the French spirit house Pernod Ricard sold Cognac Bisquit, part of a €1bn disposal programme designed to cut the group’s €13bn of debt. It was only a tiny divestment, but the valuation nevertheless illustrates the strategy of selling low value businesses and buying expensive ones – Cognac sold for 1.3 times sales, compared with the three times that Pernod paid for the Absolut vodka owner Vin & Sprit a year ago, calculates Goldman Sachs.The hope is that with booze taking up just 1.5 per cent of the typical US household budget, customers will switch from bars to their living rooms, but still buy the same brands. Signs of this happening have been mixed. Consumption at home was up last year. But in the most recent set of trade figures from AC Nielsen, the research group, US spirits growth had slowed to just 1.3 per cent (for the four weeks to February 7). Pernod saw sales down 5 per cent, dragged down by weak Absolut volumes.Still, the decline by a third in Pernod’s market capitalisation since the €5.6bn Vin & Sprit purchase was announced suggests that the market has already discounted a sizeable amount of value destruction. Pernod now trades on a mere 10 times prospective earnings. With a long recession in prospect, it seems likely that people will turn to spirits in more ways than one.Pernod Ricard recently confirmed that it would achieve double-digit net profit growth from recurring operations for the full year – to a record €1bn – while Diageo, the world’s biggest spirits group, forecast a gloomier outlook.Both companies experienced a marked slowdown in sales. Diageo cut its profit growth forecast and Pernod Ricard reduced its full-year guidance for organic growth in profits from recurring operations to 5-8 per cent from “about 8 per cent” previously. Unlike Diageo, Pernod’s results were less dependent on cost-cutting.Pierre Pringuet, Pernod’s chief executive, attributed the company’s resilience in part to its decentralised structure, but he also made clear that there would be no acquisitions until 2011 as it concentrated on cutting debt.While some US consumers were trading down by buying cheaper brands, Mr Pringuet said there was little evidence of it taking place in other parts of the world. He expected trading up to continue in emerging markets, particularly China, but at a slower pace than before.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

52;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2008-09-26T08:53:16Z;Foster’s shares rise on bid speculation;;Foster’s was at the centre of takeover speculation on Friday as Deutsche Bank confirmed it had built a 5.3 per cent stake on behalf of an unknown investor and analysts suggested the Australian drinks group was in the sights of London-listed SABMiller and Heineken of the Netherlands.Shares in Foster’s have been battered after the group issued a profits warning in June when it reduced the carrying value of its global wine assets by A$1.2bn. The group is undergoing a strategic review with “all options open” and may look to shed its lower-margin wine assets.Trevor O’Hoy also quit as chief executive at that time, and Foster’s said yesterday that Ian Johnston, the former London–based executive of Cadbury Schweppes who had been acting in the role, had been confirmed as its new boss.A person close to Foster’s said the announcement of Mr Johnston’s appointment was not linked to Deutsche Bank’s shareholding disclosure.Foster’s defied a weaker Australian market on Friday to close 6 per cent higher at A$5.66 as bid talk swirled around the stock. The shares traded as low as A$4.32 after the June warning, compared with more than A$7 last year.Takeover interest in Foster’s comes amid a wider shake-up of the Australian and New Zealand consumer brands sectors.France’s Group Danone has put its New Zealand-based Frucor Beverages business on the auction block, with an expected price tag of A$800m to A$1bn, and is working with JPMorgan. Meanwhile, Cadbury Schweppes is looking to sell its Australian beverages unit and is believed to be working with UBS.Australian-listed Coca-Cola Amatil and Lion Nathan, listed in both Australia and New Zealand, are keen to expand their beverage businesses, while Lion Capital, a UK-based private equity group, and Japanese brewer Kirin may also show interest in the assets being sold.Kirin this year expanded in Australia by acquiring Dairy Farmers for A$884m, its second significant purchase in that market in the past two years.“Whoever wins Frucor is likely to go for the Cadbury unit,” an investment banker close to the situation said. He added that Foster’s had become a much more attractive target following the fall in its share price this year and after InBev of Belgium made an $52bn unsolicited bid for Anheuser-Busch, the US brewer, in July.Mr Johnston on Friday said that Foster’s would complete its strategic review before the end of 2008. He declined to comment on whether the group would sell its wine business or whether there had been takeover interest in the entire group.Rumours in Australia also suggested that Deutsche Bank could be working with an activist fund keen to win a seat at the table in the event Foster’s was broken up.Constellation Brands, the world’s largest wine producer, is also looking to restructure its Australian operations. The US drinks group plans to sell some of its vineyards and wine production facilities in the country.
53;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2008-05-21T16:40:33Z;Private equity acquires taste for US vineyards;;Wine-savvy financiers are planning to take advantage of an expected shake-out in California’s wine industry as the generation of winemakers that put the US on the viticulture map prepares to exit the business.Vinum Capital Management claims to be the first private equity group dedicated to the wine industry. Its partners are raising a $250m fund to make strategic investments in vineyards and wine-related companies in California, Oregon and Washington.The plan comes as the industry is approaching a turning point. Half of west coast vineyards are expected to change ownership in the next decade, according to a study by Silicon Valley Bank, a wine industry lender.“There is going to be a consolidation, just like we have seen in software and the internet,” said Stephen Kuhn, Vinum’s managing partner, a former banker and Silicon Valley entrepreneur.In recent years, big beverage companies such as Constellation Brands and Diageo have swooped to buy some of the biggest US wine producers.But many smaller vineyards established in the boom years that followed 1976 remain in the hands of their ageing founders, many of whom lack clear succession plans.In 1976 French judges had proclaimed California wines superior to their French counterparts in a blind taste test – the so-called Judgment of Paris.“There is a cluster of folks whose children may not want the business,” said Eileen Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, the wine industry consultancy.Mr Kuhn said Vinum was mindful of an old adage about winemaking: the easiest way to make a small fortune is to start with a large one.The company’s team included buy-out experts and winemakers, he said. Rolling up small vineyards could help them gain the attention of distributors that control sales of wine to US retail shops.“This is going to be a lot of fun, but this is a serious financial endeavour we are undertaking here.”Vinum’s focus will be on premium winemakers that have annual sales of 300,000 cases or fewer.The company will try to position vineyards to take advantage of an expected boom in demand for premium wines overseas, as rising incomes in countries such as India and China produce a new generation of connoisseurs.Vinum’s partners are travelling to the UK, Europe and the Middle East next month to meet potential investors.
54;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2008-02-15T18:47:10Z;Why ‘Evil Knievil’ is riding high;;One of the London’s most colourful and long-standing short sellers is Simon Cawkwell.The trained accountant, who likes to be known as Evil Knievil, on account of his daring stock market gambles, made his name shorting Robert Maxwell’s Maxwell Communication Corporation and Polly Peck International.But on Friday he was focusing on Northern Rock. Mr Cawkwell claims to have made £500,000 out of the stricken mortgage lender, but expects to make more.“As I go into this weekend I am short of 1m Northern Rock shares. I think Monday will be very interesting. The government will either say Richard Branson has got it or they will nationalise it,” he says. “I fully expect to pick up another £700,000 on Monday morning.”He says the fall out from the end of the credit bubble has been hugely beneficial to his shorting activities.“It has provided a ripe old harvest,” he says.Aside from Northern Rock, his other big short positions are two American companies: Constellation Brands, a wine and spirits group, and Arthrocare, a medical device company that has been battling short sellers.“The biggest frauds always happen in the US because the American investor is so trusting.”Mr Cawkwell has also shorted Artilium, the telecoms technology company. Losses sustained by investors in Artilium were partly responsible for Global Trader Europe, a spread betting house, being placed into administration this week.Mr Cawkwell was introduced to short-selling by a stockbroker during the 1970-73 bull market. Ironically, the broker was trying to hedge long positions owned by Mr Cawkwell.He says a successful short-seller has to be fairly “contemptuous of loss”.His advice for anyone considering short-selling is to “start small and work up”. “Short-selling is not an activity for those who like certainty in their lives.”Although Mr Cawkwell does not give investment advice, three times a week he discusses his short positions with his “diarist” on the website T1PS.com.
55;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2008-01-28T19:29:10Z;Diageo buys Rosenblum for £53m;;Diageo signalled its intention to dominate the US market for expensive wine by acquiring Rosenblum Cellars, one of the country’s biggest producers of zinfandel, for $105m (£53m).Ray Chadwick, president of Diageo’s Chateau & Estate Wines group, said: “Our goal is to be the leading premium wine company in the US.”It is the international drink group’s first wine acquisition since it bought the Chalone Wine Group in 2005 for about $260m.Rosenblum was founded by Kent Rosenblum, a vet from Minnesota who started his own vineyard specialising in zinfandel and Rhône varieties of wines after moving to California in 1970.Today, Rosenblum has several different ranges of wines, selling for between $12 and $50.Its wines are distributed throughout the US and in 16 other countries.The premium wine market is dominated by Constellation Brands, the US drinks group, and Kendall-Jackson, a family-run wine company.Mr Chadwick said the zinfandel category was showing “tremendous growth” in the US.“Premium wine is a true growth category,” he said, adding that during the past three years, wines selling for more than $10 had shown double-digit sales growth.By 2010, the US is expected to be the biggest market for wine globally, overtaking France and Italy.Americans are forecast to drink 27.3m hectolitres of wine in 2010 – 12.3 per cent of total world consumption – according to Vinexpo, a wine and spirits fair, and the International Wine and Spirit Record. The French drink more wine than other nations but consumption has fallen during the past decade amid tougher drink-driving laws and new restrictions on alcohol advertising.Meanwhile, US wine producers such as Constellation, Kendall-Jackson and E&J Gallo have created palatable wines at reasonable prices, which has encouraged Americans to drink more.Wine remains a small part of Diageo’s overall business, accounting for just £253m in sales in the financial year ending in June 2007, compared with £1.64bn in spirits.But Mr Chadwick said that owning wine brands helped Diageo negotiate deals for its spirits brands with its customers.
56;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2007-10-04T20:47:03Z;Wall St edges higher ahead of jobs data;;"Wall Street stocks closed marginally higher on Thursday as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of crucial non-farm payroll numbers for September, due on Friday.“Any large equity market move ahead of the payroll number is premature,” said Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent higher at at 1542.84. The index had traded in a narrow range between 1,537.63 and 1,544.02. Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index was moderately lower. The Vix was off 2.3 per cent at 18.37, but is higher by 2 .1 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,733.57.Shares in Research in Motion jumped 4.4 per cent to $100.54 ahead of earnings results. After the closing bell RIM reported fiscal second quarter profit that met expectations but raised guidance for the third quarter. The stock fell 1 per cent in after-hours trade.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction firmer at 13,974.31.A boost for the Dow came from the pharmaceutical giants. Merck was up 1.4 per cent at $52.86, while Pfizer climbed 0.9 per cent to $25.30.The payroll report looms as a crucial piece of data for investors after jobs in August fell 4,000, the first monthly contraction in four years. Economists expect job gains of 115,000 last month.“The market is coming to the view that the US September employment report will provide a riposte to the weakness in the August data, with many indicators, notably the sum of states and initial claims suggesting the August numbers overstated labour market weakness,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.The forecast rebound in payrolls is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines when policy makers meet at the end of the month, say economists.“An indication that the labour market picture is not as dire as suggested by last month’s report should lead the Fed to hold policy steady at the October 30/31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting,” said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley.At this juncture, interest rate futures indicate a split as to whether the FOMC cuts its 4.75 per cent Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent or 4.50 per cent by the end of the year.The tone of the labour report could test the bullish resolve of equity investors as further rate cuts this year are seen helping offset a weak third-quarter earnings season. The major benchmarks have rallied 10 per cent from their lows in August and this week
the Dow set a new record high.“Equities are back on a narrow path and do not want a payroll number that is strong enough to suggest rate cuts are off the table,” said Mr Peta. “But the market does not want a weak payroll number that spurs renewed talk of a recession.”Third-quarter S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to expand 2 per cent over the year, according to Thomson Financial. That is down from a forecast of 6.2 per cent at the start of July.Among the leading sectors on Thursday were utility, telecoms and energy. Conversely, consumer discretionary and technology stocks underperformed the market.Financial stocks extented gains this week as a number of banks issued earnings warnings for pending third quarter results.Mr Peta said: “It was too early to jump back into financials at this juncture, but investors clearly believe the worst is over for the sector.”In earnings news, Marriott International reported a 7 per cent decline in third-quarter profit, but the result was above analyst expectations. Shares fell 4.6 per cent to $42.28.Meanwhile, ArvinMeritor, the car parts supplier, issued a lower fiscal fourth-quarter outlook due to a weak commercial vehicle sector. The stock slid 3.1 per cent to at $16.22.In corporate news, CVS Caremark said September sales at stores open at least one year rose 5 per cent. Pharmacy same-store sales for the five weeks ended September 29 rose 4.3 per cent and were hurt by recent generic drug introductions. Company shares rose 1 per cent to $38.66.Constellation Brands said that its second-quarter profit rose 9.2 per cent as strong spirits sales helped to offset a drop in wine shipments to US wholesalers and heightened competition in Britain. Its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $25.00."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Companies pay a one-off entry charge in return for tax exemption, allowing them to pass property profits to shareholders through higher dividend payments.Asset-rich pub companies Greene King, Mitchells & Butlers, Punch Taverns and Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries have all said they would look at the new legislation.However, Mr Thorley said that the best long-term returns for Punch shareholders was provided by its current business structure.Analysts have long suggested that Punch was the pub company most likely to be involved in corporate activity because of its asset backing – 94 per cent of its estate is freehold or on long leases.Punch is due to finish the conversion of 700 managed pubs to leased outlets by August and has been shuffling its portfolio in recent months.It moved into the the drinks distribution business by forming a 50-50 joint venture with Constellation Brands to become owners of Matthew Clark, the drinks wholesaler. Last month it sold 869 pubs to Admiral Taverns for £326m to focus on its more profitable premises.Mr Thorley said Punch now had a pub estate “of the highest quality”.Revenue for the 28 weeks to March 3 rose from £618.9m to £921.1m thanks to higher rental charges and drinks price inflation. Pre-tax profit rose from £108.3m to £138.1m.Basic earnings per share, after exceptional items, rose 11 per cent to 42.9p. The interim dividend rose 16 per cent to 5.1p. Punch said that second-half trading was in line with expectations.

Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to a “sell” from “neutral” and cut its price target to $10 from $12. Shares in Micron fell 4.6 per cent at $11.51.Boosting sentiment for technology was Research In Motion, up 2.3 per cent at $145.77, after Goldman raised its earnings estimates for the maker of the BlackBerry hand held personal organiser and maintained a price target of $185 a share.Meanwhile, another tech bellwether, Yahoo, was up 1.1 per cent at $31.96. Goldman raised its price target on the internet search group to $35 from $31.50.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.25 per cent to 12,560.20, with tech giant Hewlett-Packard, up 1.7 per cent at $41.80, and General Motors, up 2.8 per cent at $31.90, leading blue chips higher.Meanwhile, Constellation Brands reported a 26 per cent rise in profit during the fourth quarter. Strong wine sales compensated for lower sales of imported beer and its share price was 3.2 per cent higher at $21.49.Sealy slid 4 per cent to $17.14 after the mattress maker said first quarter profit rose 7 per cent, but sales growth was maintained by reduced prices.Both the Dow and the Nasdaq have now risen for the past six trading days and stocks have repaired most of the damage inflicted by the sell-off in late February and early March.While the cash equity market is closed on Friday, stock futures will trade during the morning, enabling investors to take account of any dramatic deviation in the data, according to traders.“Any moves will play out in S&P futures,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “Unless there is a dramatic result, there should be little impact for stocks.”Economists expect March payrolls to have expanded by 135,000, and that the unemployment rate will rise to 4.6 per cent from 4.5 per cent.A much weaker result would fan concerns that the economy is slowing faster than expected, analysts say.Jim Caron, co-head of global interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley, said the unemployment rate and hourly earnings are important components of the report for investors. “We still think that the trend favours tight labour markets and rising wages, that is the lynch pin to the economy these days.”Once the payroll report is out of the way, equity investors will focus on the earnings season, which begins in earnest next week when Alcoa releases its first quarter results on Tuesday.At the start of the year, analysts expected first quarter earnings growth in the region of 8.7 per cent according to Thomson Financial. That call has been reduced to 3.6 per cent.“It could be difficult for the market to make further gains if we see disappointing earnings results,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said low earnings expectations were “pretty much baked into the cake”. He added: “We are at a point in the cycle when earnings growth slows, but the market can still do well this year if inflation moderates.”

It eased back to 15.74, up 2.1 per cent.“It has been a sell-first and ask questions later kind of day,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “We are in a period of extreme uncertainty and volatility that is likely to continue.”By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent at 12,234.34. It slumped more than 200 points in the first hour of trading before recovering to move briefly into positive territory.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,403.17.After a long bull run, the S&P and Dow are down 1.1 and 1.8 per cent respectively for the year.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,404.21.Oracle stock gained 2.1 per cent to $16.77 after the group said it had agreed to buy Hyperion Solutions for $3.3bn in cash. Shares in Hyperion jumped 20.3 per cent to $51.55.The proposed deal fuelled takeover speculation across the sector. Shares in the software group Cognos, were 2.5 per cent stronger at $39.06 on talk of an approach from Germany’s SAP.Motorola shares jumped 1.7 per cent to $18.83 after Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, said he would increase his holding.Shares in Apple rose 2.9 per cent to $87.06 after analysts at Lehman Brothers raised their rating on the stock, anticipating strong sales of its new mobile phone.The troubles of mortgage lenders continued to weigh on sentiment.Shares in Countrywide were on the defensive after the mortgage lender said that the rate of defaults on its loans to borrowers with patchy credit had increased. Its shares eased 2.4 per cent to $37.44.IndyMac, which focuses on prime mortgages with less strict lending criteria, said that defaults on loans would hit its profits this year, sending its shares 6.3 per cent lower to $32.16.Goodyear advanced after the group said it was freezing its pension scheme for some employees. The potential savings lifted its shares 6.2 per cent to $26.15.Constellation Brands stock plunged 14.5 per cent to $20.06 after the drinks maker said its 2008 revenue and profit might decline.

buyers.Stronger-than-expected job creation in December sent stocks lower on Friday and tipped them into negative territory for the week. Equity investors began the year optimistic that a Federal Reserve rate cut before June would offset slower earnings growth.“A rate cut is looking less likely in the first half of this year,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank. “The most important factor for the equity market this year will be evidence of inflation moderating and trending lower as it will give the Fed the flexibility to cut rates should the economy slow further.”The S&P 500 settled down 0.6 per cent at 1,409.71 on Friday, a fall of 0.6 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent lower at 2,434.25, but was 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.7 per cent to 12,398.01, a fall of 0.5 per cent this week, and was down from a new record high of 12,580.35 on Wednesday.Although a $6 plunge in the price of oil this week should help allay fears of inflation, energy stocks were hit hard and the S&P 500 energy index slid 4.8 per cent for the week. But the S&P information technology sector was 1.5 per cent firmer.Among technology stocks that fared well was BMC Software, rising 8.4 per cent to $34.92, while Yahoo, which declined 35 per cent last year, rose 8.6 per cent to $27.74. Another laggard from 2006 was Intel, but the stock rose 4.2 per cent to $21.10 this week and was the best stock in the Dow.Cisco shares rallied 4.2 per cent to $28.47 after the company announced that it had bought e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.“Technology has a higher weighting in our portfolios than was the case a year ago,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at RiverSource Investments.He said large software companies were also attractive “as they are very good cashflow generators and trade at cheap multiples”.Not all tech shares rose. Motorola plunged 7.9 per cent to $18.94 for the week after the mobile phone maker said lower sales would reduce fourth quarter earnings below estimates.AT&T led the Dow lower this week, falling 5 per cent to $33.96. Another Dow laggard was Exxon Mobil, as its shares fell 4.4 per cent to $73.24 on plunging oil prices. Chevron slid 4.1 per cent
to $70.55. ConocoPhillips slumped 6.3 per cent to $67.42 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.Wal-Mart rose 2.6 per cent to $47.39 as its same-store sales were better than expected, making it the second best performing stock in the Dow.Goodyear Tire & Rubber shares jumped 10.9 per cent to $23.28 after an upgrade to “buy” from Deutsche. Workers ended a three-month strike against the company’s plans to cut costs.Constellation Brands slumped 15.9 per cent to $24.41 and led losses in

63;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Swedish premier welcomes bids in big sell-off;;Sweden’s government will not succumb to economic protectionism in its forthcoming disposal of multi-billion dollar state holdings in industry, the country’s new centre-right prime minister has said.Fredrik Reinfeldt said foreign investors were welcome to take part in the asset sales that are set to clear the way for one of the most significant periods of corporate restructuring in recent Swedish history. “I am not ruling anyone out,” Mr Reinfeldt told the FT.His remarks came as his centre-right alliance prepares to embark on the initial phase of sell-offs of stakes in banking, telecommmunications and airlines. The government hopes to raise SEK150bn ($21.8bn, €16.6bn, £11.2bn) in the first three years of the disposal programme.Mr Reinfeldt sought to distance himself from some of his counterparts in Europe and the US who have moved to protect national companies targeted for takeover by foreign companies. “We are stronger on free trade than some other countries that sound as if they are building up national protection again,” he said.Foreign interest in the asset disposal programme is high. There has been a steady stream of investment bankers visiting the country since elections in September brought Mr Reinfeldt to office and ended 12 years of Social Democrat rule.The Swedish government has stakes in 57 companies or groups that employ around 200,000 people with an estimated combined value of about SEK500bn.These include 19.5 per cent of Nordea, the Nordic region’s largest bank, 45.3 per cent of TeliaSonera, the telecoms company, 6.7 per cent of OMX, the stock market operator, and 21.4 per cent in SAS, the airline.The government’s other holdings include ownership of V&S, maker of Absolut vodka, and stakes in companies in property and pharmaceuticals. Constellation Brands, the Australian group, and Pernod-Ricard of France have both expressed interest in acquiring the iconic vodka brand.The prospect of large stakes in Swedish companies being sold to foreigners has proved controversial in the past and could do so again.Mr Reinfeldt made clear each sale would be treated on a case-by-case basis and he would ensure no Swedish jobs were lost unnecessarily as a result of the asset disposal programme.“We have a long-term responsibility. We would like to see a sale that is open to a job creation process, rather than one that sees less jobs.“We want the best price, but some of the companies are linked to Swedish interests. There needs to be individual reasoning.”The money raised from the sales will be used to finance Mr Reinfeldt’s election pledges to cut taxes and create jobs, which have already run into opposition from Sweden’s powerful unions.Landsorganisationen (LO), which represents 15 labour unions with 1.83m members, has arranged nationwide demonstrations on December 14 to protest against proposed cuts in unemployment benefits.Mr Reinfeldt backed their right to protest, but vowed to press ahead with his refrorms. “I have a majority government in parliament. I can act on that majority.“I do not seek or need a conflict with the trade unions,” he said.Independent analysis of Sweden’s economy by McKinsey, the management consultancy, concluded a deregulation programme should boost productivity, increase employment and raise tax revenues over time.
64;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2006-11-10T12:00:32Z;The wages of sin can outperform more responsible investments;;"There are literally
hundreds of funds which follow socially responsible or green investment criteria. But what about funds which take the opposite view, specifically targeting the gambling, tobacco, alcohol and armament industries?Charles Norton, a straight-talking Texan, manages such a fund. It is aptly named the Vice Fund.The manager of this US mutual fund admits he does not fit the bill when it comes to being sinful or nefarious. He never smokes. He rarely drinks. And he moved home to Texas from New York City because he and his wife wanted to raise their two children in a more peaceful environment than the East Coast urban jungle offered.“People think the fund would be managed by some sort of cowboy who comes to work drunk, but I’m more of a conservative family man,” he says somewhat earnestly.For Norton, investing in “vice stocks” is simply about looking for the best return.Norton likes to invest in these four types of sinful stocks for no other reason than they are “very strong” performers. Why? They are all in recession-proof industries. Whether markets swing up or down, wars will be waged, gamblers will head to the tables and people will light up cigarettes and have a beer or a gin and tonic.Norton is not the only notable investor who subscribes to this theory. He points out that Ben Bernanke, before he was made chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that Altria, the cigarette maker, is the lone stock he has in his portfolio.Tobacco is the most popular sector within the portfolio. Altria is the biggest holding at 5.33 per cent. Other large ones include British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Diageo, Constellation Brands, MGM Mirage and Harrah’s Entertainment. Almost 70 per cent of the fund is invested in US stocks and about 22 per cent is in non-US ones. About 7 per cent of the fund remains in cash. Norton’s strategy is to take a “30,000-foot view” and look at trends and then conduct research to figure out which companies to invest in.What are his views? When it comes to alcohol, breweries with considerable exposure to the US market are not a particularly good pick as more Americans are electing to drink wine and spirits.“That trend would lead us to buy a Heineken or AmBev, which have more exposure to Europe and emerging markets,” Norton says. US tobacco stocks are a better bet largely because many companies have won lawsuits filed by smokers. And the future for gambling companies also looks rosy as the market for casinos is expected to open up in Asia. And last, defence stocks represent a particularly good deal given the amount of money dedicated by governments to funding wars. This year, defence stocks are set to outperform the Standard & Poor’s 500 for the sixth time in the past seven years, according to Norton.Norton took the reins of the Vice Fund, which is based in Dallas, in September last year. The fund now has $64m in assets and 54 holdings. For Europeans, the fund is only open to investors with accounts at certain US brokerages such as Fidelity and Ameritrade.During his short tenure, Norton has had no need to atone for performance as the fund has reported a 14.7 per cent return in the last 11 months, against an 11.7 per cent return by the index for all-cap growth mutual funds, according to Standard & Poor’s.The fact that prissier types might avoid putting money into his portfolio is only an advantage, says Norton. “These sectors are widely overlooked,” he says.Norton is careful to declare himself an agnostic when it comes to debating the merits of smoking, drinking, gambling or war. “We’re not advocating or promoting these businesses. And I wouldn’t want to tell any of our investors that smoking or drinking might be good for them.”"
65;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2006-04-03T22:57:15Z;Constellation wins battle for Canada’s Vincor;;Constellation Brands on Monday finally got its hands on Vincor International, a Canadian winemaker, after a five-month battle.It agreed to pay C$1.27bn (US$1.08bn) for a company that will cement Constellation’s position as the world’s largest wine producer.The price paid – C$36.50 a share – represents a premium of 55.5 per cent to Vincor’s closing share price in September, when Constellation first approached, and was rebuffed by, Vincor. It is a premium of 15.9 per cent to Vincor’s closing share price last Friday.Constellation went hostile shortly after Vincor’s refusal to discuss the matter but the company’s offer expired in December. Richard Sands, Constellation’s CEO, said the deal was revived in recent weeks. During his company’s previous attempt to buy Vincor, he said the target was not a “must-have” purchase.But he told the FT on Monday: “We always believed that this was a natural fit and that this combination was meant to be.”Vincor’s brands include Jackson-Triggs wine and Kumala, a South African wine that has been popular in Britain since the late 1980s.The purchase is Constellation’s ninth since 2000 as Mr Sands has aggressively grown the business through acquisition. The company bought Robert Mondavi wines for US$1.36bn in 2004.Marc Swartzberg, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said: “The acquisition’s profile – strategically and financially – is typical of an acquisition strategy that has been the single biggest driver of more than $5bn in value creation over the last seven years.”Other analysts said that Constellation did not appear to have overpaid. Caroline Levy of UBS said Vincor would give it another 20 per cent share of the high margin Canadian market.“The acquisition [will] also add fast-growing brands in the UK and US along with significant synergies in both of those markets in terms of overhead reduction and grape costs.”Constellation shares closed up 0.8 per cent at $25.25.
66;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2006-01-05T20:15:23Z;Constellation Brands’ earnings hit record;;Strong sales of wine – and of beers imported into the US – helped Constellation Brands to deliver record third-quarter earnings, but a cautious outlook sent the world’s largest wine producer’s shares down almost 3 per cent.Sales at the company rose 17 per cent, boosted by the 2004 acquisition of winery Robert Mondavi and sales of Ruffino wines, which it started distributing in the US last year.Imported beer sales grew 16 per cent, boosted by Corona, the Mexican beer that is the biggest-selling imported beer in the US.Net income rose 12 per cent to $109m, with earnings per share up 10 per cent at 46 cents a share. Constellation said fourth-quarter earnings would be hurt by costs associated with last month’s failed bid for Vincor, a Canadian wine maker. It expected fourth-quarter earnings of 34-37 cents a share, below analysts’ expectations of 38 cents.Constellation is benefiting as younger drinkers shift from mass-market beers to wine. It has taken advantage of the trend by launching wines with more accessible labels such as Monkey Bay sauvignon blanc from New Zealand and Twin Fin and 3 Blind Moose, both Californian wines.Richard Sands, chief executive, said: “No matter what demographic you are talking about wine is the category people are moving to. This new consumer group wants wine to be approachable.”Most of Constellation’s wines sell for $10-$15 a bottle. That price range commands double the margin of wines at about $3. Net sales of branded wines in the US were up by 50 per cent compared with the year-ago quarter.Operating income at the company’s wine unit rose 44 per cent to $184m. Its operating margin was 20 per cent, compared with 16.5 per cent a year earlier.While branded wine sales were up by 4 per cent, the UK business was down slightly as wine and spirit sellers suffered from a continuing shift in the business to off-licences and retailers from restaurants and bars.● Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, said increased market share in supermarkets and a 2.7 per cent rise in fourth-quarter sales to retailers were “encouraging”. Months of price cuts have helped stem a decline in Anheuser’s market share in recent months, partly at the expense of arch-rival SABMiller.
67;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2006-01-05T19:49:39Z;Lex: Constellation Brands;;The stars have not been well aligned for Constellation Brands lately. Last summer, the world’s largest wine maker lost out to Pernod Ricard and Fortune Brands in the battle for British spirits group Allied Domecq. Just as investors were starting to forgive it, Constellation made a similarly ill-fated attempt to buy Vincor, the Canadian wine maker.That must be annoying for a company that has grown largely through acquisitions. It is not necessarily disconcerting for its shareholders, who have long been denied such treats as the occasional cash dividend on common stock.After all, Constellation snapped up a few smaller targets recently. It is also starting to deliver some of the promised benefits from buying Mondavi and has done surprisingly well in the challenging UK market. Overall, the market share of higher priced wine continues to grow, helping to lift margins. Profitability trends are less encouraging in spirits and beer. But rising sales of Corona and the other Mexican beers it distributes more than offset that.Having grown Corona to its current size, Constellation appears well placed to renew and perhaps even extend its distribution rights geographically. More worrying is the prospect of a sharply increased US grape harvest, to coincide with Australia’s continuing wine glut. Constellation, moreover, is showing no signs of relinquishing its spirits ambitions. Add its subdued guidance and a rating at 16 times this fiscal years earnings, and its shares hardly look tempting yet.
68;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Consumer Industry year in review;;The big consumer products industry story of the year was the news of Procter & Gamble’s decision in January to buy Gillette for $57bn. The merger - cleared by US antitrust authorities in September on condition that Gillette sell a handful of brands including Right Guard deodorant - signalled the sector’s desire to boost growth through global scale and higher margins in the face of large retailers pushing down prices.In April, France’s Pernod Ricard struck a deal to acquire Allied Domecq, bringing together the world’s second and third largest makers of spirits and enabling it to compete more effectively with market leader Diageo. The US drinks group Constellation Brands subsequently pulled out of the ensuing bid battle, leaving Pernod to seal the £7.6bn ($13.3bn) deal.Meanwhile, in October Reckitt Benckiser said it would buy Boots’ non-prescription drugs business for £1.9bn. Boots Healthcare International owns the Lemsip and Disprin cold remedies, as well as the painkiller Nurofen, and Boots needed to sell the business before it could merge with Alliance Unichem. Reckitt expects that the acquisition will lead to annual cost synergies of £75m by 2008.Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch home and personal care conglomerate, launched a £1.1m restructuring and rebranding programme, overhauling its Unilever.com website to serve consumers. Flat European markets have been an issue for the company, which issued its first-ever profit warning in 2004. In February this year it abandoned its 75-year old dual chairman/chief executive structure and launched sweeping management changes. And in September, the company said it was conducting a review of its western European frozen foods business that could lead to a sale of the operation. Its frozen food brand names include Birds Eye in the UK, Iglo in Germany and Findus in Italy.The fallout from the €14bn ($16.5bn) accounting scandal that led to the collapse in 2003 of Parmalat, the Italian dairy company, has continued. September saw the start of the trial of 16 of the company’s former executives, including founder Calisto Tanzi on charges that included market-rigging and false auditing, began in Milan. In October, Parmalat relisted in Milan, two years after the accounting scandal that brought the company down. The following month, Enrico Bondi, the government-appointed administrator who has run Parmalat since its implosion, was voted in by shareholders to be the company’s chief executive.
69;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-12-09T18:19:10Z;Dividends at Vincor after seeing off Constellation;;Vincor International, the Canadian winemaker, has rewarded shareholders with a quarterly dividend and share buybacks after fighting off a $944m (C$1.1bn) takeover bid by Constellation Brands, the US drinks group.Constellation’s offer of C$33 a share expired at midnight on Thursday after failing to win the necessary two-thirds support from Vincor shareholders.Richard Sands, Constellation’s chief executive, said that his company “could not let this process continue indefinitely. In these circumstances, we will move on to other priorities”.Constellation originally offered C$31 a share, and had indicated that it might be willing to raise its bid to C$35 in a friendly deal.Nevertheless, Constellation may renew its assault on Vincor. Mr Sands has a track record of aggressively pursuing acquisitions and integrating them rapidly.One person familiar with the matter said Constellation was undecided until the very last minute whether to extend the tender offer. He added that the decision to drop the bid did not mean Constellation had entirely lost interest in Vincor. The US drinks group is expected to monitor the reaction by Vincor shareholders.Tim Ramey, an analyst at broker D.A. Davidson, said: “We think this remains a game of high-stakes chicken. We would caution against bidding the shares up …on the view that a deal will not happen.” Vincor, whose brands include Inniskillin in Canada, California’s Toasted Head and Kim Crawford in New Zealand, has reached out to other prospective suitors, and some analysts have predicted that other bids will emerge.Vincor said that the new quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share reflected the board’s opinion that its operations “are at a level of maturity and sustainability that shareholders should be able to share in the company’s success”.
70;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-11-28T19:15:00Z;Vincor rejects Constellation’s improved bid;;Vincor, the Canadian wine maker, rejected an improved cash offer of $944m, equivalent to C$33 a share, from Constellation Brands, the US drinks company.Constellation raised its unsolicited bid on Monday from $31 tabled in September in an effort to put pressure on the Canadian winemaker to enter takeover talks.Constellation also said it was prepared to bid C$35 a share for an agreed deal with Vincor, whose brands include Inniskillin, Jackson-Triggs and Toasted Head.Vincor has been steadfast in its opposition to Constellation’s approaches, deeming them inadequate, and has not allowed the New York-based company any access to its financial information. Vincor said on Monday that the C$33 offer fell short of the board’s view of the price that would be sufficient to allow access to non-public information.Richard Sands, Constellation chief executive, earlier described the increased offer as “best and final”.He said his company did not need any additional information to launch a tender offer for Vincor at C$33 per share, but reiterated a proposal made privately last week that involved Constellation raising its bid to C$35 per share if the Canadian company’s board supported the deal.Constellation shares dipped 1.43 per cent to $22.80 by lunchtime trading, while Vincor shares rose 0.9 per cent to C$34.40.Since Constellation made its initial approach in September, Vincor has defended itself by insisting the offer undervalued the cost savings that could be achieved in a takeover. It has also been reaching out unsuccessfully to alternative buyers.Last week, Vincor dropped a “poison pill” provision in its charter that would have made it more difficult for Constellation to win a take-over battle.Constellation has been attempting to expand its wine business through acquisitions. Last year, it completed the purchase of California-based Robert Mondavi for $1.4bn.
71;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-09-30T20:44:33Z;‘Incredibly resilient’ week for Wall Street;;Wall Street tacked on gains slowly over the past week in the face of uncertainties over the impact of hurricanes Rita and Katrina and achieved their first September advances in seven years.All the main equity indices finished the week, and the third quarter, with respectable gains in spite of yesterday’s news that consumer spending fell an unexpectedly steep 0.5 per cent in August, the biggest drop since November 2001.By the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 0.2 per cent to 10,568.70 and the S&P 500 index had fallen 0.1 per cent to 1,228.81. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent behind at 2,151.69.For the week, the Dow put on 1.4 per cent as the S&P 500 gained 1.1 per ent and the Nasdaq added 1.6 per cent.The Dow advanced 2.9 per cent in the quarter ending on Friday, while the S&P 500 put on 3.1 per cent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq advanced 4.6 per cent.Seasoned bulls appeared impressed by the market’s ability to withstand the impact of the hurricanes and other negatives over the quarter.“It’s been tremendously resilient,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “We’ve had two of the largest natural catastrophes in our nation’s history back-to-back, seen one of our major cities decimated and had 28 per cent of our refining capacity put out of business. The Fed Reserve has continued to raise rates, the news on the ground from Iraq is terrible every day and we have tremendous divisiveness in Washington.“I think it is very impressive that the market did not fall. We bent, but we did not break.”Mr Goldman forecast earnings growth of about 10 per cent in the forthcoming third quarter reporting season and that the S&P 500 would end the year about 6 per cent higher at 1,300. He estimated that Wall St was currently trading on a multiple of about 15.5 times 12-month forward earnings.Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, agreed the resilience of Wall Street was “absolutely incredible”.“You have to wonder how much higher this market would be without the bad news,” he said. However, Mr Hogan warned that the market was not out of the woods yet, with gasoline prices still elevated, higher heating bills due to start arriving in the coming months and healthcare costs also increasing.The early signs of the challenges facing US stocks could be reflected in the indices’ monthly performance as the quarter drew to a close and the impact of Katrina and Rita on the economy became apparent. In September, the Dow and the S&P 500 both advanced a timid 0.8 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively, while the Nasdaq was flat. Nevertheless, the bulls found solace in the fact that it was the first winning September for Wall Street in seven years.“The effects of some of things that have already happened are still to be felt in the fourth quarter,” Mr Hogan said.This week saw an onslaught of corporate news, ranging from earnings to merger-and-acquisition activity and initial public offerings.A stream of deals hit the headlines almost every day. Tuesday’s news that WellPoint agreed to buy WellChoice sent the latter’s shares 7 per cent higher for the session. They rose 7.5 per cent on the week.A day later, NRG Energy saw its shares advance 3.7 per cent on news the power plant operator was in talks to acquire Texas Genco. It finished the week up 5.2 per cent.Then on Thursday the $1.6bn acquisition of JPMorgan’s BrownCo unit by E*Trade sent the online broker’s shares 5.5 per cent higher.By the close on Friday, they had advanced 7.3 per cent for the week.Also on Thursday, the shares of IDX Systems shot up 23 per cent on news that the healthcare software company’s success had induced General Electric into acquiring it.IDX Systems gained 26.6 per cent up on the week.Not all bid news led to actual bids, as Constellation Brands discovered midweek. An unsolicited – and rejected – bid from the drinks group for Canadian rival Vincor sent the latter’s stock up sharply in Toronto, while Constellation shares rose 1.8 per cent on Wednesday. On the week, the shares lost 1.7 per cent as Vincor invited the company to try again.Earnings news highlights this week included Red Hat, the open-source software company, whose above-estimate results sent the shares almost 30 per cent up on Thursday. They finished the week 30.6 per cent higher.The same session also saw six new companies debut on Wall Street. WebMD, a medical information portal, was the most successful among them, closing its first session up 39.4 per centm tacking on another 1 per cent on Friday.
72;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-09-27T23:07:55Z;Constellation in $1.2bn hostile bid for Vincor;;Constellation Brands, the US drinks group, on Tuesday night launched an unsolicited takeover offer worth C$1.4bn ($1.2bn) for Vincor International, a Canadian wine company.The move is another sign of the rapidly consolidating wine and spirits business which is growing as drinkers continue to shift away from beer and towards higher value drinks such as wine.It also comes after Constellation earlier this year withdrew from an attempt to buy some of the spirits brands of UK’s Allied Domecq, which was later snapped up by Fortune Brands and Pernod Ricard.Constellation already moved to expand in the wine business last year when it completed the acquisition of Robert Mondavi, the California-based wine producer, for $1.4bn.Constellation is offering Vincor shareholders C$31.00 per share in cash - or the equivalent of a 39 per cent premium over Vincor’s value before Constellation’s initial proposal, discussed with the Canadian company’s management on September 9. The transaction value of C$1.4bn includes the assumption of C$305m in Vincor debt.“We are disappointed that the Vincor board has refused to engage in meaningful discussions with Constellation regarding our premium proposal, said Richard Sands, Constellation’s chairman and chief executive.“This transaction is a unique opportunity for Vincor and its shareholders to receive a significant cash premium for their shares despite the very difficult operating conditions Vincor faces in markets such as the US, the UK and Australia where it lacks scale.“Vincor has wineries throughout Canada in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. In addition, Vincor has small operations in the US, Western Australia and New Zealand, and is an importer, marketer and distributor in the UK. Its premium brands include Inniskillin, Jackson-Triggs, Toasted Head, Hogue, Goundrey, Amberley and Sawmill Creek.Constellation Brands has identified possible acquisitions worth between $500m and $2bn in the global spirits sector.Constellation formed a consortium that included a number of private equity groups this year to try to put a bid together to purchase Allied after the UK drinks company had agreed to be acquired by France’s Pernod Ricard.A successful purchase of Allied would have been an important strategic transaction, Mr Sands told the FT recently, adding that Constellation had been working with other parties to examine the possibility of buying Allied years before. “The portfolio of brands represented the largest premium semi-global portfolio that could become available.”Citigroup is advising Constellation.
73;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-07-15T15:42:51Z;Kevin Goldstein-Jackson: Cash rolls;;My self-invested personal pension scheme (Sipp) has recently increased its already large cash pile – and yet more cash is due to arrive soon.In April, when Allied Domecq announced it was in “early stage” discussions regarding a takeover bid by Pernod Ricard, I hoped that rival bidders would emerge to drive the share price higher.Unfortunately, the only rival to appear was a consortium led by US drinks firm Constellation Brands which made an “indicative proposal” regarding a potential offer. On June 17 the consortium announced it would not proceed with a bid.This left me with having to decide whether to sell Allied shares in the market or accept Pernod’s offer of 545p in cash and 0.0158 of a new Pernod Ricard share for each Allied share held. Or, according to the offer document, I could attempt a “mix and match election” to vary the proportions of cash and Pernod shares received. It was estimated that cash and “statements of entitlements” to new Pernod shares would be issued “by 9 August”.I thought taking cash from selling in the market was the quickest, safest and easiest option so sold my Sipp’s Allied holding on June 20 for 676.1p per share. This month I also received Allied’s interim dividend of 6.5p per share.My Allied shareholding has therefore been quite profitable since the shares had cost 292p each in January 2000.Also on June 20 I sold my Sipp’s holding in Falkland Oil and Gas (FOG) for 120p each. The shares had been acquired as a result of FOG’s offer of shares at 40p each when it floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in October last year.The temptation to take such a good profit was too great to resist. My Sipp still has a holding in Falkland Islands Holdings which has a large shareholding in FOG so I should still benefit if oil and gas are eventually commercially extracted by FOG’s activities.More cash will flow into my Sipp if shareholders in Radamec approve its plans for a members’ voluntary liquidation (MVL) at an extraordinary general meeting on July 28. After selling land and various high-tech subsidiaries, Radamec accrued a pile of cash and the MVL has been proposed as a way of distributing that cash to shareholders.According to the company’s June 30 circular to shareholders, it is proposed that, “in the absence of any unforeseen circumstances”, the first of a number of capital distributions in cash will be made “between six and eight weeks after the commencement of the MVL”.While my Sipp will show a profit from its Radamec holding, the same cannot be said of its dreadful investment in Xenova which is currently the target of a bid by Celtic Pharma Development UK.In July 1999 my Sipp invested in two Cambridge-based companies: Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) and Cantab Pharmaceuticals, paying 186p and 196p per share respectively.I sold part of the CAT holding in January 2000 for £12.40 per share and the remainder in July that year when the shares were £29.25.Early in March 2000 Cantab’s shares were over 700p. But I did not take profits. I held on in the hope of greater gains. Instead, the share price began to slide and when the failure of one of its vaccines was announced in October 2000 the shares plummeted to 76.5p.In March 2001 Cantab merged with Xenova. Both firms were loss making. For every seven Cantab shares held, a replacement of 11 new Xenova shares was given.In August 2003 Xenova took over another loss-making firm, KS Biomedix. Although I disapproved of the deal I retained my shares. In December that year Xenova underwent a further share restructuring.In its circular of June 24 this year to Xenova shareholders, Celtic is offering a choice of secured loan notes, or cash and secured loan notes or just cash. The pure cash offer is worth just 4.5p per Xenova share. It means, effectively, that after all the various share restructurings over the years I will have lost around 94 per cent of the original 1999 value of my Cantab/Xenova investment.It is experiences like this that have helped shaped my views in now trying to cut losses sooner. I should also have taken some profits on Cantab by selling part of my holding when I had a chance to make a fat profit rather than being too greedy and hoping that its performance would match that of Cambridge Antibody.

The Nasdaq Composite was less than 0.1 per cent lower at 2,068.89.Oracle, the software company, saw its shares add 5.8 per cent to $13.57 after it reported a 3.2 per cent rise in net profits, thanks to the effects of its takeover of rival PeopleSoft.There was less good news for Sigmatel, a maker of components for the ubiquitous iPod music player made by Apple. Sigmatel shares edged off 0.8 per cent to $17.60 in spite of news that it had cut its second quarter earnings earnings and revenue outlook. Lower forecasts hurt Symbol Technologies shares, which gave up 7.2 per cent to $9.72 as the barcode scanner and handheld device maker announced a restructuring.Shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose 12.9 per cent to $305.95 after reports that the futures exchange had made a bid for its cross-town rival the Chicago Board of Trade.Research in Motion, meanwhile, was 0.9 per cent off at $75.91 ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement after the close.Among insurers, American International Group shares gained 6 per cent to $58.48 after the world’s largest insurer by capitalisation reported a sharp increase in quarterly profits.But AIG’s gain failed to pull the Dow industrials higher.

Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and colleagues are widely expected to decide a new quarter-point increase in benchmark interest rates.In other economic news, the US government announced the final reading of first-quarter gross domestic product growth, which came at 3.8 per cent. The data included a downward revision of an inflation indicator watched by the Fed, which could fan hopes that the US central bank was approaching the end of its cycle of monetary policy tightening.The pre-Fed vigil was also evident in the lack of reaction to weekly data on petroleum inventories in the US. Rising stockpiles of crude and fuels sent futures lower on the Nymex but stocks opted to switch obsession from oil to the Fed.
75;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-24T12:23:13Z;Lex: Spirit makers;;Among the ancient Greeks, Dionysus was a multi-purpose deity. Intoxication aside, he also served as the patron of the theatre. The sale of Allied Domecq, the UK spirits maker, has had its dramatic moments, although it was an anti-climax when Constellation Brands finally staggered off stage last week, leaving Pernod Ricard to face the curtain. Competition authorities could provide a little more excitement, although the European Commission let it off rather lightly on Friday.The bigger questions concern the deal's wider impact.For now, the benefits could prove fairly widespread among spirit makers. Dionysus was, after all, also seen as a peace-promoting benefactor to all. Recent trading trends suggest that Pernod and its main partner, Fortune Brands, will have their work cut out integrating Allied.This could allow rivals to secure some swift market-share gains, while pricing pressures are likely to ease further.But in the longer-term, Pernod and Diageo will use their enhanced scale to make life harder for the rest. Distribution partnerships among smaller spirit makers are likely to come under strain. International reach could prove especially important in some of the fastest growing markets, such as China. Moreover, Allied showed that, despite the large amounts of spirits involved, there are limits to how much scarce assets can fetch. Solvent bidders will be even more reluctant next time around, given competition concerns. Medium-sized players must hope not to wake up alone when festivities draw to a close.
76;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-17T20:25:10Z;Drinks group fails to lift its spirits as offer collapses;;It was at 2am that Constellation Brands finally threw in the towel in its campaign to take over Allied Domecq.Executives of the US drinks group had spent most of the night in a huddle with their advisers and equity backers about a last-minute offer that would trump a rival bid from France’s Pernod Ricard.On Wednesday, Constellation had presented a revised offer to the Allied board, outlining the price, structure and detail.Allied had said it would be prepared to negotiate. But mindful that it had already agreed an offer with Pernod, it had told Constellation it needed to make the revised offer public within hours.As talks between Allied and Constellation continued, the UK drinks group drafted a press release ready forFriday morning. “We did not want a false market in our shares,” one person close to Allied said. “We were duty- bound to tell the market that we had received an offer.”But Allied’s insistence that it needed to tell shareholders of the revised offer had put the talks under great strain.Constellation, keen on a private dialogue, was irked that Allied was pressing to expose its bid, not least because it wanted to keep Pernod in the dark to prevent the French drinks group from returning with a knock-out, winning bid.The revised offer from Constellation, which had teamed with Brown-Foreman, the drinks group, and Blackstone Group and Lion Capital, the private equity groups, proposed paying Allied shareholders 608p in cash for each share.It also devised a plan to spin-off Allied’s World Wines division as a separately quoted business owned by Allied Domecq shareholders. Constellation valued this business at £1.9bn, or 112p a share. In theory, this would have lifted the total of Constellation’s offer to 720p a share compared with Pernod’s offer of 670p a share.But late on Thursday, Richard Sands, chief executive of Constellation, was starting to lose patience. He needed the co-operation of Allied to take talks forward.“He did not want to be used as a stalking horse and he felt that his position was being abused,” one person close to the Constellation consortium said on Friday. “He finally decided early Friday morning that we did not want to play this game.”So, at 2am yesterday, NM Rothschild, adviser to Constellation, telephoned Goldman Sachs, adviser to Allied, to inform the firm that it would no longer be pursuing an offer.Each side’s version of events appears to differ. Constellation claimed the offer collapsed because of Allied’s heavy-handed tactics, particularly relating to public disclosure of its bid so soon after it was put forward. Allied said it had a fiduciary duty to tell its shareholders that it was considering a revised proposal, despite no sharp movements in the UK drinks group’s share price.Although Allied was willing to enter into discussions with Constellation to develop its bid further, it had reservations. Above all, was concern whether an offer it found satisfactory could be delivered.Allied felt Constellation’s revised proposal greatly undervalued the business.“There were constraints about the timing and impracticality of Constellation’s proposal,” one person close to Allied said.Further, Allied believed that, at £1.9bn, Constellation had significantly overvalued World Wines, which it estimated had a valuation much closer to £1.2bn. The US group also believed that it would take until at least October to demerge the wine business and then relist it.“They had assumed debt of four times, which is much more highly geared than rival wine groups,” people close to Allied said, adding that Constellation’s timetable looked “extremely challenging”.Analysts had been sceptical. But Constellation, its advisers and its equity backers had been working overtime to thwart Pernod’s bid ahead of a June 29 deadline by the Takeover Panel.On Friday, Mr Sands hinted he was not quitting the acquisition trail. “We will remain a determined and disciplined buyer,” he said. But given the tense 11th-hour negotiations between Constellation and Allied, it might be a long time before the US drinks group has the courage to raise its spirits..
77;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-17T17:36:01Z;Constellation abandons its pursuit of Allied;;Constellation Brands, the US drinks group, abandoned its pursuit of Allied Domecq on Friday, paving the way for France's Pernod Ricard to secure the UK-based maker of Beefeater gin and Courvoisier cognac.Pernod's agreed ?7.6bn offer will create a stronger number two in the global drinks industry to rival Diageo.Constellation's late withdrawal came a day after it submitted a revised proposal to Allied. The US drinks group, its equity backers and advisers worked through Thursday night before deciding at 2am on Friday to pull out. Richard Sands, chairman and chief executive of Constellation, is believed to have grown frustrated with Allied's insistence that it wanted to make a public statement about the new proposal.However, Allied argued it had a fiduciary duty to tell its shareholders about the new offer and had prepared a statement to release yesterday morning.?Constellation approached this opportunity in a disciplined strategic and financial manner and does not believe that the economics justify an offer,? Mr Sands said on Friday.Constellation's new offer, which it valued at 720p a share, consisted of 608p of cash and shares in Allied's wine business, which it had proposed to demerge with an estimated value of ?1.9bn.The about-turn by Constellation marks a victory for Pernod, which is now in a position to secure Allied without having to raise its offer.Pernod, which makes Chivas Regal whisky and Martell cognac, agreed in April to buy Allied along with Fortune Brands, maker of Jim Beam bourbon, for 545p a share in cash and 0.0158 new Pernod shares for each Allied share. That valued Allied at 689p a share or ?7.6bn last night.?This demonstrates that our offer is a good offer,? the French group said.However, Allied may face criticism for not having used the presence of a rival bidder to extract a higher price from Pernod and Fortune. The two groups agreed to split Allied's brands, with Pernod taking Ballantine's whisky, Beefeater gin and most of Allied's wines, and Fortune picking up Sauza tequila and Maker's Mark bourbon.The offer will go to a vote of Pernod shareholders on June 30 and Allied investors on July 4. The European Commission will rule on Pernod's bid on June 24, while Fortune is expected to receive clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in July.
78;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-17T16:48:06Z;Bourses climb to new three-year highs;;Pernod Ricard’s expected victory in its £7.5bn ($13.7bn) bid for Allied Domecq helped the French group’s shares rise 2.7 per cent to €136 on Friday. The performance helped lift the FTSE Eurofirst 300 by 0.16 per cent to a three-year high of 1,139.75 on Friday.Pernod’s victory seemed to be sealed after a consortium led by Constellation Brands, the US winemaker, was forced to withdraw its bid after one of its members pulled out.Diageo’s decision to support the Pernod bid, had already strengthened the market’s view that Pernod was likely to prevail against other bidders. Allied fell 1.7 per cent to 680p on the news.Europe as a whole saw a flurry of corporate activity, centred primarily on the Italian banks. Shares in UniCredito climbed 7.7 per cent to €4.41 over the week, lifting those of takeover partner HVB by 7.9 per cent to €21.66 as investors warmed to the significant cost synergies of the €19.2bn deal. Bank Austria, in which HVB holds 77.54 per cent, rose by 6.2 per cent to €86.58 over the week.Meanwhile the battle for Banca Antonveneta continued this week as fellow Italian Banca Popolare di Lodi announced that it would increase its bid to €7.9bn in shares and cash, apparently trumping Dutch bank ABN Amro’s bid of €7.6bn and lifting Lodi’s shares 1 per cent to €7.99. Lodi’s latest bid involves a cash component of less than 20 per cent and involves raising €1.5bn through a share issue.ABN has extended its all cash offer to July 6 in the hope that legal and regulatory rulings will favour its bid. . ABN’s shares rose 2.5 per cent this week to €20.10 as it seemed less likely that the bank would become involved in a protracted bidding war. Capitalia shares rose 0.9 per cent to €4.57 on speculation that it could be an alternative for ABN should the Dutch group’s Antonveneta bid fail.Spanish Bank BBVA also rose by 1.2 per cent to €12.93 this week after shareholders met during the week to approve funding of the bank’s €6.7bn all-share takeover bid for Italy’s sixth biggest bank, Banca Nationale del Lavoro. BNL shares rose 4.2 per cent to €2.90. Francisco Gonzalez, BBVA chairman, acknowledged that the bid had still to overcome some resistance, but said he expected whether he had been successful by the end of July.Shares in Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, which had climbed some 15 per cent since the start of the year, fell 5.4% per cent on Wednesday after it warned about slowing consumer demand, falling a further 0.3% later in the week to finish at €21.25.Sampo, the Finnish insurer, provided another point of interest. The stock, up 3.1 per cent to €12.24 on the week, has risen some ten per cent on the month following purchases by Arion Custody Services. Arion, a wholly owned subsidiary of Iceland’s Kaupthing bank, is now one of Sampo’s largest shareholders, but its stake is still less than that of Bjorn Wahlroos, the Finnish company’s CEO.
79;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-17T12:17:25Z;Lex: Allied Domecq/Pernod;;The flirtation stage of this party is past.Suitors who looked attractive at midnight after a glass or two seem a lot less appealing in the cold light of day. Allied Domecq's board, though, was never in doubt about which of its two potential purchasers it preferred. And the field is now open for favoured Pernod Ricard, after Constellation Brands and its partners bottled out.Pernod's shares, up 3 per cent on Friday, were not the only reason for it to be feeling merry. The French group has worked hard to make its bid look robust, sidestepping most competition concerns by bringing Fortune Brands on board, and defusing the potential for proper counter-offers by cutting a deal with Diageo. The failure of the Constellation consortium to get a serious bid together means it was not even able to drive up the price Pernod is offering or to force it to improve the 80 per cent cash, 20 per cent equity mix. The price should leave Allied's owners hangover-free as well. Allied shares fell yesterday as the more fevered expectations of a competing offer died. But shareholders are still likely to get 685p a share, 44 per cent above the average price in the 12 months to March.Some uncertainties remain. The US and European competition authorities, as well as shareholders, have yet to pronounce on the deal, and the combined group's debt levels will leave something to be desired. But, barring surprises, this particular party should be over by the end of next month.
80;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-07T11:17:03Z;London fails to hold 5,000 level;;London’s benchmark index made a fresh attempt to break through the 5,000 barrier in morning trade on Tuesday, bolstered by news that drinks-maker Allied Domecq would be bought by Pernod Ricard.The FTSE 100 was up 13.6 points, around 0.3 per cent, at 4,994.0 by mid session while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 23.3 points, 0.4 per cent, to 7,213.1.Diageo was up 2.1 per cent at 804p after it withdrew from the bidding war for Allied Domecq. The spirits group said that it had agreed to buy Allied’s Montana wines if Pernod’s bid against Constellation Brands of the US was successful. Allied Domecq shares fell 1.1 per cent to 691p in morning trade.Standard Chartered added 2.3 per cent to £10.31 as Merrill Lynch moved its rating to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, arguing it was likely to outperform its domestic peers thanks to its exposure to Asia Pacific. Analyst John-Paul Crutchley raised his estimates for operating profit in Hong Kong to 9 per cent in this financial year.He added that “the current speculative fervour within the currency markets appears to favour Standard Chartered.”Severn Trent was down 1.6 per cent to 993p after full-year profit before tax fell 3.8 per cent to £262.2m. Adjusted basic earnings per share was also lower, down 9.4 per cent to 55.6p but dividend for the year increased 3.1 per cent to 48.51p. The water company said it intended to ‘maintain dividends in real terms at least up to 2009/10’.Cable & Wireless was 1.3 per cent higher at 137p after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on the company to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’ and hiked its target price to 145p from 130p. The broker expects the telecoms carrier to benefit from Ofcom’s forthcoming strategic review announcement on the telecoms industry, primarily through C&W’s broadband service Bulldog. An improvement in the US dollar could also strengthen non-UK revenues, it added.Evolution Group, the stockbroker, firmed 2.2 per cent to 127¾p after it confirmed it had bought 6.5m shares at £1.22 each for cancellation. The holding is widely believed to be that of Commerzbank. Investors have been waiting for the German broker to sell the stake since last month’s closure of its proprietary trading desk, which held the stake.The removal of the share overhang also boosted Evolution’s attempt to remain in the FTSE 250 index. The FTSE’s quarterly reshuffle will be calculated on Wednesday, based on Tuesday’s closing prices.Corus weakened 2.3 per cent to 42¼p as it faces potential relegation from the FTSE 100 at the quarterly review. Its attempts to remain part of the blue chip club were hampered by comments from CSFB, which urged caution on the steel sector in the face of falling imported steel prices in China.“This corresponds to what we have been hearing anecdotally from the western steel companies who are clearing their excess steel inventories in the export market at marginal cost,” the broker said.In the mid-caps, John Wood Group added 3.2 per cent to 160.8p after JP Morgan raised its rating to ‘overweight’ from ‘underweight’.Shares in Woolworths fell 2.2 per cent to 34p after it reported mainchain like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to June 4 down 4.4 per cent. The high-street retailer said current trading had remained ‘difficult’ and the outlook for consumer spending on the high street remained poor.
81;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-06-06T19:58:44Z;Diageo strikes a deal with Pernod over Allied;;Diageo on Monday removed itself as a possible threat to Pernod Ricard’s £7.5bn acquisition of Allied Domecq by striking a deal with the French drinks company to buy its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand and taking an option to buy Allied’s Montana wine business.As part of the deal, Diageo has agreed to cease any discussions with third parties in connection with Allied’s business.A consortium led by Constellation Brands of the US is considering launching a formal counter-offer for Allied and although Diageo is not part of the group it has indicated that it would, in some circumstances, be a willing participant.Matthew Jordan, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said: “Pernod is very keen to keep Diageo onside.” Mr Jordan added that it appeared that Pernod was unwilling to see Diageo’s healthy balance sheet end up helping the Constellation-led consortium fund a rival bid for Allied.One person close to Pernod said that the deep-pocketed Diageo needed to be “taken out” to make sure that it did not join the Constellation consortium, which includes US spirits company Brown-Forman as well as investment firms Blackstone and Lion Capital.Pernod will pay about £200m to buy Bushmills, while Diageo has agreed an option to pay about £320m for most of Montana, New Zealand’s largest wine company. The sales, which do not include the Corbans, Stoneleigh or Church Road wine brands, are conditional on Pernod successfully closing its purchase of Allied.Diageo said it wanted to ensure that Montana would deliver “appropriate growth and returns” for shareholders before exercising its option. It will get more information on Montana when Pernod closes its acquisition with Allied.The sales of the whiskey brand and wine business will also provide Pernod with extra cash should it be forced to amend its offer for Allied in the event of a formal counter-offer from the consortium.Pernod may be forced to raise its bid, initially valued at 670p a Allied share, or change its offer to all cash. Its initial offer was 80 per cent equity and 20 per cent cash.On Monday, Pernod’s offer was valued at 678p a share. Allied’s shares closed up 1p at 699p.Pernod said on Monday that it would change the date of its extraordinary general meeting to June 30 from June 20 to give shareholders more time to review the transaction with Diageo.The consortium is understood to continue to be working towards a formal offer for Allied, and has hired Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America to help finance a potential bid. It has until June 29 to make an offer.Diageo’s deal with Pernod may make it more difficult for the consortium to raise sufficient cash to fund a potential offer if it was considering asking Diageo for financial support in exchange for giving the spirits company some of Allied’s brands.
82;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Constellation given deadline for its Allied offer;;The Takeover Panel on Wednesday gave Constellation Brands, the US drinks group, a June 29 deadline to proceed with a formal counter-offer for Allied Domecq, the spirits company that has agreed to be bought by Pernod Ricard of France.Earlier this month, a Constellation-led consortium presented Allied with an indicative proposal to buy the company. It still remains unclear whether the proposal - which is understood to be in cash and to value Allied at about 700p a share, or about £7.75bn - will be followed with a formal bid.Constellation is understood to be happy with the deadline, but if it does not proceed with a bid by that time, it will be unable to make another offer for six months.Allied wanted the panel to set a deadline so that its board would have time to consider any rival bid before shareholders meet on July 4 to vote on Pernod’s cash and shares offer.Pernod’s offer, initially worth 670p a share, now values the company at 678p a share, or £7.5bn. At least 75 per cent of Allied’s shareholders must approve the deal for it to go ahead.Allied’s shares closed at 694½p on Wednesday.Allied’s business has been under attack from its competitors in recent months as rival distributors have discounted prices to capture market share, seeking to take advantage of the uncertainty over its future.Allied said on Wednesday that it had noted “a change in behaviour” from some of its customers, suppliers and competitors and warned that the disruption caused by Pernod’s offer and the Constellation consortium’s approach may have a short-term impact on its business. However, it said it still expected to achieve earnings a share growth in the “high single-digits” for 2005.The consortium - which consists of Constellation Brands and Brown-Forman, another US spirits group, as well as buy-out firms Lion Capital and the Blackstone Group - must decide how to address tax and pension issues and how to divide Allied’s spirits brands before proceeding with a formal bid.The pensions regulator has already approved Pernod’s offer, with the French company agreeing to inject additional cash into Allied’s pension fund to help cut its deficit. Allied had a post-tax deficit of £387m as of August 2004.Pernod will hold a shareholder meeting on June 20 to approve the issuance of shares to help fund its offer.A successful acquisition of Allied by Pernod would create the second largest wine and spirits group worldwide, behind market leader Diageo.
83;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Aad Jacobs intends to stand down at the 2006 annual meeting, when the board wants to have an external candidate ready to take his place. The search is being led by Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, deputy chairman and senior independent director.But Mudlark understands that some candidates have raised a surprising objection – none of them wants to live in The Hague, a requirement seen as non-negotiable. In the case of US candidates, there’s a cheeky temptation to blame the proximity of the International Court of Justice. But even Lloyds TSB chairman Maarten van den Bergh, were he not disqualified by already being on the board, is said not to be keen about living in The Hague.Mudlark also hears that Shell does not necessarily want a UK candidate. Someone from Ireland, English-speaking but “neutral”, might be preferable. But the list of appropriate candidates appears to begin and end with Sir Gerry Robinson, whose days as chairman of Allied Domecq may be numbered because of the respective takeover ambitions of Pernod Ricard and Constellation Brands.Samuel Johar, chairman of headhunter Buchanan Harvey, has a provocative name to throw into the ring. What about Lord Patten, whose European commitment and political skills are beyond doubt? As one of the fathers of the proposed European Union constitution, Kerr is well acquainted with Patten.Full to the brimA Heineken Cup final featuring two French teams may not be what British rugby fans wanted. But it is good news for Heineken France – and not just for the obvious reason.On the other side of La Manche, a law banning the advertising of alcohol means that the tournament is known as the H Cup.When French teams play at home, it is this H Cup to which perimeter advertising refers, while retaining a similar look to the uncensored hoardings in other countries.On Sunday, however, Toulouse and Stade Français – which boasts a flanker called Rémy Martin – will be playing at Murrayfield. This should ensure that a bumper French television audience is exposed to the cup’s unexpurgated title.

The orchestra will play four concerts in seven days – at the BBC Proms in London on August 27, followed by Berlin the next day, Moscow on August 30 and Beijing on September.The opera house book, like world peace, has never come to fruition. But that doesn’t mean that they’re not goals worth pursuing.Troc on the blockTwo bidders remain in the frame to buy the Trocadero Centre at Piccadilly Circus. Each has offered more than £215m. But a joint bid by Robert Tchenguiz and Sir Stuart Lipton’s Stanhope is not one of them, despite their innovative plan to develop a 600-room budget hotel.

Now that Royal Dutch Shell has its date for unifying its Dutch and British parts, it's time to turn attention to the next task, finding a new chairman. Aad Jacobs intends to stand down at the 2006 annual meeting. The search for an external candidate is being led by Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, deputy chairman and senior independent director.At least it keeps the former British diplomat's mind off the referendums on the constitutional treaty he helped draft when he was merely Sir John Kerr.But Observer's man on the oil rig hears some candidates have raised a surprising objection - none of them wants to live in the Hague, a requirement seen as non-negotiable.In the case of US candidates, there's a cheeky temptation to blame the proximity of the International Court of Justice. But even Maarten van den Bergh, Lloyds TSB chairman, were he not disqualified by already being on the board, is said not to be keen about living in the drab Dutch capital.And Observer hears that Shell does not necessarily want a Briton. Someone from Ireland, English-speaking but ""neutral"", might be preferable. But the list of appropriate candidates appears to begin and end with Sir Gerry Robinson, whose days as chairman of drinks group Allied Domecq may be numbered because of the respective takeover ambitions of Pernod Ricard and Constellation Brands.Samuel Johar, chairman of headhunter Buchanan Harvey, has a provocative name to throw into the ring, someone Kerr knows well from his time in Brussels. What about Lord Patten, whose European commitment and political skills are beyond doubt?Cup runneth overA Heineken Cup final featuring two French teams is unexpected good news for Heineken France - and not just for the obvious reason.A ban on alcohol advertising means that the European rugby tournament is known in France as the H Cup.When French teams play at home, it is this H Cup to which perimeter advertising refers, while retaining a similar look to the uncensored hoardings in other countries.On this occasion though, the French finalists (Toulouse and Stade Français) will be playing away, since the big match is being staged in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Sunday.This should ensure that a bumper French television audience is exposed to the competition's full unexpurgated title. A case of reaching the eyeballs other beers cannot reach?Still, the beer won't be the only booze getting exposure, thanks to the Stade Français player Rémy Martin.Ironed outThe proliferation of muscle-bound heavies around Brussels is a costly business, and will be watched closely by Dalia Grybauskaite, the EU's no-nonsense budget commissioner.Not only does José Manuel Barroso, Commission president, have a squad of bodyguards but so too Franco Frattini, the justice and security minister.But the platinum blonde Grybauskaite, dubbed the ""Iron Lady of Lithuania"" for her resemblance to former British prime minister Baroness Thatcher, clearly believes in keeping spending on a tight leash.""She drives herself home in the evening,"" says Observer's insider at the Commission car pool. ""She's the only one of the 25 commissioners who has just one driver, and he knocks off at 7pm.""Nor does she need a bodyguard. While Thatcher wielded a handbag to vicious effect, Grybauskaite is a judo black belt.Marlboro menWhen Philip Morris, the international tobacco giant, first announced its $5bn (€3.9bn) takeover of Indonesian clove cigarette giant Sampoerna in March, they took many observers by surprise.That was mainly for cultural reasons. No one believed that the ethnic Chinese family that had run Sampoerna for four generations would sell.Yet it seems that Philip Morris, which announced this week that it had secured at least 97 per cent of Sampoerna's shares, may still be doing some cultural wooing.The executives it appointed to run the company this week shed their business suits and donned the black shirt and black trousers that Sampoerna directors have been wearing for years.At least the uniform isn't the kind of busy batik shirts so popular with businessmen in tropical Indonesia. Observer is not sure they would suit the Marlboro Man.Oui-tremerAs France prepares to vote on the European constitution next week, mischievous British eurosceptics keep recalling the last vote there, on the Maastricht treaty that ushered in the euro.

Allied shares rose 1p yesterday, or 0.14 per cent, to 692p.Pernod shares rose €0.1 to €119.40 Friday, valuing its offer for Allied at 673p per share.Pernod declined to comment on whether it was prepared to raise its offer for Allied if the consortium - which includes US distiller Brown-Forman and investment firms Lion Capital and the Blackstone Group - proceeded with a formal bid.The consortium said there was no certainty a bid would come.Allied said the consortium’s proposal was subject to “considerable” further due diligence, as well as confirmation that it could finance an offer. The consortium will also have to satisfy Allied’s pension trustees that it is willing to reduce the UK company’s pension deficit.Allied’s pension fund had a post-tax deficit of £387m as of August 2004. Pernod has met Allied’s trustees and the UK pension regulator and agreed on enhancing funding of the deficit by a total of £108m in 2006 and 2007.Ron Amy, chairman of Allied Domecq’s pension trustees, declined to comment on whether he had been approached by the Constellation consortium.Meanwhile, Allied is moving ahead on its deal with Pernod. The French company is expected to release offer documents and the dates on which shareholders will vote on the Allied acquisition in the next 10 days.Diageo, the world’s biggest distiller, is not participating in the consortium.However, it is understood to be interested in possibly buying some of Allied’s brands if the consortium makes a successful bid for the UK spirits company. Diageo’s shares rose 8.5p, or 1 per cent, to 808p on Friday.Allied agreed to be acquired by Pernod last month as the French company seeks to build its business to compete more effectively in the international spirits market.

87;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-05-11T18:52:32Z;Lex: Allied Domecq/ Pernod Ricard;;The battle for Allied Domecq has turned eerily quiet. Trading volumes in the spirits group's shares remain fairly high, as they have been since Pernod Ricard and its partner Fortune Brands fired their opening shots. But Allied's share price continues to linger just a touch above the original offer.Pernod might yet be dragged into a bloody bidding war. However, good spirits are often the best defence and, with another solid quarter under its belt, Pernod certainly has reason to cheer.Organic sales grew 6.4 per cent in its core business, even excluding a 2 per cent boost from bulk spirits sales. Spirits and wine shipments are volatile beasts but overall depletion trends and retailer promotions probably held Pernod back from hinting at even better underlying trends. Especially encouraging is the progress of its premium brands, notably Chivas and Martell, which have had a glorious Chinese New Year.This helps strengthen the case that Pernod might reap bigger gains than rivals from swallowing Allied. Not that it will necessarily have to rely on such arguments. The rival consortium around Constellation Brands still faces a myriad of financing, tax and asset allocation issues and will hardly return to the limelight until it has come up with solid answers. Other potential bidders are keen on specific assets they might pick up from whoever wins. That gives them little reason to gossip, fun as it is to watch Pernod squirm.
88;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-04-27T19:12:52Z;US group joins fight for Allied Domecq;;Allied Domecq on Wednesday said a consortium led by the US's Constellation Brands had approached it to discuss a potential counter-offer for the UK company, which last week agreed to be acquired by France's Pernod Ricard in a £7.5bn deal.The consortium includes Brown-Forman, the fifth-largest US spirits company, as well as private investment firms Lion Capital and Blackstone.People familiar with the situation said the consortium had been put together early on Wednesday morning and would offer all cash if it launches a formal bid.Pernod's offer consisted of 80 per cent cash and 20 per cent equity. An all-cash offer may be more attractive to UK shareholders reluctant to hold an equity stake in a French company.The consortium, which has proved to Allied that it is capable of making a valid offer, will be given the same access to Allied as Pernod had in order to undertake due diligence on the UK company.The consortium does not yet have commitments for financing a potential bid.Pernod said that it remained confident that its offer for Allied would be successful. “Our offer is a very good offer,” said a company spokesperson. “It's good for shareholders and good for the future of the brands.” Pernod will be discussing its offer with Allied investors in the US and Europe over the next two weeks.A person close to Pernod Ricard said the company was sceptical of the consortium's chances. “They are going to find it very difficult to put something credible together.”Allied would have to pay Pernod a £37m break-up fee if it accepts a competing offer within six months.The approach by the consortium underscores the attractiveness of Allied's spirits assets in a rapidly consolidating industry. Opportunities to purchase premium spirits brands are rare because most spirits companies are family controlled and difficult to acquire.Diageo, the world's biggest distiller, said on Wednesday it was also considering acquisitions that would complement its premium drinks brands as consolidation in the industry picks up.“We want to be able to seize opportunities if they present themselves,” a company spokesperson said. The company declined to comment on whether it had recently hired financial advisors to pursue a specific acquisition.Domecq is considered unlikely to mount a bid for all of Allied Domecq due to a large amount of overlap between the companies' spirits brands that would raise concerns with regulators, but analysts said it may want to pursue the company's wine assets.Diageo on Wednesday announced plans to refinance $900m in debt, and said borrowings could potentially be used to fund acquisitions. The company said it could also pay for acquisitions using free cash flow, which is projected at £636m for the 2005 financial year, as well as by selling its shares of US food company General Mills. It has 24m shares in General Mills, worth £600m.Diageo has some $4.5bn in debt outstanding.
89;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-04-26T19:33:51Z;Lex: Allied Domecq;;Liquor does not change people. It lets them be themselves, only more so. Pernod Ricard cannily secured the backing of Fortune Brands in its bid for Allied Domecq, but its offer leaves the door open for rival bidders.Deal connoisseur Constellation Brands would love to have a go, perhaps backed up by others. Allied represents a last-minute chance in the consolidating spirits sector. Given the premiums lately on offer, investors might, of course, prefer would-be bidders turning into sellers.But Allied's strength in the US promises significant savings in distribution, while its global reach should eventually boost revenues. There are two snags. The first is financing. Allied is too big for either Constellation Brands, Brown-Forman or Bacardi.Teaming up could solve their financing difficulties especially if they also line up other buyers. Market leader Diageo might, for example, be enticed to take another look at some of the wine businesses of its old rival. Constellation is the world's largest wine-maker, but appears more interested in premium spirits and international distribution. These assets, however, might also be the main attraction to its potential partners, which is the second snag.Coming up with as sensible a deal as Pernod and Fortune looks tough. Constellation, moreover, is already a heavily indebted acquisition machine that has not paid a cash dividend on common stock since its listing in 1973. None of this makes it a credible cheerleader for a rival bid.
90;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Bidding war looms for Allied Domecq;;Brown-Forman, the US maker of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Southern Comfort, has hired Lazard, the investment bank, to look at ways of thwarting Pernod Ricard's £7.5bn (€11bn) offer for Allied Domecq.The move comes as Constellation Brands, a rival US drinks group, said it had hired Merrill Lynch and NM Rothschild to advise on a possible counter offer for the UK spirits company. Constellation said it would evaluate options with “a number of potential partners”.The group is keen to attract Hicks Muse Europe to provide the equity for a potential offer. The US private equity firm hired Javier Ferran, the former chief executive of Bacardi, last year. He could lead any potential offer for Allied.Speculation about a counter-offer for Allied drove its share price 8.5p higher to 671.50p. Pernod's offer was valued at 670p.Constellation has until the end of June, when Allied's shareholders vote on Pernod's offer, to work on a counter bid and form a fully-financed consortium. With a market capitalisation of $6.1bn, Constellation is not large enough to purchase Allied on its own.“It would have to be a joint bid,” said Mark Swartzberg, equity analyst at Legg Mason.The US drinks group has told analysts and investors that it would like to strengthen its spirits portfolio by purchasing premium brands. However, it missed out on the auction for Malibu in 2001, which was sold by Diageo following the break-up of Seagram's drinks portfolio.Industry observers said it was too early to tell whether Brown-Forman would consider joining Constellation. However, one said: “They are likely to want most of the same brands, so it is more likely that they will each look at separate bids with private equity groups.”Observers believe Allied provides Constellation with one of the last chances to enter the premium spirits market.“At some stage, Constellation needs to decide if it's going to be a player in spirits,” said Richard Hurst, an independent consultant in the beverage industry.Most of Constellation's acquisitions have been in wine, including BRL Hardy, Australia's largest wine producer, which it bought in 2003. The group last year acquired the Robert Mondavi Corp., one of the biggest US producers of table wines.The $1.4bn acquisition left the company with relatively high levels of debt. Constellation had $3.3bn of rated debt at the end of February, according to Standard & Poor's. The group has a good record in cutting debt after purchases. But another debt financed acquisition could hurt its credit rating, which is at junk levels. S&P rates Constellation at “BB” with a negative outlook.
91;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-04-25T19:21:13Z;Lombard: Fermentation continues for Allied Domecq;;"Pernod Ricard may not be home and dry yetIt’s still a long way from happy hour for Pernod Ricard. Its £7.5bn offer for Allied Domecq, in conjunction with Fortune Brands, could yet be trumped by a rival bid.Constellation Brands of the US, the world's largest winemaker, on Monday confirmed it was considering whether it might make an offer. Meanwhile another US group, Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniels bourbon, is understood to have hired Lazards while it considers its options.The interest is hardly surprising. It is rare for a drinks portfolio of Allied's size and quality to come on the market. An all-cash deal could be preferable to Pernod's, which is 20 per cent in shares.Constellation has expanded rapidly over the past five years, aggressively buying producers of wine, and its sales now top £2bn. But it seems as interested in Allied for its spirits brands as much as its wines. Constellation has a fairly small presence in spirits, even though these are the preferred tipples among young Americans and consumption is growing faster than beer or wine.But Constellation is too small to buy Allied on its own, and needs partners. These may not be easy to find. Diageo, the global drinks leader, would probably run into competition issues for anything other than small fill-ins. Bacardi has a complicated family shareholding structure and has already expended a lot of firepower on acquisitions. Brown-Forman could be the one of the most credible partners.But it is questionable whether a consortium of this kind could extract the same synergies as Pernod, and any carve-up could take some time to put in place. If Pernod and Fortune manage a fairly smooth run through the competition authorities, they may be hard to dislodge. Not surprising then, that Allied's shares yesterdayon MondayPulling the plug""Are you sinking what we're sinking?""The Conservative Party, as part of an ""action for business"" election programme, on Monday announced that if elected it would pull the plug on the government's plans for listed companies to publish statutory operating and financial reviews.It looks a remarkably knee-jerk, cavalier promise that shows little sign of considered thought and, if carried through, would undermine years of work aimed at improving the flow of information to investors.For reporting years beginning this month companies will be required to publish with their annual report an OFR, providing a narrative on their performance and prospects. The purpose is to give greater insights into a business's strengths, the risks to it and where it is heading.The idea is hardly new. Many companies already produce an OFR voluntarily and the Accounting Standards Board has been issuing guidance on drawing it up for more than a decade. The idea of a statutory review was given impetus by the Company Law Review, a group of experts who laboured for years on proposals to drag the hodgepodge of UK company law, some of it dating from Victorian times, into the 21st century.True, the government's original proposals for turning this into firm regulations were excessively onerous, and risked creating such a forbidding framework that companies would only produce safe legal boilerplate. But after pressure from the CBI and others, the regulations have been sufficiently diluted that they may draw out useful information from companies.They would have been better if the CBI had won a ""safe-harbour"" provision protecting directors from liability claims over forward-looking statements. But even in their present state they deserve a chance to succeed - or measured arguments from anyone who still opposes them. The Conservatives' cryptic condemnation just produces a sinking feeling.The Lomax wayIs Kevin Lomax sprouting horns? You might think so, given the way he is being demonised in the press in his role as senior independent director at Marks and Spencer and head of the nominations committee.He is said to be keen on an outside chairman for the company, in place of Paul Myners, who stepped up to be interim chairman last May to see off Philip Green's bid approach. Mr Myners evidently now wants to stay on, and has the backing of Stuart Rose, the chief executive, with whom he gets on well.The complaint is that Mr Lomax is being too rigid and divisive. However, the board as a whole agreed last summer to look for an outside chairman, and it is legitimate to ask whether Mr Myners and Mr Rose may be too close. The jury is out on M&S's recovery and whoever is chairman may yet have to ditch Mr Rose.Some say Mr Lomax's stance underlines the drawback of creating the job of senior independent director, who can be a separate and potentially divisive powerbase to the chairman. But arguably M&S presents precisely the kind of situation where an independent figure is valuable.martin.dickson@ft.com"
92;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-04-25T18:28:50Z;Constellation's star still in the ascendant;;Constellation Brands seems to have an insatiable thirst for acquisitions.Having snapped up Robert Mondavi wines of the US last December and Australia's BRL Hardy wines in 2003, the world's largest wine group is now eyeing a joint counter-bid for Allied-Domecq.“It's totally consistent with the character of the company and [chief executive] Richard Sands,” said Richard Hurst, a US-based independent consultant in the beverage industry.While pursuing a third acquisition might seem a stretch so soon after the $1bn Mondavi deal, buying Allied would give the mainly wine and beer group a larger presence in the global spirits business.It would also give Constellation access to Allied's distribution networks in Asia and Europe, and round out its wine portfolio by handing it Allied's Clos du Bois wine brand.Constellation, founded in 1945 as a wine producer, already has more than 200 alcoholic beverage brands. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.In the 1990s, Constellation embarked on a “multi-category” strategy to reduce dependency on a single product or geography. This strategy, it says, has supported stable growth in volume, cashflow and return on invested capital.It is now the largest US importer of beer into 25 mostly western states and the second-largest producer and marketer of ciderin the UK. Indeed, the company's recent record ofproducing growth from acquisitions appears good.Fourth-quarter earnings per share of 62 cents beat analysts' estimates amid strong growth in wine sales. At the same time, Constellation has been benefiting from the end of a three-year grape glut, which had depressed prices.In addition, the integration of Mondavi appears to be on track, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Marc Greenberg. “Constellation is putting together a winning portfolio,” he wrote in a report earlier this month. “Mondavi filled out the wine portfolio. Top priority for future acquisitions is spirits. It is now one of our most attractive growth plays in the alcoholic beverage industry.”However, after the rash of acquisitions, some analysts harbour doubts about what this means for Constellation's earnings visibility.Jeffrey Kanter of Prudential Equity Group questions the company's high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens earnings growth, partly because a flurry of purchases has made it hard to pinpoint where earnings are coming from.“The company has done so many deals it is hard for us to figure out where the internal trends are relative to simply ‘brought growth' and distribution pipeline fill.”
93;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-01-17T11:24:16Z;Foster?s shows confidence with bid for Southcorp;;Foster?s, Australia?s leading drinks group, on Monday signalled its confidence in the recovery of the global wine industry by launching an A$3.1bn (US$2.35) all-cash takeover bid for its smaller rival Southcorp.But, in talks over the weekend, it failed to secure the backing of the winemaker?s board, sending Southcorp?s shares soaring by 26 cents, or 8.5 per cent, on Monday to A$4.61, well above Foster?s A$4.17-a-share bid, as investors expected Foster?s to come up with a higher offer.If successful, the bid would unite some of Australia?s best known brands to create the country?s largest wine company, as well as the world?s biggest producer of premium wine. Southcorp is owner of the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands.?This is an absolutely outstanding opportunity for Foster?s and a sensational deal for both sets of shareholders,? said Trevor O?Hoy, Foster?s chief executive. ?There is no doubt whatsoever as to the strength of the combined portfolio.?But the deal was immediately attacked by Southcorp as ?inadequate and opportunistic? and it told its shareholders to reject it.?[The offer] has come at a time when Southcorp?s earnings are depressed due to the current position in the global wine cycle and the relatively high Australian dollar, and prior to the full realisation of the benefits from [the group?s restructuring initiatives],? said John Ballard, the Melbourne-based group?s chief executive.But Foster?s said the deal, pitched at 14.9 times Southcorp?s forecast earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation for this year, represented one of the highest multiples ever paid for a substantial listed wine group. It compares with the 15.2 times that Constellation Brands recently agreed to pay for fellow US group Robert Mondavi and the 12 times that Foster?s itself paid for Beringer, the Californian producer, in 2000.The price was set after intense negotiations with Bob Oatley, Southcorp?s outgoing deputy chairman, whose family agreed to sell its 18.8 per cent stake, also at A$4.17 a share, last week.The family, the founders of Rosemount, which merged with Southcorp in 2001, is believed to have sold out because of concerns that the group would fall into the hands of a foreign predator.Although Foster?s now holds a blocking stake, analysts said Southcorp might yet attract a rival bidder, with international groups Allied Domecq, Diageo and Pernod Ricard seen as the most likely candidates.?This is possibly the last opportunity to buy a high quality portfolio of iconic brands and premium vineyard holdings in one acquisition in Australia,? said Macquarie Bank. ?This is what makes it compelling for Foster?s and for potential international bidders.?Shares in Foster?s, whose gearing would rise to more than 90 per cent if the deal succeeds, fell 38 cents, nearly 7 per cent, to A$5.27.It is being advised by Goldman Sachs JB Were and Southcorp by Deutsche Bank.
94;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2005-01-13T08:08:48Z;Foster?s takes an 18.8% stake in Southcorp;;Foster?s, Australia?s leading drinks group, surprised the market on Thursday by snapping up a near 19 per cent stake in Southcorp, paving the way for a possible full bid for the Melbourne-based winemaker.Foster?s, whose Beringer Blass division holds several premium wine brands, said it had acquired 18.8 per cent of Southcorp from Bob Oatley, deputy chairman, and his family, for A$584m (US$447m) or A$4.17 a share.This valued Southcorp, Australia?s biggest wine producer in value terms and owner of the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, at A$3.11bn.Foster?s also requested its shares be suspended until Monday, saying it was in talks that could lead to a ?major announcement?. Analysts said the group appeared to be in talks to take over the rest of Southcorp, but that it might also be content to stick with the 18.8 per cent holding as a defensive measure.It was unclear whether Foster?s had approached the Oatleys over the stake or whether the family, the founders of Rosemount, the wine group that merged with Southcorp in 2001, had decided to sell.In the latter scenario, Foster?s would have faced the spectre of Southcorp falling into the hands of powerful international groups such as Allied Domecq or Diageo and a likely intensification of the already strong competition in its home market in Australia.Although the timing of the move took the market by surprise, Southcorp has long been seen as a potential takeover target. The company is widely considered to have botched its merger with Rosemount and to have been responsible, with a mishandled discounting strategy, for a slump in wine prices that undermined the broader Australian industry.Its difficulties resulted in a series of profit warnings and a sharp fall in its share price, although the company is experiencing a turnround following the appointment of new management two years ago.The move by Foster?s comes as consolidation is reviving in the fragmented global wine market. Constellation Brands, the owner of BRL Hardy, another of Australia?s large wine producers, agreed late last year to take over Robert Mondavi, the Californian producer, for US$1.36bn.Foster?s, however, had suggested it was not on the look out for a large wine acquisition in the near term and had planned to return most of the proceeds of a recent A$846m property sale to shareholders.Macquarie Bank said a full acquisition of Southcorp at the price of A$4.17 a share and funded from debt would lift Foster?s gearing to more than 90 per cent, well beyond its target range of 50 to 70 per cent. Foster?s therefore would need to raise A$750m to A$1bn if it decided to proceed with a full bid.?Southcorp has arguably the best portfolio of Australian wines. It has incredibly good brands,? Macquarie said, adding that a takeover would also give Foster?s, which derives about three quarters of its wine earnings from the US, greater diversity and strengthen its position in the UK export market.But there were also concerns that Foster?s would overpay for Southcorp, whose shares have risen 27 per cent since late October. They were trading at A$4.25 before being suspended on Thursday, up from A$2.45 a year ago but down from A$8.38 at their peak in mid-2002.
95;STZ;Constellation Brands Inc;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Lex: Constellation brands;;Hard drinkers rarely know when to stop. The same appears true for investors in Constellation Brands. Admittedly, the world's largest wine-maker is expecting another exceptional year. The wine glut is finally diminishing. Drinkers continue to trade up, as the flavoursome performance of Majestic Wine illustrates for the UK. That is a boon for Constellation, as it needs to pump Mondavi's premium wines through its distribution network to make its latest pricey acquisition work financially.But Constellation's shares have already risen by 50 per cent in the past 12 months and the easiest way to make a small fortune in wine is to start with a large one. Constellation has been better than most in generating at least some cash returns, partly due to its smaller beer and spirits distribution businesses. Its free cash flow to equity yield should top 5 per cent this fiscal year. Still, past annual filings suggest it had good reasons for never paying a common stock dividend since its listing in 1973. Excluding acquisition costs, its average annual free cash flow since 1995 was just 1.3 per cent of its current value.In itself, Constellation's increased size is no guarantee that recent returns will prove more sustainable than past ones. Already, it is trading at a premium to spirits companies, even on net earnings. Investors hoping this momentum will last should remember that the longer one takes to finish a bottle of wine the greater the likelihood that it tastes like vinegar.

Instead, the overhaul will be put to shareholders in a vote scheduled for the end of November.“We remain fully committed to a process that maximizes value to our shareholders,"" said Ted Hall, Mondavi's chairman. ""We believe strongly that our proposed recapitalisation plan is important to achieving full value for our shareholders.“"
