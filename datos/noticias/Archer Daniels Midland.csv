0;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2019-10-31T18:36:45Z;Trader claims discrimination for depression after $10m loss;Employee at ADM Investor Services says he prevented much bigger financial hit;A trader who oversaw almost $10m of losses during a stock market rout claimed he was discriminated against for depression and said his actions prevented a financial hit of potentially “hundreds of millions of pounds” more.Adam Glover Bailie, 48, remains a senior trader at ADM Investor Services International, the UK brokerage of US food processing company, Archer Daniels Midland. He told a central London employment hearing on Thursday that he had been marginalised within the company following a mental health breakdown that worsened after the February market crash last year.He said the firm had inadequate risk systems, which were at the heart of the almost $10m of losses he was trying to stem.The trader, who has been on a medical leave of absence since August, has filed for “disability discrimination, harassment and victimisation” against the firm and his manager Fabian Somerville-Cotton. He claimed his depression was triggered by work stress.Mr Bailie was head of the company’s global equity and fixed income divisions during a period of market volatility at the start of 2018. In his witness statement he claimed to have grown increasingly concerned from November 2017 about a lack of stress testing by the firm’s risk division, which was designed to protect the brokerage from heavy losses.Several staff members left the company in 2017, including the head of risk.“I was concerned that clients had positions that were too big and our lack of risk meant we couldn’t reduce them,” Mr Bailie told the hearing on Thursday.On February 5 a dramatic decline in US stocks hit many of the firm’s trading positions. Mr Bailie said the London office was unable to give him up-to-date data to make intraday margin calls — requests for more cash to cover client trades — that would incorporate the “considerable change in volatility”.He was told to contact the Chicago arm of the business, which provided him with data that helped him “manually estimate, extrapolate and calculate” the amount of money needed to cover clients’ positions amid the market turmoil.Mr Bailie said in his witness statement that he “was making these calls and calculations whilst simultaneously trying to speak to the clients and trade to close those positions”. He returned to the office at about 2am on February 6, when markets had worsened, to “undertake urgent damage limitation on behalf of clients”.By 5.30am several clients were “insolvent” and facing losses of about $10m, Mr Bailie said.In his witness statement, he said: “My direct intervention in manually calculating and trading over the course of the two days considerably reduced the losses to the firm and the clients which had the potential of running into hundreds of millions of pounds.”ADM Investor Services and Mr Somerville-Cotton deny all allegations against them. The firm claims Mr Bailie did not inform them of his depression until April 2018. The respondents claim they were not informed that Mr Bailie’s condition was work-related until he made a formal grievance in September. The case continues.

The Chicago-based company reported net profit of $235m, or 42 cents a share, in the second quarter, less than half its earnings of $566m or $1 per share a year before. Analysts had forecast profits of 65 cents a share.It was the lowest net income in a second quarter since 2013, according to S&P Capital IQ. ADM is among the small group of international companies that lead international grain handling and processing, purchasing crops such as corn, wheat and soyabeans from farms for distribution or processing into products such as animal feed, biofuels and food ingredients.Such companies rely heavily on river barges as the most economical way to move grain. ADM owns American River Transportation, a leading barge company that ships its own and third-party grain. Rains far above average in the second quarter halted barge traffic on the Mississippi river this spring and disrupted movements elsewhere. The intense rainfall was consistent with recent changes in the climate across the US Midwest as the planet gets warmer. ADM said both its merchandising and handling and transportation results were down year on year due to “continued high water conditions on US rivers,” contributing to a 63 per cent fall in adjusted operating profit in its origination division. Adjusted profit at ADM’s oilseeds division fell by 15 per cent, in part due to “production outages caused by high water” at the company’s soyabean crushing plant in Quincy, Illinois, which sits beside the Mississippi river. Rain and floods also hit ADM’s results in the first quarter, when they inundated railroad lines and grain terminals. Extreme weather cost ADM $125m in the first half of the year, the company said.For farmers, the wetness slowed planting of corn in the US this spring, damping expectations for a high-yielding crop. The company’s leadership offered a non-committal outlook on the bilateral tariff dispute that has battered exports of US soyabeans to China. Talks between Washington and Beijing this week were inconclusive.“Although the timing is uncertain, we remain confident in the resumption of significant food and agricultural trade flows between the US and China, which will help bolster margins in the US grain export and ethanol industries,” said Juan Luciano, chief executive. In February, Mr Luciano said he expected the trade dispute to be resolved in the first half of the year.
2;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2019-05-29T19:14:16Z;ADM’s top grain-trading executive leaves in latest reshuffle;Chicago-based company will fold four divisions into three in realignment;Archer Daniels Midland is parting ways with its top grain-trading executive as it undertakes a second internal realignment in 15 months, joining a lengthening list of agribusinesses shuffling senior ranks.Chicago-based ADM said on Wednesday it would fold four divisions into three as its origination and oilseed businesses become one called ag services and oilseeds. The two predecessor divisions produced 60 per cent of ADM’s $3.4bn in operating profit before tax in 2018.Greg Morris, the current oilseeds president, will lead the new unit. Stefano Rettore, president of the origination division, has decided to leave ADM for personal reasons, the company said.ADM stands among the handful of companies that dominate international grain handling and processing, buying crops from farmers, moving them to food importers or refining them into products such as animal feed, biofuels and food ingredients. The origination division was the heart of the trading business, with a global trade desk based outside Geneva, Switzerland.The industry has been under pressure as large crops dampen price swings and farms expand, giving them greater bargaining power. Juan Luciano, chief executive, told an investor conference in New York this month that the “old model” of trading profit had “evaporated”.The shake-up at ADM follows personnel changes at rival groups. Last week the agriculture division of Swiss-based Glencore announced the retirement of veteran leader Chris Mahoney. In April, New York-listed Bunge appointed Greg Heckman chief executive following pressure from activist shareholders.The same month Mr Heckman’s former company, Omaha-based grain trader Gavilon, named Steven Zehr its new chief. Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader, has appointed Joe Stone as the head of its agricultural supply chain business.Mr Rettore previously was president of the international division at CHS, the largest US grain co-operative.ADM in March 2018 created four new divisions to reflect internal operating changes and provide more transparency to investors. The divisions were origination, oilseeds, carbohydrate solutions and nutrition.The new ag services and oilseeds unit will come into effect on July 1, the start of ADM’s third quarter.“Bringing the unparalleled strength of our global origination, global trade and destination marketing businesses and our transportation network together with our leadership in oilseeds processing and value-added product mix is a natural evolution,” Mr Luciano said in a statement. “This helps us better integrate the supply and value chains to deliver significant simplification and efficiency to the day-to-day business.”Since Mr Luciano was promoted to chief executive in January 2015, ADM shareholders have lost 15.5 per cent on a total return basis, while the S&P 500 stock index has returned 47.7 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. The company in April raised its cost-savings goal to $1.2bn by the end of 2020.“I am personally committed to the strategic value that simplification can bring to our organisation, and feel our ability to accelerate purposeful value creation within ADM has never been greater,” Mr Luciano said.
3;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2019-04-26T12:13:46Z;Agricultural trader ADM Q1 earnings down 40% on bad US weather;Chicago-based group to review ethanol division to test potential of spinning it off;Archer Daniels Midland, the international agricultural trader, reported a 40 per cent fall in first-quarter earnings and said it plans to break off its ethanol business into a separate unit with the view of spinning it off.The US group, a leading trader moving grains and soyabeans around the world, reported earnings of 41 cents a share for the three months to March, down from 70 cents for the same period a year ago, hit by a sharp fall in its starches, sweeteners and bio-products division. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was 46 cents compared with 68 cents.“The first quarter proved more challenging than initially expected,” said Juan Luciano, ADM’s chairman and chief executive. “Impacts from severe weather in North America were on the high side of our initial estimates, and the ethanol industry environment limited margins and opportunities.”In March, the company said that snow and flooding in the Midwest would hurt first-quarter operating profits by $50m to $60m. Operating profits at its “carbohydrates solutions” unit, including starches and sweeteners, and its ethanol business, which was affected by severe weather, fell to $96m from $213m. The sweeteners business was hit by margin pressure, the company said.Chicago-based ADM said on Friday it would separate off its ethanol business, and would review the division potentially to sell it off. It also said it was offering early retirement for staff in the US and Canada.Meanwhile, the trading house’s rival Bunge said it had appointed Gregory Heckman chief executive. Mr Heckman, who formerly led grain trader Gavilon, joined the Bunge board in October and has been acting chief executive since January.
4;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2019-03-04T05:00:25Z;Green activists push soya traders on Brazil deforestation;Largest agricultural dealers agree to disclose production in Cerrado region;Climate activists are pushing the world’s largest agricultural traders to go “beyond nice statements” and enact concrete measures to tackle deforestation caused by soya production in Brazil’s Cerrado region.Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus — known as the “ABCD” of agricultural traders — as well as Cofco International and Glencore, have committed to sharing granular data on their suppliers in the Cerrado, an abundant savannah in central Brazil that has been at the heart of the largest agribusiness boom in decades.The Soft Commodity Forum’s move to introduce a set of transparency and reporting measures follows pressure from customers and investors to ensure that traders are supplying sustainable food stuffs, and meeting their climate targets.Daniel Nepstad, executive director of the Earth Innovation Institute, said: “The attention is very much welcome and needed, sending a clear signal that what Brazil does with its savannahs could have implications for markets.”But for some investors and pressure groups, the new reporting measures do not go far enough. They want traders to extend the Amazon Soy Moratorium, in which signatories pledged not to purchase soya from deforested land in the Amazon, to the Cerrado.Companies, including McDonald's, Walmart, Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Nando’s and Unilever, have already called for an extension of the soya moratorium to the Cerrado, although traders and farmers have been fairly trenchant in their opposition.Greenpeace has long been a proponent of extending the moratorium. Paulo Adario, the environmental group’s head of forest strategy, said: “Time is ticking on climate pledges, and companies have the responsibility to go beyond nice statements on paper.”The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank that is one of Cofco International’s shareholders, has pressed the company to instigate systems for penalising farmers who illegally deforest, while Norges Bank Investment Management last week announced that it would be factoring deforestation risk into its investment portfolio decisions.Last year, Louis Dreyfus became the first big trading house to say it would not buy soya from newly deforested land in the Cerrado, though it gave no timeline.The Cerrado, known as an upside-down forest for its deep root network, has lost half of its native vegetation to agricultural expansion.An area almost the size of Wales has been cleared in the past 11 years to make way for soya, according to the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). The three biggest soya exporters from the region are Bunge, Cargill and ADM, with combined exports of 13m tonnes in 2017.The Cerrado now supplies soya to much of the EU and China, ending up on consumers’ plates across the world, in the form of soya-fed chicken, sold at Burger King, McDonald’s, Tesco and Morrisons. The UK is the fifth-biggest importer of Cargill’s Cerrado-cultivated soya, according to SEI.Under the agreement, traders will report data every six months, starting in June, and closely monitor high-risk municipalities with the aim of “eradicating deforestation and conversion of native vegetation in Brazil’s Cerrado biome”.“This initiative is a great example of collaborative action urgently needed to safeguard future food and agricultural production while ensuring environmental conservation,” said Johnny Chi, chairman of China’s Cofco International.According to Brazilian law, farmers in the Cerrado need only keep 25-35 per cent of native vegetation on their land intact — the rest they can deforest. By contrast, in the Amazon, they must protect 80 per cent.“We are exploring ways to incentivise farmers to go towards zero conversion which is a big leap from what the law requires of them,” said Wei Peng, global head of sustainability at Cofco International.Brazilian farmers are, however, unwilling to relinquish revenue streams without some form of compensation for the cost of sacrificing business expansion. While these “carrot initiatives” are broadly supported, there are ongoing talks about who would bank them.“Of course, all efficient and serious farmers are totally in agreement with any initiative that demands no illegal deforestation,” said Marcelo Vieira, president of the Brazilian Rural Society, an agricultural lobby group. “If people want farmers to protect native vegetation beyond the legal requirement, those [farmers] should receive payment for their services to the environment.“We are discussing funding models with investors, including European national funds,” he added.Pressure groups say that the new standard put forward by the Soft Commodity Forum lacks a mechanism to deal with rogue suppliers and a clear deadline for ending deforestation in their supply chains.“Traders need to immediately cut off suppliers that they find to be engaging in deforestation,” said Glenn Hurowitz, head of the environmental group Mighty Earth.

6;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2019-02-05T17:09:07Z;Grain trader ADM envisages end to trade war this year;Upbeat comments come as China restarts soyabean imports from US;A central participant in agricultural exports from the US to China is betting the countries’ trade dispute will be resolved this year. Archer Daniels Midland, the Chicago-based grain trader and processor, said it expected soyabean sales from the US heartland would rebound in the autumn after China slowed down purchases in retaliation against US tariffs. China, the world’s largest soyabean consumer, added a 25 per cent duty on US soyabeans in July, putting the crop at a disadvantage to rival supplies. Exports fell to zero even as American farmers hauled in a record harvest last autumn, prompting the Trump administration to offer them a $7.3bn federal bailout.Beijing has since committed to buy some US soyabeans to feed its vast pig herd and generate goodwill as its trade negotiators thrash out differences with Washington ahead of a March 2 deadline.Last week China’s vice-premier Liu He said China would buy 5m tonnes, and in the past two days the US government confirmed sales of 3.2m tonnes.Reporting corporate results, ADM cited an “extremely small volume of US soyabean exports to China” in the fourth quarter of 2018. Juan Luciano, chief executive, said the company was able to replace about 70 per cent of the lost volume by increasing corn exports and by sending soyabeans elsewhere, notably to its processing plants in Europe and to Thailand, which has a large poultry industry. Mr Luciano said he expected the US-China trade dispute to be resolved in the first half of the year, though not by March. This would lead to “sizeable exports” from the US to China as harvests roll in during the fourth quarter.“That is our predominant scenario at this point in time,” Mr Luciano said. He warned that, with a protracted trade dispute, “I think it’s going to be bad for everybody. I think it’s going to be bad for the global economy and then it’s difficult to forecast what’s going to happen.” His comments came as ADM reported net profit of $315m, or 55 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, less than half the $788m or $1.39 a share the company earned a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents were four cents less than Wall Street consensus, sending ADM’s shares down 6 per cent to below $42 in morning trading in New York. China historically imported more than 30m tonnes of soyabeans per year from the US, business that largely flowed to Brazil in the past year. A resumption of purchases in the fourth quarter would come too late for farmers deciding what to plant in the spring. Soyabean futures for November 2019 delivery were $9.57 per bushel in Chicago, well below prices before the onset of the trade war. The low US soyabean price has been beneficial to ADM’s oilseeds division, which was able to buy them cheap and crush them into animal feed meal and vegetable oil. The unit, which also exports Brazil-grown soyabeans, more than doubled its operating profit from the year before to $432m. 
7;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2019-01-31T16:38:42Z;Grain trader ADM pledges gender parity in senior ranks by 2030;;Archer Daniels Midland, the international agricultural trader, has pledged to achieve gender parity within its senior leadership structure by 2030.The Chicago based company, which was led by Patricia Woertz for 8 years as chief executive until 2014, currently has three female executives on its 22-member senior leadership team, according to its website.ADM has partnered with Paradigm for Parity, a coalition comprised of corporate chiefs, senior executives, founders, board members and business academics addressing the gender gap in corporate leadership.The senior ranks of commodities traders and natural resource groups have traditionally been dominated by male executives. Along with ADM, other natural resources and commodities groups which have joined with Paradigm for Parity include Cargill and mining group Newmont.“We recognise that our success as a company and as an industry relies on developing, creating and growing an inclusive culture and diverse workforce,” said Juan Luciano, ADM’s chief executive and chairman.
8;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Australia’s GrainCorp receives $1.8bn buyout bid ;Shares jump by a quarter on offer that comes 5 years after Canberra blocked takeover by ADM;"Australian agricultural group GrainCorp said it has received a A$2.4bn ($1.8bn) takeover bid from Long-Term Asset Partners, an asset management company, sending its shares up by more than a quarter.The all-cash offer comes five years after Canberra blocked a A$3.4bn takeover of GrainCorp by Archer Daniels Midland, saying it was not in the national interest. GrainCorp said its directors were not yet able to make a recommendation to shareholders but that its board would engage with LTAP, a newly set up asset management group that counts several high profile Australian business people among its directors.“The board requires additional information on the identity of the equity investors underpinning the LTAP proposal as well as the long-term financing plan and intentions of the business,” said GrainCorp.It noted that the bid involved a complex financing structure, with Goldman Sachs providing A$3.2bn in loans and UK-based Westbourne Capital providing a further A$400m. LTAP directors include Tony Shepherd, a former president of the Business Council of Australia and previously chairman of Transfield Services; Lance Hockridge, a former managing director of rail group Aurizon; and Andrea Staines, a former director of Queensland Investment Corporation. The investment manager has not revealed which organisations or pension funds are providing equity funding for the bid. Adam Fleck, analyst at Morningstar, said LTAP’s focus on being Australian-owned and controlled was another important consideration given the government’s decision to block ADM’s bid in 2013. “GrainCorp is a strategically important company in Australia due to its role in moving grain around the country and its ownership of infrastructure in ports,” he said. The bid comes as the agricultural group is in the midst of reviewing its portfolio and capital management, aiming to boost shareholder returns following disappointing share price performance in recent years.Founded more than a century ago as a government agency, GrainCorp is battling a drought on Australia’s east coast that is expected to reduce grain production to its lowest level in a decade. Australia is the world’s fourth-biggest wheat exporter behind the US, Russia and Canada. The grains industry is a strong political lobby, and in 2013 Canberra blocked a A$3.4bn takeover approach by ADM, arguing it could “impede growers’ ability to access the grain storage, logistics and distribution network”.ADM exited GrainCorp in December 2016, selling its 19.9 per cent stake for A$387m, at A$8.53 per share.LTAP’s all-cash bid of A$10.42 a share is a 42 per cent premium to GrainCorp’s last closing price. It values GrainCorp at around nine times 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Shares in GrainCorp were up 27 per cent at A$9.25 on Monday afternoon in Sydney.Mr Fleck said LTAP’s bid was opportunistic, with the drought having beaten down the company’s share price, but attractive, coming in significantly above Morningstar’s A$8.30 fair-value estimate.Mr Shepherd, the LTAP chairman, said the bid would ensure the stable development of GrainCorp's operations while guaranteeing that ownership and control of the company's assets remained in the hands of Australian owners. “Our plans for GrainCorp’s assets are focused on increasing volumes over time,” he said. “Keeping transport and handling costs as low as possible will be a major incentive to help farmers increase production.”"
9;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-10-25T11:49:43Z;Agribusinesses to standardise trade operations with new technologies;;Leading agricultural commodities traders known as the “ABCDs” have agreed to work together to standardise and digitise deals in order to increase efficiency and transparency and reduce transaction times.Rivals Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus Company, which move millions of tonnes of grains, soyabeans and sugar in a cut throat world of agricultural trading, announced that they wanted to reduce costs by digitising the large amount of contracts, letters of credit, invoices and other paperwork currently sent around the world by email, fax or post, and automate the post deal process.The announcement comes as more than five years of low crop prices due to bumper crops and low margins have weighed on the agricultural sector. This year’s trade war between the US and China has also increased uncertainty over some parts of the industry.Over the past few years, large traders of raw materials have been trialling the digitisation of documentation through blockchain. Commodities trading and finance is a centuries-old sector still reliant on the exchange of physical documents. This can lead to delays, high costs and also an increased risk of fraud.At the start of this year agricultural trader Louis Dreyfus completed a soyabean transaction with a Chinese buyer with banks ING, SocGen and ABN Amro. In the energy sector, leading traders including Royal Dutch Shell and Mercuria and banks such as ING and Société Générale are preparing to launch of two new platforms underpinned by blockchain technology later this year.The heads of the agricultural traders — Juan Luciano of ADM, Soren Schroder of Bunge, Cargill’s David MacLennan and Ian McIntosh of LDC — said they wanted to modernise and standardise data and documents. They are calling on other agricultural commodities traders to join their efforts.“We will bring hundreds of years of collective knowledge and experience to simplify processes and reduce errors for the benefit of the entire industry,” said Mr Luciano.
10;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-07-31T13:18:58Z;Grain merchant ADM weathers agricultural trade wars;Group posts strong quarterly results despite uncertain food commodities market;Grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland has weathered the start of agricultural trade wars in fine shape, reporting strong results despite an uncertain market for food commodities.The Chicago-based company operates one of the largest crop trading businesses, purchasing harvests from farmers for processing or sale at destinations around the world. Traditional supply routes twisted ahead of China’s move this month to impose steep tariffs on US soyabeans, a core product for ADM.Yet in the second quarter ended June 30 ADM said operating profit in its origination division, which houses most grain and oilseeds trading, had more than trebled from the same period a year before to $189m.Juan Luciano, chief executive, called the US-China dispute “manageable”, adding that company’s outlook for 2018 was in fact “more favourable” than it was at the end of the first quarter.The boost in origination underpinned company-wide net profit of $566m, or $1 per share. Adjusted for one-off items, earnings were $1.02 per share, up 79 per cent from the same period a year before and well above consensus expectations of 78 cents per share, according to S&P Capital IQ.The dislocations and grain price fluctuations caused by the trade disruptions have been very positive for ADMADM belongs to industry associations that have vociferously opposed new US tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, Canada and the EU. America’s trading partners have responded by targeting US agriculture, prompting dire warnings from the US farm lobby.The short-term impacts of the nascent trade war have created opportunities, however.“The dislocations and grain price fluctuations caused by the trade disruptions have been very positive for ADM, which has benefited from record exports out of the US ahead of trade sanctions,” said Farha Aslam, analyst at Stephens.The company has the most exposure to the US among global agricultural trading houses. Exports of leftover US soyabean stocks quickened before China’s soyabean tariffs took effect on July 6. Government data showed exports surged to 3m tonnes in May, the most ever for that month.Grain and oilseed deals were also helped by volatility in South America after a drought reduced Argentina’s soyabean crop and labour strikes by truck drivers interrupted movements of grain from Brazil.Ray Young, ADM’s chief financial officer, said: “The short crops in South America, as well as increased purchases from that region by China in anticipation of tariffs, offered motivation for other buyers to come to the US. The result was significantly higher volumes and margins for corn, wheat and soyabean exports.”Argentina’s smaller harvest pushed up profit margins for processing soyabeans into protein meal and vegetable oil. That business is another speciality of ADM, which owns 123 oilseed crushing and origination plants, mostly in the US and Europe, with a daily capacity of 157,000 tonnes.The company said its oilseed crushing and origination businesses achieved a second-quarter record in crushing volumes. Operating profit from ADM’s oilseeds division jumped 70 per cent year on year to $341m.ADM’s business refining corn into fuel ethanol was harmed after exports to China dried up because of another set of tariffs raised in response to new US steel and aluminium duties. Mr Luciano warned of weaker results for the carbohydrate solutions division that includes ethanol, as operating profit from such bioproducts fell by more than half to $11m.Shares in ADM rose 2.2 per cent to $48.39 early in New York.
11;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-07-31T09:04:38Z;Sirius Minerals reveals its US partner;;Sirius Minerals has named Archer Daniels Midland, one of the worlds biggest agricultural commodity traders, as its North American partner.The London-listed group, which is developing a huge potash project under the North York moors, announced three years ago a deal to supply a US group with its fertiliser, which is called Polyhalite.However, due to commercial sensitives it had not revealed the name of its partner until today.“The expanded agreement is for a period of seven years from commercial production and has two five-year extension options to supply volumes of polyhalite increasing to 1.5m tonne per annum in year five, with an option for an additional 500,000 tonnes per annum,” Sirius said in an update.The company also said it had signed an agreement with ADM for supplies of starch, which it plans to use a binding agent.Sirius’s potash project is the largest mine to be built in the UK for a generation. The FTSE 250 company is currently seeking financial backing from the UK government to complete construction of the mine.It needs to secure $1.5bn in debt guarantees from the Treasury to push ahead with the next phase of the project, including a 23-mile tunnel linking its mine with a port on Teesside.“ADM is Sirius’ largest offtake partner and had signed a 1.5m tonnes per annum binding take-or-pay supply agreement three years ago, but had opted to remain anonymous,” said analysts at Liberum, a London-based brokerage. “The naming as an offtake partner today adds to the public endorsement of Polyhalite as a product.”
12;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Archer Daniels Midland moves to limit reliance on bulk crops;Agricultural trader in talks to buy French animal feed business Neovia for €1.5bn;Archer Daniels Midland has taken further action to diversify away from handling and processing bulk crops with moves to acquire two businesses involved in nutrition.The Chicago-based company, one of the world’s biggest grain traders, said on Monday it was in exclusive talks to acquire French animal feed business Neovia for an enterprise value of €1.5bn.That came on the heels of the announcement, on Friday, that ADM had reached an agreement to acquire Probiotics International Ltd (PIL) of the UK, a maker of live bacteria that aid gut health, for £185 million.The two deals represent ADM’s latest attempts to develop businesses that are relatively insulated from swings in commodity prices. Including Neovia and PIL, the share of ADM operating profit coming from its nutrition segment would have been 15 per cent last year compared with 7 per cent in 2014, the company said.“All told, this will represent a major milestone in the execution of our strategic plan, the growth of our integrated nutrition business and the transformation of our portfolio,” Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, said on a conference call discussing the transactions.The all-cash Neovia purchase would be ADM’s biggest since its €2.3bn acquisition of speciality food and drinks flavour company Wild Flavors in 2014.Most of ADM’s operating profits continue to flow from its corn, wheat, oilseed and trading businesses. They have been performing well this year in part thanks to strong industry margins for crushing soyabeans, but they remain vulnerable to shifting market conditions.Heather Jones, analyst at Vertical Group, called the nutrition deals a “needle mover”, but noted that roughly 85 per cent of profits would still be subject to agricultural markets. “It’ll help cushion them relative to the last down cycle,” she said.Shares of ADM were down 1 per cent at lunchtime in New York trading.Early this year ADM approached rival trader Bunge about a takeover that would have increased its exposure to bulk commodities markets, but nothing emerged from the overture.Neovia, founded in 1954, is majority owned by French agricultural co-operative inVivo. French private equity group Eurazeo holds a stake.It manufactures feed for cows, pigs, chickens, fish and shrimp as well as pets and horses. Sales totalled €1.7bn in 2017 from operations concentrated in western Europe, South and central America and south-east Asia.Vince Macciocchi, president of ADM’s nutrition division, said that consumers’ preference for “clean label” food products with more natural ingredients was a trend that had spread to foods for animals. Neovia’s products would help address those customer demands, he said.
13;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-05-01T16:41:16Z;Archer Daniels Midland points to profits recovery;Commodities trader says oilseeds unit likely to report $1bn in earnings this year;Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities, on Tuesday signalled that a long awaited recovery in profitability had finally arrived, saying its oilseeds business was likely to report more than $1bn in earnings this year.After several tough years in which international grains merchants have struggled to find lucrative trading opportunities because of bumper harvests, 2018 has started on a more positive note for traders.Argentina’s worst drought in five decades has hit production of soyabeans, which are crushed to make feed for livestock. This in turn has boosted processing margins in the Americas as buyers have scrambled to find alternative sources of supply.Argentina is the world’s top exporter of soyabean meal with around 40 per cent market share.“We have confidence that we could see oilseeds achieve north of $1bn of operating profit in 2018 . . . that’s a significant increase over about the $850m of adjusted operating profit that we achieved last year,” said Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive.He was speaking after ADM reported first-quarter results that topped market expectations.We feel very strongly about not only the sustainability of this margin, but the sustainability and improvement of our performance in the years to comeThe Chicago-based group posted net income of $396m in the three months to March, up from $340m in the same period a year ago, boosted by a lower tax rate and a $120m biodiesel rebate.ADM said it processed record volumes of soyabeans in North and South America in the quarter as it moved to lock in high margins. While that had not immediately translated into higher profits because of “negative timing effects” of more than $100m on forward hedges, Mr Luciano said the position would reverse later in the year.Companies like ADM use derivatives to lock in profits on supply deals, although this can lead to some volatility in earnings until the underlying contracts are completed.Mr Luciano said he believed the turnround in the soyabean market was sustainable, citing several factors including strong demand.“When you had all these, plus everything that we have been doing in terms of cost control and swing capacity in our facilities, we feel very strongly about not only the sustainability of this margin, but the sustainability and improvement of our performance in the years to come,” he said.Another factor that helped the oilseeds business was the return to the market of Brazilian farmers who had withheld their soyabeans because of low prices in 2017.The lack of availability caused chaos in the industry last year, hitting profits at ADM and rivals such as Bunge who had to buy beans in the market to fulfil supply contracts.“In Brazil, we have seen farmer selling. At this point in time, they price probably about 56 per cent to 60 per cent of the crop versus about 44 per cent a year ago. So we’ve seen good farmer selling,” Mr Luciano said.ADM is one of the largest exporters of US sorghum to China, and Mr Luciano said it would see a $30m hit in the second quarter from Beijing’s import duty announced last month.Last year, ADM made a takeover approach to Bunge, leading to deal talks as the industry struggled with tough market conditions. Those talks have fizzled out, however.
14;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-05-01T12:38:56Z;ADM flags improving look for soyabean processing;;Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities, flagged an improving outlook for its soyabean processing, as it reported first-quarter earnings that topped expectations.The Chicago-based group said adjusted earnings for the three months to March rose 13 per cent to 68 cents a share, boosted by US tax reforms and credits. The result was ahead of market forecasts. Analysts had expected ADM to report earnings of 49 cents.ADM said it processed record volumes of soyabeans in north and South America in the quarter as it moved to lock in high margins. While that had not immediately translated into higher profits because of losses on forward hedges, ADM said the position would reverse later in the year.“The consistent execution of our strategic plan, combined with our first quarter results, improving market conditions for many of our businesses, and the benefits of US tax reform, lead us to be even more confident about 2018,” said ADM chief executive Juan LucianoAfter several tough years, where international grains merchants have struggled to find lucrative trading opportunities because of bumper harvests, 2018 has started a more positive note.Argentina’s worst drought in five decades has hit production of soyabean meal, which is used as feed for livestock.This in turn has boosted crushing margins in the Americas as buyers have scrambled to find alternative sources of supply. Argentina is the world’s top exporter of soyabean meal with around 40 per cent market share.ADM’s said net income was up 16 per cent to $396m, after paying $68m of taxes in the quarter, down from $118m a year earlier.ADM’s refining and biodiesel unit reported a 200 per cent increase in operating profits thanks to a $120m tax rebate.ADM’s crushing results were lower due to the negative timing effects of more than $100m on forward hedges, which the company uses to lock in margins. These will reverse later in the year as the underlying contracts are completed, the company said.
15;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-03-20T23:32:19Z;Cargill executive calls time on traditional supply model;President of agricultural supply chain division says making money through grain sales is ‘over’;Long-established methods of making money through grain sales are “over”, a senior executive at Cargill has said, declaring a lasting shift has taken place in agricultural commodities markets.Cargill, with more than $100bn in revenue, handles and processes tens of millions of tonnes of crops and meats annually. The US-based company has for decades relied on a far-reaching network of silos and ports to maintain its edge as a grain and oilseeds trader. “The traditional business model in the ag supply chain is over,” Gert-Jan van den Akker, president of Cargill’s agricultural supply chain division, told the FT Commodities Global Summit on Tuesday.Mr van den Akker said Cargill and its rivals historically financed farmers and agreed to buy their crops during the growing season. At harvest they would purchase the crops, store them in company silos and trade around the inventory. “You’d wait for markets to appreciate and then you would sell it. And that’s what created margins. That’s over. That doesn’t exist any more,” he added.His comments may help settle a debate on whether financial pressures facing the world’s big agricultural traders are a symptom of a temporarily slack grain market or reflect more structural changes.Gary McGuigan, president of global trade at Archer Daniels Midland, a Cargill competitor, said traditional ways of buying crops at one origin and dropping it off at a port were becoming outmoded.“I just don’t see how that sort of thing will survive,” Mr McGuigan told the conference. There are no secrets today in the world of agricultureIn the past decade farms have grown bigger. Farmers from Ukraine to the US have invested in storage assets in the form of mammoth plastic bags or corrugated metal silos, allowing them to decide when to sell supplies to merchants.Data on commodity prices, weather, crop yields and trade flows have also become affordable for farmers and consumers, diminishing the value of grain traders’ inside knowledge.“There are no secrets today in the world of agriculture,” Mr van den Akker said in an interview.Big grain merchants continue to buy crops from farmers but have adapted to the changes. ADM, for example, has built up “destination marketing”, or bringing grain supplies closer to customers. Cargill has been offering more services to farmers, such as digital tools to guide cultivation.The executives spoke as volatility returns to grain markets because of a drought in Argentina. Mr van den Akker said that, after initial expectations for a 57m-tonne Argentine soyabean crop, he now expected a crop of 40m-45m tonnes, or below 40m in the worst case.Soyabean prices have rallied back above $10 per bushel. “Things have bottomed,” Mr van den Akker said.
16;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-03-19T15:47:36Z;ADM to restructure divisions a second time;Agricultural merchant reshuffles operations in face of supply surplus and flat prices;Archer Daniels Midland plans to restructure its operating divisions for the second time in three years as it battles falling profit margins in the grain industry. The Chicago-based company is a top global agricultural merchant, shipping bulk foods such as corn, wheat and soyabeans or processing them into ingredients. Ample grain supplies and flat prices have weighed on profits for parts of ADM’s business, impelling it to cut costs and streamline operations over the past few years. On Monday, the company said it would reshuffle divisions into four new ones, reflecting internal changes to how it operates. The change will also give investors more transparency, said Juan Luciano, chief executive. “It’s very important that investors can see through our segmentation,” Mr Luciano said in an interview.The new divisions are called origination, carbohydrate solutions, oilseeds and nutrition. They replace four existing divisions: agricultural services, corn processing, oilseeds processing and wild flavours and speciality ingredients (WFSI). ADM last restructured its operating divisions in the first quarter of 2015, when it assembled the WFSI segment from its €2.3bn acquisition of Wild Flavors and other businesses. While the unit has been profitable, it contributes a relatively small share of earnings. The grains trading and processing industry has suffered from a series of large harvests that led farmers to hold back crops in search of better prices and prompted consumer food groups to become tougher negotiators when buying supplies.Bunge, an ADM rival, is slashing costs and capital spending by $450m in an effort to boost profit margins. Cargill, the biggest agricultural merchant, in 2015 revamped its leadership structure.ADM has been investing in businesses that are closer to final customers. Last summer it disclosed Project Readiness, a combination of cutting costs and finding efficiencies such as standardising business processes around the world. Mr Luciano said the new segments were part of a “natural evolution” of changes under way at the company, and a “reflection of how we think about those businesses”.ADM’s new structure focuses most of its grains trading — the business furthest from final customers — inside the new origination division. Stefano Rettore, ADM’s chief risk officer, will lead the group.The company’s wheat milling business, housed until now inside agricultural services, will sit in the carbohydrate solutions division alongside ADM’s corn processing plants, which make products such as corn syrup and fuel ethanol. Chris Cuddy, head of corn processing, will be in charge. The nutrition segment will encompass WFSI as well as ADM’s enzymes, “bioactives” and animal nutrition businesses, which partly reflects ADM’s expansion into the pet treat market. Vince Macciocchi will lead the unit.Oilseeds is a simpler name for the oilseeds processing division, which will otherwise remain unchanged under management of Greg Morris. This division also handles soyabean origination from Brazil and will continue to do so, the company said.ADM approached Bunge about a merger, people familiar with the matter said early this year. Mr Luciano declined to comment on the status of any talks. 
17;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-03-09T17:06:25Z;Bunge shares drop on ADM deal talks stalling report;;Shares in Bunge fell as much as 6 per cent on reports that takeover talks with Archer Daniels Midland had stalled.ADM is said to have approached Bunge about a potential takeover that would combine two of the world’s four largest grain trading houses although traders and analysts had noted the lack of activity despite frenzied speculation.Earlier this week analysts at JPMorgan said that the economics of a deal between Bunge and ADM were far from compelling.Bunge shares were down almost 4 per cent just above $74 a share after hitting $72.32 on the back of the Wall Street Journal report, while ADM was at $43.48 a share, up 0.4 per cent.
18;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-03-07T15:59:05Z;Doubts cast on rationale of Bunge/ADM tie-up;The economics of a deal between Bunge and ADM were far from compelling, says JPM;Shares in takeover target Bunge were higher on Wednesday after JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the grain trader in a report that had a sting in the tail.Resuming coverage with an “overweight” recommendation after a “period of restriction”, JPMorgan, which is a corporate adviser to Bunge, said it expected earnings to bounce back in 2018.“We acknowledge that the soyabean and crush margins in the US are benefiting from Argentine production issues, which may provide a cyclical tailwind for the company in the near term,” said analyst Ann Duignan.The report also examined the likelihood of a bid for the company, concluding that it was probable “given the structural headwinds” facing the industry.But it also said the economics of a deal between Bunge and rival Archer Daniels Midland were far from compelling.If ADM were to offer $95 a share for Bunge, financed 60 per cent with cash and 40 per cent with stock, its net debt would rise to a whopping 3.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.On top of that, the deal would only be marginally earnings accretive by 2022, assuming ADM could extract $604m of cost synergies.The deal model also assumes Bunge ebitda, which slumped to a $1bn in 2017, recovers to $1.5bn this year and $2.44bn by 2022.Traders said the JPMorgan analysis might explain why an offer for Bunge has yet to emerge despite frenzied speculation. ADM is said to have approached Bunge about a potential takeover that would combine two of the world’s four largest grain trading houses.As well as the challenging economics, an ADM/Bunge combination would face serious pressure from regulators to divest assets especially in the US and Canada. That would further skew the risk/reward equation, traders said.Shares in Bunge rose 1.6 per cent to $78.39.The re-initiation of coverage by JPMorgan came after Bunge completed a deal to buy a 70 per cent stake in Loders, a Malaysian palm oil producer for $946m, to expand its food ingredients business.

The bulk of ADM’s assets are in the US, where its 471m bushels in grain storage capacity leads the industry. The group has approached rival Bunge about a possible takeover, widely seen as an attempt to expand in South America.The Aston deal follows last year’s purchase of Chamtor, a France-based sweetener and starch producer, as ADM seeks to acquire businesses with less exposure to commodity swings and higher profit margins.
20;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-02-16T22:37:59Z;Archer Daniels Midland, Syngenta settle litigation over biotech corn;;Archer Daniels Midland and Syngenta, two giants of industrial agriculture, have settled lawsuits over the release of a new biotech corn strain that upended US grain exports to China.ADM, an international grain dealer, had accused Swiss-based seed company Syngenta of negligence when it introduced two new varieties of genetically modified corn to US farmers.The strains had not yet been approved by authorities in China and in 2013 were turned away by inspectors in Beijing, costing the grain-trading industry tens of millions of dollars.Syngenta was also sued by farmers and Cargill, an ADM competitor. The farmers reached a $1.5bn settlement with Syngenta last September. The Cargill case is set for trial this September, Syngenta said.An annual report ADM filed late Friday revealed it reached confidential settlements with Syngenta in December.Syngenta also confirmed the settlement with ADM. “Syngenta is continuing to defend against the claims of other exporters, and continues to believe that American farmers should have access to the latest US-approved technologies to help them increase their productivity and crop yield,” it added.Syngenta now has a Chinese owner: it was acquired last year by state-owned ChemChina.
21;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-02-14T17:55:42Z;Bunge’s fourth-quarter loss stirs deal talk;Returns to agricultural trader fall as supplies grow and farmers gain the upper hand;Bunge has revealed an exceptionally weak finish to 2017, with results that will intensify questions over the future of the 200-year-old global agricultural trading house as an independent company.It buys crops from farmers for processing into ingredients and feeds, or for bulk shipment to customers around the world. International trade in grains has been breaking records, and Bunge said its main agribusiness handled 34.3m tonnes in the quarter, an increase of 4.6 per cent year on year.But ample supplies have made it difficult for merchants to extract profits from these flows, as farmers hold back crops in storage bins in hopes of higher prices and customers refuse to pay premiums for long-term deals.High stocks of grain have also damped price swings. Bunge said its global grain trading and distribution business felt pressure “due to limited dislocation opportunities”.For the fourth quarter, Bunge reported a loss of $60m, or 48 cents per share, swinging from a net profit of $271m, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for the effects of US tax reforms and a corporate restructuring, the company earned 67 cents per share — half of what analysts forecast.“I think the entire industry, and certainly ourselves, are trying to adjust to a new environment,” Soren Schroder, chief executive, said on a call with analysts.As the industry struggles, competitor Archer Daniels Midland made a takeover approach to Bunge, leading to deal talks. Last year Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities trader, disclosed it had also approached Bunge about forging ties with its agriculture business.Speculation over a possible takeover has buoyed Bunge’s stock price, with shares up 14.5 per cent this year despite a 3.4 per cent fall in Wednesday morning trading.Mr Schroder declined to comment on reports of ADM’s interest. He said in an interview that consolidation made sense in certain places.“I still think that there are regions in the world where consolidation through partnerships, the way we like to do them, could be beneficial. The US grain-handling system is an example of that. There’s too much capacity and we’ve all become very efficient, so you can do more with less,” he said, citing soyabean crushing industries in Brazil and China as another example.“But it’s pockets, and it’s not general. That’s why I hesitate to make any comments about something that is more global in nature. It’s regional and it’s more surgical,” Mr Schroder said.Bunge also disclosed plans to exit sugar trading, a business in which it exports the sweetener mainly from Brazil to consumers in the Middle East, north Africa and Asia. Longstanding plans to rid itself of Brazilian sugar mills are also advancing, with options including a public offering, a sale or a partnership, Mr Schroder said.On a call with analysts last week, Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, said he wanted to expand in South America and Southeast Asia, two regions where Bunge has a superior footprint. Credit Suisse said in a note last week that it “believe(s) that ADM is close to a deal with Bunge”.
22;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-02-06T18:22:49Z;ADM fuels Bunge tie-up talk with expansion plans;Grain trader keen to increase South American presence where rival dominates;Archer Daniels Midland has reiterated a desire to expand in South America, fuelling speculation that the grain merchant and processor might agree to acquire Bunge, a powerhouse on the continent.Agricultural middlemen have suffered as huge global grain supplies prompt farmers to hold back crops and strengthen customers’ bargaining power. ADM on Tuesday reported a 4 per cent decline in quarterly adjusted operating profit compared with same period last year, even as the new US tax reform law flattered net income. Amid pressures, ADM has approached rival Bunge about a takeover, according to people familiar with the matter. Executives declined to discuss the talks on an earnings call but spelt out growth plans that analysts said were consistent with a potential deal.If combined, ADM and Bunge would form a $34bn grain company rivalling Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trading house. An agreement could lead to a bidding war with Swiss-based commodities group Glencore, which last year disclosed an interest in combining with Bunge. The majority of ADM’s assets are in the US, where its 471m bushels in grain storage capacity leads the industry, according to a report by Credit Suisse. Bunge is a dominant oilseed and grain exporter in Brazil and Argentina. We don’t want to just invest to be big. We want to invest to plug holes in our value chainJuan Luciano, ADM chief executive, said the company’s agricultural services division, which buys crops from farmers for processing or export, had expanded in Europe, a key production region.“South America is trailing Europe in that regard, and the same in Southeast Asia. So that will continue, but very selectively,” he said. Farha Aslam, an analyst at Stephens, said: “ADM left the door open for a potential Bunge acquisition, because they highlighted the need for geographic expansion, particularly in South America and Asia.“Of course, Bunge is very well positioned in South America in particular, and has a good representation in Asia.” ADM has recently focused on acquiring businesses with less exposure to commodity swings and higher profit margins, or what Mr Luciano called “the right-hand side of the value chain.” In the past year these have included Chamtor, a France-based sweetener and starch producer.Mr Luciano said: “We don’t want to just invest to be big. We want to invest to plug holes in our value chain”. Shares of ADM rose 1.3 per cent to $41.11 in New York. Bunge, which reports results next week, gained 0.5 per cent to $81.32. ADM reported net profit of $788m, or $1.39 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $424m or $0.73 per share a year earlier. Adjusted for the tax changes and other items, earnings amounted to $0.82 per share, beating estimates by $0.11.
23;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM profits climb on tax reform gains;;Archer Daniels Midland reported sharply higher profits in the fourth quarter, as the benefits of US tax reform overcame weaker operating performance at the global grain merchant and processor.The Chicago-based company took in net profit of $788m, or $1.39 per share, up from $424m or $0.73 per share a year earlier. Adjusted for the benefits of tax changes, earnings amounted to $0.82 per share, beating estimates by $0.11.The results underlined the continuing stresses on the agricultural commodities trading industry in spite of massive volumes of crops flowing through warehouses and processing plants. As grain prices have fallen, farmers have consolidated and built up their storage bins – boosting their negotiating power with merchants.Competition in the business of processing corn and soyabeans into food ingredients, animal feed and biofuels has also been fierce, weighing on margins.ADM said annual return on invested capital was 6.4 per cent, or 40 basis points above its 6 per cent cost of capital – well below an internal goal of 200bp. Total operating profit declined 9 per cent from $806m to $733m.Amid the squeeze, ADM has approached rival agribusiness Bunge about a merger, according to people familiar with the matter.ADM said operating profit in its agricultural service division, which buys crops from farmers for processing or export, rose 23 per cent to $301m thanks to a near-doubling of income from grain merchandising and handling and solid global trading.Corn processing operating profit rose modestly to $261m, as higher sales of sweeteners and starches outweighed worsening results from refining corn ethanol.Oilseeds processing operating profit fell 15 per cent to $202m, in part hurt by poorer performance from crop origination in South America. The company’s bottom line was also hit by “unfavourable underwriting performance” from captive insurance operations, the company said.Juan Luciano, chief executive, said: “We ended 2017 with a solid fourth quarter. We pulled the levers under our control—including cost and capital initiatives and interventions throughout the year—to deliver value for shareholders.”
24;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2018-01-22T16:44:34Z;ADM and Bunge sow seeds for grain revival with tie-up talk;Merchants under pressure from shrinking margins amid growing competition;The proposed $30bn tie-up between Archer Daniels Midland and rival Bunge has highlighted how the toughest market conditions in a generation have forced the world’s biggest grain merchants to rethink strategies and attitudes to dealmaking. ADM and Bunge are two of the world’s four largest grain trading houses, using sprawling networks of storage, transport and processing assets to shuttle bulk crops from farmers to customers or convert them into ingredients.The Chicago-based group approached Bunge with a takeover offer in the past month, say people briefed on the matter. Combined they would create a company with annual sales of almost $110bn, putting it on level pegging with Cargill, the industry leader.Both companies are feeling the pinch of acting as middlemen at a time when farmers have become more selective about when and at what price they will sell their crops. The democratisation of industry data has eroded the value of information once controlled by the big trading houses, and used to exploit arbitrage opportunities. At the same time, a series of bumper harvests has weakened agricultural traders’ bargaining power with customers in the food industry. “The merger would make sense strategically for ADM because it would create significant scale in South American, European and Asian markets, eliminate excess capacity in regions where margins have compressed and reduce its cost to serve customers and farmers globally,” says Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse.We just don’t feel that the acquisitions today are priced at the point that we will make the proper returnsShares in Bunge, which has a market value of more than $11bn, rose 3 per cent on Monday, while ADM, with a market value of $23.3bn, increased almost 2 per cent.That ADM would consider doubling down on the business of dispatching corn, soyabeans and wheat speaks to the difficulties facing the industry. ADM has in recent years sought to mitigate this by investing in businesses that sell more specialised ingredients for higher profit margins. In 2014, ADM paid €2.3bn for Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company, its biggest deal.But such businesses are not big enough to offset structural problems in trading bulk foods. Less than 10 per cent of ADM’s operating profit in the past 12 months came from its Wild Flavors & Speciality Ingredients division, according to S&P Capital IQ.Juan Luciano, ADM’s chief executive, has in the past year raised doubts about expanding his company through big-ticket acquisitions. “We have the balance sheet to do acquisitions. We just don’t feel that the acquisitions today are priced at the point that we will make the proper returns,” he said at a conference last May. That might be about to change as market conditions look set to deteriorate further. Profit margins from grain trading could tighten even more as rivals add to their crop-handling networks, increasing competition to procure supplies from farmers who have built up their own storage. G3, a joint venture between Bunge and a Saudi investor, is building a massive grain terminal in Vancouver, British Columbia that is expected to compress export margins on the Pacific coast. In Brazil, Cargill is considering a new grain port in Barcarena, according to World-Grain.com, an industry news service, where ADM and Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader and miner, jointly own an export terminal. Both ADM and Bunge have irreplaceable portfolios of ports, grain storage silos and crushing plants for commodities such as soyabeans and sunflower seeds. But the bulk of ADM’s assets are in the US, while Bunge has a bigger presence in Brazil, another surplus grain producer.“Potential deal synergies could be significant as ADM and Bunge have substantial overlap in North American and South American grain origination and oilseeds processing and could therefore be able to optimise their networks to maximise utilisation rate and minimise costs,” said Vincent Andrews, analyst at Morgan Stanley.Others see a different motive. New York-based Bunge rebuffed Glencore after it made an approach last year. A standstill agreement preventing Glencore from making a new offer expires next month. “The fear factor is driving ADM,” says Jean-François Lambert of consultancy Lambert Commodities. “The thought of Glencore buying Bunge and emerging as even bigger competitor is quite uncomfortable for ADM.”Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore’s chief executive, has made no secret of his desire to expand his agricultural business, a joint venture with two Canadian pension funds. “We’re looking to grow that business in various parts of the world,” he said in December.It is not clear how Bunge, founded 200 years ago in Amsterdam, will respond to ADM’s overture. Neither company has yet commented on the takeover reports. Despite pressures in its main agribusiness division, Bunge’s shares have been propped up by its status as a potential takeover target. Soren Schroder, Bunge’s chief executive, has spoken openly about the need for consolidation in the industry, but he has emphasised his preference for joint ventures and partnerships instead of the sale of the company.In the past year, Bunge has held discussions with Gavilon, a grain company owned by Marubeni of Japan, about partnering on grain handling facilities in the US, people familiar with the matter said. Bunge declined to comment and Gavilon did not respond to a request for comment.A potential ADM-Bunge tie-up has already sparked anxiety among farmers who rely on competing bids to get the best prices for their crops. The US and Canada have highly consolidated oilseed processing industries with ADM and Bunge representing a little over 50 per cent of capacity, according to Credit Suisse.An ADM takeover of Bunge would be yet another wave in the overwhelming flood of consolidation overtaking every agriculture industry“An ADM takeover of Bunge would be yet another wave in the overwhelming flood of consolidation overtaking every agriculture industry,” says Rob Larew, senior vice-president of public policy and communications at the National Farmers Union in the US. “It’s time we put a stop to unbridled consolidation in agriculture.” Such rhetoric suggests that any deal would require significant divestitures in the US. The sale of assets could create an opportunity for Glencore or another strategic buyer — possibly China’s Cofco International — to make long-sought inroads into breadbaskets such as the US without having to bid for the whole of Bunge. But even ADM’s approach has shown investors that Mr Luciano has a pragmatic streak, as well as a recognition that action needs to be taken to preserve profitability in increasingly challenging market conditions. “We think things are going to come back but the layer of profitability may not come back,” he told the conference last May, referring to grain and oilseed trading. “And I think that’s something important for everybody to realise.” 
25;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Grain powerhouse ADM makes Bunge takeover approach;Deal would combine two of the world’s four largest grain merchants;US agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland has approached its rival Bunge about a potential takeover that would combine two of the world’s four largest grain trading houses, three people briefed on the matter said.ADM’s approach comes eight months after Swiss commodities trader Glencore proposed a tie-up with Bunge, setting the scene for a potential bidding war.Glencore and Bunge had signed a standstill agreement that prevented any further talks between the two companies until February. It was unclear whether Bunge, which had a market capitalisation of about almost $11bn on Friday evening, is interested in pursuing a deal with ADM, said one person briefed about the situation.Along with Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, ADM and Bunge constitute the so-called ‘ABCD’ of global grain traders, buying millions of tonnes of corn, soyabeans and wheat from farmers for processing into food or export to booming markets such as China.In the summer Bunge chief executive Soren Schroder left a door open to a possible transaction, saying that the suburban New York-based company would seriously evaluate any offer that would generate shareholder value. However, he has emphasised partnerships and joint ventures as a means of consolidating an industry suffering from too much capacity.A combination of Bunge and ADM would face serious pressure from antitrust authorities to divest assets especially in the US and Canada, an industry executive said. This could offer an opportunity for Glencore or another company to acquire those assets without engaging in a bidding war for the whole of Bunge.It is unclear whether Glencore would renew its interest in a deal after the standstill agreement ends as the commodities group is concerned about a recent decline in profitability at Bunge, said people familiar with its thinking.Bunge, which is incorporated in Bermuda, has no poison pill or bylaws that would allow it to fend off an unsolicited approach, making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover.Its shares spiked in the last minutes of trading on Friday to end 11.3 per cent higher, and gained another 1 per cent in after-hours trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported the talks. ADM’s stock rose a little over 1 per cent in after-hours trading, giving the Chicago-based company a market value of nearly $23bn.ADM and Glencore declined to comment, while Bunge did not respond to a request for comment.While demand for grains continues to grow, agricultural traders have struggled as a succession of bumper crops has depressed prices and curtailed trading opportunities.Farmers have built up their own storage bins, allowing them to wait for more favourable prices before selling harvests to traders. Consumer food companies, recognising the state of plenty, have been reluctant to pay traders a premium for firm supplies.In some locations, grain merchants have overbuilt ports and silos needed to handle flows of grain and oilseeds, whittling down profit margins. In November, Mr Schroder cited “a growing understanding within the industry that something has to change, particularly in the US”.ADM dates to 1902. It is the most US-weighted of the ABCD companies, with more than half its processing plants and nearly three-quarters of its procurement facilities located in the country. It has sought to expand its global reach, including through an attempt to take over Graincorp of Australia that was blocked by local authorities.Bunge was founded in 1818 in Amsterdam, moved its headquarters to South America in the early 20th century and resettled in New York before its public listing in 2001. Reflecting its history, it has an important presence in South American soyabeans, corn and sugarcane, in addition to assets elsewhere.

Last year Bunge, with a $9.8bn market cap, was approached by Swiss-based commodity trader and miner Glencore about a possible business combination with its agricultural arm. That received a cool response from Bunge, which said at the time it was focused on “pursuing opportunity for driving growth and value creation.”The WSJ report said it was possible that neither Glencore nor ADM, which has a market value of $22.6bn at Friday’s close, would succeed in getting Bunge into their fold.Last year, Bunge shares advanced 15.6 per cent.
27;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Apollo partners with ADM in new bid for Unilever spreads unit;Rivals to KKR and CVC tap turnround executive for $7bn auction;Apollo Global Management has partnered with Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader, and a veteran British turnround executive, as it prepares to submit a fresh bid in the $7bn auction for Unilever’s spreads business.ADM, with dozens of oilseed processing plants across the Americas and Europe, has been investing in value-added businesses such as food ingredients but would join Apollo as a strategic partner rather than an investor. The company may play a role working with Apollo to find synergies in spreads production, people close to the discussions said.Apollo has also tapped David Haines, former chief executive of Germany’s Grohe, to become executive chairman involved in running the unit, which includes Flora margarine and the spread until recently known as I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!, should it win the bid battle against rivals KKR and CVC Capital Partners.The auction for the spreads unit is expected to result in one of the largest private equity deals of 2017. Unilever has cautioned that a sale is not assured and that it could instead pursue alternatives including a public offering, though advisers working with bidders raised doubts that the company would walk away from a deal in favour of a listing.Mr Haines is credited as the driving force behind the turnround of the German bathroom fitting maker — enabling stakeholders including TPG Capital and Credit Suisse to almost treble their investment when they exited in 2013. He remained as chief executive until 2016 and is also a non-executive director at UK tobacco group Imperial Brands.But Mr Haines’ time at Grohe was singled out in 2005 by a senior German politician as an example of private equity’s capacity to inflict heavy job losses. Ultimately, Mr Haines cut fewer jobs than was expected and the revival of Grohe became a case study in private equity turnrounds.Apollo has also brought on board a group of former industry executives who were working for Bain Capital, which bowed out of the auction in an earlier round, two people familiar with the matter said.Questions over the future of jobs at the unit could play an important role in the transaction if Unilever unions mount opposition, people closely following the auction process said.The Anglo-Dutch group’s European works council has called on the company to find “a responsible buyer” to help protect the jobs of more than 1,000 workers at the unit in Europe.Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, has been a flag-bearer for responsible business, especially in providing employment and has prioritised long-term thinking and sustainability over short-term profits.Even though its spreads unit is highly profitable, Unilever has been running a process to exit the business as revenues have been in decline in the face of changing consumer tastes for more natural products, such as butter.ADM, based in Chicago, said: “We are not pursuing a bid for Unilever’s spreads business.” It declined to comment on the nature of its involvement with Apollo.CVC, the European private equity group, which is also planning to bid next week, is looking to positioning itself as the responsible European buyer of a business that cares about the way employees will be treated even after its sale, one person familiar with its thinking said.CVC is hoping that one of its Dutch partners will help it win over Unilever’s management and the company’s unions as it may not be able to match the level of an Apollo bid, one person close to the situation said.Private equity groups have been raising a record amount of capital in recent years as investors look at the asset class as a way to make returns in a low-interest rate environment.Earlier this year Apollo raised $25bn from investors — the largest fund in private equity’s history. CVC raised €16bn in Europe, making it the largest fund on the continent.Private equity executives are under huge pressure to deploy unspent capital, which has led to worries that buyers will push the envelope when it comes to price which will eventually hit returns.Unilever is advised by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
28;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-11-17T04:00:36Z;Grain traders grapple with rise of Russian exports;Companies continue to rely on US markets for hedging despite diversifying trade flows;The $20m loss by US agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland on hedge positions in Black Sea grain has raised questions about traders’ commitment to traditional North American derivative benchmarks as Russia takes a bigger slice of the global grains market.The company said two weeks ago that its loss stemmed from a “lack of correlation” between its hedges in North America and the underlying movement in the prices of grains in the Black Sea region, representing Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.The loss shone a spotlight on how agricultural companies have continued to rely almost entirely on North American benchmarks for their hedging and trading even as the global grains market has undergone a fundamental shift east.Rising productivity in Russia made the country the world’s largest wheat exporter for the first time in 2015-16, vying for top position with the US — which has seen its share of grain exports fall from 45 per cent three decades ago to just 15 per cent today, according to US Department of Agriculture data.But while trade flows have shifted dramatically the derivative market has been far more stable.The dominant contract has remained the soft red winter (SRW) wheat future traded in Chicago, which debuted 140 years ago, which has at least 70 per cent of the market.“Liquidity is king,” says Scott Irwin, agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, referring to traders’ attraction to contracts with high volumes that can help smooth out price movements.Once a commodity futures contract achieves a certain level of demand and liquidity position, it is difficult for a competing contract to attract trading away, says Prof Irwin, adding that traders may choose market depth over a derivatives contract traded in the same timezone as the physical trade or one that closely matches the physical specifications.Fred Seamon, executive director of CME’s agricultural research and product development, says that there was no reason for the benchmark contract to move from Chicago, even as the exchange has experimented with launching wheat derivatives more closely tied to the Black Sea.“There is nothing that forces benchmark status from Chicago,” said Mr Seamon. “It may happen but there’s nothing that would necessitate [that].”The CME is launching a Black Sea wheat derivatives contract later this year after a first attempt in 2012.Mr Seamon said SRW’s price correlation to international markets had already improved through the introduction of electronic day trading a decade ago.There has, however, been some signs of a small shift eastward this decade.Economists at the US Department of Agriculture and Montana State University said in a new study that Paris — where the wheat contract is more closely linked to the Black Sea — had roughly doubled its influence over global prices in recent years.They said that though SRW in Chicago remains dominant, their research suggests Europe is becoming more important for “price discovery” as Black Sea grains take a bigger part of the market.Since 2010, when a ban on grain exports by Russia after a serious drought wreaked havoc on the wheat markets, the importance of the Euronext milling wheat contract in Paris has been rising, they said, having studied price data and how it responds in various markets to major news events.In 2013, Paris accounted for about 20 per cent of the share of price discovery, the academics said, as the market that moved first in response to news that affected wheat prices in all locations. That was up from about 10 per cent at the start of 2008, according to their research.“There has been a long-term shift in the centre of gravity and area of influence,” says Olivier Raevel, head of commodities at Euronext in Paris, referring to the growth in influence of Black Sea grains.Volumes of Euronext’s milling wheat contract have jumped more than ninefold in the decade to 2016, while open interest — the number of outstanding contracts held by buyers or sellers — has almost quintupled, even as its share of the market versus Chicago has been steady.While traders have been slow to adopt contracts specifically tied to Black Sea grains, some believe that hedging has always been a skill, and that companies simply need to find what works best for them.One Swiss based grain trader says he is mostly hedging his physical positions in Black Sea wheat this year with physical trades.Swithun Still, director of Solaris Commodities says: “The best hedge for Russian wheat is Russian wheat.”This article has been updated to identify the Swiss trader.It has been amended to change Russian grain trading position to wheat trading and to clarify CME’s product launch.
29;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-11-01T11:26:22Z;Bunge cuts profit forecasts for second time in three months;;Bunge, one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders, further reduced its profit outlook for the year as difficult market conditions weighed on its grain and sugar businesses.The New York-listed company on Wednesday estimated operating profit for 2017 in its core agribusiness segment would total between $425m and $500m, down from an earlier prediction of $550m to $650m and less than half the guidance outlined in February.Bunge blamed the change partly on disappointing profit margins from crushing oilseeds. In its Brazil-based sugar and ethanol business, Bunge foresaw full-year operating profit at $45m to $55m, down from $100m to $120m, in part because of lower-than-expected Brazilian ethanol prices and less in sugar trading.The announcements came as Bunge reported third-quarter earnings of $92m, or 59 cents per share, down from $118m or 79 cents a year earlier. Adjusted for items, earnings were 75 cents, a penny above Wall Street estimates.Soren Schroder, chief executive, said: “Our earnings improved sequentially and year-over-year, although they continued to be impacted by market and industry headwinds.”Bunge is among a small group of companies that buy crops from farmers for processing into basic foodstuffs or distribution to food makers. The sector has struggled as large grain supplies dampen trading activity and price swings.ADM, a competitor, on Tuesday reported a 44 per cent decline in net profit for the third quarter, due in part to slow US exports of corn and soyabeans in the face of competition from South America. “We are not counting on a significant change in conditions before 2018,” Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, told analysts.Cargill, the world’s biggest largest agricultural trading house, recently reported lower quarterly profits in its main grain trading division.Bunge said that in the agribusiness segment, “margins in global grain trading and distribution remained weak due to competitive pressures and limited dislocation opportunities.”The company has been eyed as a potential takeover target for Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities trader that is seeking to expand in agriculture.Glencore Agriculture in May disclosed it had informally approached Bunge about a deal. The two have reached a standstill agreement that prevents Glencore from buying Bunge shares or making a public approach until at least February, two people familiar with the matter said. Shares of Bunge have surrendered all of their gains since Glencore announced its interest.Farha Aslam, analyst at Stephens, said in a note ahead of the earnings announcement that Bunge’s share price “has not traded on earnings but rather has been supported by the anticipation of M&A”.Photo: Bloomberg
30;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-10-31T11:31:51Z;Archer Daniels Midland profit hit by weak exports;;"Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s biggest crop traders and processors, reported worse-than-expected results for the third quarter as bountiful supplies of corn and soyabeans held back exports from the US.
The Chicago-based company is among the handful that dominate the international grain trade, shuttling food commodities from farms to countries dependent on imports. Its biggest footprint is in the US, which has struggled to export grain in the face of competition from South America.Net profit was $192m or 34 cents per share in the quarter, down from $341m or 58 cents in the same period a year before. Excluding one-time items, ADM earned 45 cents per share, well below Wall Street expectations of 55 cents.Shares in ADM fell more than 2 per cent in pre-market trading.ADM had previously given guidance that its agricultural services segment, which houses its grain trading activities, would be weaker than before.The segment’s adjusted operating profit totalled $87m, down from $195m a year before. Grain handling results suffered “largely due to the lack of competitiveness of US corn and soybeans in global markets.”Slow US grain exports also hit ADM’s transportation business, which includes barges that take grain down the Mississippi river to export terminals.In a statement on Tuesday Juan Luciano, chief executive said: “Our third quarter results were below our expectations, as the operating environment in our ag services and oilseeds businesses was more challenging than anticipated.”Adjusted operating profit at ADM’s oilseeds division, which crushes soyabeans into animal feed and vegetable oil, fell to $119m from $145m in the same quarter a year before."
31;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-09-28T12:01:45Z;Louis Dreyfus profits jump boosted by trading arm;;"Louis Dreyfus Company, one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities, reported a sharp increase in half year profits on Thursday, boosted by a strong performance from its trading arm.Pretax profits in the six months to June climbed by more than a third to $206m,
on sales up 18 per cent to $27.7bn. Net income came in at $159m, up from $136m a year earlier.“The half year results, in what continues to be a fundamentally challenging market for the agricultural sector, show our ability to adapt,” LDC’s chief executive Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena said in a statement.LDC is one of a small group of companies that dominate global flows of crops and food stuffs. These include Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Glencore.Like its peers, the 166-year old company has struggled with tough conditions in its core grain and oilseeds market brought by bumper harvest and farmers hoarding supplies.Thursday’s results showed that LDC’s “Value Chain business”, which houses its grain and oilseed operations, had recorded flat operating profits of $352m in the period.But its ‘merchandizing”, or trading arm, saw operating profits rise to $250m, up from $195m, on the back of improved results in cotton.“The cotton platform delivered substantial and improved results over the first half of 2017,” the company said. ” This was generated by a winning strategy, coupled with increased global trade.LDC also said its metal business delivered a “satisfactory results”.LDC is looking to sell a stake in the metals unit, which trades copper, lead and zinc, to help fund further growth and focus on grain and oilseeds, the historic core of the business.As part of this strategy, the Geneva-based company, which is controlled by Russian-born billionaire Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, is also looking for partners to invest in its, dairy, and orange juice units.“We are starting to see renewed optimism, most notably in Europe, but still recognize the need for flexibility to adjust our geographic and operational footprint,” said Mr Martiarena. ““We have successfully begun a divestment process for some non-strategic assets and since closing the first half of the year, we have also entered into an agreement to sell our African fertilizers and inputs business.”Thursday’s results showed total adjusted gross debt fallen to $3bn, down from $3.6bn at the start of the year. The company handled 43.3m tonnes of commodities, a rise of 8 per cent year-on-year."

But since it embarked on the acquisitions of Nidera and the agricultural operations of Noble Group in 2014, it has faced unexpected setbacks.At the end of last year it had discovered a $150m hole in the Dutch agricultural commodity trader’s accounts. The problems, stemming from Nidera’s Brazilian operations, followed losses caused by a rogue biofuels trader a year earlier.At the start of this year, the Chinese group lost Matt Jansen, a former ADM manager, who joined as as chief executive of Cofco International.Earlier this month, in his first move to expand Cofco International since he took over as chief executive, Jingtao (Johnny) Chi announced a partnership with US farm cooperative Growmark in a deal that gives China more direct access to the food it imports.Cofco International could not be reached for comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Mr Sitorus stepped down as executive deputy chairman in April to become a non-independent non-executive director of Wilmar.The two companies’ relationship dates to their days operating soyabean crushing joint ventures in China. ADM later converted its stake in the ventures into equity in Wilmar. Juan Luciano, ADM’s chief executive, sits on Wilmar’s board.
35;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-08-08T10:32:47Z;Tough times for big grain traders;Intense competition means record crops generate little profit for middlemen;Booming production and strong demand has helped the world’s biggest oil traders record bumper profits in recent years.Yet similar market conditions have not been as kind to big grain traders, who have seen profits decline and margins squeezed. The question is why?One answer is slow farmer selling in key producing regions like Argentina and Brazil, which forces traders to compete aggressively with each other for the crops needed to satisfy their export commitments.That at least, is the view of Soren Schroder, the chief executive of Bunge — the B in the so-called “ABCD” of companies that dominate international agricultural trading, along with Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company.“Commodity prices dropped during harvest, farmers held back selling and used all means to store their crops, in silo bags, at co-operatives” Mr Schroder explained last week after the company reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits.“Brazilian exporters and crushers therefore fell behind on procurement and had to compete aggressively for bean origination to fulfil commitments,” he continued.The result, according to Mr Schroder, was that grain traders and processors made little or no profit from a record South American crop.“The size of the mismatch between farmer pricing and industry commitments is unprecedented and challenges the traditional wisdom of farmer marketing patterns”, he concluded.For margins in both soyabean crushing (the process used to make vegetable oil and protein meal) and grain trading to return to historic norms, Mr Schroder says it will require the industry to be more responsive and manage capacity actively.It will have to work more closely with farmers, who now have a wealth of information at their fingertips, and offer them new financing and risk management tools as well as logistics, so they can lock in a larger share of crop before harvest. All of which is easier said then done.The industry will also have to think about consolidation, says Mr Schroder. But how that consolidation plays out is the subject of much debate within the industry at the moment and there are no clear answers from the leading players.Glencore’s agricultural arm — a joint venture with two Canadian pension funds — has already nailed its colours to the mast. It approached Bunge over a possible business combination in May but was rebuffed. It is likely to come again but for the moment is playing its cards close to its chest.Mr Schroder prefers a regional partnership approach, something he says is a fairly straightforward way to achieve rationalisation and better utilisation of assets. Indeed, Bunge has struck several such deals in recent years.Meanwhile, ADM has the financial firepower to strike large deals, according to its chief executive Juan Luciano, but is wary about the benefits of consolidation which is often confused with dealmaking and land grabs.“If I look at transactions in the past, most of them have been the consequence of someone trying to grow more than consolidating a position,” he told the Financial Times last week after reporting second-quarter results.“Some of the transactions we may see in the future may be the same — a strong player taking over a strong player for geographic growth rather than consolidation,” he added.The Commodities Note is an occasional online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
36;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-08-02T11:31:08Z;Bunge second quarter earnings slide;;Bunge, the grain trader that is a possible takeover target for Swiss commodities group Glencore, reported a sharp drop in second quarter earnings as it battled tough market conditions.The New York-listed company, the world’s largest oilseed processor and a leading merchant of corn, soyabeans and wheat, reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.17 cents in the three months to June, down from $0.79 cents in the same period a year ago. Net income attributable to Bunge shareholders fell 33 per cent to $81m.The results were slightly lower than markets forecasts, which were cut last month after the company issued a surprise profit warning. They were also flattered by $55m of tax related gains.“Weak global margins and slower than expected farmer selling in South America led to a challenging second quarter in agribusiness”, said Bunge chief executive Soren Schroder in a statement. “We are optimistic about a much better second half, but some markets headwinds will still exist.”Most of Bunge’s revenue and profit come from its agribusiness division, which buys wholesale grains and oilseeds and stores, ships and sells them around the worldMassive stockpiles and low prices following several years of bumper harvests have hit agricultural commodity prices and volatility. As a result there have been fewer profitable trading opportunities for Bunge and its rivals which include Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus Company and Glencore.Bunge said it expected the agribusiness unit to deliver earnings before interest of between $550m and $650m in 2017. Before its profits warning it had expected the unit to make EBIT of $800m to $925m. Overall, Bunge now expects group EBIT to be around $1bn in 2017, down from its May projection of around $1.34bn.“While consumption of soy meal and oil is strong, the crushing industry oversupplied the market during the second quarter, resulting in a meal surplus that is expected to weigh on margins through the third quarter,” said Mr Schroder.Last month, Bunge announced plans to slash $450m in costs and capital spending in an effort to boost weakening profit margins and ward off a possible takeover approach from Glencore. The Swiss based commodity trader and miner said in May it had approached Bunge about a “business combination”.Mr Schroder said he expected the cost cutting plan to reduce overheads by $250m by the end of the 2019 with $100m of savings expected next year.“This is a transformational next step that will significantly boost our competitiveness as market conditions improve,” he said.

But their presence attests to what fund managers say is rising demand for opportunities in agriculture as financiers seek to capitalise on trends such as population growth, changing eating habits and innovation.Their timing may be viewed by some as inauspicious. The UK’s vote to leave the EU a year ago prompted a fierce debate over the future of farming and food prices while comments made by Justin King, who formerly ran supermarket group J Sainsbury for a decade, thrust the industry into the spotlight this week.“Brexit, almost in whatever version it is . . . will introduce barriers,” Mr King told the BBC’s Panorama programme, adding that shoppers are set to face “higher prices, less choice and poorer quality”.Fund managers are divided over the effect leaving the EU will have on agriculture, but they argue that the sector as a whole is still attractive when conceived as a play on a growing and diversifying food market, with niche opportunities in direct lending.$850mAmount Prestige Funds has under management“UK farming is pretty easy to understand,” says Craig Reeves, chief executive of Prestige Funds, a direct lending specialist which funded the biogas plant. The company, which has $850m in assets under management across two funds, raised about $250m in 2016, and $150m this year, from investors including two Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, a Spanish university endowment and a large Korean financial institution.The UK farming industry accounted for 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product last year and was worth £8.2bn. The majority of its 466,000 workers are employed on family-owned farms producing cereals, meat, dairy and poultry goods.Only three of the 21 agriculture-focused funds domiciled in Europe are based in the UK, with the group as a whole having €1.77bn in assets at the end of April, according to Morningstar. That is down from €1.99bn at end of 2016, but managers insist interest is returning.Agriculture is still an important part of the economy and Britain an important food exporter, says Jeneiv Shah, deputy fund manager at the Sarasin Food & Agriculture Opportunities fund.“It is more challenging than it was 10 years ago, from a farmer’s perspective, but for stock market investors it’s still quite attractive,” he says, arguing that the sector offers exposure to growth in the food market, particularly as consumers become more concerned with the provenance of what they eat and the increasing numbers of people eating away from home.The Sarasin fund has £135m in assets under management, with just under a quarter allocated to the UK. Having launched in 2008, its annualised growth rate is 6.53 per cent, but during the past three years it has been 13.4 per cent. Interest from both retail and institutional investors has ticked up this year.Companies that it has invested in include Leroy Seafood Group, a Norwegian seafood exporter, and Archer Daniels Midland, an Illinois-based group that processes agricultural products.Demographics are working in the sector’s favour. The world’s population is expected to reach 9.7bn by 2050, up from about 7.3bn today, according to estimates from the UN, a fact that managers point to with enthusiasm. As well as there being more of us, we are also increasingly fussy about what we eat.“Historically, the real focus of food has been how are we going to feed 9bn people as cheaply as possible,” says Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management, who manages the BNP Paribas Parvest Smart Food fund, which was launched in 2015 and had €443m in assets at the end of May.But now, thanks to factors such as concerns over pesticides, the use of GM crops, climate change and people wanting to eat more healthily, “this is shifting to a bigger focus on quality”.Innovation is another attraction as farmers ramp up their use of technology to improve profitability.Gertjan van der Geer, co-manager of the Pictet-Agriculture fund at Pictet Asset Management, says there are good opportunities in precision agriculture, an approach to farming that deploys techniques such as automated steering for machinery in the field to reduce overlapping and overspraying.These reduce farm costs but also make the industry more efficient — a plus for investors who are increasingly considering environmental factors in their decision making.€443mTotal in assets of the BNP Paribas Parvest Smart Food fund at the end of May“We want them to be more productive but more sustainable,” Mr van der Geer says. “Institutional investors are looking for more thematic opportunities.”This interest is a welcome vote of confidence in a sector facing many pressures, some of them linked to the UK’s vote to leave the EU. Input costs have risen after sterling’s depreciation and it is not clear what will happen to subsidies and seasonal EU migrant labour, putting the sector under enormous strain.“Even the very best farmers find it difficult to operate in terms of the blank sheet ahead of them,” says Vicki Hird, campaign co-ordinator at Sustain, a food and environment consultancy. “It’s the worst kind of pressure, in that it’s completely unknown.”Mr Reeves, who plans to launch a new fund later this year lending to Ireland, agrees. Prestige does not have any concrete stipulations on green issues when it comes to lending but it is keen to fund more environmentally friendly projects. If nothing else, biogas plants and solar panels help farmers’ bottom line.“A lot of these businesses operate on a very thin margin — on a good day”, he says.
40;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-06-14T10:03:38Z;WiFi tractor cab ‘hedge funds’ give farmers an edge;Wealth of new information eats into insider advantage of big grain companies;The video quickly went viral: a Nebraska farmer, clad in a life jacket and blue jeans, skimming across his uncle’s flooded field on a wakeboard.Quentin Connealy’s watery ride last month became a minor sensation on social media. It also added a data point about a soggy start to the growing season in the US midwest. Grain traders took notice.A new transparency is taking hold in agricultural markets, once an opaque realm. From farmers’ Twitter posts to weather maps, shipping data, satellite photos of fields and online grain marketplaces, it is chipping away at the insider advantages of international grain companies.Analysts are debating whether the rapid spread of information means structurally lower profits for the trading arms of a grain industry led by the “ABCD” companies — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus.“There’s less information arbitrage. That was one of the core elements of their edge,” says Alex Keane, a former trader for Cargill who helps run Pathway Agriculture, a Geneva-based investment manager.Broadly speaking, insider trading is an essential feature of commodities markets. A farmer who observes good weather and heavy corn seedings by his neighbours might hasten to sell his corn crop before prices decline.Grain companies have traditionally multiplied the farmer’s powers of observation through global networks of warehouse and port managers, in-house meteorologists and agronomists and central communications. Cargill’s private teletype system, used for most of the 20th century, was “one of the company’s strongest competitive advantages”, the company says.“The gap has narrowed significantly,” says a former Cargill employee who now trades for a hedge fund. “The amount of information we have access to or can get our hands on is very, very similar to what a Cargill or ADM or Bunge or Dreyfus had.”The transparency starts in the wifi-enabled cabs of modern tractors. There, farmers outfitted with as many screens as a Wall Street trader can monitor weather maps, track government reports on acreage or crop production, execute sales to the local silo complex or trade agricultural futures. Multitasking is easy because the tractors can steer themselves.“They’re running mini-hedge funds out of their cabs,” says Farha Aslam, food and agriculture analyst at Stephens, an investment bank.Karl Setzer of MaxYield Co-operative, an Iowa grain company, says farmers used to like personal visits from grain merchants. “The majority of farmers today don’t want that,” Mr Setzer says. “Some you couldn’t track down if you tried. They’d rather have a text message, an email.”The most powerful data in grain markets still come from government agencies such as the US Department of Agriculture and Conab in Brazil, which report detailed figures on planting area and crops. While public, the internet has speeded their dissemination.Guessing what the official numbers would say has long been a speciality of commodity brokers. But a growing number of companies have improved how they process data from satellite images to offer yield predictions ahead of the agencies. “Early tech firms like us are going to work pretty hard to democratise this stuff,” says David Potere, chief executive of Tellus Labs, a start-up which touts the accuracy of its satellite-based 2016 US soyabean and corn yield forecasts.Meanwhile, Mr Keane says subscription weather services have become more tailored to agriculture in the past decade.Then there is what farmers call “Ag Twitter”. Just this week, users of the messaging service posted comments and photos about “rough-looking” crops in Indiana, stunted soyabean seedlings in a dry South Dakota and hail-damaged corn in Minnesota.Mr Connealy, of Tekamah, Nebraska, posted his wakeboarding video on Twitter after five inches of rain fell in a week in an attempt to “put our little town on the map”, he says.But Twitter is also useful for his business: growing corn and soyabeans for sale mainly to Cargill and Bunge. He follows hundreds of farmers and industry experts to keep abreast of grain markets.“You can always pay a marketer to study that stuff for you. You pay him quite a bit,” Mr Connealy says. “But if you can pull it up on Twitter, it gives you more perspective.”A fire hose of information is no guarantee of quality. Even the best-informed traders make mistakes, as shown by high-profile losses in soyabeans last year.But it’s nevertheless changing the economics of agricultural trading. “The arbitrage power that a lot of the big trading houses had,” says Rajiv Singh, a senior executive at Rabobank, “is clearly getting eroded by the transparency and availability of data.”
41;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-05-24T17:40:13Z;Glencore keen to bulk up in agricultural trading;Ambitious trader has more to do to convince Bunge about the merits of a takeover;One thing that sets Glencore apart from many of its rivals is a willingness to do ambitious deals.The latest example came in December, when the Swiss mining and trading group joined forces with the Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund to swoop for a 19.5 per cent stake in Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil producer.Now, Glencore’s hard-charging chief executive Ivan Glasenberg has spotted another opening, this time in agriculture. On Tuesday evening Glencore said its agricultural arm had approached Bunge of the US, one of the world’s biggest grain traders, about a “possible consensual business combination”.A takeover of Bunge, if it happens, would create one of the world’s largest agricultural trading merchants, with leading positions in crops such as soyabeans and wheat, and assets spread around the globe.It would also be further confirmation that Glencore has emerged from a debt crisis that saw the company locked in a battle for survival towards the end of 2015.“Agriculture has always been [in] our strategy,” Mr Glasenberg told shareholders at Glencore’s annual meeting on Wednesday. “Hopefully it will get bigger in the future.”The disclosure of Glencore’s approach comes just weeks after Bunge reported an 80 per cent plunge in net profit for the first quarter of 2017 and its chief executive Soren Schroder said it was open to combinations with rivals because of increasingly difficult market conditions.Large agricultural traders have struggled in recent years as bumper harvests and fierce competition have squeezed margins. As crop prices have declined farmers have hoarded grain, forcing traders to pay more.At the same time customers in fast-growing markets such as China are consolidating and using their size to buy directly from farmers.Some traders have responded by shifting to higher margin areas such as fish food, but others are seeking joint ventures or alliances.Mr Glasenberg has made no secret of the fact that he wants Glencore’s agriculture arm to join the elite group of companies that dominate agricultural trading: Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company.When Glencore last year sold a 50 per cent stake in the arm to two Canadian pension funds for more than $3bn, it was not simply to raise cash to help hit its debt reduction targets.It was also to expand the business, now called Glencore Agriculture, which is a large player in wheat trading but which lacks a presence in the US and also needs to bulk up in South America.One way to do that was to bring in investors with deep pockets, and the retirement funds — the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and British Columbia Investment Management Corp — certainly have that.But the sale also brought other benefits. Glencore Agriculture is now run as a joint venture, which means its debt is no longer on Glencore’s balance sheet.This move was important because in 2015, as commodities prices reached new lows, some shareholders questioned whether Glencore could service its large borrowings The company’s stock plunged.Scarred by that experience, Mr Glasenberg has promised investors he will keep Glencore’s leverage under control. Specifically that means he will not let the company’s net debt rise to more than twice the level of its annual core earnings.While a takeover of Bunge has obvious attractions — it is the world’s largest processor of soyabeans, with a major presence in South America — analysts say a deal of this size could worry some Glencore shareholders.Bunge’s market capitalisation is about $11.6bn, while Glencore Agriculture is worth $6.25bn excluding debt based on the price paid by the Canadian pension funds for their stake.“While the market expects — and is comfortable with — smaller bolt-on acquisitions . . . a merger with Bunge looks to be in a different league,” says Heath Jansen, analyst at Citigroup.One way Glencore Agriculture could fund a takeover of Bunge would be to bring in more investors, including some of those that failed to secure a stake in the transaction with the Canadian pension funds, say bankers involved in the creation of the joint venture.“The new structure of Glencore’s Agri JV means that funding a large deal of this nature isn’t particularly troublesome to Glencore,” says James Milligan, analyst at Olivetree Securities.One person familiar with Glencore’s thinking says the company has been talking to all the large agricultural traders over the past six months to see which companies might be open to a combination.During those conservations, it became apparent that a takeover of Bunge was attractive partly because of the opportunity to cut costs, adds this person.Tyler Broda, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says: “Bunge’s selling and general administration costs, which accounted for 50 per cent of its gross profit, should be a starting point for driving synergies [with Glencore Agriculture].”However, it is doubtful whether Bunge, founded in 1818, would accept a takeover by Glencore Agriculture.Bunge said on Tuesday that it was not in “business combination” discussions with Glencore. It declined to comment further on Wednesday.That cool response is unlikely to concern Mr Glasenberg. The person close to Glencore says it will let the dust settle before making its next move.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
42;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-05-03T17:05:41Z;Bunge open to tie-ups as it warns of lower profits;CEO Schroder says historic shift in commodities market could lower long-term earnings;Bunge, one of the world’s leading grain traders, has opened the door to a large-scale tie-up in its sector after acknowledging that a historic shift in agricultural commodities markets threatened to persistently depress profits.The New York-listed company, with silos, ports and grain mills in 40 countries, said it was willing to participate in more combinations in the grain-handling industry it dominates alongside companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Glencore and Louis Dreyfus.Consolidation, “in whichever form, is becoming more obvious”, Soren Schroder, chief executive, told analysts after reporting an 80 per cent decline in first-quarter net profit and lowering its outlook on Wednesday.Mr Schroder said operators needed to consolidate to shave costs amid slim profit margins. “We’re certainly open to look at anything that creates value for shareholders and makes us more efficient,” he said.Bunge’s agribusiness division has suffered from several years of bumper corn, wheat and soyabean crops. As crop prices skidded lower farmers hoarded grain and forced traders to pay more. Food companies that are traders’ customers have balked at buying far in advance as they assume that supplies are plentiful.We’re certainly open to look at anything that creates value for shareholders and makes us more efficientThe Bloomberg grains sub-index, a price benchmark, has tumbled 43 per cent from 2012, when crop shortfalls in Brazil and the US led to a scramble for supply that benefited traders.Mr Schroder estimated that average profit margins from procuring and shipping grain from the US and South America had declined by $3-$4 per tonne from $8-$10 per tonne four or five years ago.“You have to assume that once it’s gone, it’s hard to get back unless you get into a period of dislocations, which we have not had for a long time,” Mr Schroder said in an interview.Bunge has made smaller acquisitions in areas such as value-added food products and forged partnerships in grain and oilseed handling and processing, such as a venture in Brazil to export soyabeans and corn with local agricultural company Amaggi.Mr Schroder told the FT that consolidation was more likely to take the form of combinations with other companies than takeovers. “It could be local or regional, it could be something bigger. The concept applies to large and small alike,” he said.Bunge was 10.1 per cent lower at $67.96 at midday on Wednesday in New York, giving it a market value of $9.5bn. Net profit in the first quarter was $47m, or 35 cents a share, down from $235m or $1.41 a share a year earlier. Analysts had expected 71 cents a share.On Tuesday, ADM shares plunged after it lowered its long-term target for investor returns and took an impairment charge against its global trade desk.Louis Dreyfus recently reported a drop in operating profits for 2016, as it continued to grapple with unfavourable markets conditions. LDC’s chief executive Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena said plentiful supplies and speculative inflows had made it difficult to make money from trading and he did not expect conditions to change in 2017.Speaking at the FT Commodities Global Summit in March, the heads of some of the world’s biggest agricultural traders said the industry would have to adapt to lower margins after a decade of bumper growth driven by the shifting diets of the rising middle class in developing markets.Additional reporting by Neil Hume in London
43;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-05-02T18:45:26Z;ADM shares fall after it says grain surplus will weigh on returns;;Archer Daniels Midland shares suffered a sharp fall Tuesday after the food commodities company indicated a persistent surplus of grain supplies would weigh on investor returns.The Chicago-based company is one of the world’s leading processors and shippers of corn, soyabeans and other agricultural commodities. As bumper crops pile up across the globe, however, it has curtailed opportunities to trade.ADM’s difficulties have been particularly pronounced at its global trade desk, based in Switzerland. The company recently announced a new head for the unit, Gary McGuigan, and on Tuesday said it would take $7m in impairment and restructuring charges in the first quarter primarily connected to restructuring the desk.Juan Luciano, chief executives, told analysts that “with ample stocks around the world, there is a very subdued environment for us to make profitable international trades.”As trading profits suffer, the company aims to reduce its cost per tonne traded. It shut down an office in South Africa and merged offices in Argentina. It also aims to build “destination marketing,” such as a joint venture with Cairo-based Medsofts, that would bring ADM in closer contact with customers and could increase trading profit margins from about $2-$4 per tonne to roughly $8-$10 per tonne, Mr Luciano said.Mr Luciano acknowledged that the company’s agricultural services business, which encompasses trading, has been generating profits “short of the range we used to hit, and we’re not going to hit it this year.” Adjusted operating profit in the division was $88m in the first quarter, up from $76m in the same quarter a year before.ADM’s net profit in the quarter rose to $339m, or 59 cents a share, from $230m, or 39 cents a share, in the same period a year before.The company also reduced its estimated cost of capital to 7 per cent from 8 per cent while maintaining a goal for return on invested capital of 2 percentage points above its cost of capital, “effectively lowering” its implied return target to 9 per cent from 10 per cent, said Ann Duignan, an analyst at JPMorgan.Shares in ADM were down 8.7 per cent to $41.77 in the New York afternoon.
44;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-04-03T12:23:26Z;Louis Dreyfus 2016 sales fall on high supplies, market volatility;;Strong supplies of agricultural commodities and price volatility led to a fall in 2016 sales at commodities trading house Louis Dreyfus Company, although net profits rose on tax gains.LDC, which competes with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill in agricultural resource, said earnings rose 45 per cent to $305m on a 11 per cent decline in net sales to $49.8bn and 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to $365m.Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena, LDC chief executive, said: “Oversupply, market shocks, geopolitical dynamics and adverse weather conditions were some of the difficulties that the agribusiness industry had to face during 2016.”The company’s “value chain” unit, which includes trading of grains, oilseeds and sugar, “posted decent logistics and processing margins” said the company, while its “merchandising” segment benefited from a strong contribution from its metals business.LDC is seeking to sell a stake in its metals unit as part of a wider strategic shift at the parent company, which is controlled by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, a Russia-born billionaire.
45;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2017-03-03T18:46:37Z;Carl Icahn: Fuel to the fire;The swamp is not drained. It now just has more creatures;Donald Trump may not have drained the swamp. But the field growing corn for ethanol gets plenty of attention. The president announced in December that his pugnacious friend and adviser, Carl Icahn, would counsel him on regulatory reform. Another Wall Street hand joining the administration was no shocker. However, Mr Icahn’s role was informal enough that he would not be forced to divest his vast financial interests (his wealth approaches $20bn). And coincidentally or not, one of his first priorities has been reform of an area in which he has investments.Mr Icahn has been a harsh critic of a rule that requires oil refiners to bear the cost of blending corn-based ethanol into petrol. His hedge fund owns a majority stake in, CVR Energy, a refiner that has had its market value almost double since the election to $2bn.Naturally, the appearance of self-dealing has sparked outrage. But an apparent reform to biofuel rules this week, that did not ultimately come to pass, created a rupture in the realm of Washington lobbyists. The flurry of machinations on all sides was an unintentional reminder that corporate influence already pervades American politics. But that it is typically more shrouded than Mr Icahn’s.Earlier this week, it was reported that the ethanol lobbying group, The Renewable Fuels Association had decided to reluctantly accept reform to the Renewable Fuel Standard that would provide relief to oil refiners. Another group called Fuels America that represents the likes of Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, and Monsanto was offended enough to cut its relationship with the RFA. Any change to the current rules have not been finalised but the jockeying among varied money interests persists.The ethanol industry is itself controversial with its harshest critics labelling the product as a giveaway to Midwestern farmers. There should be a real debate on biofuels, how costs should be borne across the value chain. But it might be better — and cheaper — for investors if the issue were not decided by a tussle between lobbyists old and new.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter in 2015 were 65 cents.ADM said its agricultural services division saw global demand for US commodities, and merchandising and handling benefited from strong export volumes in an improved margins. However, the global trade desk was hit “by poor execution and limited forward merchandising opportunities”.Juan Luciano, chief executive, said the division was “refocusing the team” and was looking at “reducing costs and people in general”.ADM is seeking to sell its corn-ethanol dry mills, but it said the bids received were not high enough. The company remains in talks with potential buyers, but with potential US corporate tax reforms on the horizon, it is also looking at different ways to structure the transaction.

Anti-subsidy tariffs will be 11.2 per cent to 12 per cent, the ministry said.Shares in Archer Daniels Midland, a leading US agricultural trader, fell 1.3 per cent to $43.8125.DDGS is used by the livestock industry as a feed substitute for corn and soya meal. US DDGS exports have exploded from 1m tonnes in 2006 to 11.7m in 2016, according to the US Grains Council. Of that, China accounted for about 30 per cent export market.

Cofco at the end of last year discovered a financial hole of $150m at Nidera’s Latin American operations, while in 2015 it faced losses due to unauthorised trading.Cofco announced Jingtao Chi as the chief executive of both Cofco Agri. Mr Chi is the former chairman of China Agri Industries Holdings, which is part of the Cofco Group.
49;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-12-02T05:15:36Z;Archer Daniels Midland sells 19.9% stake in Australia’s GrainCorp;US commodities merchant abandons Australian group it once sought to own outright;Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based agricultural commodities merchant, has sold its 19.9 per cent stake in Australian counterpart GrainCorp, abandoning a company it once sought to own in full.ADM initially sold the stake for A$387m (US$288m) to underwriters UBS, which later sold the shares on to several institutional investors and pension funds.ADM once viewed GrainCorp as a prize as it sought to diversify its supply map and get closer to growing food markets in Asia. In 2012, ADM divulged a stake and launched an unsolicited takeover attempt for GrainCorp, which was founded a century ago as a government agency. However, the deal was blocked by Canberra.The announcement comes as the US handles mammoth crops of corn, soyabeans and wheat, giving traders with extensive US silos and shipping networks — such as ADM — an edge in international grain markets.Australia, one of the world’s largest wheat exporters, is also on the cusp of a record crop. This will boost volumes for GrainCorp, the largest exporter of bulk grains from the east side of the country.In 2013, the Australian government said ADM’s proposed A$3.4bn takeover of GrainCorp was not in the national interest and rejected the sale. The proposed deal was opposed by the National party, a junior coalition partner in the government.ADM’s 19.9 per cent stake remained, and in 2014 Juan Luciano, chief executive, indicated he might increase it.When Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott as Australian prime minister in September 2015, some analysts speculated the government could change its mind and allow an ADM takeover. But this was quashed when the National party’s influence within the coalition government increased following a general election in July, which cut the government's majority to a single seat in the House of Representatives.In the intervening period, foreign ownership of agricultural land and assets has become an even more sensitive issue in Australia, which is experiencing a surge in Chinese investment. ADM’s sale of its stake follows an earlier attempt in July, which was aborted when banks did not offer a high enough price.Under Mr Luciano, ADM has been buying and selling assets to improve returns.“As part of our ongoing portfolio management, we carefully considered our equity investment position in GrainCorp and determined that we could better meet our long-term returns objectives by reallocating that capital,” he said.ADM will sell its stake at A$8.53 per share. After already owning 5 per cent of the company, it acquired a 10 per cent stake at A$11.75 per share in October 2012, then another 5 per cent at A$12.20 in December 2012.In 2013, ADM wrote down US$155m related to its GrainCorp investment, according to a securities filing.Nick Markiewicz, analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report on Thursday that grain traders had suggested Australia could enjoy record harvests and upgraded GrainCorp’s earnings-per-share forecast for 2017 by 46 per cent to 71 cents.
50;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Trump victory rattles grain traders ADM and Bunge shares;;"It’s been a bad week for agricultural commodities traders, with shares in Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge down sharply since Donald Trump’s victory.ADM’s shares are down 10 per cent since the start of Wednesday and is trading at $43.29 while Bunge is down almost 6 per cent at $65.515, reports Emiko Terazono in London.JPMorgan analyst Anne Duignan has downgraded ADM to “underweight”. She warns that “the full impact of the Presidential election result is hard to quantify at this point; however, we believe that the risks to US agriculture are now skewed to the downside”Mr Trump’s presidency should raise several concerns around the agriculture sector. They include worries about trade, currency impacts and potential changes in blending rules on biofuel mandates. The farming sector also relies heavily on immigrant labour, which is “a negative for US producers who are already struggling to achieve breakeven” she says.ADM said in a statement earlier this week:At ADM, we have prospered for 115 years under 20 U.S. presidents, and nothing from the U.S. presidential election changes our positive outlook for the food or agriculture industry, or for ADM specifically."
51;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-11-03T13:21:55Z;Booming US grain exports a riposte to protectionism;Agricultural sector grows just as poll rhetoric turns against free trade;If trade has fallen into disrepute this US election season, no one bothered to tell the grain market.Ships laden with millions of tonnes of US-grown wheat, corn and soyabeans have been leaving ports for destinations across the globe. Soyabean exports have been heavy enough to propel economic growth in the third quarter. For US farmers it is a welcome change from year ago, when the effects of a strong dollar and ample supplies elsewhere trapped some crops inside the country. Since the US consistently grows more food than it needs, exports are a crucial outlet. “You have to sell it or smell it,” says Gregg Doud, president of the Commodity Markets Council, a Washington-based industry group whose members include agricultural merchants such as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill. “If we can’t move it out of this country it stays at home and lowers prices.” US export sales of corn are up 97 per cent from the previous crop year, while sales of soyabeans have risen 35 per cent and wheat sales are 26 per cent higher, according data released Thursday by the US Department of Agriculture.The department anticipates that for the full marketing year, which ends before the 2017 harvest, US soyabean exports will be the most ever and corn exports the highest in nine years. Supplying the shipments will be record harvests of corn and soyabeans this autumn and silos packed to the roof. The scale of the export push was reflected in third-quarter results announced this week by ADM and Bunge. The former is the most US-centric of the big grain handlers, with constellations of “elevators” (commercial silo complexes) across states such as Illinois in the heart of the US corn belt and Kansas in the main hard winter wheat region. Quarterly operating profit from its agricultural services division, which trades grain, rose 30 per cent on year to $193m as US exports soared. Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, told analysts his company exported record volumes. He believes “the US will be very full in the pipeline and will be exporting corn and soybeans well into [the first quarter of] next year”. Bunge, by contrast, has a large footprint in Brazil, whose corn crop was curtailed by dry weather earlier this year. In the US Bunge’s silos are concentrated in the Mississippi river delta region, where the crops are smaller and the competition is intense, says Soren Schroder, chief executive. Bunge on Wednesday reported its agribusiness volumes fell in the third quarter, while the division’s operating profit plunged 74 per cent to $83m. “This year is the year where the US really has a clear shot at global exports, because Brazil in reality is out,” Mr Schroder says. Despite their differences, shares of ADM and Bunge have this week jumped by 8.4 per cent and 11.5 per cent, respectively, as both companies issued positive outlooks for the coming months. The exports come at an ugly time for US agriculture. Grain prices are depressed and farm income is the lowest since the global financial crisis. They also come as the idea of free trade faces hostility not seen for years in a US presidential campaign. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Republican and Democratic nominees, oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade deal that would end barriers for US agricultural commodities including beef, pork, soyabeans and cotton, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Mr Trump has proposed punitive tariffs on China and Mexico, respectively the top-ranked foreign destinations for US soyabeans and corn. Iowa, which grows more corn and soyabeans than any other state, is leaning towards electing Mr Trump, according to polling data from Real Clear Politics. The midwestern state has 130,000 farm operators, according to the latest US census of agriculture, but more than 2m registered voters. The Farm Bureau, an agricultural lobby group, backs free trade measures, estimating the TPP would increase net farm incomes by $4.4bn. “It’s a tough time in farm country. So any additional sales people can get are a great thing,” said Will Rodger, a bureau spokesman. “One thing that is certain is that trade for the US agricultural sector has been, without exception, positive. If you look at any sector in United States farming it’s hard to find one that is going to worse under conditions of free trade,” he added.

Investors also sweetened on the international agricultural trader’s shares as it predicted that improving market conditions would extend into next year.ADM shares were up 7 per cent to $46.81 by midday on Tuesday — the highest since October 2015 — after the company said that the headwinds it faced in the first half of the year had largely receded by the third quarter, allowing it to capitalise on improving market conditions and crop shortages in South America that lifted North American exports.The company reported earnings per share of 58 cents on net income of $341m for the third quarter, compared to the 46 cents per share on a $270.6m profit that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected. While revenue clocked in at $15.3bn, shy of the expected $16.28bn, ADM said that it expected that the rising tides it rode during the third quarter would last through the end of the 2016 and into the new year.The North American harvest “is progressing well as we’re seeing record yields and production for both corn and soyabeans,” said chief executive Juan Ricardo Luciano during a conference call with investors. “We expect this to translate into continued solid results for export volumes and better global merchandising and handling opportunities as we finish out the year.”Also helping to lift the company’s quarterly results was strong demand for corn-based sweeteners and starches, executives said.ADM is benefiting from the same crop export wave that lifted overall US economic growth during the past three-month period. Exports grew at an annualised pace of 10 per cent, thanks in part to increased overseas demand as heavy floods destroyed soyabean crops in Argentina.ADM shares have gained 2.5 per cent over the past year.
53;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-10-04T14:12:38Z;Cargill logs sharp earnings rebound;;Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trading company, showed signs it was turning a corner from sluggish performance by reporting a sharp rebound in earnings.Adjusted operating earnings in the first quarter ended August 31 rose 35 per cent to $827m, compared with $611m in the same period a year before. Net profit unadjusted for items such as inventory values and hedging positions increased 66 per cent to $852m, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.The privately held Minnesota company controlled by the Cargill and MacMillan families has a sprawling set of businesses, from beef packing plants to international grain trading. Executives have tried to reshape its portfolio, streamline management and cut costs amid disappointing returns.David MacLennan, Cargill’s chairman and chief executive, said: “We’ve been charting a new path to higher performance, and it’s rewarding to see the many changes we’ve made resulting in gains across much of the company.”Cargill said its animal nutrition and protein segment was the largest contributor to the quarter’s earnings, owing partly to a beef business that was helped by bigger cattle herds and stronger demand for steaks and burgers.Earnings in the origination and processing segment, which houses Cargill’s main grain trading business, “rose moderately,” in part because of improving profit margins from processing soyabeans into meal and oil and the “reversal of mark-to-market losses taken in the preceding quarter,” Cargill said.Analysts covering the food industry watch Cargill’s results for clues to upcoming earnings from listed competitors such as Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge.
54;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-09-29T09:48:14Z;Louis Dreyfus Co ekes out higher profits despite ‘erratic’ commodities;;Louis Dreyfus Company, one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities, has reported a small increase in half year profits as it battled erratic prices moves and unfavourable market conditionsIn the six months to June, the privately-owned company reported a near 4 per cent rise in net income to $135m on sales of $23.5bn. Shipments were up 1 per cent on a year ago driven by a rise in grain exports from South America. Adjusted net debt was $3.6bn, against $3.2bn in December.Profits were flattered by $107m of deferred taxes being recognised in the income statement. Income before tax declined 15 per cent to $151 millionLDC’s chief executive Gonzalo Ramirez said “intense” and “erratic” moves had hit the performance of its main operating units, writes Neil Hume.“The second quarter witnessed irrational volatility moves on certain markets, echoing unexpected strong speculative capital inflows,” he said. “Posting reasonable results during such periods and a context of continued oversupply illustrates our ability to adjust to changing conditions.”Like its peers, which include Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill, — making up the so-called ABCD companies — Dreyfus has been grappling with difficult market conditions. Bumper grains crops and absence of significant supply disruptions had crimped margins from trading commodities and hit prices.LDC’s ‘supply chain’, or procurement and refining arm posted operating profits of $351m, down from $405m in the same period a year ago, knocked by wild swings in oilseed, grains and sugar prices.Soyabean prices surged more than 30 per cent in the second quarter, mainly due to unexpected flooding in Argentina which affected crops and attracted large speculative inflows from financial investors.Sugar prices also jumped by nearly a third in the period, wrong-footing traders and upending hedging strategies.In LDC’s ‘merchandizing’ or trading recorded operating profits of $195m, down from $233m a year before. Weak demand and the release of government stocks in China affected its cotton business.LDC said its fertiliser business, which it has ring-fenced as it searches for an investor, continued to struggle as farmers put off purchases because of weak grain prices. LDC also wants joint venture partners for its dairy, metals and orange juice units to boost their reach and competitiveness.Louis Dreyfus Company is controlled by Russian-born billionaire Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the widow of flamboyant businessman Robert Louis-Dreyfus who died in 2009 after a battle with cancer.Ms Louis-Dreyfus is looking for a strategic investor to buy a stake of about 16 per cent in the holding company that controls Dreyfus. The stake is owned by other members of the Louis-Dreyfus family who have exercised options allowing them to sell. LDC did not comment on the sale process in its interim results announcement.
55;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-08-21T18:02:43Z;Chastened Glencore on track to hit debt target;Interim results give executives chance to highlight progress on deleveraging plans;At Glencore’s interim results on Wednesday, the miner-cum-commodities trader will try to put a bruising year behind it, presenting a slimmed-down, more modest company than the one that misread the market mood one year ago.At its half-year results last August, Glencore’s management was defiant in the face of the worst commodities crash in a generation, with Steven Kalmin, chief financial officer, boasting the company could “walk and chew gum”, in spite of investor concerns that its dividend and large debt load were incompatible.As commodities prices spiralled lower, the brutality of the market’s verdict was matched only by its swiftness, with Glencore’s share price falling more than 50 per cent over the following month.Glencore’s combative chief executive Ivan Glasenberg was forced into a rare climbdown, outlining plans last September to slash the dividend, raise cash from shareholders and sell assets in order to reduce the company’s borrowings.One year on, Mr Glasenberg and Mr Kalmin will be looking to demonstrate that they are following through quickly on their plans to deleverage the company, having moved, eventually, more aggressively than peers.By scrapping $2.4bn of dividend payments, completing a $2.5bn share offering and selling more than $3bn in assets, Glencore is on its way to hitting a net debt target of $17bn-$18bn by the end of this year, down from almost $30bn in the middle of 2015.“No other company in the peer group has reduced indebtedness as quickly or by as great a magnitude, and the scope for further debt reduction remains high,” said Alon Olsha, analyst at Macquarie. “We believe that management’s credibility has been restored.”Glencore’s shares have recovered to 188.6p, up 175 per cent from last year’s low, but remain below their 2011 flotation price of 530p.The company’s earnings for the first half of 2016 are still expected to be lower than those for the same period last year, however, because of the pain felt by its mining unit through the ongoing commodities slump.The consensus analysts’ forecast for Glencore’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — its preferred measure — is $3.9bn for the six months to June 30, down 16 per cent from $4.6bn in the same period one year ago.The prices of most of Glencore’s key mined commodities averaged less in the first half of the year than during the same period in 2015, although many have since rebounded. Copper, which generates about a quarter of the company’s underlying earnings, is flat.Investors will also be looking at the performance of Glencore’s trading unit, which makes money from moving millions tonnes of commodities around the world.Some shareholders are concerned that trading conditions, especially in agricultural markets, have not been strong in the first six months of 2016.Still, certain analysts are starting to ask if Glencore might return to buying assets after this period of scaling back and balance sheet reinforcement.“Does the company remain committed to debt reduction or move back to a more growth-focused approach,” said Liam Fitzpatrick, analyst at Credit Suisse.Glencore has said it is targeting a higher credit rating — it is currently one notch above junk status — and will only resume dividend payments once it has further improved its ratio of net debt to earnings.
56;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Grain markets weigh on Cargill’s operating profit;Agricultural trading house under pressure to reignite growth;Cargill revealed its weakest operating profit in four years amid a slump in grain markets, intensifying pressure to reignite growth at the world’s largest agricultural trading house.The US-based private company earned $1.64bn in the fiscal year ended May 31, down 15 per cent from the year before and the least since 2012, it said on Wednesday. The figures were adjusted for items such as gains on sales of businesses.In the fourth quarter Cargill reported an adjusted operating loss of $19m, reflecting unprofitable soyabean and energy trading and a charge to account for heightened contract risks in weak shipping markets.“We are not happy with our financial performance,” said Marcel Smits, chief financial officer.International grain merchants such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus have endured a tough stretch as a succession of big crops depresses commodity prices and volatility, reducing trading opportunities.Traditional customers of merchants, such as China, have also begun to procure commodities directly from growing regions, adding to competition.Cargill has responded by aggressively shuffling its vast portfolio, selling businesses including steel mills, crop insurance, sauces and Texas cattle feed yards and acquiring ADM’s chocolate business, a salmon feed maker, a candle wax company and a ground beef plant, among others.The company said it invested more than $3bn in acquisitions and new or expanded facilities and made nearly $2.4bn in divestitures in 2016. Mr Smits called it a “peak year” for transactions and said fiscal 2017 was unlikely to bring deals of a similar size.“It’s pretty clear that we either lead and we have a good path to growth and winning in our industry or we’ll reconsider our position,” Mr Smits said.Cargill’s return on equity — a measure of profitability — was 5.8 per cent in the latest fiscal year, also the lowest since 2012. In the past year it also streamlined its management structure, replacing a two-tier system with a single executive team in an effort to speed up decision-making.The company is controlled by the Cargill and MacMillan families, descendants of its founder.“I’d say that shareholders are very encouraged by steps we’re taking to improve the results outlook for the business,” Mr Smits said.He added: “We’re pushing through an enormous amount of change in a time-condensed period in order to position ourselves. We should be doing OK when we’re in a trough and doing great in a peak of the market.”For the full fiscal year, Cargill’s unadjusted net profit rose 50 per cent to $2.38bn, the highest since a record year in 2011. Full-year revenue declined 11 per cent to $107.2bn because of lower commodity prices, a strong dollar and divestitures, Cargill said.John Rogers, credit analyst at Moody’s, called the results “not great” and said prospects for another year of large crops meant continued pressure.“I think they’re still in a transition period, and it will take several years to show a meaningful improvement in margins. The bottom line is there’s so many things that are beyond their control,” Mr Rogers said.
57;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-08-02T17:20:56Z;ADM nears decision on corn ethanol processing unit;;Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural trader, told analysts that the company was closer to making a decision on its corn ethanol processing operations after a strategic review initiated earlier this year.Juan Luciano, chief executive, said “7 parties indicated they were interested” in the company’s dry mills. ADM is expected to reach a decision on its review later this month, writes Emiko Terazono.The company’s biofuels business has been affected by the sharp fall in energy prices. For the second quarter, its bioproducts division reported a loss of $19m compared to operating profits of $43m in the same time last year.His comments came as the company reported a 26 per cent fall in the three months to June and announced that losses linked to Wilmar, the Asian agricultural trader, would be about $50m, or 17 cents a share, in the third quarter.ADM increased its stake in Singapore based Wilmar from 20 to 22 per cent during the quarter.Wilmar issued a profit warning last month, saying it expected net losses of about $239m for the second quarter. With analysts previously forecasting the profit from Wilmar to be $50m, the “swing” would be $100m, said Mr Luciano.“The $100m delta in Q3 is difficult,” he said, telling analysts that he believed it was an “one-off” event.For the second quarter, ADM said “weak grain handling margins and merchandising results” which hit its agricultural services division, as well as lower canola and soya crush margins at its oilseeds unit, had led to lower profits.Nevertheless, Mr Luciano was more optimistic for the second half of the year:After a challenging start to the year, general market conditions began to turn at the end of the second quarter, providing us with improved opportunities for the second half of the year.
58;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-06-06T22:32:27Z;Meat sector’s appetite sparks scramble for soya meal;Signs of tight supply a boon for investors in commodity indices;The market for soya meal is flashing signs of tight supply, helping propel commodities markets higher and boosting profit margins for big agricultural processing companies.The product, which is crushed from soyabeans, is a main ingredient in feed for livestock and chickens. Strong demand from the meat industry has prompted a scramble for supplies.CBOT July soya meal on Monday settled at $411.70 per short ton, down on the day but $23 above the contract for delivery in December, which closed at $388.70. The two contracts had the same price as recently as late April.The steepening premium has been a boon for investors holding commodity indices. This week the Bloomberg Commodity Index, tracked by tens of billions of dollars in investor money, is set to replace the July contract with the December one. The price difference between the two contracts will enable investors to collect a return by selling one high and buying the other relatively low.Such a pattern has been a rarity in futures markets, where persistent oversupply has often made it more economical to store a commodity and sell it for a higher price later.The premium for prompt soyabean meal is “really a function of the tightness in the market”, said Kurt Nelson, partner at SummerHaven Investment Management, which manages an index that currently has more than a fifth of its weighting allocated to soyabeans, soya meal and soya oil.The meal rally comes despite plentiful supplies of soyabeans in the US. Before this autumn’s harvest, the US Department of Agriculture expects surplus stocks will total 400m bushels, more than double levels of last August and the highest since 2007.People are nervous about the summer weather patternHowever, US demand for soya meal is anticipated to rise to 33.8m short tons in the coming year, while exports would climb to 12m tons, the USDA predicts. After a poorer than expected soyabean harvest in rain-soaked Argentina, “people are nervous about the summer weather pattern” for soyabeans grown in the US, said Richard Feltes, vice-president of research at broker RJ O’Brien.US farmers had planted 83 per cent of their soyabean crop as of Sunday.Mr Feltes said index investors rolling out of the expiring July contract could put pressure on the premium, at least temporarily.With the price of soya meal rallying, the “crush spread”, or profit margin from processing soyabeans, has ballooned to more than $1 a bushel. This has buoyed the shares of big Midwestern agricultural processors such as Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, which have risen more than 10 per cent since mid-May.As soya meal has rallied, hedge funds and other money managers have adopted a large bullish position. As of last week they were net buyers of 7.5m short tons, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
59;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-05-25T07:13:36Z;Cargill juggles customer’s GMO food preferences;Changing customer preferences have big impact for world’s largest commodities trader;The world’s biggest agricultural commodities trader is taking steps to “de-commoditise”.That was the term invoked by a Cargill senior executive as he described how shifting food preferences were changing the Minneapolis-based company.The term was jarring because Cargill for a century and a half has been known as a quintessential commodity merchant, handling rivers of grain, oilseeds, sugar and other foodstuffs.But as a growing bloc of consumers demand natural food, which lacks certain traits such as bioengineered genes, or food grown according to certain social or environmental standards, Cargill has tweaked aspects of its bulk supply chain.The company created a GMO-free corn syrup in response to changes at a confectionery customer, its annual report said. Marcel Smits, Cargill’s chief financial officer, explained in New York last week that to do so Cargill dedicated one plant to make it, representing 10 per cent of its volume in the sweetener. He also cited customer demand for yoghurt that was non-GMO, which reaches into the supply of grain used for cow feed.“If people ask for a GMO variant and non-GMO variant, initially we stand back and say, ‘Oh that’s going to be complicated, because we have to keep our grains separate, in separate bins,’” Mr Smits said at the BMO Farm to Market conference. “If we stand back a little further, we say, ‘Oh, that’s actually interesting, because it’s going to de-commoditise our business.’”Cargill is one of the biggest cattle processors in North America, producing almost 8bn pounds of boxed beef and byproducts a year, according to its website. Now the company is able “keep the meat of 20 animals separate all the way through, to the box that it ultimately goes into”.By definition, such fragmented supplies squeeze the economies of scale that come with moving large volumes of commodities. Building a separate grain bin adds costs.However, Mr Smits said more speciality businesses such as the non-GMO corn syrup also reaped higher profit margins.“The fragmentation of our industry is de-commoditising agricultural supply chains. That’s not going to change. It’s really good news for Cargill, by the way,” he said.Of course, Cargill has long had businesses that do not fit the commodities mould. The company makes soya-based polyols and polymers that go into foam cushions, for example, and formulates specialty egg products cooked in fast-food restaurants.And it continues to build its core business of commodities trading, for example investing in a grain port in Ukraine earlier this year.At a time when plentiful supplies have whittled profits in grain trading, it is no wonder Cargill and other big agricultural trading houses are talking about lines that are not commodity businesses.Archer Daniels Midland, for example, in 2014 purchased Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company, for €2.3bn, the largest acquisition in its 112-year history. Bunge, a grain and oilseed trader and foodmaker, said it aims for value-added businesses to make up more than a third of its earnings before interest and tax, up from 15 per cent last year.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
60;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-05-10T18:02:57Z;Russian gang suspected of scam in ICE market;Two arrested and £22m frozen over alleged money laundering;Intercontinental Exchange’s London futures market has been used as a front for Russian organised crime, according to police who have made two arrests for suspected money-laundering.The City of London Police revealed that they had arrested two men — one a Russian broker — over suspected money-laundering as part of a global alleged scam spanning Switzerland, the Caribbean and Russia. The police did not name the broker, but people familiar with the situation said it was Dzimitry Niadzvetski, who worked at a London unit of Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader and producer.Mr Niadzvetski has been released on police bail, without charge. His lawyer declined to comment.A Russian oil firm, and Swiss and British Virgin Islands-headquartered investment firms are suspected of being used as a front for a Russian gang to launder gains, City police said, adding that they had frozen $22m so far as a result of its probe.ICE, which routinely monitors for suspicious trading, presented its concerns to the police and collaborated closely with the probe.“Our investigation points towards a suspected Russian organised crime group using London’s futures market to launder millions of dollars worth of criminal revenue,” said Detective Inspector Craig Mullish.The revelation is a further blow to the City days before the prime minister, David Cameron, is due to host a global anti-corruption summit. The government wants to clamp down on offshore finance and tax havens following a global furore sparked by the release of the Panama Papers.Mr Cameron has been criticised by campaigning groups for not doing enough to clean up his own back yard.ADM Investor Services, the futures brokerage arm of ADM, said: “We can confirm an employee was suspended following an investigation by the City of London Police. [ . . .] There is no tolerance for improper behaviour and we will take action if it transpires he has broken the terms of his employment.”Our investigation points towards a suspected Russian organised crime group using London’s futures market to launder millions of dollars worth of criminal revenueAs part of its probe around ICE Futures Europe, the financial district’s police force arrested the 43-year-old Russian broker just before Easter. He was interviewed again this month, according to people familiar with the situation. A British trader has also been interviewed under caution, which is when suspects are read their rights.Authorities were initially tipped off about the alleged extensive network via suspicious trading in crude oil futures on a London market operated by ICE, according to people familiar with the situation. ICE said: “We notified the authorities immediately upon detecting suspicious trading activity.”The FCA has also been informed.The Russian broker’s trading accounts valued at $22m were frozen by a clearing firm for being suspected proceeds of crime, the police said.Companies and traders use ICE Futures Europe’s exchange to speculate and hedge their exposure to fluctuating crude oil prices. The venue is one of the world’s most liquid markets for energy futures trading, with big users like electricity and power providers, banks and high-frequency traders making up the majority of the exchange’s members.Additional reporting by Neil Hume and Philip Stafford in London
61;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-05-03T19:10:43Z;Food traders stuck in the hard times;ADM, Bunge and Cargill have been hit by bumper harvests and the slowdown in emerging markets;A recent bout of poor weather has damaged South America’s corn and soyabean crops, and this has provided a rare reason for optimism at some of the world’s largest traders of food.These companies own silos and ports stretching from New Orleans to Odessa on the Black Sea, enabling them to tap supplies in one region when another falls short.But the crop problems in Brazil and Argentina are hardly grounds for a full-scale revival in the agricultural trading business.The dominant players — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus Company and Glencore — are struggling with thin profit margins after bumper harvests since 2013 resulted in large stocks of grain and oil seeds, thereby reducing the need for trade.“It doesn’t mean that things have returned to easy times with big margins,” said Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, referring to the crops issues in South America. “It just means that there’s movement. That is typically a positive thing for companies like us.”The agricultural traders have also been caught out by the economic slowdown across emerging markets, particularly in China. The companies invested heavily in ports and mills, but some of these assets are now only half full.“It’s not an easy environment to be an ag trader,” said GJ van den Akker, head of Cargill’s agricultural supply chain businesses, last month.The latest agricultural trader to reveal the financial consequences of these difficult conditions was ADM. On Tuesday, it reported a first-quarter net profit of $230m, down 53 per cent compared to the same period last year, with the company citing weaker US export volumes and a loss at its agricultural trading desk.Traders often say they pay little attention to whether prices for certain cereals are high or low, instead exploiting the differences between where or when grain is bought and sold. But the commodities rout has encouraged farmers to hoard harvests until they are offered better prices.Too much infrastructure also plagues some parts of the industry.For example, Bunge and Itochu of Japan in 2012 bet on Asian demand when they opened the first new US grain export terminal in 25 years in Washington state. But last year exports of wheat, corn, soyabeans and soya meal fell 29 per cent from the port that houses this terminal, as the strong dollar combined with disappointing demand to crimp shipments of grain from the US.“Historically, these companies thought of themselves in a growth industry. It was ‘Build it and they will come’,” said Farha Aslam, analyst at Stephens.Net profit for many agricultural traders peaked around 2010 and 2011, after Russia banned cereals exports in response to a heatwave and set off wild moves in grain prices. Cargill earned more than $3bn in adjusted operating profit in its 2011 financial year, 38 per cent higher than in 2015.In the past year, Cargill has streamlined management and reshaped its varied portfolio, exiting lines including steelmaking, hedge funds and US pork production, and acquiring businesses where it sees stronger demand, such as salmon feed. On Tuesday, Cargill announced the sale of its dressings, sauces and mayonnaise business.In response to what it called the “bearish environment”, Louis Dreyfus cut capital spending by 30 per cent to $420m in 2015.Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena, chief executive, said last month that he did not foresee big changes in the market. “This year will be another year of ample supplies,” he added.Industry bulls stress agricultural traders’ good long-term prospects. They say food demand is inexorably rising, increasing the world’s reliance on shipments of grain, and therefore traders with hard-to-replace assets will eventually benefit.That view helped Glencore sell a 40 per cent stake in its agriculture business for $2.5bn last month to Canada’s biggest pension fund.A less bullish view suggests that agricultural traders enjoyed a boom in the previous decade because of factors that are unlikely to be repeated, such as governments’ biofuels policies that sharply increased corn demand and China’s rise as an economic power.The advent of ship tracking software, satellite data on crop conditions and other services has also eroded the value of traders’ inside knowledge of commodity flows. “Technology in the last 20 years has made information asymmetry a much less common thing,” said Richard Payne of Accenture Consulting, who is a former Cargill executive.Like farmers, many executives in the agricultural trading business are watching the weather.The South American crop problems have unleashed dramatic swings in corn and soyabean markets, giving traders opportunities for profit. With a nod to this, Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, told analysts on Tuesday: “We are cautiously optimistic.”
62;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-05-03T12:20:48Z;Archer Daniels Midland hurt by weak grain export;;The agricultural merchant Archer Daniels Midland earned its weakest quarterly profit in almost three years after processing less corn and oilseeds and suffering a loss at its new global trade desk.The company forms the A in the so-called ‘ABCD’ of food commodities traders that handle a large share of global grain exports. The others are Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, reports Gregory Meyer in New York.New York-listed ADM reported net profit of $230m, or $0.39 per share, in the first quarter, down from $493m, or $0.77 per share, in the same quarter a year before. Adjusted per-share earnings of $0.42 undershot analyst expectations by three cents.ADM’s earnings release reinforced the downbeat mood across the sector as traders confront few opportunity amid a worldwide surplus of grain. The strength of the dollar has added pressure on ADM’s largely US footprint of silos, ports and processing plants, as it shifted exports to other countries.Juan Luciano, chief executive, said in a statement: “Low US export volumes and weak margins continued, and in the quarter, poor results from the global trade desk impacted results for Ag Services” – the main division responsible for buying, selling, storing and shipping corn, wheat and oilseeds.ADM’s global trade desk in Rolle, Switzerland, established after the company bought a remaining minority interest in the merchant Toepfer, reported losses in the quarter due to what ADM called “unfavourable merchandising positions”.ADM’s bioproducts division lost $12m, due to tough conditions in the market for lysine, an animal feed additive. Profit margins in its vast ethanol biofuel business were under pressure by “high industry production levels,” ADM said.
63;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-04-28T11:24:02Z;Bunge eyes ‘dislocations’ in world grain markets;;Deteriorating weather in South America has reintroduced the prospect of “dislocations” in global grain markets, the head of food commodities trader Bunge has said.New York-listed Bunge is a leading merchant in world markets for oilseeds, wheat and corn, with ports, silos and processing plants on several continents. It and and peers such as Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Glencore tend to benefit when crops fall short in one place, enabling them to supply grain from another, cheaper locale, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.Granaries have been overflowing around the world, but recent bouts of dry weather in Brazil and wetness in Argentina have jolted sleepy agricultural markets with the prospect of smaller crops.Soren Schroder, chief executive, said the possibility of “dislocations” had increased. He said in a statement.Smaller harvests in South America, due to recent adverse weather, are introducing new market dynamics. These will generate headwinds in the second quarter, but also create the potential for us to leverage our winning global footprint more broadly over the course of the year.His comments came as Bunge reported strong grain exports from South America in the first quarter, shoring up a slight decline in net profit that still beat Wall Street forecasts handily.Bunge earned $222m in its first* quarter, or $1.54 per share, down from $249m, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $0.79 per share. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.60, compared to $1.58 in first quarter a year ago.The largest drop in operating profit came in Bunge’s oilseeds division, as profit margins from crushing soyabeans, rapeseed and other sources of vegetable oil remained weak in a business plagued with too much capacity.However, the Bunge grains division’s operating profit jumped from $88m to $144m in the quarter, helped by greater exports out of South America.The weakening of Brazil’s real and Argentina’s peso – the latter after the country’s new president removed fixed currency exchange rates – have been a boon to farmers in both countries, while restricting grain exports from the US.Note: Piece was amended to reflect profits were for the first quarter.
64;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Bumper crops, low volatility, hit agri trader Louis Dreyfus;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, has announced a sharp drop in annual profits because of weak prices and abundant crops.Net income fell 67 per cent to $211m in the year to December, the company, which is controlled by billionaire Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, said on Monday.Sales declined $55.7bn from $64.7bn because of lower prices, although volumes increased 1 per cent to 81m tonnes, writes Neil Hume.“Plentiful crops for the second consecutive year, combined with the absence of significant logistic and geographical disruptions, resulted in a low volatility environment for most commodities,” said Dreyfus in a statement.Louis Dreyfus Commodities, or Louis Dreyfus Company as it will now be called, is one of a small group of companies that dominate the trading of agricultural commodities. The 164-year old company says it accounts for 10 per cent of global trade flows.Like its peers, which include Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill, Dreyfus has been hit by saturated global markets which have impacted prices. Lower volatility has also crimped margins from trading activities.“2015 was a difficult year for the entire industry, marked by geopolitical issues that contributed to an environment of reduced commercial opportunities. However, our results have shown our resilience under the circumstance, “ said Dreyfus chief executive Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena.Mr Martiarena, who was appointed CEO in October, has moved to streamline the company’s management structure and had replaced several divisional heads.The Rotterdam-based group is also seeking joint venture partners for a handful of businesses. These include its metals, dairy, fertiliser and orange juice units. Dreyfus is one of the world’s largest juice processors, owning several factories, as well as orange groves.It rivals are also selling assets in a bit to cut debts and reduce costs. Noble Group recently sold its remaining stake in its agricultural unit to Cofco, China’s state-owned grains traders. Glencore is seeking a strategic investor to buy a stake of around 40 per cent in its agricultural division.Dreyfus is controlled by Ms Louis-Dreyfus, the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus.The 53-year old is planning to take a short leave of absence next month while she gives birth to twin girls.The Russian-born billionaire is currently trying to find a strategic investor to buy a stake of around 16 per cent in the holding company that controls Dreyfus. The stake is owned by other members of the Louis-Dreyfus family who have exercised options allowing them to sell.
65;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-03-03T11:31:48Z;Glencore’s agribusiness disposal is not just about debt;Sale of stake could see group joining forces with investor that would give it firepower to bulk up;Why is miner and commodity trader Glencore trying to sell a large stake in its agricultural business? The obvious answer is to pay down debts, which at the end of last year stood at nearly $26bn. But there are other factors at play.Through its $6bn acquisition of Canadian grain handler Viterra in 2012, Glencore has emerged as a major player in agriculture, handling 44m tonnes of grain last year. But to be considered a truly global player it needs to bulk up in South America and the US — two of the world’s most important food markets.This is where a partner comes in. Joining forces with a strategic investor, most likely a group of sovereign wealth funds, would give Glencore the firepower to make acquisitions in the Americas. Glencore is targeting a sale of between 30-49 per cent, which JPMorgan says could raise up to $3.9bn.“To grow in that business, you’re going to need more financial muscle,” Glencore’s chief executive Ivan Glasenberg told analysts after the company reported annual results earlier this week.“It’s clear it’s time to bring in a partner, like we did when I first expanded the coal business in Colombia,” he said, referring to the deal he struck with rival mining companies to jointly acquire Cerrejón, a major field in the South American country.So what could Glencore look to purchase?The industry’s four biggest players — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities — are probably beyond its reach for a number of reasons. Some are too big, others are wedded to remaining private. That leaves mid-tier companies.Previous reports have linked Glencore with a bid for The Andersons, an $800m Nasdaq-listed company based in Ohio. Scoular Co and Lansing Trade Group, both privately-held companies, have also been mentioned as possible targets.But the strong US dollar has made exports from the US increasingly uncompetitive. Relatively high prices over the past decade have also led to increased production, leaving the US market oversupplied.So for now, Glencore might look to South America and Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter of soyabeans. Indeed, Glencore’s most recent deal in agriculture was the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in an export terminal in Brazil from ADM.“It’s quite clear that there is going to be a period of some industry consolidation coming up there and you don’t want to miss out on that,” said Glencore’s chief financial officer Steven Kalmin after the results.But before Glencore can buy anything it needs to complete the sale of a significant minority stake for an acceptable price. Some analysts say this could be a challenge because it is a buyer’s market at the moment. After a bumper year in 2014, adjusted earnings from Glencore’s agriculture division fell 48 per cent to $542m last year.But Mr Glasenberg does not appear to be worried.“We have strong interest in the ag business,” he told analysts on Tuesday. “We’re dealing with various companies and I feel very confident we will have that sale concluded definitely before the first half of this year.”The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
66;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-02-26T17:16:55Z;Gavilon, grain merchant, replaces CEO;;Gavilon, one of the largest US grain handlers, has just named its second new chief executive in less than two years.On Friday the company, a unit of Japan’s Marubeni, said Lewis Batchelder would take over as CEO on March 1, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.The announcement comes as a strong dollar and plentiful global grain stocks have hit the business of trading houses with a large footprint in the US, such as Gavilon, as they crimp volumes in a high-volume, low-margin business.A Gavilon spokesman declined to disclose the company’s financial results or the reason for the executive switch, but said: “We are not facing any unique challenges that nobody else is.”Mr Batchelder has more than 40 years’ experience in the grain industry and previously served as a senior executive at Archer Daniels Midland, a rival US agribusiness. He also was chairman of Alfred C Toepfer International, a Germany-based unit of of ADM.He replaces Jim Anderson, who became chief executive in October 2014. John Neppl, Gavilon’s chief operating officer, and Greg Konsor, vice president of North American grain, have also left the company, Gavilon said.Marubeni bought Gavilon for $2.7bn, excluding debt, in 2013 from a group of investors led by Ospraie Management of New York.Last year Marubeni flagged roughly Y50bn in goodwill impairment charges on its investment in Gavilon.
67;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-02-08T11:33:39Z;ADM considers calling time on ethanol mills as oil fall bites;Biofuel industry struggles to cope with reality shift of fierce competition and plunging fuel costs;Exactly 10 years ago, Archer Daniels Midland announced the first of two new corn mills that would cement the agribusiness company’s status as America’s top ethanol producer.“Ethanol and other biofuels are an increasingly important part of the world’s energy supply, especially as the world’s energy needs continue to grow,” Edward Harjehausen, ADM senior vice-president of corn milling and bioproducts, said in a statement in 2006. However, less than six years after ribbons were cut, the two mills in Nebraska and Iowa and an older one in Illinois will be reviewed for “strategic options,” the company disclosed last week— a study that could lead to a sale.It is a far cry from 2006: crude oil prices had cleared $60 a barrel, travellers were burning record amounts of petrol and Washington had just passed a mandate requiring biofuel use. ADM spent $1.3bn on new mills to lift its ethanol production capacity to 1.7bn gallons per year.But now the value of those investments is in doubt. Low oil prices and shifting politics are forcing a reckoning for the US biofuel industry, the world’s largest by production volumes. ADM, a potent ethanol advocate since opening its first plant in 1978, will be a test case. “Going back the last three decades, ADM has probably been the biggest proponent of ethanol along with being the biggest producer,” said David Nelson, a consultant who covered ADM for years as an equities analyst. “The fact that they might be scaling back suggests the reality for this industry has changed.” ADM built the two mills in a big bet on the federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandate, which required fuel companies to blend ever more ethanol into the US petrol supply. When grain supplies tightened and crop prices surged, then-chief executive Patricia Woertz stood behind the policy. “Retreat from biofuels is wrong. It’s foolish. It’s dangerous. It’s a mistake,” she told an analyst in April 2008. But ADM was not the only company building. US ethanol production capacity has now expanded to 15.5bn gallons per year from 214 refineries, according to the Renewable Fuels Association. Profit margins shrank as competition intensified. And, under pressure from the oil industry, Washington tempered the mandate to 14.5bn gallons of corn-based ethanol this year, 500m gallons less than volumes originally envisioned by Congress. Bruce Babcock, an economist at Iowa State university, said: “The future of ethanol in the United States really depends on continued support from the RFS.” Corn farmers and biofuels refiners are a powerful alliance, but the amended mandate and trends in presidential politics suggest their clout is losing its impact. In Iowa, a corn belt state, Texas senator Ted Cruz last week won the Republican presidential caucus despite opposing government support for ethanol. Ethanol is also good for boosting octane and reducing tailpipe emissions, qualities that spur some sales irrespective of the mandate. However, the plunge in crude oil prices has made ethanol less appealing for this market. A gallon of wholesale ethanol now costs about 30 cents more than petrol even though it provides less energy. Ms Woertz stepped down as chief executive in December 2014 and retired as chairman at the end of last year. Juan Luciano, her successor, outlined his plans on an earnings call last week after operating profit from ADM’s bioproducts division, which includes ethanol, dropped 79 per cent in 2015 to $149m. The three mills under review comprise 800m gallons of ADM’s annual ethanol capacity. The plants in Columbus, Nebraska, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, opened in 2010, while the third in Peoria, Illinois, was acquired in 1980. The plants are “dry mills”, relatively simple factories that grind corn kernels and send the starch to a refinery for distillation into ethanol. ADM’s “wet mills”, which can make a broader menu of products including ethanol and high-fructose corn syrup, are not part of the study. Mr Luciano told analysts he was “concerned about the long-term fundamentals of the dry mill ethanol part of the industry”. ADM is not the only company to struggle with ethanol. Valero, mainly an oil refiner, said that adjusted operating profit from its 11 ethanol plants had fallen 75 per cent in 2015 to $192m. Paul Massoud, an analyst at Stifel, said that a sale of the mills may eventually be on the table, but he doubted that ADM would part with them now given the state of the industry. “I am pretty certain they have no interest in selling the plants at $30 oil,” he said.
68;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-02-02T18:25:32Z;Weak grain exports and low oil price weigh on ADM;Shares fall as strong dollar adds to Chicago-based trader’s woes;The strong dollar is creating a grain mountain in the US as global buyers shun the corn, wheat and soyabeans grown by American farmers.The currency impact on US agriculture was evident on Tuesday when Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s biggest traders of grain and oilseeds, reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 in the fourth quarter of 2015, down 39 per cent from $1 in the same period last year.Shares in ADM fell 8 per cent to $32.65 as the Chicago-based company revealed weak US grain exports, the effects of low oil prices on its corn ethanol business and the impact of a global surplus of soyabean meal, an ingredient in livestock feed.The group’s agricultural services division, which buys, sells and transports grain, reported a 49 per cent drop in operating profit in the quarter to $214m compared with $421m a year earlier.“There were a number of factors that impacted our results, including a lack of global dislocations and a strong US dollar versus the weakening currencies of other major crop growing areas. This reduced both volumes and margins,” said Juan Luciano, chairman and chief executive of ADM.The US dollar has gained against the currencies of big grain exporters such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Russia and Ukraine. In December, it also strengthened sharply against the Argentine peso after the election of president Mauricio Macri, raising expectations of a new stream of soyabeans in the world market.Exports of corn and soyabeans from the US are predicted to decline between 8 and 9 per cent this year, according to the US Department of Agriculture, while wheat exports are forecast to be the lowest in 45 years.ADM’s network of silos, ports, barges and processing plants is more concentrated in the US than many of its rivals.The value of the US currency is reaching into the heartland. After recently speaking to audiences of farmers and financial executives in Nebraska, Ernest Goss, an economics professor at Creighton University, said: “The message is the same: the value of the dollar of killing them.”ADM last year had a return on invested capital of 7.3 per cent, 70 basis points above its annual cost of capital, but below Mr Luciano’s goal of 200 basis points.The group’s annual net income fell 18 per cent to $1.849bn in 2015.On Tuesday, ADM also announced a further push into natural foods by agreeing to buy a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, which makes expeller-pressed soyabean oil and meal.“More and more consumers are looking for foods that are gluten-free, that aren’t genetically modified, and that are healthy and organic, and ADM is perfectly positioned to meet those needs,” said Vince Macciocchi, president of its WILD flavours and speciality ingredients division.At the Commodity Markets Council’s annual conference in Florida, attended by executives from ADM and other big commodities companies, the effect of the dollar weighed on the mood.Joseph Glauber, a senior fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and former USDA chief economist, showed a chart indicating that soyabean prices in Brazilian reais were far healthier than the dollar price of less than $9 per bushel.“Currently, with where the price is, US producers are getting one message, but in Brazil it still looks like a pretty good price for beans,” Mr Glauber said.
69;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Fall in Cargill profit strips out sale gains;World’s biggest agricultural trader and processor hit by declines across business units;Cargill suffered a decline in operating profit across all of its main reporting divisions as results flagged in businesses ranging from sugar to red meat.The world’s biggest agricultural trader and processor said on Thursday that adjusted operating profit in the second quarter ended November 30 was $574m, down 13 per cent from $657m in the same period a year ago.The result stripped out gains from the sale of Cargill’s US pork business and its interest in North Star BlueScope Steel, a steelmaking joint venture. Unadjusted net profit was $1.39bn, up 77 per cent from $784m in the second quarter a year before.Cargill has a sprawling portfolio of businesses, from a chicken operation in Thailand to a salt mine in New York state where 17 workers were rescued early on Thursday after getting stuck in a lift 900 feet below ground. Its results reflected the variation across these businesses and the countries in which they operate.David MacLennan, chairman and chief executive, pointed to improvements in certain departments. “We saw performance gains in key global businesses, including animal nutrition, grain and oilseed processing, most of our poultry operations, and several food ingredients categories,” he said.Cargill has been reshuffling its portfolio. In addition to the pork and steel sales, it sold a US crop insurance agency and has largely exited its hedge fund business. The company said it realised losses when it liquidated investments in hedge funds overseen by Black River Asset Management, which is in the process of spinning out into three independent companies.Privately owned Cargill purchased the global chocolate business of Archer Daniels Midland, a rival, for $440m, and EWOS of Norway, a salmon feed maker, for €1.35bn including debt.The company also shook up its management structure in November, replacing a two-tier system with a single executive team.Earlier this week the company appointed Gert-Jan (GJ) van den Akker president of Cargill’s legal entity in Switzerland. He will be in charge of the group’s global agricultural supply chain businesses from a base in Geneva. Mr van den Akker rejoined Cargill from Louis Dreyfus Commodities in December.Quarterly revenues declined 10 per cent to $27.3bn, stemming from lower commodity prices and weaker demand in some markets, the company said.The Minnesota-based business is a large supplier to emerging markets, and noted that “some of the staple foods units were hurt by weakening currencies and recessionary conditions in the emerging economies they serve”.Cargill said it stopped consolidating Venezuelan operations with its financial statements because it was unable to convert Venezuelan bolívars to dollars or pay US dollar dividends and was finding it increasingly difficult “to exercise operational decision-making authority”. Cargill still operates in Venezuela, selling feeds and foods such as flour, pasta and oils.

Cargill still operates in Venezuela, selling feeds and foods such as flour, pasta and oils.
71;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2016-01-05T15:03:01Z;Former Cofco boss named chairman of Sinochem;Ning Gaoning oversaw acquisitions of Dutch trading company Nidera and Noble Agri;The man who turned China’s state-owned grain trader Cofco into an integrated agribusiness and led its overseas acquisition spree has been appointed chairman of Sinochem, the Chinese government announced on Tuesday.Ning Gaoning, who uses the name Frank and enjoys speaking English, oversaw the acquisition of Dutch trading company Nidera and most recently the agricultural arm of struggling Hong Kong-based energy and commodities trader Noble Group.The deals, which gave Cofco a footprint in Southeast Asia and Latin America, were designed to put the company on a par with those that dominate the world grain trade. These include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.In December Mr Ning celebrated his 11th year as head of China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Co, or Cofco. During that time he transformed the company from a grains importer and exporter into an integrated food and dairy business, that now makes wine and fruit juice and dominates China’s soyabean crushing industry.Cofco’s international expansion was part of wider strategy to build national champions that can compete with western multinationals as well as helping secure more grain directly, reducing China’s reliance on international traders that ship commodities to its ports.At an FT conference in Switzerland last year Mr Ning laid out plans to turn the company into a publicly listed global powerhouse. “It’s not going to be a company that only supplies China,” he said.But the expansion has not been without its problems. Nidera suffered a significant loss in its biofuels business because of unauthorised activities by a rogue trader in Rotterdam, where the company is based. Plans to integrate the business have subsequently been put on hold.Some analysts believe Cofco overpaid for lossmaking Noble Agri. The initial 51 per cent stake cost the company $1.5bn in 2014 but under the terms of a deal announced in December, Cofco will pay just $750m for the remaining 49 per cent.Mr Ning will also face challenges at Sinochem, China’s state-owned fertiliser producer that is one of the country’s largest iron ore importers. “His new post at Sinochem showcases the central government’s determination to promote China’s agricultural industry,” said Ma Wenfeng, agricultural analyst at Beijing Orient Agriculture Consultancy.He added: “To improve China’s agricultural production level, it will need to promote the integration of the production of seeds, fertilisers, chemicals and machines.”Mr Ma said Mr Ning is expected to oversee aggressive international and domestic mergers and acquisitions at Sinochem as he did at Cofco.Mr Ning’s career has involved unusually long tenures at the heads of state-owned corporations. China’s ruling Communist Party prefers to regularly shuffle executives to prevent them from building personal fiefdoms.Before Cofco he spent 17 years in top positions at China Resources, a resources conglomerate that like Cofco and Sinochem is a state-owned company with one foot in the international trading world.Mr Ning will be replaced by Zhao Shuanglian, who heads China Grain Reserves Corp. The grains firm has accumulated several years of stocks which it is having problems selling.Additional reporting by Luna Lin
72;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Louis Dreyfus Commodities chair expects twins in April;Margarita Louis-Dreyfus plans to take two weeks’ maternity leave before returning to work;The billionaire who chairs and controls Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s biggest traders of grains and food, is due to give birth to twin girls and plans to take a short leave of absence.Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, 53, who last year strengthened her control over the family-owned company, intends to take two weeks maternity leave in April before returning to work, the company said in a statement.The announcement of the pregnancy comes after Russian-born Mrs Louis-Dreyfus, started a search for an investor to buy out other family shareholders in Louis Dreyfus Commodities. She inherited a majority stake in the company following the death of Robert Louis-Dreyfus, her husband, in 2009, and became non-executive chair last year.Media reports in Switzerland and France, where Mrs Louis-Dreyfus has a high-profile due to her ownership of Olympique de Marseille, the football club, said the father of the twins is Philipp Hildebrand, the former head of the Swiss National Bank.A spokesperson for BlackRock, the asset manager where Mr Hildebrand now works, declined to comment, but two people with knowledge of the situation said the reports were correct.He resigned as chairman of the SNB in 2012 after details of email exchanges suggested he had played a role in controversial currency trades carried out by his then wife. He denied any wrongdoing and was later cleared by a series of audits including one by accountancy firm KPMG.Louis Dreyfus Commodities, which was founded in France but is now registered in Amsterdam and does much of its trading in Geneva, is one of a small group of companies that dominate global flows of agricultural commodities.Dreyfus said the company’s senior management, including Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena, the chief executive, would ensure business as usual during Mrs Louis-Dreyfus’s “short, well-deserved absence from her duties”.She married flamboyant businessman Robert Louis-Dreyfus in 1992, who at the time of his death was chief executive of Louis Dreyfus Commodities.One of his last wishes was to preserve the privately held company for his descendants.Mrs Louis Dreyfus had three children with her late husband, all boys, including twins. She blocked plans by senior executives at Louis Dreyfus Commodities to take the company public shortly after his death.80%stake held in a holding company that controls Louis Dreyfus CommoditiesLast year, her family trust raised its stake in a holding company that controls Louis Dreyfus Commodities to 80 per cent, and Mrs Louis-Dreyfus was appointed non-executive chair.The Dreyfus family members that own the remaining 20 per cent of Louis Dreyfus Commodities want to exit, and Mrs Louis-Dreyfus has been working with banks on ways to finance the purchase of most of these shares, in a deal that would be worth about $1bn.One plan under discussion involves bringing in a strategic investor to buy the stake, which could mean a sale of shares to a sovereign wealth fund.Louis Dreyfus Commodities is not the only commodity trader trying to find a strategic investor or sell assets. Several other companies, including Glencore, are also looking to pull off deals as commodity prices have slumped to levels last seen during the financial crisis.This article has been amended since publication to show that Mr Hildebrand was cleared of any wrongdoing in connection to currency trades during his time at the SNB.

Last year, Dutch registered Dreyfus shipped more than 80m tonnes of produce.Mrs Louis-Dreyfus inherited control of the 164-year-old business when her husband Robert died in 2009 and has been quietly strengthening her control over the company. She replaced Serge Schoen as chairperson of the company last year after raising her stake in the holding company that controls Dreyfus to 80 per cent from 65 per cent.That followed the purchase of shares from other members of the Dreyfus family. They have now asked the Russian-born billionaire to buy out the majority of their remaining 20 per cent stake.Mrs Louis-Dreyfus has been working with banks on ways to finance the purchase of the 16 per cent stake, which is worth around $1bn. One plan under discussion involves bringing in a strategic investor to buy the stake — which could mean a sale of shares to a sovereign wealth fund.Dreyfus is not the only commodity trader trying to find a strategic investor or sell assets. Several other companies are also looking to pull off deals as commodity prices have slumped to levels last seen during the financial crisis.Most notable of these is Glencore, the Swiss-based trader-cum-miner. It is seeking to sell a minority stake of up to 30 per cent in its agricultural trading unit and has already received some expressions of interest
74;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-12-23T22:09:05Z;Noble Group shares rise on Agri stake sale to China’s Cofco;Deal with Cofco raises $750m but draws cool response from Standard & Poor’s;Shares in Noble Group rose 4.5 per cent after the commodity trading company sold the remaining stake in an agricultural business for $750m — but the deal drew a cool response from a leading rating agency.According to the Hong-Kong based company, selling its 49 per cent stake in Noble Agri to Cofco, China’s state-backed grain business, would place its “financial metrics . . . [in] excess of those required for an investment grade credit”.However, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s took a different view. While the disposal will reduce debt and eliminate about $670m of liabilities, S&P said Noble’s liquidity headroom— the difference between its cash resources and the debt it must refinance over the next year — was still weak for a company with an investment grade credit rating.“Furthermore, we believe the sale of Noble Agri has changed Noble’s business composition and somewhat reduced its business diversity, competitive position, and relationship with Cofco,” the agency said.S&P and another rating agency, Moody’s, have told Noble to raise at least $500m cash by the time of its annual results in February, or face a downgrade to junk status — a move that could dent the profitability of its core commodity trading business.”We will evaluate the full impact of the Noble Agri sale and any other transactions completed by the company,” S&P added. “Our review will also focus on the competitive position of Noble after the sale of its agriculture segment”.Hong-Kong based Noble is one of the biggest commodity traders in Asia, moving millions of tonnes of coal, iron ore, oil and other commodities around the world.It shares have fallen almost 60 per cent this year, reducing its market value to $2.1bn, after a group called Iceberg Research published reports that questioned Noble’s accounting practices and the way it booked profits on deals long before receiving cash from them.Noble has defended itself against the accusations and had PwC review how it accounted for these deals. PwC concluded that the deals fell within international standards.The Singapore-listed company plans to use the entire proceeds from the sale to pay down adjusted net debt, which stood at $2.5bn when it reported third-quarter results at the end of September. It shares closed up 4.5 per cent to S$0.46 on Wednesday.“The stake sale, once completed, will allow Noble to improve its balance sheet structure immediately,” commented Fitch, another rating agency. Proceeds from the sale could rise a further $200m, depending on future growth of Noble Agri.But Noble will be forced to record a $546m loss on the disposal because the stake was valued on its balance sheet at $1.34bn. This will “materially” affect its profits for the year to December, the company said.Cofco paid $1.5bn for its 51 per cent stake in Noble Agri last year. It subsequently placed the holding into a new company with China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth fund.Its aim was to create an international agricultural business with the muscle and reach to compete with the agricultural “ABCDs” — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.
75;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-12-23T02:07:34Z;Noble raises $750m from sale of agribusiness stake;Commodity trader needs cash to avoid losing investment grade credit rating;Noble Group, the commodity trader fighting allegations of aggressive accounting, has raised $750m from the sale of its stake in an agricultural joint venture with Cofco, China’s state-backed grain trader.Shares in the company, which is listed in Singapore, rose as much as 5.7 per cent on Wednesday morning following the news.The Hong Kong-based company has been scrambling to raise cash to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating, which is crucial to the profitability of its core business of moving millions of tonnes of raw materials around the world.Noble had been given until early next year by rating agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s to raise at least $500m in cash or face being cut to junk status.“After completion of this transaction, Noble Group’s financial metrics will be well in excess of those required for an investment grade credit,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.However, the company will be forced to book a $546m loss on the sale of its stake in Noble Agri, which was valued on its balance sheet at $1.34bn. This will “materially” affect its profits for the year to December, the company said.Noble Agri employs about 12,000 people in 25 countries, and includes operations ranging from oilseed crushing plants in China to sugar mills in Brazil. In May it hired Matthew Jansen of Archer Daniels Midland as its chief executive.The business has been a drag on Noble Group’s earnings this year, which have fallen in spite of a strong performance in its North American oil business.It operated at a loss in the nine months to September, hit by weak sugar prices and rain which affected the harvest in Brazil.Proceeds from the sale could rise a further $200m if Noble Agri is sold or listed on a stock market by Cofco. Noble will also be released from guarantees over a $2.55bn borrowing facility.Cofco paid $1.5bn for its 51 per cent stake in Noble Agri last year. It subsequently placed the holding, along with its stake in Dutch grains trader Nidera, into a new company with China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth fund.This was part of a plan to create an integrated international agricultural trader with the muscle and reach to compete with the agricultural “ABCDs” — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.At an FT conference in Switzerland earlier this year, Ning Gaoning, Cofco’s chairman, laid out plans to turn the company into a publicly listed global powerhouse.He said he wanted Cofco to be an international company, adding that he planned to expand in North America, a big surplus grain producer.“I have said since we acquired our initial stake in Noble Agri that we have every confidence in its vision and its new leadership,” Mr Ning said.“In terms of our expectations in the critical global agribusiness sector, I trust our decision to acquire 100 per cent speaks for itself.”For Noble the sale brings to a close a difficult year in which its share price has fallen 61 per cent, reducing its market value to $2.1bn, because of questions over its accounting practices and its inability to generate cash consistently.A group called Iceberg Research — which Noble claims is the work of a disgruntled former employee — alleged that the company inflated asset values and booked profits on deals long before receiving any cash from them.Noble has defended itself against the accusations and had PwC review how it accounted for its long-term commodity deals. The auditor concluded the deals fell within international standards.“We are delighted to have been able to enhance our liquidity significantly while also delivering on our commitments,” said Noble’s chief executive Yusuf Alireza.
76;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-12-16T12:51:20Z;Agricultural commodities traders catch the natural foods bug;Shifting crop flows in US grain belt testify to change on store shelves;At Zeeland Farm Services, a grain processor on Michigan’s western flank, farm trucks arrive with an increasingly familiar load: soyabeans free of bioengineering.Much of the meal ground from the beans is fed to chickens, turkeys, pigs and cows whose eggs, meat and milk are sold at grocers including Whole Foods Market, which is pushing producers to label whether their animals ate feed made with genetically modified organisms.The new volumes are striking: 94 per cent of Michigan-grown soyabeans are still bioengineered. To meet new demand from US consumers, Zeeland has been buying other states’ spare beans.Darwin Rader, a Zeeland sales manager, says: “The biggest question when this first started happening a few years ago was, ‘is this a fad that will soon go away, or a trend?’ We’re seeing it’s becoming a trend.”Shifting crop flows in the heart of the US grain belt testify to a change under way on store shelves from Whole Foods to Costco Wholesale. Consumers are increasingly choosing “clean label” foods they perceive to be healthier or free of incomprehensible ingredients, setting off a well-documented scramble among big food brands. The bulk agricultural traders that dominate flows of food commodities are now being forced to respond.US organic food sales have doubled since 2007 to $36bn in 2014, according to the Organic Trade Association. Fruits and vegetables were more than a third of the market, followed by dairy cows fed organic feed grain or forage.US sales of foods verified as non-GMO have tripled since 2013 to $15bn in the year to September, Non-GMO Project data show. While these include products that never have been genetically modified — such as non-GMO verified baking soda — they also include products made from corn and soyabeans, among the most widely bioengineered crops in the US.“Clean label, gluten-free, GMO-free — it is a force to be reckoned with and to pay attention to,” says David MacLennan, chief executive of Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural commodities trader and processor.Cargill created a GMO-free corn syrup in response to changes at a confectionery customer, its annual report says. Its rival, Archer Daniels Midland, last year spent $170m to acquire Specialty Commodities, which secures organic foods from around the world and offers organic-certified pasteurisation for nuts, legumes, ancient grains and other foods.Bunge, another large agricultural house, recently purchased Whole Harvest Foods, an expeller-pressed (where raw materials are squeezed under high pressure) cooking oil producer. “They are niches, but they are growing fast,” Soren Schroder, Bunge’s chief executive, says of “clean label” foods.Co-operatively owned CHS in 2011 bought a soyabean processing plant in Creston, Iowa, that is now verified by the Non-GMO Project. Some non-GMO soyabean meal is sold to meat companies in California that demand non-bioengineered feed.“Consumers and companies that buy want to know the supply chain is intact, that people are really segregating,” says Tom Malecha, CHS’s vice-president of processing and food ingredients.The challenge for the biggest agricultural traders and processors is twofold. One is the risk of making an investment based on a fad. The other is understanding how to generate returns from speciality crops when their sprawling networks of silos, trucks, barges, ships and industrial-scale mills were designed to digest massive volumes of interchangeable commodities.ADM’s North American oilseed plants can crush 85,000 tonnes a day, for example — about the size of the entire 2014 US organic soyabean harvest.Handling bespoke batches “kind of contradicts their large economies-of-scale business model, where they’re always looking for throughputs”, says Nick Fereday, a food analyst at Rabobank.Surging US demand for organic food — which is not bioengineered and also free of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers — kept values for organic feed corn and soyabeans aloft even while prices for conventional crops plummeted. The US, the world’s top corn and soyabean grower, has become an importer of organic corn and soyabeans.In the organic food trade, smaller companies are absorbing some of this growth. Scoular, a privately owned US grain merchant, has been meeting a shortfall in domestic supplies by delivering containers packed with certified organic grain and soyabeans from India, Argentina, and eastern Europe.“The US has a $1bn trade deficit in organic products right now,” says Greg Lickteig, a company director.New York-listed SunOpta says it handles more than half the organic soyabeans grown in North America as well as corn, sunflower, cocoa, sugar, fruits, nuts, seeds and ancient grains.The squeeze on organic grain supplies in part reflects stringent US Department of Agriculture rules that require a farm to follow organic practices for three years before it can be certified. For many farmers, the risks of making such a long-term investment offset the appeal of selling organic corn at a current price of $10.50 a bushel instead of $4 or less for benchmark corn.“The market is telling the farmer, ‘we want more of this’,” says Lynn Clarkson, founder of Clarkson Grain, an organic and non-GMO corn and soyabean merchant in Illinois.Additional reporting by Avantika Chilkoti
77;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-11-29T19:47:05Z;Deutsche Bank created complex tax avoidance strategies;PPI trades pitched to corporate clients despite G20 drive to close loopholes;Deutsche Bank has been devising complex international tax avoidance strategies for some of its largest corporate clients, even as G20 governments and the OECD attempt to close loopholes involving moving money to other jurisdictions.According to documents seen by the Financial Times and people familiar with the process, tax-saving plans were pitched this year to several Deutsche Bank clients with offices in Brazil, including brewer AB InBev and the commodities groups Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill.They involved the so-called profit-participating instruments, or PPI trades. Under the proposed strategy, a Deutsche client in Brazil would have co-invested with the bank’s Austria unit in a newly established Austrian entity. This Austrian entity would then take the funds and lend them back to the corporate client in a jurisdiction outside Brazil with favourable withholding tax rules — such as another European country.Both the client and Deutsche Bank would benefit from the “profits” of the Austrian entity — generated from the loan terms — and pay them out as dividends that also qualify for tax exemptions.Deutsche structured the transactions this way to establish a commercial rationale, such as raising finance, rather than simply rerouting money to avoid tax, people familiar with the strategy explained.It did not want to see the cash being lent around in a circle back to Brazil, the people added.Similar deals were proposed to take advantage of tax arrangements between other countries, such as Mexico and Luxembourg. None of the proposals was illegal.Deutsche Bank said it did not proceed with the plans for any clients. “These transactions were never executed,” the bank said in a statement.AB InBev declined to comment, while ADM and Bunge could not immediately be reached for comment. Cargill said it was looking into the matter.However, the plans suggest that banks have continued to design creative tax avoidance strategies, despite concerted efforts by the OECD and the G20 to prohibit them, through anti-avoidance measures.In a recent estimate, the OECD said governments were losing $240bn in revenue because of corporate tax avoidance. Recession-hit Brazil has been trying to raise tax revenues in an attempt to reduce a widening budget deficit.“God knows there are people out there who have a lot of creativity on tax matters,” said Achim Pross, head of international co-operation and tax administration at the OECD. “But we’re pretty optimistic that one way or another, these rules capture the bulk of what governments perceive as the problem. We have put together a pretty comprehensive package and reached a global consensus on what needs to be changed in the international landscape.”Deutsche Bank appears to have been aware of the possible sensitivities of its proposals, and a Brazilian law firm was asked to review the structures, said people familiar with the deals.Documents also show that Deutsche executives in its Latin America unit and other divisions were aware of the proposals but needed to approve them. The plans also needed to go through the bank’s reputational risk committee.
78;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-11-25T17:43:49Z;US ethanol output tops 1m barrels a day;Refiners benefit from low corn prices and motorists returning to American highways;US ethanol output has topped 1m barrels a day for the first time as refiners take advantage of low corn prices and a caravan of motorists returning to American highways.The surge in supply shows how US ethanol plants, which mash corn into fuel and animal feed, have staggered back to life after being wounded by the financial crisis and then a historic drought.The ethanol industry has benefited as an improving jobs market and low oil prices prompt Americans to drive more. Travel on US roads rose 4.3 per cent in September to nearly 260bn vehicle miles compared with the same month last year, according to the Department of Transportation.As petrol consumption increases, so has demand for the ethanol that is blended into virtually every barrel sold. Department of Energy data released on Wednesday showed US ethanol plant output at 1.008m barrels per day in the week ended November 20, up 33,000 b/d from the week before and more than triple volumes of a decade ago. The US is the world’s largest ethanol producer, followed by Brazil.The growth comes despite uncertainty over US biofuels blending mandates. The Environmental Protection Agency in May proposed a plan that mandates less ethanol use than originally outlined in a 2007 law. The federal agency is expected to modestly increase these levels in a final rule to be released by November 30, Reuters reported.Ethanol producers, led by companies such as Poet, Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains and Valero Energy, the last also an oil refiner, have expanded facilities in response to demand.Alex Thomas, trader and analyst at Vectra Capital in New York, said: “They’ve increased capacity steadily over the years. Some of that was masked in 2012 and 2013 with the drought we had in the Midwest — you had some plants shutting down because we ran out of corn. This is the first time that you’ve had enough corn, enough capacity and enough demand that they can produce that much.”4.3%rise in travel on US roads in September to nearly 260bn vehicle milesCompetition among ethanol plants has squeezed profit margins for ethanol producers. Iowa State University estimated recent returns over operating costs of just 11 cents per gallon at a typical plant in the state, down 60 per cent from the start of the year.Chicago ethanol prices were $1.5025 a gallon on Wednesday, off 0.2 per cent on the day and down 35 per cent from a year before.New York-listed ADM told analysts earlier this month: “We continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins.”The high production inflated US ethanol stocks to 19.6m barrels last week, up 15 per cent from a year ago, according to the Department of Energy.
79;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-11-03T21:55:19Z;ADM slides on weak ethanol margins;Energy shares rally after oil supply disruptions in Brazil and Libya;Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest agricultural traders and processors, was among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Tuesday after revealing weak profits from manufacturing ethanol fuel and sluggish exports of US grain.The Chicago-based company is one of the top US refiners of corn ethanol. The fuel is blended with petrol or shipped abroad.Even while US drivers burnt more fuel as they flocked to highways this year, ethanol refiners have been producing nearly 1m barrels per day, building up an inventory surplus.Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive, said the company’s operating profit margins in ethanol were a modest 18 cents per gallon in the third quarter.“We continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins,” Mr Luciano said on a conference call with analysts.ADM reported profit of $252m, or 41 cents per share, in the three months ended in September, down about two-thirds from $747m, or $1.14 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted net income of 60 cents per share missed consensus estimates.With a large network of grain silos in the US, ADM was also hit by poor trading volumes in US grain. Corn and wheat prices are depressed and a strong dollar made other exporters more competitive.Mr Luciano said: “US farmers don’t like these prices. And at this point in time, they are holders of grain.”ADM shares, which have declined 17 per cent this year, were down 6.8 per cent at $43.15 by markets close.FitBit shares fell 8.7 per cent to $37.26 after the maker of wearable fitness devices disclosed plans for a follow-on offering and said it would lift lock-up restrictions on others.The San Francisco-based company said it planned to sell 7m shares and that certain stockholders were planning to sell 14m shares.Fitbit also said that it agreed to release the lock-up restrictions on its employees and consultants for 2.3m shares as of October 31.The news came alongside third-quarter profits that slid 33.5 per cent year-on-year to $45.8m, or 19 cents a share, in the three months ended in September and sales that nearly tripled to $409.3m, both ahead of expectations.Shares in Kellogg, the cereals and snacks maker, fell 3.6 per cent to $68.09 after the company reported disappointing third-quarter results as sales of its US breakfast foods slowed.The Michigan-based company reported profits of $205m, or 58 cents a share, compared with $224m, or 62 cents a share, in the year-ago period.Sales slid 8.5 per cent to $3.3bn, declining for the third straight quarter, and were shy of analysts’ estimates.Shares of King Digital Entertainment jumped 14.8 per cent to $17.84 in New York after Activision Blizzard agreed to pay $5.9bn to acquire the maker of Candy Crush Saga. Activision shares gained 3.6 per cent to $35.82.Energy shares rallied after news of supply disruptions in Brazil and Libya pushed oil prices higher.By close of trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 2,109.79, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,918.15 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 5,145.13.
80;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-09-18T13:18:40Z;Dreyfus picks internal candidate for CEO;Commodities trader appoints Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena as chief;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s biggest traders of coffee, sugar and wheat, has appointed Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena, an internal candidate, as its chief executive, ending a 17-month search for a new head of the privately owned company.Dreyfus, as the company is widely known, resumed its search for a CEO earlier this year after plans to appoint Mayo Schmidt, the former head of Viterra, the Canadian grain handler, were dropped. This followed a disagreement over the terms and conditions of his employment.The company is controlled through a family trust by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus, whose family founded the Rotterdam-headquartered company in 1851.It has been looking for a new chief executive since Ciro Echesortu stepped down in April 2014. The decision to select an internal candidate may damp speculation that Dreyfus is looking to go public.“Mr Ramírez is a valued member of our senior management team, and stood out as a strong internal candidate during an extensive and rigorous search process,” said Ms Louis-Dreyfus in a statement, adding they had also considered external candidates.Apart from a 14-year stint at Nidera, the Dutch grains trader, Mr Ramírez, 48, has spent the rest of his career at Dreyfus, most recently as head of its Asian business. The Argentine has also worked in freight, flours and cereals.Alongside the appointment of Mr Ramírez, Ms Louis-Dreyfus also revealed that she would become non-executive chairman, succeeding Serge Schoen. She said Sandrine Téran, global head of tax, had been appointed chief financial officer. The appointments take effect at the end of the month.Dreyfus, the world’s largest rice and raw cotton trader, has changed its business model so that it more closely resembles a publicly listed company. It has also been investing heavily to increase its size and keep pace with its competitors and a rapidly consolidating sector.Glencore recently said it would consider selling a minority stake in its agricultural arm while Cofco, the Chinese state-owned grains trader, has purchased majority stakes in the agri business of Noble Group and also Nidera. Cofco is planning to consolidate its international purchases into a new holding company.This has fuelled talk that Dreyfus might have to launch an initial public offering in either Asia, Europe or the US. A big name appointment would have stoked further speculation, said industry watchers, although sharp declines in the share prices of Glencore and Noble Group have shown the difficulties facing trading companies when they float on the stock market.For her part, Ms Louis-Dreyfus has said there are many options open to the company, including selling a minority stake to a strategic investor. She has also said it would be “difficult” for an outsider to run the 164-year old business because of its ingrained culture.Ms Louis-Dreyfus, a Russian, has been quietly increasing her grip on the company since the death of her husband in 2009. Earlier this year, she raised her stake in the parent company of Dreyfus to 80 per cent from 65 per cent, buying shares from other family members. Terms of the deal and the value that would have placed on Dreyfus were never publicly disclosed.Dreyfus and its rivals Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill form the “ABCD “ group of companies that dominate the global flow of food commodities.The agricultural commodity sector has faced headwinds over the past year in the form of high inventories because of good harvests over the past few years and slowing growth in emerging markets.In 2014, Dreyfus reported net income of $648m, flat on the previous year, as a strong performance from its food-processing arm was offset by difficult trading conditions. The group paid $600m in dividends to shareholders, including Ms Louis-Dreyfus. Sales increased 1.7 per cent to $64.7bn. Dreyfus is due to file interim results for 2015 later this month.
81;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-08-04T16:02:01Z;Plentiful South American harvests hit Archer Daniels Midland;Adjusted earnings per share for the three months to June fall almost 25%;Strong crop flows from South America hit Archer Daniels Midland’s second-quarter profit margins, but the US agricultural group’s shares rallied on an improved outlook for the second half.The Chicago-based group’s shares rose almost 4 per cent to $49.48 a share following its forecast of a rebound in its North American grain export volumes and margins after missing analyst earnings estimates for the second quarter.“We are very bullish given domestic and global demand,” said Juan Luciano, ADM chief executive.The results followed weak second-quarter numbers for Bunge, one of ADM’s rivals in the agricultural trading sector. Both companies are expecting better trading conditions in the second half of the year when North American farmers start to harvest their corn and oilseeds crops.Lower ethanol margins, which also affected profits in its corn processing division, are expected to improve, as sales remained strong, ADM said. A good corn crop in the US is likely to push down input costs, helping margins.For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share for the three months to June fell almost 25 per cent from a year before to 60c a share compared with Wall Street forecasts of 65c. Sales dropped 20 per cent to $17.2bn.The company’s agricultural services business, which moves grains and oilseeds between the growers and consumers, saw operating profits for the quarter fall more than 30 per cent to $127m as a plentiful South American harvest and a strong dollar reduced the competitiveness of North American grains.The unit’s “earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes of North American exports, as they were less competitive globally, and by a sharp upward move in commodity prices at the end of the quarter,” Mr Luciano said.The corn processing unit fell 30 per cent to $188m. However, the oilseeds business rose 1.3 per cent to $301m, supported by good soyabean meal demand and higher South American purchases and export volumes. US demand for feed has been high thanks to a rise in poultry consumption.ADM said it was no longer going ahead with its acquisition of Chinese sweetener business Meiweiyuan Biotechnology, originally announced in May. It is understood the two companies failed to agree on closing conditions.
82;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-06-25T14:49:08Z;Rain delays to US planting lift corn and soya prices;Soggy conditions have also slowed the harvest of US winter wheat;Fields too wet to drive a tractor, corn stalks flattened by gusts, submerged silos: wild weather in the US Midwest has taken agricultural markets for a ride.In the past few weeks, grain futures have halted months of decline on fears that storms in the grain belt could trim otherwise ample supplies.The downpours and damaging winds have arrived just as the US Department of Agriculture prepares an official survey of farmers’ planting plans for the year. The report, to be released Tuesday, will help guide grain markets for the rest of the northern hemisphere growing season.When farmers were first surveyed in March, they intended to plant 89.2m acres with corn and a record 84.6m acres with soyabeans, the two most widely cultivated crops in the US. Many analysts believed these new numbers would be higher in Tuesday’s update. Now they are not so sure.“The adjustment in acreage the USDA imparts June 30 will be worth watching closely,” says Bill Lapp of Advanced Economic Solutions, a consultancy.As the top producer of both corn and soyabeans, the US crop is important in steering world grain prices. The two commodities are fed to livestock, processed into food and biofuels and exported around the world.The rains have delayed planting of soyabeans, which are generally sown after corn. Earlier this week 90 per cent of the crop was planted, 5 percentage points below average. In Missouri just under half the intended soyabean crop remains to be planted.Furious winds across Iowa and Illinois earlier this week knocked over young corn stalks in “garden spot areas, potentially the best-yielding areas, and the market is taking notice”, says Mike Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics. “Because soils are so saturated, hail and wind exacerbate an already bad problem for producers.”Soggy conditions have also slowed the ongoing harvest of US winter wheat, leading to worries that moisture could damage the quality of that grain before it reaches millers.Prices have jumped, with July-delivered corn futures gaining 6 per cent to $3.73¼ a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, CBOT July soyabeans rising 7.9 per cent to $10.01 a bushel and CBOT July wheat rising 6.1 per cent to $5.23¾ a bushel since June 1.June began wet and became wetter when tropical storm Bill barrelled through, dumping nearly four inches of rain in a day on southern Indiana. Further north, the agricultural trading house Bunge shut down a soyabean processing and oils packaging plant for four days as it was encircled by muddy water. Illinois is slogging through what is already its fifth wettest June on record, according to its state climatologist.The rains are consistent with long-term climate projections as the world warms. The US National Climate Assessment, published last year, said the Midwest’s annual precipitation increased in the past century with much of the rise due to “intensification of the heaviest rainfalls”, a trend set to persist.The rains are also stoking concerns more immediate than the autumn harvests: high water has hindered barges trying to reach silos along the Illinois river, the official delivery point for corn and soyabean futures. Futures exchange operator CME Group last week invoked a force majeure clause allowing traders to delay deliveries until the river subsides. If the situation persists, traders said it could push down July-delivered futures prices relative to later delivery dates.Archer Daniels Midland, the owner of some shipping stations on the river, says that while flooding has hampered barge operations, “our extensive rail and road assets allow us to continue moving grain”.The rainy spring has an upside: it will leave ample moisture in the soil to guard against any dry spell during July and August, when corn ears and soyabean pods fill out. This is a contrast to the US drought of 2012, when a dry spring left plants vulnerable to intense summer heat and soyabean prices shot to a record high.“There’s no correlation whatsoever between June rainfall and final yield,” says Dan Basse, president of AgResource, a consultancy. “This is a very good-looking crop, both corn and beans, albeit with some localised flooding in some areas.”The global supply picture is also ample: South America is reaping large soyabean and corn harvests, while the US is sitting on mounds of both commodities after two years in a row of huge crops.Ahead of Tuesday’s USDA report the forecast remains cloudy: Commodity Weather Group eyes more rain through Friday, with the heaviest amounts in Corn Belt states such as Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
83;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-05-07T08:15:03Z;Agriculture outlook provides bright spot for Glencore;Key grain and oilseed traders achieve high export volumes;"Glencore investors disappointed by the company’s quarterly production report released this week — especially in metals — might want to look at agriculture for some better news.Glencore’s update on its own agriculture business revealed little — processed and produced volumes in the first quarter fell 15 per cent from the year before. But the read across from the quarterly results of agricultural traders Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland should provide some cheer for Glencore shareholders.Glencore’s agricultural unit saw earnings surge in 2014 thanks to record grain and oilseed crops around the world. The bulk of last year’s $992m annual earnings before interest and tax came from grain handling and logistics.Both Bunge and ADM had a good start to the year thanks to strong soyabean crushing margins and high export volumes from key grain and oilseed producers. They were also positive on the year’s outlook. Juan Luciano, the chief executive of ADM, said he saw “good planting” and “plentiful crops” leading to a strong second half of the year for the company’s grains and oilseeds teams.Bunge’s first-quarter earnings before tax for its four main business units almost quintupled to $373m, while ADM’s segment operating profits for the three months to March rose 24 per cent to $855m.Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, told analysts that first-quarter grains and oilseed flows were strong overall — a good sign for Glencore investors.One of the high points in Glencore’s 2014 agricultural “industrial” business was higher soyabean crush volumes in Argentina. Mr Schroder described the country’s harvest as “the largest crop we’ve had” and noted active deliveries and good margins.“Global oilseed trading and distribution results were excellent, and our risk management teams guided both margins and global flows well,” said Mr Schroder.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingGrain export volumes in Brazil, US and the Black Sea region were high, he added.Glencore is the largest grains exporter out of Russia and it would have benefited from the strong exports following a bumper crop in 2014. Analysts say the grains export tax imposed by Moscow in the first quarter had minimal impact on flows out of Russia.One area of weakness in the companies’ operations was ADM’s ethanol business, which suffered from low margins due to low oil prices. The unit saw first-quarter operating profit plunge 70 per cent to $42m.In its first-quarter production report, Glencore said output volumes of biodiesel fell 37 per cent due to “a scheduled maintenance shutdown at Biopetrol and reduced production at Renova, in response to lower esterification margins”.Nevertheless, the rebound in crude prices to almost $70 a barrel are likely to help biofuel margins recover. On its corn ethanol business outlook, ADM said “conditions and margins have been improving since late March”.The Commodities Note is online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times"
84;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
85;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-05-06T12:02:16Z;Wheat heavyweights battle for global market share;Large crops and currency moves reshape trade flows;An Australian agricultural official asked a pointed question at a recent conference: “Are we at risk of becoming the poor white trash of Asia?”He was quoting Lee Kuan Yew, the late prime minister of Singapore who once described Australia’s potential using the same harsh words. But in this case the official was warning about Australia’s status as a grain exporter.Australia, Canada, Europe, Russia and the US are among the heavyweights battling for a piece of the global wheat market. Surplus stocks, sharp currency moves and large impending crops are reshaping trade flows of the staple grain, with winners and losers.Aggressive sales by big exporters have pushed benchmark US wheat prices down more than 20 per cent this year to below $5 a bushel. Hedge funds have got the message, holding three bearish bets for every bullish one in Chicago’s futures and options markets. “You would have to search to find something to turn the wheat market around,” says Richard Feltes, vice-president at broker RJ O’Brien.Wheat is a versatile crop, grown in a variety of climates and used in products from bread to noodles to animal feed. After years of high prices, farmers have grown two straight record harvests. A third year of production above 700m tonnes is on the cards, according to the International Grains Council.Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, a New York-listed grain trader and miller, says: “The decline in prices is just a reflection of the very good crop outlook everywhere. Many origins are competing against each other for the same business.”The stronger dollar has helped cut US wheat exports by 25 per cent this year, according to its department of agriculture. Once the source of a quarter of the global wheat trade, the US has seen its share slip to 15 per cent. “We’re just not competitive in the world market,” says Ted Schultz, chief operating officer at Team Marketing, a co-operative grain merchant in Kansas, the top US wheat-growing state.The US’s loss is others’ gain. Amid weakness in its currency, Canada’s wheat exports are set to match the US’s for the first time ever. Last month Bunge and a state-owned Saudi Arabian investment company took a majority stake in Canada’s former wheat monopoly, helping the US group diversify its sources of supply and Riyadh enhance food security as it stops growing its own wheat.Europe has enjoyed record exports thanks to good harvests, the decline in the euro and its proximity to the Middle East, a key importing region. Archer Daniels Midland, another New York-listed trader and processor, this week announced it had taken full control of export terminals at the mouth of the Danube river able to handle wheat and other commodities from Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary.But it is supplies further east in the Black Sea region that have tipped the global wheat balance. The crisis in Ukraine and Russia has heightened the value of grain sales as a source of hard currency for the two countries.Ukraine’s wheat exports are forecast at 11.7m tonnes, the highest since the 2007-08 crop year, while Russia’s are forecast at a near-record 21m tonnes, according to consultancy Sovecon in Moscow.The rise of the Black Sea producers two years ago led the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation to add Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan to the list of five members in its “bulk wheat exporter” category: the US, EU, Canada, Australia and Argentina. “These are new players who were not there 10 years ago,” says Abdolreza Abbassian, FAO senior economist in Rome.Wheat from the Black Sea, especially from Russia, became more attractive thanks to lower freight shipping rates and the sharp fall in local currencies such as the rouble. It is even finding its way to markets near the US.“With freight rates so cheap, Russian wheat works into both South America, for example Peru, and into Central America, such as Mexico,” says Swithun Still, director at Solaris, a Swiss-based grain trader. Nigerian mills, traditionally buyers of US wheat, are also buying more from the Black Sea exporters, he said.Wheat is not a uniform commodity. Bread bakers may prefer “hard” varieties with more protein while cracker makers seek soft wheat. As a result, some longstanding trade relationships with sources of speciality grains are hard to undo.Nevertheless, David Fienberg, the Australian agricultural official who warned of “white trash” status in grains, said rival wheat exporters were working hard to gain market share in new places.Canada, he told the conference in Canberra, was developing wheat “so that it’s able to gain entry and also eventually dominate the Southeast Asian noodle market”.Australia’s wheat exports are forecast at 17m tonnes, the lowest in five years, according to government data. Mr Fienberg added: “You can see the encroaching of the Black Sea exports.”
86;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-04-21T08:18:54Z;Tate & Lyle wields axe to bolster profits;Foods group to withdraw from European bulk ingredients and restructure its sucralose business;Tate & Lyle is to withdraw from European bulk ingredients and take an axe to its sucralose operations in a restructuring that it hopes will draw a line under a tumultuous year marked by three profit warnings.The moves announced on Tuesday will allow the British food ingredients maker to increase its exposure to its core speciality ingredients unit, while quitting the non-strategic business of high-fructose corn syrup in Europe, albeit at the cost of a dilution in earnings.Tate & Lyle has also decided to hang on to, but downsize, its Splenda sweetener business, where once-high profits have been badly hit by a sharp fall in sucralose prices.Javed Ahmed, chief executive, said the measures would “streamline and focus Tate & Lyle as it continues to transition to a global speciality food ingredients business supported by cash generation from bulk ingredients”.Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies, said the restructuring could make the company a more attractive M&A target. “Tate will be a cleaner, potentially more biddable, entity, when the dust settles,” he said.The group will exit from a joint venture with Archer Daniels Midland in corn wet mills in Europe — principally Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary. But it will take full ownership from ADM of a speciality food ingredients plant in Slovakia and receive €240m in cash from the US commodities group.The corn mills produce high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener that will no longer be subject to quotas in 2017, when the EU also deregulates sugar production.Mr Ahmed said: “We think the industry will be volatile until it adapts to the new unregulated environment. For us, it’s all about getting out ahead of the volatility.” The company’s remaining bulk ingredients business will be focused on North America.The group is to slash costs in its sucralose business by shutting down its Singapore factory, leaving it with one remaining facility, in Alabama.Mr Ahmed said he expected sucralose prices to continue to fall. The group said it would report a 75 per cent drop in sucralose operating profits to £16m for the year to March 31.Sucralose profits would fall further, to break-even level, in the next financial year before returning to profitability in the year ending March 2017, the company said.The restructuring will lead to an exceptional charge of £185m this year — of which £165m will have been incurred in the sucralose turnround.Citi analysts described the restructuring as “two strategically sensible moves. Tate will become a much more predictable business, but we think the dividend cover of 1.3 times is at a low level”.The sale of European bulk ingredients follows that of sugar refining, which Mr Ahmed exited in 2010, soon after becoming chief executive.His policy has been to shift the business away from bulk commodities into the more profitable speciality ingredients business, which includes sweeteners and starches.But Tate & Lyle has continued to suffer price volatility — especially in sucralose, where the market has been flooded by cheap products from Chinese manufacturers.The plunging sugar price has eaten into its European sweetener profits, while low oil prices have also hit ethanol prices. The group has also suffered from supply chain problems in the US.The three setbacks led to as many profit warnings in its current financial year.The shares, which have underperformed the FTSE 100 by more than 20 per cent over the past three years, were 1 per cent lower at 645.84p in afternoon London trading.
87;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-04-08T13:35:46Z;Argentine soyabean ‘stocks bubble’ set to burst;Farmers expected to sell stored crops as currency falls and debts rise;Argentina’s soyabean “stocks bubble” is about to burst as the country’s farmers are set to sell their crops to support their dwindling incomes.The country’s farmers have long used their crop, priced in US dollars, as a buffer against rising inflation and a falling local currency. However, “currency devaluation pressure, farmer indebtedness, and a surging industry demand”, will lead to inventory sales, said the latest report from the US Department of Agriculture’s Buenos Aires agricultural attache.“Producers, crushers, and the government can only play the game of chicken so long before someone will have to cave,” it added.Argentina is the world’s third-largest grower of the oilseed, producing 56m tonnes, a little more half of US output, and in the past few years, the “selling strike” by farmers has affected global companies such as ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Glencore.The crop can be stored for several years and inventories in Argentina have soared. At the start of the 2014-15 crop year, soyabean inventories totalled 18.6m tonnes, almost doubling from the year before, according to USDA data. Sales of the plastic silo bags Argentina’s farmers use to store their soyabeans have also rocketed.The government, frustrated by the fall in taxes from soyabean exports, has tried to restrict the sale of the bags by creating new reporting requirements for silo bag manufacturers and vendors.The AFIP, the tax agency, is now keeping a registry of how many silo bags the industry is manufacturing and selling, as well as who is buying how many of the bags.The AFIP has decried soyabean producers’ “speculatory use of silo bags that disrupts the market and keeps much-needed funds from entering the country”, according to the USDA report.Cases of vandalism against the soyabean farmers have risen during the past few months. In the six months to February this year, there have been some 50 incidents of silo bags being deliberately cut open by intruders and farmers forced to sell their crops.Selling by Argentina’s farmers will bring more soyabeans on to an already oversupplied market. CBOT soyabeans have fallen 4.5 per cent from the start of the year, and 36 per cent from a year ago. Soya meal, which is used for livestock feed, has declined 12 per cent in the year to date and 35 per cent since April 2014.More than three-quarters of soyabean production in Argentina is processed domestically and crushed for meal and oil. The country is the world’s leading producer of soyabean meal and oil.
88;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-03-26T21:27:28Z;Margarita Louis-Dreyfus strengthens grip on food trader with ‘supermajority’;Dreyfus reports flat profits as CEO search continues;Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is strengthening her grip on the holding company that controls Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s biggest traders of coffee, sugar and wheat.The news came as privately owned Louis Dreyfus Commodities revealed flat annual profits for 2014, after falling agricultural commodity prices weighed on performance.Ms Louis-Dreyfus said she expected the Rotterdam-based company — widely known as Dreyfus — to have completed a search for a chief executive by the end of the year.The Louis-Dreyfus family has maintained control of the group since it was founded in 1851 by Leopold Louis-Dreyfus, the son of a farmer who started selling French wheat across the border in Switzerland.Since the death of her husband Robert in 2009, Ms Louis-Dreyfus, a Russian, has been steadily increasing her grip on the company.Under a deal expected to close in June a family trust called Akira will increase its stake in Louis Dreyfus Holdings from 65 to 80 per cent, by buying shares from other family members.LDH owns 85 per cent of the shares, with the rest held by senior employees.Ms Louis-Dreyfus, chair of LDH, refused to say how much she had paid for the stake which will give Akira a “supermajority” in the holding company’s decision making. Once Akira’s stake rises above 67 per cent, minority shareholders will have less power to block strategic moves.“One of Akira’s main goals to is keep family control of the company, and with 80 per cent we have complete control,” said Ms Louis-Dreyfus, who is also the owner of Olympique de Marseille, a French football club. “Gaining a supermajority was important.”While there were no plans to acquire the remaining 20 per cent of the shares, she said Akira would be willing to buy additional stock if more family members wanted to sell.Under an agreement hammered out by her late husband, Akira has the obligation to buy shares that other family members tender during the period from “2011 until 2031”.“We’d like to keep our options open . . . Akira could buy or we could bring in a strategic partner. It depends on the situation,” she added. “Minority shareholders will decide.”Dreyfus resumed its search for a chief executive late last year when its chosen candidate, Mayo Schmidt — former head of Viterra, the Canadian grain trader — decided not to take the job after failing to agree terms.Ms Louis-Dreyfus said she had learnt from the experience and was still open to the idea of appointing an outsider. “I don’t have a preference where to look. We are going to look everywhere,” she said.In the year to December, Dreyfus reported net income of $648m, compared to $640m in 2013, as a strong performance by the food-processing business offset weak results by its trading arm. Sales rose 2 per cent to $64.7bn.The group paid $600m in dividends to shareholders, including Ms Louis-Dreyfus. Half of the total was a one-off payment funded by asset sales.The group’s ‘Value Chain’ division, which is focused around oilseeds, grains, and fruit juice, posted a 19 per cent rise in operating profits, as abundant supplies of crops helped Dreyfus run assets such as processing plants at higher rates of capacity.Dreyfus’ trading, or ‘Merchandizing’ arm, did less well. Operating profits at the division, which buys and sells commodities including cotton, sugar, coffee and rice, fell 13 per cent last year because of weaker prices and high inventories.Against a backdrop of falling agricultural commodity prices, Ms Louis-Dreyfus said she was pleased with the results, which proved the strength of the group’s business model.“We remain one of the best performers in our industry with a return on equity of 14 per cent. This is a good achievement in a challenging environment,” she said.Under Ms Louis-Dreyfus the group has altered its operations so they are more closely aligned with those of a listed company. However, Dreyfus has no plans to follow Glencore and go public.Dreyfus and its rivals ADM, Bunge and Cargill — collectively know as the “ABCD” group — dominate global flows of food commodities.
89;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-03-02T18:31:54Z;Noble chairman increases his stake;Trading house’s market value has fallen a fifth since Iceberg published a critical report;The chairman and founder of Noble Group has increased his shareholding in the commodity trader as it attempts to deal with the fallout from an attack on its accounting policies by a mysterious research group.In a stock exchange filing, Noble said Richard Elman had bought 4.8m shares, worth S$4.5m ($3.3m) on Monday, lifting his holding to almost 21 per cent.News of the purchases came as in shares in the Singapore-listed group dropped to their lowest level in a year. They fell 3 per cent to S$0.945, valuing Noble at S$6.3bn ($4.67bn).Noble’s market value has slumped by a fifth since Iceberg Research, a little known research group, published a critical report alleging the company exploited the accounting treatment of its associates “to avoid large impairments and fabricate profit.”Noble has rejected all the allegations, which it reckons are the work of a “disgruntled” junior employee it fired a year-and-a-half ago. However, it has been unable to halt the slide in its share price even though management has repeatedly rebuffed the claims.In an attempt to reassure nervous analysts and investors, Noble has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday where its chief executive Yusuf Alireza and finance director Robert Van Der Zalm will answer questions about its accounting policies and annual results, which were released last week.“We hope management will offer a response to class action lawsuit filed by the Rosen Law firm claiming that Noble Group may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public”, Morgan Stanley analyst Charles Spencer said in a note to clients.The attack on Noble marks the second time in three years that a Singapore-listed commodities company has come under fire from a research group. In late 2012 Olam, a cashews-to-coffee group, came under fire over accounting practices and ballooning debt from Muddy Waters, a US-based shortseller.In Olam’s case, the knock to shares proved brief. The company rejected the criticism, and conducted a capital raising exercise that helped push shares higher. A consortium led by Temasek, the state-owned investment group, now owns 80 per cent of Olam.Olam, Noble and a third Singapore-listed commodities group, Wilmar, are widely considered to be Asian rivals to longer-established western businesses Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge.Noble reported its first quarterly loss in more than three years last week after it recording more than $400m of impairment charges, write-offs and provisions.The charges included a $200m loss on its stake in Yancoal Australia. In its first report, Iceberg claimed Noble had overstated the value of associate companies, including Yancoal.A subsequent report, published just before Noble announced its results on Thursday, focused on difference between Noble’s net profit and operating cash flows, which it claimed were the result of the company increasing the fair value of unrealised commodities contracts. Again, Noble rejected the allegations.On Monday, Standard & Poor’s said its credit rating on Noble was unaffected by the write downs or claims of aggressive fair value accounting.“We view fair value accounting and mark-to-market of financial assets and liabilities as an ordinary part of operations for commodity companies like Noble,” said Cindy Huang, analyst at S&P. “The company’s risk management is adequate in our view”.Moody’s, a rival rating agency, said Noble’s results were consistent with a triple B credit rating.However, banks have cut their rating on Noble in the wake of the results announcement and credit analysts at JPMorgan have said the company could do more to “alleviate market concern” on fair value accounting and “target specific answers to allegations”.“We also believe a share/bond buyback programme would help improve investment sentiment towards the company,” JPMorgan said in a report.Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country’s central bank that is also the market regulator, is reviewing the Iceberg research report.
90;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Australia to clamp down on foreign property buyers;Fears over Chinese buyers prompt tighter scrutiny for agriculture and real estate;"Australia is tightening scrutiny of foreign ownership in agriculture and real estate to combat public fears that Chinese investment is forcing up house prices and could potentially undermine the country’s food security.From next month, purchases by foreign investors of agricultural land worth more than A$15m (US$11.6m) will be subject to regulatory approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board. The previous threshold was A$240m.The Australian tax office will undertake a stock-take of agricultural land ownership by foreign owners, and new rules on foreign investment in residential real estate will be outlined in “coming weeks”, according to Canberra.“Foreign investment is important to us, but it’s got to be investment that serves our national interests,” said Tony Abbott, Australia’s prime minister.The ruling Liberal-National coalition has previously said that Australia was open to foreign investment, and last year signed trade deals with China, Japan and South Korea.However, the agricultural sector is a sensitive issue among the National party’s rural base — a fact underlined when the government in 2013 blocked a A$3.4bn takeover of GrainCorp by US company Archer Daniels Midland.Foreign ownership of agricultural land was a hot topic before the 2013 election, with a Vote Compass Survey by state broadcaster ABC finding that three-quarters of people wanted more restrictions on land sales.A Lowy Institute poll last year found that 56 per cent of people thought there was too much Chinese investment in Australia, compared with 37 per cent who said it was the right amount.“There is concern among a rural constituency that land will be bought by Chinese investors, who will export all the products and distort export prices,” said Hans Hendrischke, professor of Chinese business at Sydney University.“But the fact is that investment in agriculture is needed and the volume of Chinese investment in agriculture is lower than many people think.”Between 2006 and 2012 Chinese investors sank A$1bn into Australian agricultural businesses, which amounted to 2 per cent of total Chinese investment in the country.This compared with A$36.8bn investment in mining, according to a report, titled “Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australian Agribusiness”, compiled by KPMG and Sydney University.But agreement on a trade deal between China and Australia in November has heightened interest in Australia’s agricultural sector. Chinese group New Hope is investing up to $500m in Australian dairy farms and processing plants as part of a deal with Freedom Foods, a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.Chinese state companies have also set up the Beijing Australia Agricultural Resource Cooperative Development Fund, a $3bn fund to invest in agricultural opportunities.But there are concerns that scrutiny of foreign deals is insufficient.Simon Talbot, chief executive of the National Farmers Federation, said while foreign investment was important to Australia’s booming agriculture sector, it was critical that the government had a full picture of who owned agricultural assets, where and why.Similar concerns have been expressed about a lack of proper scrutiny of foreign investment in real estate, which has been cited by some as a factor in fast-rising house prices in Sydney and Melbourne.A parliamentary inquiry recently recommended the creation of a new database of foreign buyers and the introduction of a fee on processing purchases.Credit Suisse said last year that Chinese investors and newly arrived immigrants had spent A$24bn on Australian property over seven years. The bank forecast they would spent an extra A$44bn in the next seven years.China Investment Corp421Property (175 Liverpool Street, Sydney)Shimao Property Holdings337Property (Gold Fields House at Circular Quay, Sydney)Dalian Wanda Group Corp331Investa Property Group (Centennial Plaza)China Investment Corp and

91;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-02-03T20:20:14Z;ADM sells stake in Brazilian export terminal to Glencore;Agricultural trader plans to ramp up oilseed volume flowing through port;Archer Daniels Midland is forming a joint venture with the commodities trading house Glencore to quadruple the amount of oilseeds flowing through a port in Brazil.One of the biggest agricultural traders and processors, ADM said it had agreed to sell Glencore a one-half stake in its export terminal in Barcarena, near the city of Belém on Brazil’s northeast coast. The companies did not disclose terms of the deal.The move comes as ADM seeks to double its worldwide grain trading volumes over the next several years. Most of the New York-listed company’s silos, ports and processing plants are concentrated in the US, leaving it exposed to localised risks such as drought.ADM is also trying to improve returns on invested capital, a performance measure closely watched by Wall Street. The joint venture, similar to others at ports in the US and Europe, would help ADM economise on its capital outlay as it ramps up trading volumes.The new ADM-Glencore joint venture will own and operate the Barcarena terminal and increase its annual volume capacity from 1.5m tonnes per year to 6m tonnes per year.“We are strengthening a strategically located asset in a cost and capital-efficient way,” said Juan Luciano, chief executive.Glencore is better known as an energy and mining group but also has a significant business trading grain. In 1997, ADM bought Glencore’s grain operations in Brazil as it made a push into the country. But Glencore still holds significant assets in Brazil, including wheat mills, a sugar mill and a soyabean crushing plant.The deal with ADM marks Glencore’s first investment in a soft commodities export terminal in Brazil. People familiar with the deal said it was an “opportunistic deal” and did not signal wider ambitions in Brazil.Three years ago Glencore gained a crucial foothold in the grain market with the $6.1bn acquisition of Canadian grain trader Viterra.The emergence of a global middle class has spurred demand for vegetable oils pressed from soyabeans, palm and rapeseed, and for meat cut from livestock fattened on soyabean meal and grain.Brazil’s soyabean exports will rise 57 per cent to 66.5m tonnes in the coming decade, the US Department of Agriculture forecasts.ADM announced the sale and expansion push as it reported fourth-quarter profit of $1 per share, adjusting for one-off items. That was up 5.2 per cent from $0.95 per share in the same period a year before and above expectations of $0.94.Without the adjustments, net profit was $701m, or $1.08 per share, up from $374m or $0.56 per share in the year earlier period.The company said it ably handled the record corn and soyabean crop harvested in the US late last year. Soyabean exports moved at a record pace despite a strengthening dollar, which can make the commodity relatively more expensive for customers using other currencies.However, executives revealed a significant drop in results from South America, as farmers hoarded grain, exports slowed and its traders lost money as they sought to hedge their exposure. “We . . . didn’t help ourselves much,” Mr Luciano told analysts.ADM shares dropped 1.2 per cent to $48.76 by end of day in New York.
92;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2015-01-08T18:16:04Z;Bumper harvest boosts Cargill profits;World’s largest agricultural trader reaps benefit of record US corn and soyabeans crops;Cargill, the food commodities trader, raked in bumper profits during a quarter in which farmers across North America harvested huge crops.The $784m in net profit reported for the fiscal second quarter to November 30, up 41 per cent from $556m a year before, ranked as the company’s best result in four years.As the world’s largest agricultural processor and trader, Cargill’s earnings are watched as a harbinger for listed competitors such as Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, as well as meat companies such as Tyson Foods.Cargill’s performance has been uneven in recent years, due in part to crop shortfalls and trading losses. In its latest quarter, the company said it ably handled the record US harvest of corn and soyabeans and large volumes of grain sales from Canada.David MacLennan, Cargill chief executive, said: “Just as last quarter’s focus was on getting ready for North America’s big harvest, the current quarter was all about execution. Our team did an excellent job serving farmer customers and fully utilising our supply chains to meet domestic and export demand.”At the same time, Cargill’s results were somewhat offset by the effects of South American farmers who are hoarding grain and delaying sales as a hedge against inflation.With operations spanning dozens of countries, Cargill is an important middleman between surplus producers and importers. It is also one of the largest privately owned companies in the world, with revenue of $135bn in its latest full fiscal year.Our team did an excellent job serving farmer customers and fully utilising our supply chains to meet domestic and export demandAgricultural trading houses tend to have better returns when they are running assets such as silos and processing plants at high rates of capacity, which has been a challenge after the weather-related supply disruptions of the past few years.That has begun to change as bumper crops across the northern hemisphere allow stocks to build. Cargill’s origination and processing division was the biggest contributor to quarterly results, the company said. BMO Capital Markets said its earnings rose 50 per cent year on year. Cargill did not provide specific data on segment performance.Cargill is also a large meat supplier, processing poultry, pork and beef. Strong sales of turkeys over the US Thanksgiving holiday were among the factors that helped to boost its animal nutrition and protein division, which BMO said enjoyed a 48 per cent rise in quarterly earnings.In November, Cargill said its branding of birds raised without growth-promoting antibiotics in the US helped aid demand.In an interview with the Financial Times last year, Mr MacLennan said Cargill’s performance was not meeting his expectations after several years of disappointing results. About 100 descendants of company founder William Wallace Cargill own about 90 per cent of its common stock.
93;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-12-18T17:42:53Z;Welcome to the world of Big Chocolate;Three companies will dominate processing sector;Olam’s purchase of Archer Daniels Midland’s cocoa processing business announced this week catapults the company into the premier league of chocolate. It also leaves the sector in the grip of three companies.Barry Callebaut, the Swiss-based cocoa and chocolate group, Cargill, the US privately owned commodities trader, and Olam’s newly expanded cocoa business will account for about 60 per cent of the world’s cocoa processing — once the deal with ADM is completed. It is the world of Big Chocolate.The sector, which “grinds” cocoa beans into butter, powder and liquor used to make chocolate and flavourings for confectionery and desserts, has become increasingly concentrated over the past few decades due to the capital intensive nature of the business.Many of the deals can be traced back to the merger between Belgian industrial chocolate maker Callebaut and Cacao Barry of France in 1996, which kick-started the sector’s consolidation.At the start of the 1990s there were about 40 or so significant grinders. In just a decade that figure stood at nine, with ADM, Barry Callebaut and Cargill dominating the sector ever since. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the “ABC” of cocoa accounted for 41 per cent of the world’s processing capacity in 2006.ADM, along with Cargill, changed the nature of cocoa trading and processing in the 1990s when they bought their knowledge of grain trading into the sector.Since then, the bigger companies have grown even more powerful by adding new capacity. In 2013, Barry Callebaut bought the processing business of Asian group Petra Foods, cementing its position at the top of the table.Gerry Manley, Olam’s global head of cocoa, made clear that the company needed to be a leading player in processing to remain “strong” as the company announced its deal with ADM.Arguably, the cocoa traders and processors are playing catch up with their customers — the chocolate makers. The sector has also seen rapid consolidation, with the top five manufacturers, including Mars, Mondelez and Nestlé, accounting for more than 65 per cent of total confectionery sales.The importance of global brands and rising research and development and marketing costs in an increasingly international and competitive market has pushed consolidation.According to Ecobank, 70 per cent of the value of the chocolate bar goes to cocoa and chocolate companies reflecting investing R&D and marketing, 17 per cent goes to retailer, 7 per cent goes to intermediaries such as traders.But as Big Chocolate gets bigger, cocoa farmers are finding themselves increasingly squeezed.Growers only get 6 per cent of the chocolate bar, down from 16 per cent in 1980, says Edward George at Ecobank. “So little of the value goes into the raw material,” he says.Leading cocoa and chocolate companies have now united in an action plan to try to support growers to encourage “sustainable” sources of cocoa beans. But, unless that value share changes or the whole pie gets bigger, farmers will find little incentive to continue growing cocoa.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Big Chocolate may be squeezing local exporters / From Christopher L Gilbert
94;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-12-17T22:31:33Z;China reopens to Syngenta corn strain;Beijing ban cost trading houses hundreds of millions of dollars and led to lawsuits;China has approved imports of biotech corn developed by Syngenta, a senior US official said on Wednesday, after blocking the variety last year at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to trading houses.The decision to allow sales of corn containing the genetically modified Agrisure Viptera trait developed by the Swiss-based crop chemical group could reopen a promising market for US farmers.It comes after Beijing late last year rejected cargoes that tested positive for the grain, leading to dozens of lawsuits against the seed company from grain traders including Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill.The world’s most populous country has been slowly loosening its policy of grain self-sufficiency. Traders had hoped it would one day become a large importer of corn, as it already is in soyabeans. The US Department of Agriculture has projected China’s corn imports could reach 22m tonnes in a decade, up ninefold from this year.Last year’s move to turn away cargoes instead surprised the agriculture industry. Viptera corn has been planted since 2011 in the US, the world’s biggest exporter of the feed grain.Tom Vilsack, US agriculture secretary, said on Wednesday that Chinese vice premier Wang Yang had told him that China’s Ministry of Agriculture had approved imports of Viptera corn and two varieties of biotech soyabeans, according to Reuters.While China may have clarified the status of one product, other questions remain. Because China typically approves genetically modified seeds about two years after the US — the world’s biggest grain exporter — it leaves the risk that other unapproved crops will leak into the world market before they are approved.“The issue is not yet resolved,” said Nathan Fields, director of biotechnology at the US National Corn Growers Association. “It’s a step, but it’s by no means a solution.”Western analysts say China’s position on importing unapproved crops has also shifted based on local agricultural market conditions. When Viptera corn imports were first blocked, China’s farmers had just hauled in a blockbuster harvest and local corn prices were depressed.Domestic corn prices in China have risen 7 per cent in the past year to Rmb2,370 per tonne, according to data from the Dalian Commodity Exchange.The issue is not yet resolved. It’s a step, but it’s by no means a solutionA recent report by a US agricultural attaché in Beijing noted that as biotech-related restrictions disrupt trade, local “feed mills are responding to high corn prices by importing alternative feed ingredients.” Price supports for farmers have driven up Chinese corn prices well above the price of US corn landed in Guangdong, the report said.Separately, Ukraine state grain firm GPZKU said the country’s corn supplies to China were facing disruption amid political turmoil in the Black Sea country, the world’s third largest corn exporter, according to Reuters.Syngenta’s seed trait combats cutworms and other pests. Before shipments were stopped, most corn imported from the US probably had Viptera in it, Syngenta officials have said.The US-based grain trading houses ADM and Cargill sued Syngenta in recent month, each claiming tens of millions of dollars in damages. “Due to the pervasiveness of corn grown from Viptera, US corn can no longer be sold to China,” Cargill said in its lawsuit filed in September.Syngenta has disputed the allegations, saying it commercialised the trait in compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.Eric Trachtenberg, director of agriculture and food at McLarty Associates, an advisory firm in Washington, said import approval would was “very likely” to result in the resumption of the corn trade.However, he said the problem of “asynchronous approval” inside China remains. This could mean more Viptera-type rejections in the future or force seed companies and farmers to slow down commercialisation of their crops.Seed companies and trading companies have formed a group called the US Biotech Crops Alliance to try to smooth commercialisation of future crop strains. This year Syngenta introduced another corn trait unapproved in China called Agrisure Duracade, but it was kept out of export channels.The approval announcement came as officials from China and the US were meeting in Chicago at the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, a high-level forum between the two countries.
95;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Asia’s agribusinesses enter new fields;Flurry of dealmaking in smaller sectors in pursuit of greater presence in global food chain;"For more than a century, the trading of crops that go into food products consumed around the globe has been controlled by companies based in the US and Europe.These include the so-called ABCD group — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus — that dominate global flows of food commodities.But 2014 has marked the rise of Asia-based commodity houses and their increasingly prominent role in what features on the world’s dinner tables.Noble Group, Olam and Wilmar, three Singapore-listed agribusinesses, have engaged in an flurry of dealmaking in pursuit of a bigger presence in the global food chain as Asian demand grows.The three companies announced $4.5bn in combined deals this year, compared with $411m last year, according to Dealogic.This week Olam, a Singapore-listed company with a mere 25-year history, snapped up for $1.3bn the cocoa processing business of ADM, catapulting it into the top ranks of global producers of key chocolate ingredients.ADM cited volatility as a motivation for the sale; its “cocoa and other” segment had an operating loss of $33m last year, after an operating profit of $276m in 2012.Olam already trades cocoa beans that go into one in every eight chocolate bars consumed. The acquisition will not only bring it closer to the market share of industry leader Barry Callebaut of Switzerland, but the company says the integration of growing with processing and marketing also should help it better manage the cocoa sector’s volatility.Earlier this year Wilmar, controlled by Malaysia’s Kuok family, agreed an A$1.4bn acquisition of Goodman Fielder — known for making Wonder White bread — gaining a big foothold in Australia’s food business.“Asian commodities companies are looking at what segments of food and agribusiness can be scaled up in areas where the traditional owners are retreating to their core businesses,” says Rohit Chatterji, head of mergers and acquisitions in Asia, outside Japan, at JPMorgan.Olam, Wilmar and Hong Kong-based Noble Group are pursuing strategies aimed at tapping into areas where the greatest demand for food is — in Asia, and particularly in China, India and Indonesia.That was the driver behind Noble’s sale this year of a 51 per cent stake in its bulk commodities business, Noble Agri, to China’s state-run Cofco food group. The $1.5bn deal was China’s second-biggest overseas food-related transaction and considered a signal of its intent to expand its access to overseas food chains. Noble is set to benefit as Noble Agri will become the principal platform for Cofco to source commodities directly, rather than buying them from intermediaries.Sunny Verghese, Olam’s chief executive, says that unlike western peers that originally focused on grains and soyabeans, his company has been going after smaller categories such as cashew nuts. They are grown in 19 countries, in all of which Olam has a presence.“We are different in that we focus on niche categories but more importantly we have found a way to make those niches global. Probably we have achieved a lot more in 25 years than the traditional commodity companies have in their first 25 years,” he says.As Olam adds cocoa processing to its portfolio of coffee, nuts, tomato paste and dairy products, Wilmar — a world leader in palm oil trading — has focused on sugar. It started in 2010 with the acquisition of Sucrogen of Australia, securing a foothold in a global business long dominated by Cargill, ED & F Man, Sucres & Denrées and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.Wilmar has since expanded further, moving into India, the world’s second-largest sugar producer, in February with a minority stake in Shree Renuka. Sugar now accounts for 7 per cent of group pre-tax profits, while its core oilseeds unit has shrunk from 26 per cent in 2009 to 13 per cent.Olam and Wilmar have also been expanding in Africa — a target, too, for Chinese agribusiness groups. Wilmar entered in 2007 and has quickly expanded into 10 countries, involved in the cultivation of palm oil and rubber, edible oil refining and packing, and oilseed crushing.Olam’s push into cocoa processing is based on bullish assumptions about demand for chocolate in emerging markets, especially in Asia. Total chocolate sales in Asia excluding China rose almost 8 per cent in the 12 months to October to $4.3bn, according to Nielsen, a research group.Cargill appears to share the view, opening a $100m cocoa processing plant in Indonesia this month. That investment and others by Cargill this year show that western agribusinesses are also chasing the Asian growth story.ADM this month increased its stake in Wilmar from 16.4 per cent to 17.3 per cent, as “one of the ways in which we are benefiting from growing consumer demand in Asia”."
96;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-12-16T18:59:18Z;Olam buys Archer Daniels Midland’s cocoa business for $1.3bn;Deal to make Singapore agribusiness one of world’s top three cocoa processors;Olam is buying the cocoa business of Archer Daniels Midland for $1.3bn, in the biggest deal by the Singaporean coffee-to-cashews trader after an attack by short sellers two years ago.The move, which propels Olam to the top ranks of cocoa processors by volume alongside Barry Callebaut of Switzerland and US-based Cargill, aims to tap into growth in demand from emerging market consumers for chocolate-based products.The cocoa processing industry turns beans into cocoa butter and powder, used in mass-market products such as Nestle’s Milo drink and Unilever ice cream in countries such as Indonesia, where consumers’ purchasing power is increasing.“It’s a growing middle class play,” said Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Olam, in which Singapore’s state investment company Temasek holds a 58.4 per cent stake.The ADM deal will add processing and marketing facilities, as well as deZaan — a brand rival to Barry Callebaut, the world’s biggest cocoa processor — to Olam’s cocoa growing business.Gerard Manley, global head of cocoa for Olam, said: “We believe that cocoa and chocolate are on the up, and that there will be a shortfall of processing capacity because of the demand that we’re seeing.”Cocoa prices reached three-year highs earlier this year, helped by rising demand from Asia’s growing middle classes, who are expected to help push global confectionery sales to a record this year at almost $200bn.The move by Olam into the processing of cocoa rather than just growing cocoa beans for sale to others mirrors similar moves made by the Singapore-listed company in coffee, where it makes instant coffee from beans that it grows.Olam described the deal as “transformational” but added that it did not foresee further large acquisitions next year. It said the purchase — $550m in fixed assets and $750m in working capital — would be financed out of cash and existing debt facilities, with no fresh equity needed.Olam is more than 18 months into a restructuring plan aimed at cutting debt and boosting cash flow, following a broadside by US short seller Muddy Waters. It accused the group of shoddy accounting, building an unsustainable debt pile and poorly managed acquisitions.The company was slow to recover from the 2012 short seller attack in spite of the support of Temasek, after an offer by the investor to acquire more shares earlier this year.Mr Verghese said the combination of Olam’s existing cocoa business with that of ADM would help minimise the impact of market volatility.“We believe that with this acquisition we have got the full complement of skills and we can extract a lot more value from the network of assets,” Mr Verghese said.Olam, which was advised by JPMorgan, said it expected the business to add to earnings and free cash flow by 2016.ADM has sold assets this year, including the September disposal of its chocolate business to Cargill for $440m. In April, it sold a fertiliser business in Brazil and Paraguay to Mosaic.Meanwhile, the Chicago-based company has pushed into businesses it believes will be less vulnerable to the swings of commodity markets. In October, it purchased Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company, for €2.3bn, the largest acquisition in its 112-year history.
97;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-12-05T22:49:54Z;ADM boosts stake in food commodities rival Wilmar;Chicago-based group pays $147m to increase its holding in Singapore company to 17.3%;Archer Daniels Midland has increased its stake in Wilmar International of Singapore as the food commodities giant tries to move more volumes outside its historic US base.Chicago-based ADM paid S$194m ($147m) for an additional 60m shares of Wilmar, boosting its stake from 16.4 per cent to 17.3 per cent, according to a securities filing Friday. It bought the shares from Martua Sitorus, Wilmar executive deputy chairman and an associate of Kuok Khoon Hong, chief executive.Wilmar controls about 45 per cent of production and trade in palm oil, the most widely used vegetable oil found in products from biscuits to shampoo. It is controlled by the Kuok family of Malaysia.The two companies’ relationship dates to their days operating soyabean crushing joint ventures in China. ADM later converted its stake in the ventures into equity in Wilmar. Juan Luciano, ADM’s incoming chief executive, sits on Wilmar’s board.In February, Mr Kuok said of a potential deal between the two companies: “We’ll get married one day.” He later added: “But unless conditions for marriage are good, we’ll just work closely with each other. So far we have not found the right conditions”.ADM is among the handful of global companies that specialise in buying grain and oilseeds from farmers in surplus regions such as Brazil and the US and selling them in countries that are net importers, such as China. Grain shipments destined for use as animal feed are growing at an especially fast pace into eastern Asia, where consumers want more meat as their incomes rise.News of the increased stake comes days after ADM disclosed plans to double its worldwide grain handling volumes. While the bigger stake is not directly related to that goal, Wilmar is ADM’s top customer, particularly in soyabeans.“Our investment in Wilmar is one of the ways in which we are benefiting from growing consumer demand in Asia. Wilmar — Asia’s leading agribusiness — is a strategic partner and one of our largest customers,” ADM said.We’ll get married one dayWilmar was not immediately available for comment.In June, ADM took full ownership of Alfred C Toepfer International by purchasing the remaining 20 per cent of the German trading house it did not already own for $157m. It also holds a near 20 per cent stake in GrainCorp of Australia, after Canberra blocked a takeover bid late last year.Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, said it was pursuing a “capital-light” strategy and “expanding its distribution and destination markets” as it sought to double its grain handling business in four to seven years.
98;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-11-28T09:20:06Z;Louis Dreyfus appoints Mayo Schmidt as chief executive;Commodity house brings in former Viterra head amid governance shift;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, has appointed Mayo Schmidt as its chief executive.Mr Schmidt is a former head of Viterra, the Canadian-based grain trader acquired by Glencore in 2012.The appointment of a chief executive from outside the company marks a further shift towards a public-style corporate structure and will fuel speculation that Dreyfus, as the company is known, is preparing for a flotation.The privately owned company, which along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill dominates the world’s commodity food flows, has been altering its business model and operations so they are more closely aligned with those of a publicly listed company.This year Dreyfus, the world’s largest rice and raw-cotton trader, appointed three members to the supervisory board, including the chairman of Syngenta, the crop chemical group.The 163-year-old company has also been investing heavily to increase its size and keep pace with its competitors in the global agribusiness industry. China is becoming an increasingly assertive force in global food commodities, with China National Cereals, Oil and Foodstuffs Corp (Cofco) recently taking controlling stakes in foreign food trading companies.“This is an important step in the transition project we launched in June 2013, to further reinforce our management structure and governance model,” said Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, controlling shareholder and chairperson, the widow of former head Robert Louis-Dreyfus.The company has been searching for a new chief executive since Ciro Echesortu announced he would step down in June.“It is a great honour to be joining this 163-year-old group, which has become a synonym for excellence in the global agribusiness industry,” Mr Schmidt, 57, who has dual American/Canadian citizenship.Mr Schmidt, a fitness fanatic who once played professional football for the Miami Dolphins, oversaw the expansion of Viterra from a regional co-operative to a $6.1bn company. He will take up his new job in January. It is unclear whether he will remain on the board of Agrium, the Canadian fertiliser group.“He is seen as having done a good job during his 12 years at Viterra and he has experience of running a public company,” noted an industry executive. However, Mr Schmidt was criticised for telling a Canadian television station that Viterra was not a takeover target just hours before the company admitted it had received expressions of interest.Sources close to Dreyfus said it had looked at 30 candidates, which was reduced to a short list of three. They said while the company had a lot of internal talent none currently had experience to take on the top job.Mr Schmidt’s appointment is the latest change at the top of leading agribusiness. Earlier this month, ADM named Juan Luciano as its new chief executive, while David MacLennan has been in charge of Cargill for just a year.In the six months to June, Dreyfus reported net income before tax of $315m in the six months to June, up from $287m in the same period a year earlier, helped by strong performances in coffee and cotton. Sales rose 16 per cent to $33.7bn.
99;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-11-06T11:13:04Z;Juan Luciano named new chief of Archer Daniels Midland;Luciano to take reins of US agricultural trader in January;Archer Daniels Midland has named Juan Luciano as its new chief executive, effective January next year, succeeding Patricia Woertz.Mr Luciano, who joined ADM in 2011 and currently serves as chief operating officer, will be the first foreign-born chief executive at the US trading company.He will take the helm of the leading US agricultural trader at a time when it is trying to widen its footprint and focus on higher margin businesses in a set of strategic moves set in motion by Ms Woertz, who will remain as chairman until May 2016.Along with other international agribusinesses including Cargill, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus, ADM dominates the flow of agricultural commodities around the world, moving corn, soyabeans and wheat.Facing the vagaries of weather, transport and government policies, the agricultural traders have been looking to even out their performances by expanding geographically and diversifying their operations.ADM tried to expand its trading footprint last year with the attempted acquisition of GrainCorp of Australia for A$3.4bn (US$3.1bn at the time), but Canberra blocked the deal on national interest grounds.Earlier this year, ADM purchased Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company, for €2.3bn, its largest acquisition in its 112-year history. More recently, it announced the acquisition of Harrell Nut Company, one of the largest sellers and processors of pecans in the US.Meanwhile, the US group sold its chocolate manufacturing business to Cargill for $440m in September and its Latin American fertiliser distribution business to Mosaic of the US for $350m.Mr Luciano, who has been widely regarded as a likely successor to Ms Woertz, worked at Dow Chemical and holds and an industrial engineering degree from the Buenos Aires Institute of Technology.The announcement of his appointment comes after ADM this week reported a strong rise in quarterly profits thanks to its corn processing business. The company said net earnings for the third quarter jumped 72 per cent to $747m, or $1.14 a share, up from a year ago.The Illinois-based company saw tumbling corn prices and strong ethanol demand push up margins for its corn processing operations. These more than offset the impact of flat results in its oilseeds business, which was affected by slower farmer selling in South America.
100;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-10-28T16:51:06Z;Cofco unveils IPO plans to compete with US agribusinesses;Chinese state-owned grain trader says proposed joint venture listing may take three years;Cofco, the Chinese state-owned grain trader, on Tuesday sought to ensure that it can compete with leading US agribusinesses by unveiling plans for an initial public offering in assets including those acquired from Nidera of the Netherlands and Hong Kong’s Noble Group.Cofco hopes the move to a stock market listing for some of its international assets will put it on a par with US companies that dominate the world grain trade, including Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus.It could also enable China, via Cofco, to secure more grain from overseas directly, reducing the country’s reliance on international traders that ship commodities to its ports.Cofco has invested about $3bn this year, buying controlling stakes in Nidera, a grain trader, and the agribusiness of Noble, another commodities group.These assets, and potentially other Cofco businesses, will be put into an international joint venture that would pursue an IPO.Frank Ning, Cofco chief executive, said the joint venture would be a vertically integrated agribusiness rather than a simple grain trader. It would be able to supply seeds to farmers spread across the world, as well as buy, store and ship their grain.After the Nidera and Noble deals, Cofco’s annual revenues are expected to reach $63.3bn, although this would amount to less than half of Cargill’s sales.Explaining why it may take three years to complete the listing of Cofco’s proposed joint venture, Mr Ning said: “We have to be one company. One, single, diverse and also centrally-managed company. It takes time.”Cofco does not envisage any more major acquisitions while it digests this year’s expansion, Mr Ning added, although he did not rule out purchases by either Nidera or Noble “to supplement their networks”.The move by China to tap more grain from overseas, partly through Cofco, highlights a shift in priorities for Beijing.Rising incomes and richer diets have collided with a shortage of arable land and clean water, prompting the world’s second-largest economy to partly abandon its traditional policy of self sufficiency in grain.China is already the world’s top importer of soyabeans, used as feed for livestock, snapping up the lion’s share of this harvest from the US, Brazil and Argentina.Chinese bureaucrats have an uneasy relationship with international grain traders that bring commodities into China, with some harbouring fears that they wield too much pricing power.Listing Cofco’s joint venture could mean a further complication for its holdings. It has five listed units in Hong Kong, including soy trader China Agri-Industries Holdings, food and beverage arm China Foods and dairy company Mengniu Dairy.Cofco has not specified whether any of those units would ultimately be folded into the joint venture.The structure of the joint venture faces complexity. For the Nidera and Noble deals, Cofco teamed up with an investment consortium consisting of Chinese private equity firm Hopu Investment, Singapore state-owned asset manager Temasek, Standard Chartered’s private equity arm and International Finance Corp, the for-profit investment arm of the World Bank.
101;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-10-07T18:51:18Z;Cargill sees net profits fall 25% in Q1 amid scarcity of soyabeans;;Cargill, the agricultural trading house, reported a 26 per cent fall in net profit in its first quarter as a scarcity of soyabeans kept the US company’s processing plants scrambling for supplies.Net earnings in the privately held company’s first quarter ending on August 31 were $425m, compared to $571m in the same period last year.The quarter ended at the same time the US counted its lowest inventories of soyabeans in four decades. This increased the price processors had to pay farmers for the oilseed, which is used to make products such as vegetable oil and feed meal for pigs and chickens.Cargill cited “lower soyabean crush volumes and limited farmer selling in some countries” in explaining its results.The world is now on the cusp of record harvests of grain and oilseeds. This promises to refill granaries and allow processors and traders such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus Commodities to run plants at full speed and store cheap excess grain until prices rise.David MacLennan, Cargill chief executive, said: “This year’s big crops, not just in North America, but across agricultural production areas worldwide, will enhance food security after several years of weather disruptions. Our company is well positioned to connect these new supplies to growing demand.”With revenues of $134.9bn in 2013-14, Minnesota-based Cargill is one of the largest private companies in the world. It is central to the global food supply, using a vast network of ships, silos and warehouses to shuttle wheat, corn, oilseeds, cocoa and other commodities to customers in 125 countries.Cargill’s executives have previously expressed dissatisfaction with performance at the sprawling company, which next year will become 150 years old.Cargill reported revenue of $33.3bn in the first quarter of its financial year, down 2 per cent compared to the same period last year.Mr MacLennan noted the “great deal of geopolitical uncertainty” in the first quarter. In June, Cargill halted operations at its sunflower seed processing plant in Donetsk, the separatist rebel stronghold in east Ukraine.Its business has also been affected by currency volatility and shifting economic policies in Venezuela, where it sells foods from pasta to sugar, and Argentina, a leading grain exporter.Operating earnings from Cargill’s food ingredients division fell in the first quarter, as weaker economic conditions in some markets reduced sales volumes.Cargill is also active in bulk and energy commodities. What it called an “erratic” market in certain large vessels hit the company’s ocean shipping trading, while China’s tightening credit markets reduced demand for iron ore and steel – hurting performance in Cargill’s metals business.The company previously announced an exit from its coal and European gas and power markets. The residual energy business – in oil and North American gas and power – recorded a rebound in the first quarter.
102;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-09-30T01:09:50Z;Coffee boosts Louis Dreyfus profits;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, has reported a 10 per cent increase in income before tax, helped by strong performances in coffee and cotton.The privately owned company, which along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill dominates the world’s commodity food flows, said net income before tax had risen to $315m in the six months to June, up from $287m in the same period a year earlier.Sales rose 16 per cent to $33.7bn, while net income after tax was flat at $260m. Dreyfus said shipped volumes had increased 6 per cent on the year, while return on equity was 11 per cent.Claude Ehlinger, the company’s interim chief executive, said each division had made solid contributions, with its merchant operations “seizing market opportunities”, and its distribution and production arm benefiting from improved processing margins.“Our business model, based on a broad and geographically diversified portfolio, enabled us to deliver good performance and increase our volume,” Mr Ehlinger said.Dreyfus has been investing heavily to increase its size and keep pace with its competitors in the global agribusiness industry. It is also reorganising its business model and operations so they are more closely aligned with those of a publicly listed company, although it has no plans to seek a stock market listing.Earlier this year Dreyfus, the world’s largest rice and raw-cotton trader, launched a search for a new chief executive to replace Mr Ehlinger. It has drawn up a short list of candidates and expects to make an appointment by the end of the year, said people familiar with the process.Global grain traders have experienced several difficult years. However, 2014 promises bumper crops and greater trading and storage opportunities for commodity traders.Dreyfus reported strong profits from oilseeds, boosted by high crop volumes, while US exports boosted its performance in cotton. Coffee, one of the few agricultural commodities not blighted by record or near-record crops, was another bright spot.The company also reported a significant increase in volumes shipped by its metals platform, an area where it is seeking to grow.
103;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-09-23T18:24:52Z;Commodities: Cereal excess;Global grain supplies are soaring, which will cause an eventual slowing of food price inflation;Towering like a missile above the Illinois prairie town of Monticello, the galvanised metal silo that Topflight Grain Co-operative has just added to its storage complex can hold an awful lot of corn: 19,000 tonnes.Yet after a mild, wet summer – perfect for growing chunky ears of yellow corn – the extra space may not be enough. Derrick Bruhn, Topflight’s grain merchandiser, warns some of it will end up piled high in outdoor mounds as farmers dump their harvests.“It will be difficult to find a place to put everything,” he says.Illinois is at the centre of an astonishing rebound in global grain supplies. After almost a decade of shortfalls and price rises, agricultural commodities have declined to the cheapest in four years. The new abundance will have broad effects, weakening incomes of farmers and companies that supply them, fattening profit margins at food and biofuel companies and – eventually – slowing food price inflation for consumers in rich and poor countries alike.As the largest agricultural exporter, the US sets the direction for world markets, traders say. Illinois and other states in America’s Midwestern “corn belt” are on track to produce a record US corn harvest for a second consecutive year. The soyabean crop will also be the largest ever, the government predicts.This bounteous picture extends across the northern hemisphere. In Canada stocks of wheat, oats and barley have doubled from a year ago after huge crops on its western plains. Europe’s wheat and corn crops are forecast to break records.Even the crisis between Russia and Ukraine has not hurt their standing in global grain markets. Despite banning food imports last month, Russia has been loading ships with massive exports of wheat and barley. Ukraine’s farmers, hungry for dollars, are also eager sellers of corn and wheat, executives say.And China plans to add 50m tonnes of storage facilities by next year as it struggles with brimming inventories of corn and rice, according to the state-run China Daily newspaper.“All of a sudden you’ve got great crops all over,” says Abdolreza Abbassian, senior grains economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome. World stocks of cereals next year will be equal to 25 per cent of annual global consumption, the highest such ratio since 2003, the FAO estimates. Soft grain prices have helped push commodity indices to five-year lows.The flush supply situation is a striking reversal from recent history. In 2007-08 low stocks ignited furious price rises and food riots in dozens of countries from Haiti to India. Russia’s cereals export ban, declared in August 2010 during a devastating heatwave, again raised grain prices to levels that some scholars say contributed to the Arab spring uprisings the following year. And in 2012 the worst drought since the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s scorched the US corn belt.The swing towards surplus is all the more remarkable because many of the long-term trends that strain food supplies persist. The world population continues to grow and consumers in developing countries are eating more grain-fed meat. Biofuel refiners are pumping out plenty of ethanol, though they have throttled back their once-headlong pace of expansion. Climate change is making weather extremes more frequent, endangering crop yields.But even when difficult weather returns – and indeed, odds slightly favour the El Niño pattern that is associated with extreme conditions – the large crops of 2013 and 2014 will leave a lasting legacy. With stocks replenished from critically low levels, the world has a cushion against the next supply shock.“Stocks are like insurance. You keep them for the bad times,” says José Cuesta, senior economist at the World Bank. “They also have a psychological effect. It gives optimism to the markets. I think right now a certain optimism is settling into international markets.”A year ago the corn and soyabean stocks in Topflight’s silo network had dwindled to 100,000 bushels (2,540 tonnes), Mr Bruhn says. Ahead of the harvest now under way, stocks have been rebuilt to 200,000 bushels despite robust demand from the industrial-scale food processing plants operated by the Archer Daniels Midland and Tate & Lyle companies in nearby Decatur.Mr Bruhn says Topflight’s silos will hold 1.5m bushels by early September 2015. Much of it will remain there. “We can carry it three or four years,” he says.“Carry”, an old grain merchants’ term embraced by financial traders, has returned to agricultural markets with a vengeance. Two years ago corn futures for December 2012 delivery were fetching $1.50 a bushel more than corn to be delivered this December – giving traders reason to sell, not store, their inventories.This week, December 2014 corn was 68 cents cheaper than corn delivered in December 2016. Simply holding on to the corn until then will make easy money for anyone with access to affordable storage. This is one reason shares of companies such as ADM and Bunge, each with extensive grain-handling networks, have outperformed the US stock market since June. A large grain volume “allows us to pick up inputs at a fairly attractive price, and with low interest rates, the cost to finance inventories is very inexpensive,” says Ray Young, ADM’s chief financial officer.…It is a truism often heard in commodity markets: high prices are the best cure for high prices. And the price of grain has been high.Corn surpassed $8 a bushel in July 2012, a time when US fields were baked by record heat. In 2005 the average corn price was $2. Wheat hit $9 in 2012, up from $3 seven years earlier.Farmers took the cue. Globally, land cultivated in corn, soyabeans or wheat rose 11 per cent to 514m hectares between 2005-13, according to FAO statistics. In the US farmers planted record soyabean acreage this spring, an area larger than Finland or Malaysia. Environmentalists note some of this land was previously wildlife habitat.In the county of Divide, North Dakota, on the US border with Canada, farmers are planting five times as much corn as a decade ago despite its extremely short growing season.“We’re as far north as you can get,” says Cliff Orgaard, executive director at the federal Farm Service Agency for the county. “Demand for corn had been rising pretty steadily because of ethanol and feed and livestock prices, so producers up here wanted to try it.”Yields – a measure of productivity – have been unpredictable in recent years as weather extremes offset technological advances such as self-steering tractors and biotech seeds. US soyabean yields peaked in 2009 at 44 bushels per acre, subsequently contracting as much as a 10th. This year soyabean yields will leap to about 46.6 bushels per acre.Mr Young of ADM says: “I believe in the law of averages – in reversion to the mean. We had a few years of US yields that were significantly below trend. When I looked at the trend line, I was actually expecting at some juncture we’re going to have a home run in the United States.”Viewed over a longer time horizon, climate change has begun to diminish wheat and maize (corn) yields, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found. The National Climate Assessment report published for the US government warns of “increased uncertainty” for production totals. “Recent analysis suggests that climate change has an outsized influence on year-to-year swings in corn prices in the United States,” the assessment says.While it might appear surprising, this year’s bumper US growing season has been consistent with climate projections, says Gene Takle of Iowa State University, a lead co-author of the climate assessment. States such as Iowa had heavy springtime rains, a regular feature of recent years. While rains can delay planting and cause erosion, moister soils also enable farmers to fit more corn stalks per acre, boosting yields.“It’s doubtful in my mind that if we had the climate of the 1940s and 50s and 60s, whether these high populations could survive,” Prof Takle says.What this summer lacked was the temperature extremes of recent years. Hot nights hurt corn yields in 2010 and 2012. “The extremes don’t happen that often but they are happening more often now than they were 30 years ago. Those trends are still in place,” Prof Takle says. “We’re seeing more of those, interspersed with a few very good years like we’re having now.”When extremes next damage grain crops is anyone’s guess. A brutal drought damaged Brazil’s coffee trees this year but spared its corn and soyabean crops, the biggest in the southern hemisphere.Still, the belief that future shortfalls will be offset by abundant stocks appears to be widespread. Governments in the Middle East – big buyers of wheat from the Black Sea region – are locking in supplies only three to six months ahead, barely extending purchases despite lower prices, says a trading industry executive. “They know that supply is there,” he says. “Nobody is going a year out.”…At Tyson Foods, a US-based beef, pork and chicken producer, the feed grain buying strategy will not change. “You’re going to have a favourable grain environment,” Donnie Smith, chief executive, said recently.Analysts are starting to rethink assumptions. Earlier this year the US Department of Agriculture projected China would overtake Japan as the world’s top importer of corn in 2020.Since then China’s corn imports have stalled. Shipments from the US virtually ended after Beijing claimed they contained a genetic trait not yet approved inside the country. Fred Gale, a USDA senior economist, says: “It’s puzzling. One of the questions we’re grappling with now is whether this is a blip or if this narrative of China needing to import is going ‘poof’.”Another piston of grain demand in recent years has been biofuels. Spurred by government mandates and high oil prices, the amount of US corn refined into ethanol climbed from 1.6bn bushels in 2005 to more than 5bn this year. That market survives, but its future is in question as the White House plans cuts to consumption targets.For farmers in the corn belt, the prospect of higher supplies and lower prices is unsettling.“The last few years have been the golden age of farming,” says Terry Lieb, who farms 3,000 acres outside Monticello with his two sons. “But farming, if you’ve been in it very long, it all goes in cycles. Now it’s turned to a down cycle again. It’s going to get tough again for a few years.”——————————————-Poverty: Lower food prices are no panacea for the poorSurges in the international price of staple grains have led to food riots over the past decade. But the recent fall in cereals prices is not necessarily a blessing for poorer countries, a new working paper from the World Bank has found.In the short run, rises in global food prices tend to increase poverty because a large portion of poor people’s income is spent on food. Even many farming households are net buyers of food.However, “higher food prices appear to lower global poverty in the long run”, because they raise wages for unskilled workers and encourage farmers to boost output. And evidence suggests that lower food prices increase poverty in the long term, says Will Martin, a research manager at the World Bank and co-author of the paper.The findings illustrate the tangled effects of the lowest cereals prices in four years.Consumers will see food-price inflation moderate. Grain prices will fall in real terms over the coming decade, according to an outlook by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the OECD. Because of strong demand, however, meat prices will on average cost more than in the previous decade, the organisations say.For farmers, the new global grain surplus brings winners and losers. After enjoying the highest real incomes in 40 years, US farmers’ profits will decline this year, the US Department of Agriculture estimates. But livestock revenues will climb as herd shortages brought on by drought and disease keep meat prices high.Weaker farmer incomes will translate into lower land rental costs and pressure on sales of fertiliser and equipment. John Deere, the tractor and equipment maker, has announced more than 1,000 redundancies.“If they’re not buying, we’re not building,” says Lucas DeSpain of the United Auto Workers’ union, representing Deere harvester employees in East Moline, Illinois.
104;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-09-15T12:48:20Z;A company’s headquarters should be aligned with its heart;A company that stays close to its roots sends a powerful signal about what it values;"Every time I hear about a company relocating its headquarters I think of the Marvin Gaye song “Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home)”. A hit for Paul Young in a 1983 cover version, its hummable melody cloaks an unattractive sentiment, voiced by someone with dubious motives.The latest bout of corporate shape-shifting has been triggered by fears that a vote for Scottish independence would spread uncertainty to businesses based in Scotland. Last week Royal Bank of Scotland and others said they would relocate southwards in the event of a Yes. Scottish nationalists accused the banks of scaremongering and claimed the threat was not material. RBS would shift its registered office, but its operational HQ on the outskirts of Edinburgh, where more than 3,000 people work, would stay put.The Yes campaigners have a point. A registered office is just a legal postbox with a person behind it. Whether the brass plate is in Bishopsgate in the City of London (where RBS has its London base), or, for that matter, in Boston or Bermuda, it need not affect the company’s operations. Scots should be grateful the RBS contingency plan is not based on the one Bank of Montreal enacted when separatists put the future of Quebec as part of Canada in similar doubt in the 1970s. The bank moved most of its operational head office functions to Toronto, leaving its registered office and branches behind in hollowed-out Montreal.Yet nationalists are also right to be scared. The address of your headquarters still matters and for the same reason it always has: as a symbol of what is important to your company.Manufacturers used to base their executive decision makers near their factories. As newfangled financial engineering took precedence over the old-fashioned mechanical type, and politicking and lobbying increased in importance, companies shifted their head offices to places where they could do those things more efficiently, such as London, New York or Tokyo. Tax “inversions”, where fiscal advantage drives corporate transactions, are the purest expression of this trend of finding a convenient peg on which to hang the corporate hat.Asked if they are considering relocation, companies always respond that it would be irresponsible for any board not to review the possibility regularly. Plenty of modern, networked groups argue they barely need a central hub, where complacency and bureaucracy can flourish. But with the exception of consultancies and accountancy groups, which cultivate a sort of globish facelessness, nobody makes a virtue of being homeless. The trend has gone far enough.When Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural company, last month took its head office from Decatur to Chicago, 180 miles north, Patricia Woertz, the chief executive, argued the city was “the best location to provide efficient access to global markets while maintaining our close connections with US farmers, customers and operations”. The abundance of skilled staff there was also a factor. As it happens, Decatur had benefited from an earlier ADM move, in 1969, from the company’s home in Minneapolis. But I still feel ADM – and Decatur – lost something in the process.With modern communications technology, it should be easier for companies to resist the gravitational pull of the big cities, and make headquarters decisions on grounds other than mere efficiency.A company that stays close to its roots sends a powerful signal about what it values and what its suppliers and customers should value. Retailer Walmart’s determination to stay in Bentonville, Arkansas, is the most obvious example.It is, of course, possible to have a registered office in one place – a venue for an occasional board or shareholder meeting – and the operational head office in another, as RBS would have under its contingency plan. Multinationals should bind themselves to all the communities where they operate.But when Gaye sang that he was “the type of guy who gives the girl the eye . . . I love them and I leave them, break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go”, he might have been describing the cold expediency with which many companies choose their headquarters at the expense of their “heart-quarters”. Directors and investors should ask themselves, instead: where is the beat that keeps this company alive and if we aren’t meeting there, why not?andrew.hill@ft.com

105;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-09-12T19:44:58Z;Cargill sues Syngenta over seed dispute;;Cargill, one of the largest suppliers of agricultural products and food, is seeking damages from Syngenta in a state court in the US over a biotech seed it claims has almost brought the country’s corn trade with China to a halt.Late last year, China started to turn away imports of US corn on the grounds they could contain a genetically modified seed that had not been approved for use in the country.The product called Agrisure Viptera had been developed by Syngenta and was designed to protect crops from common pests.China’s decision affected commodities trading houses, including Archer Daniels Midland and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, whose cargoes were turned back. Total losses globally were in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In its court filing on Friday, Cargill said it had suffered losses of more than $90m.Cargill claims Syngenta’s decision to commercialise Viptera without gaining import approval from China has put the ability of the US agricultural industry to serve global markets “at risk” and had cost the industry a “significant” amount of money.It says a study by the National Grain and Feed Association shows that US exporters and farmers could have lost up to $2.9bn because of the Chinese import ban.“I want to be clear about this: Cargill is a supporter of innovation and the development of new GMO seed products,” said Dave Baudler, president of Cargill AgHorizons divisions. “But we take exception to Syngenta’s actions in launching the sale of new products . . . before obtaining import approval in key export markets for US crops.”On Friday Syngenta said it believed the lawsuit was without merit, and that it “strongly upholds the right of growers to have access to approved new technologies that can increase both their productivity and their profitability”.Corn with the Viptera trait was first planted in the US in 2011. Until China began turning away cargoes last autumn, a large amount of corn it imported from the US probably contained the trait.Several trading houses, including Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, are now refusing to accept another genetically modified seed developed by Syngenta called Agrisure Duracade.“Cargill believes that Syngenta continues to not accept its role in shared responsibility by moving ahead this year with the commercialisation of Duracade, which also is not approved in China and other key export markets,” Cargill said in a statement.As one of the world’s emerging corn import heavyweights, China’s stance on genetic modification has the potential to transform agricultural markets, according to analysts.Syngenta said: “[Agrisure Viptera trait MIR162] was approved for cultivation in the US in 2010. Syngenta commercialised the trait in full compliance with regulatory and legal requirements” and “obtained import approval from major corn importing countries”.The company said it had been fully transparent in commercialising the trait over the past four years. “During this time Agrisure Viptera has demonstrated major benefits for growers, preventing significant yield and grain quality losses resulting from damage by a broad spectrum of lepidopteran pests,” it added.US agribusinesses have salivated over the prospect of China becoming as big an importer of corn as it is of soyabeans. Hopes have been raised by China officially loosening its longstanding policy of grain self-sufficiency.But high domestic corn prices spurred China’s farmers to grow record corn crops of their own, leading to huge domestic surpluses. China’s corn imports from the US plummeted by 89 per cent to $40m in the first seven months of 2014 compared to the same period a year ago. US-produced dried distillers’ grains, a product of corn ethanol refining, have also been blocked at Chinese ports.
106;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Japan’s Ajinomoto to buy Windsor Quality for $800m;;Ajinomoto, Japan’s biggest seasoning maker, is to buy US frozen foods maker Windsor Quality Holdings for $800m in its biggest overseas acquisition.The deal is the latest in a string of cross-border purchases by Japanese food and beverage makers looking to expand their international reach as their home market stagnates.With the acquisition of privately owned Windsor, best known for ethnic brands including Ling Ling, José Olé and Bernardi, Ajinomoto said it hoped to increase its revenues from the North American frozen food market sevenfold to $940m by 2020.Texas-based Windsor’s products are found in 80,000 retailers and 120,000 restaurants in North America.Masatoshi Ito, Ajinomoto’s chief executive, said he wanted to tap into the US market and its growing demand for Asian and ethnic foods.Ajinomoto aims to raise the overseas make-up of its frozen food business, which comprises about 11 per cent of total revenue, from 13 per cent to 50 per cent within two years.Investors reacted positively to the deal, sending Ajinomoto’s shares up 1.4 per cent in Tokyo. Mr Ito said the $800m purchase price was equivalent to 10 times expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for next year, and that the deal will be financed by bank loans plus cash on hand.Windsor, founded in 2004, reported revenues of $670m last year, down 2.5 per cent from the previous year. The figure excludes Windsor’s sausage business, which Ajinomoto is not planning to buy.Excluding the Windsor deal, Ajinomoto has spent nearly $800m on overseas deals over the past decade, according to Dealogic, including the $238m purchase of Hong Kong-based Amoy Food Group from France’s Danone in 2006.Earlier this year, Ajinomoto lost a bidding war for Wild Flavors– a food and drinks flavour company backed by private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts – to Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based corn processor.“We’ll continue to broadly look for deals that are necessary for global growth and leadership in research and development,” Mr Ito said on Wednesday. Ajinomoto has previously said it is willing to spend about $3bn in acquisitions.Other Japanese companies in the sector have also been actively seeking growth abroad.In May, Japanese food company Mizkan bought Unilever’s North American pasta sauce brands, Ragu and Bertolli, for $2.15bn. This followed its 2012 purchase of the Branston pickle brand from Premier Foods for £92.5m.Other cross-border purchases include Suntory’s $16bn takeover of Beam, one of the biggest names in US whiskey, and its £1.35bn acquisition of consumer drinks brands Lucozade and Ribena from GlaxoSmithKline.
107;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-09-02T17:59:28Z;Cargill buys six chocolate plants from ADM;;Cargill, the agricultural commodities trader, has strengthened its presence in the cocoa and chocolate sector by buying the manufacturing operations from rival Archer Daniels Midland.The $440m deal comes a year after Cargill entered talks to purchase the whole cocoa business from ADM. However, negotiations were terminated earlier this year after the companies faced numerous antitrust hurdles as well as a disagreement over price.ADM is known in the industry for its chocolate that is sold in the wholesale market, and a potential deal, valued at about $2bn by industry executives, would have created the biggest company in the cocoa processing industry with a market share of about 35 per cent.In April, it abandoned efforts to sell the whole cocoa and chocolate business and instead put up for sale six of its chocolate manufacturing plants located in Canada, the US, Belgium, Germany and the UK.For ADM, which wanted a stronger focus on its grains and oilseeds businesses, the cocoa and chocolate operations were seen as a drag on return on capital. However, demand for cocoa has grown especially in emerging markets, giving the cocoa processing operations a lift.ADM will retain its cocoa press operations turning beans into cocoa butter and powder.Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive, said the company had considered “several options” to strengthen the returns of its cocoa operations.“The sale of the chocolate business helps improve ADM’s returns and will allow us to redeploy capital for higher-return investments,” she said.In a push for higher profit margins, the company in July agreed to buy Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for €2.3bn.For Cargill, the three plants in North America will boost its position in the world’s largest market for confectionery.Cargill said the acquisition would complement its existing chocolate business. “Cocoa and chocolate products have been key contributors to Cargill’s business since 1979,” said Jos de Loor, president Cargill Cocoa & Chocolate in Europe and Asia.
108;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-08-07T18:10:37Z;Cargill fourth-quarter profits fall 12% to cap challenging year;;Cargill has reported a 12 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits after the commodities trader was forced to book a loss stemming from changes to Venezuela’s complex foreign exchange rate system, and its energy business continued to struggle.Net income at Cargill dropped to $424m in the three months to May, down from $483m in the same period a year earlier, as the Minneapolis-based company revalued its Venezuelan assets to reflect a new exchange rate.Several other US corporations have also been hurt by Venezuela’s revamped exchange rate system, which some critics have called a backdoor devaluation.The decline in fourth-quarter profits contributed to a 19 per cent decrease in annual earnings to $1.87bn, a result the company’s chief executive, David MacLennan, said was “short of expectations”.The results cap a challenging year for Cargill, one of the biggest privately owned companies in the US, during which it has faced numerous headwinds.In grain trading, one of its core businesses, Cargill has been hampered by China’s decision to turn away shipments of US corn grown with an unapproved genetically modified trait. It has also faced reduced opportunities to make money by storing grain, while competing demand from crude oil traders has led to a shortage of railway tank wagons to transport the crop.On top of that, Cargill suffered a trading loss because of an “unprecedented price spike” in the US power markets in late January. That loss contributed to a 28 per cent drop in third-quarter profits.Cargill said the poor performance of its energy business had continued in the fourth quarter as the company, which closed its coal and European power and gas operations in March, cleaned out its trading book.However, earnings rose significantly in the company’s animal nutrition and protein division, as the benefits of recent acquisitions flowed through, and lower feed costs boosted its North American beef business.In response to weaker profits Mr MacLennan, who took the reins of the company in December 2013, has been attempting to make Cargill, which has interests ranging from grain silos in Canada to chicken farming in China, more agile and decisive.“We acknowledge 2014 wasn’t a year when we hit the ball out of the park,” Marcel Smits, Cargill’s chief financial officer, said. “But we feel quite good about our business going forward. We have taken a number of steps that will set us up for success in the future,” he said, citing a move to centralise back office functions and the introduction of a new software system.We are seeing very large crops in corn and wheat, also soyabeans. We are optimistic we are going to be paid a lot more for handling grain in North AmericaCargill leads a small group of companies that dominate flows of agricultural commodities. Last month, rival Archer Daniels Midland reported an increase in second-quarter profits, citing strong ethanol demand and a recovery in US grain exports.A good harvest worldwide this year is expected to boost profitability at international grain companies, allowing them to buy and store the crop at a cheaper price and sell it later in the year. The prospect of a bumper crop has already caused US corn and soyabean prices to drop sharply over the past three months.“We are seeing very large crops in corn and wheat, also soyabeans. We are optimistic we are going to be paid a lot more for handling grain in North America,” said Mr Smits.“Corn prices are getting into territory where it is more difficult for our customers to make money, so it will be interesting to see to what extent people will sit on inventory in anticipation of higher prices,” he added.Asked about Russia, where Cargill has invested more than $1bn since 1991, Mr Smits said it was too early to assess the impact of a decision to ban imports of a wide range of agricultural and food products.“Our business in Russia is primarily focused on producing goods in the local market as opposed to importing,” he said.Separately, Noble, one of Asia’s leading commodities trading houses, reported a 5 per cent rise in second-quarter profits to $65.8m as its metals and energy businesses recorded lower earnings.Additional reporting by Luc Cohen.

However revenues were lower than expected.A strong demand for ethanol and oilseed products drove the improved results, as well as a recovery in US grain export volumes, said Patricia Woertz, ADM chairman and chief executive.In a volatile retail sector, shares in Target fell 4 per cent to $58.02 after the retailer warned second-quarter profits would fall short of its earlier guidance as it takes a charge related to its December 2013 hacking of its customer database and retires debt.The Minneapolis-based company said it expected expenses related to the data breach to total $148m, which will be partially offset by $38m in an insurance payment.Target now expects second-quarter adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share, below earlier forecasts as high as $1. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of 90 cents per share in the quarter.The company added that “guests continue to spend cautiously and focus on value in the current environment”, adding to the retailer’s challenges ahead.In contrast, shares of Coach rose more than 4 per cent after the luxury handbag maker reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations.The company, which has struggled amid intensifying competition, said sales in the three months to June 28 declined 7 per cent to $1.14bn, while net income tumbled 66 per cent to $75m.Coach took $132m of charges in the quarter as executives work to turn it round and better compete with glossier contemporaries like Tory Burch, Kate Spade and the Michael Kors.Victor Luis, chief executive, noted the company had “laid the groundwork” to transform the retailer into a more upmarket destination in the US.“We are taking the key transformation actions to enable the strategic path forward, embarking on the execution phase of our journey,” Mr Luis said.The wheel of fortune also spun MGM Resorts International back in favour, as Las Vegas gambling revenues jumped.The casino operator swung back to a net income of $105.5m in the second quarter from a net loss of $93m a year ago on strong growth in its wholly-owned domestic resorts portfolio.The results beat estimates, as US casino revenue increased by 6 per cent. Diluted earnings per share rose to $0.21 from a loss of $0.19 in the second quarter of 2013.MGM shares fell 2 per cent to $25.88.Shares in Avis Budget Group rose 3 per cent to $59.62 after the car rental company raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, in light of rising prices and demand in North America.The company reported a net income of $74m during the quarter ending June 30, up 28 per cent from $58m during the same period last year.Shares in Cablevision dropped 7 per cent to $18.08 after it reported a loss of 21,000 customers, a decrease of 0.6 percent, in the quarter ending June 30.Net income during the period reached $94.2m, or 35 cent per share, down from $135m, or 51 cents per share, last year.Overall US equities were weaker in spite of the latest data showing the pace of expansion in the US service industry hit an eight and a half year high in July. The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,920.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent to 16,429.47. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7 per cent to 4,352.83.
110;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
111;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-08-05T13:00:57Z;US grain export recovery boosts ADM;;Strong ethanol demand and US grain exports pushed up second-quarter profits at Archer Daniels Midland despite hoarding by farmers in South America and weak oilseed results at affiliate Wilmar.The profit figures followed weaker than expected first-quarter results because of poorer margins and adverse winter weather affecting the grain operations of the international agricultural trader and commodities processor.A good grain harvest worldwide this year is expected to boost profitability at international grains companies, allowing them to buy and store the crop at a cheaper price to sell later in the year.“Today, the crops in North America and Europe are developing nicely, so we are preparing for what could be very large harvests,” said Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive.The company is also expected to make an announcement of the sale of its chocolates business in the third quarter and will complete the €2.3bn purchase of Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company, at the end of the third quarter or the fourth quarter.ADM said net earnings for the three months to June rose almost 2.5 times to $533m. This took the half-year earnings figure to $800m, almost double the $492m earned during the same period last year.“We capitalised on robust ethanol demand, a recovery of US grain export volumes and continuing strong demand for oilseeds products,” said Ms Woertz.Corn processing, ADM’s largest division, reported a 55 per cent rise in operating profits to $347m for the second quarter, thanks to a 45 per cent rise in biofuels to $141m and a 22 per cent increase in sweetener sales.Its oilseeds operations posted three-month operating profits of $327m, up 2 per cent, helped by a strong North American processing business. South American processing results were weaker because of “slower farmer selling”, while in Asia, Wilmar, the leading food oil processor in the region, reported lower results.Agricultural services jumped from $81m to $203m on a strong rise in the merchandising and handling business, which posted operating profits of $115m, compared with $14m the same time last year.

Now, like Monet, he is taking a knife to it. A big chunk of America Movil’s fixed line and mobile assets will go on the block in response to new regulations.French supermarket group Carrefour has also been shedding parts of its business. Indonesia and Malaysia have already gone. Now it is pulling out of India, having decided to shut its cash and carry stores there. India, despite the huge opportunity on offer, is a tough place for overseas retailers to make money.The sculptors behind the Lafarge-Holcim combination have been busy this week as they attempt to get their deal past the regulators. Planned asset disposals in Europe have been announced, but their strategy elsewhere, especially in Asia, will be more important.AbbVie’s proposed acquisition of Shire is at a much earlier stage. AbbVie increased its offer for the pharma group by 10 per cent. Shire’s board is still considering its response – can it push its American suitor into another increase?Life is more straightforward for Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural company. It has spent €2.3bn on Wild Flavors, a drinks flavouring specialist. Although it is a small bite for ADM it should improve the shape of its returns, which have been falling for years.Boeing is facing a potentially more worrying change to its corporate shape. For years the US Export-Import bank has been helping foreign buyers to purchase US made planes. But a report from Standard & Poor's suggested that if the ExIm Bank is not renewed by September 30, Boeing’s own financing arm will have to step in with support to the tune of $9bn.One company that should be considering a radical change to its corporate shape is Allianz. The German insurance group has done very nicely out of its 2000 purchase of bond fund manager Pimco. But as we argued in a Lex in-depth this week, the time has come to spin it off.Finally, the problems of an imperfect corporate structure were highlighted by Banco Espirito Santo, Portugal’s second-largest lender. Its share price has halved in a month on worries that debt problems further up the complex Espirito Santo group could infect the bank.For a deeper look at the clash between perfect organisation and artistry, tune in to Germany v Argentina on Sunday.Have a good weekend.Oliver Ralph, Deputy head of Lex
113;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Peabody leads miners lower;;The energy and mining sectors were among the worst performing on a listless Monday as broker Deutsche Bank cut its rating on Peabody Energy, the largest US coal miner, and warned that weaker currencies would weigh on many closely tracked mining companies.Coal miners, which have been hamstrung by the shift in energy production in the US, particularly to natural gas, as well as President Barack Obama’s push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, extended declines this year.“Upstream miners continue to be bogged down by China’s muted performance,” analyst Jorge Beristain said.“Weaker currencies have also robbed certain commodities of prior price-support arguments and it is a Mexican stand-off to see who shuts capacity first in met coal.”Coal constituted less than 40 per cent of power production in 2013 in the US compared to more than 50 per cent a decade earlier.The investment bank said Peabody, which tallied sales of $7bn in 2013, would struggle against “muted” coal prices, forecasting a 3 per cent sales decline this year.Shares in Peabody closed down 3.67 per cent to $16, after Mr Beristain lowered his rating to hold from buy and cut his price target to $19.Peabody has underperformed the broader energy sector since the beginning of the year, falling 17 per cent compared with a 12 per cent advance by the Dow Jones global energy index.Deutsche remained optimistic for some mining and energy businesses, including Consol Energy.Deutsche lowered its rating on Coeur Mining to hold from buy, sending its shares 5.28 per cent lower to $8.79. Consol shares fell 2.52 per cent to $44.55.BioDelivery Sciences shares jumped 8.92 per cent to $13.06 after the company said results from a late-stage experimental pain medication study met its primary goals.The announcement triggered a $10m payment from Endo International, which entered a partnership with BioDelivery in 2012 to develop the drug for chronic pain.Shares of Endo International declined 2.54 per cent to $67.50 after advancing earlier in the day.Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest food commodity traders and processors, said it would pay €2.3bn to acquire Wild Flavors, a Swiss-based drink flavours company backed by KKR.ADM said the all-cash deal should close by year-end, subject to regulatory approvals.The sellers include Dr Hans-Peter Wild – son of founder Rudolf Wild – who owns 65 per cent of the shares, and private equity shop KKR, which acquired a 35 per cent stake in the company in 2010.“Natural flavour and ingredients is one of the largest and fastest-growing consumer trends in both developed and emerging markets,” ADM chief executive Patricia Woertz said.The disposal highlights the increasing competition for deals in Europe as more companies consider acquisitions amid signs of economic recovery.

114;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-07-07T17:21:52Z;Archer Daniels Midland buys Wild Flavors for €2.3bn;;It is said you cannot buy good taste. Archer Daniels Midland is spending billions to prove the adage wrong.The company, one of the world’s biggest traders and processors of food commodities, said on Monday it had reached an agreement to purchase Wild Flavors, a speciality food and drinks flavour company backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for €2.3bn ($3.1bn).The acquisition is the largest in ADM’s 112-year history and will create a new division inside a company known for earning single-digit margins on about $90bn in revenue moving grain and soyabeans around the world and processing them into bulk flour, vegetable oil, syrup and biofuel.With Switzerland-based Wild, ADM is acquiring a company with €1bn in revenue that develops ingredients for beverages such as the Monster energy drink. Its profit margins, measured as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) as a percentage of sales, are in the mid-teens and sales growth is about 8-10 per cent per year, ADM said. While ADM customers are primarily large food companies, Wild’s 3,000 customers are more entrepreneurial.The deal comes as agricultural trading houses such as ADM, Bunge and Cargill have struggled with uneven performance. The business of handling bulk food commodities is subject to the vagaries of weather, transport and government policies on matters from biofuels to genetically modified crops.ADM tried to expand its trading footprint last year with the attempted acquisition of GrainCorp of Australia for A$3.4bn (US$3.2bn), but Canberra blocked the deal on national interest grounds.Now, ADM is expanding in a different direction, broadening its existing product line of proteins, vitamins and other speciality ingredients.Acquisition of specialist flavourings group is not about cost-cuttingContinue reading“The last platform and the piece of the total package that we have not offered to date is taste, and taste is king,” Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive, told analysts. The company said it would create a new division called Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients that combines the two businesses.In the all-cash deal, ADM will pay €2.2bn to acquire Wild and will assume net debt of about €100m. ADM shares rose 1.5 per cent to $46.44 in New York.Wild was founded in the German city of Heidelberg in 1931 but is now headquartered in the Swiss city of Zug. Hans-Peter Wild, son of founder Rudolf Wild, owns 65 per cent of the company.Private equity group KKR acquired a 35 per cent stake in 2010 and at the sale price has made more than three times its initial investment, said a person with knowledge of the investment.The acquisition highlights growing competition for deals in Europe as more companies consider takeovers amid signs of economic recovery.Despite access to cheap debt financing for acquisitions, private equity groups are finding it hard to compete with trade buyers, which can typically offer cost savings.ADM paid more than 16 times Wild’s 2014 projected ebitda of €140m, people close to the transaction said. Ray Young, ADM chief financial officer, said ebitda would be about €160-€165m in 2015.ADM outbid Ajinomoto, the Japanese food seasoning company, in what turned into a bidding war between the two strategic buyers which had beat out other private equity groups including Sweden’s EQT.Barclays acted as financial adviser to ADM on the acquisition.

115;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM / Wild Flavors: a natural fit;Acquisition of specialist flavourings group is not about cost-cutting;If you are what you eat, then drinking well seems obvious. Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural company, on Monday acquired Wild Flavors, the natural beverage flavouring specialist, for €2.3bn including net debt. Wild will accelerate ADM’s shift towards food supplements businesses. ADM has promised a dieting period to follow: €100m of cost savings by 2017.But this acquisition is not about cost cutting. Wild – the number six player in flavourings worldwide with €1bn in sales – will nearly double the size of ADM’s speciality ingredients sales to €2.5bn. This purchase adds beverage flavouring and ADM plans to create an entirely separate flavourings division.Most important, profit margins at Wild are significantly higher than those at ADM’s existing food supplements businesses. ADM had decided to allocate more capital to their ingredients area to improve the groups’ declining return on capital. Good thing. Return on invested capital (equity plus net debt) for ADM has halved since 2008 to 6 per cent, roughly equal to its cost of capital. For example, Givaudan and Symrise, global leaders in flavours and fragrances, have returns twice as high as ADM. The addition of Wild’s better margins and growth should help revive ADM’s moribund profitability.The deal looks reasonably priced. Givaudan and Symrise trade at an enterprise value to sales multiple of three times, higher than the 2.3 times paid by ADM. Also, ADM has paid 14 times next year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – a small premium to both Givaudan and Symrise.Wild seems a mere morsel for ADM, which is valued at $30bn. Management promises a consistent 8-10 per cent sales growth rate in flavours that will help lift overall profits. If they deliver, Wild will have proven a tasty titbit.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
116;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;ADM goes head to head with Ajinomoto for Wild Flavors;;Archer Daniels Midland, a US-based corn processor, and Ajinomoto, a Japanese producer of seasonings and curry sauces, have emerged as the last remaining bidders for Wild Flavors, a Swiss-based drink flavours company backed by KKR, in moves underscoring companies’ growing appetite for cross-border acquisitions.The two groups have submitted bids valuing the Zug-based company at more than €2bn including debt, against the €1.5bn-€2bn price tag the owners initially expected, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.ADM and Ajinomoto have trumped offers from private equity groups including Stockholm-based EQT Partners, they said. Swiss flavours and fragrances company Givaudan submitted a bid that was not retained, partly because a merger with Wild would have resulted in cost-cutting measures, according to one of them.ADM processes crops including oilseeds, wheat and cocoa to produce ingredients for food and animal feed. A spokesperson for the company, based in Decatur, Illinois, could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Ajinomoto, which is headquartered in Tokyo, could not be contacted outside normal business hours.Wild, which was founded in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1931, makes natural flavours, ingredients and systems for the food and beverage industry. Hans-Peter Wild, who is the son of founder Rudolf Wild, owns 65 per cent of the shares. KKR acquired a 35 per cent stake in the company in 2010.The disposal highlights the growing competition for deals in Europe as more companies consider acquisitions amid signs of economic recovery.Two of the people with knowledge of the talks over Wild said they expected Ajinomoto to win the deal because of its previous interest in the Diana process. The Japanese company operates in 26 countries and generates about €9bn in revenuesDespite having access to cheap debt financing for acquisitions, private equity fund managers are finding it hard to compete with aggressive trade buyers, which typically can offer cost synergies.The sale of Wild comes just months after Symrise, a German aroma chemicals maker, agreed to buy Diana Ingredients, a French pet food ingredients maker. The deal valued the Brittany-based company at €1.3bn including debt – more than its private equity owner Ardian had expected.Ajinomoto competed for Diana Ingredients before deciding to focus on Wild, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Private equity funds including Blackstone, CVC Capital Partners and BC Partners were outbid in the Diana process.Two of the people with knowledge of the talks over Wild said they expected Ajinomoto to win the deal because of its previous interest in the Diana process.

117;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-06-08T07:58:58Z;Maize price decline and export rise fire optimism of ethanol refiners;Refiners are finding faraway markets amid fears of a biofuel mandate cut;For a sector on the defensive, US ethanol producers are remarkably sanguine.Motor fuel consumption is stagnating inside the US. For the first time, the White House wants to slash a federal biofuels mandate. Yet profit margins for ethanol refiners are soaring to close to $1 a gallon.“We are optimistic for the future,” Juan Luciano, president of Archer Daniels Midland, an ethanol refinery operator, told the BMO Farm to Market conference in New York last month.The US has the world’s largest ethanol industry, with capacity of more than 14bn gallons a year, according to the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). As outlined by law, the federal mandate would have required 14.4bn gallons of maize-based ethanol to be sold inside the country this year.Oil companies generally refuse to blend more than 10 per cent ethanol into the petrol they sell at service stations. This caps domestic ethanol demand at about 13.5bn gallons. This situation, known as the “blend wall”, prompted the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose to cut the maize-based ethanol mandate to 13bn gallons. Biofuels lobby groups have pushed back, warning of dire consequences.Ethanol companies are riding high, however. There are several reasons why.Maize prices have fallen sharply from peaks reached during the US drought of 2012. The cost of the feedstock for a typical Iowa ethanol plant is now close to $4 per bushel, down from $7 a year ago, according to Iowa State University. US ethanol producers are also taking their product from the Corn Belt to markets as distant as the Philippines. Net exports in March were 79m gallons, a more than 10-fold increase from a year before, RFA data show. Despite strong production, US ethanol stocks hover at a lean 18m barrels.Todd Becker, chief executive of Green Plains Renewable Energy, a large US ethanol producer, told the conference: “The EPA sent us the message: Go find yourself other demand. We did, and now the US is facing shortages because the world said: ‘I’ll take your fuel’.” Canada, a leading ethanol destination, has a 5 per cent biofuel blending mandate. Israel is also implementing a renewable fuel programme, Mr Becker noted.“The Mid-East accounted for 10 per cent of our exports,” he added. “We sell to the United Arab Emirates. They want our octane. Why? Because it’s a fuel extender.” Mr Becker outlined further opportunities in Mexico and China. He said of China: “Quite frankly, if they showed up on our market, we probably don’t have enough ethanol for them because we wouldn’t have enough ethanol for ourselves.”One place to which exports have slowed is Europe, which imposed anti-dumping duties on US ethanol in 2013, notes Seth Meyer, senior economist at the US Department of Agriculture.After a period of plant shutdowns, larger companies are beginning to consolidate the fragmented ethanol refining industry.Valero – also the largest US oil refiner – in March purchased its 11th maize ethanol plant, a 110m gallon-a-year operation in Indiana that had been idle for two years. CHS, a farmer co-operative, has bought a 133m gallon-a-year refinery in Illinois.The resilience of the US ethanol industry has called into question whether the renewable fuels mandate is needed. Charles Koch, chief executive of the conglomerate Koch Industries and a donor to conservative political causes, recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal: “Now the mandate needs to go, so that consumers and the marketplace are the ones who decide the future of ethanol.”Koch Industries owns several maize ethanol plants as well as oil refineries.As the oil and biofuels industries and commodities traders await the EPA’s decision, they are watching the price of Rins (Renewable Identification Numbers). These are credits that fuel companies may redeem in lieu of meeting federal biofuel blending obligations.Ethanol exports do not count towards the mandate. All things being equal, a higher ethanol Rin price suggests a tougher blending mandate. Ethanol Rins traded at about 48 cents apiece in late May, up 20 per cent from a year before. This suggests the Rins market “expects a substantial rollback” from the EPA’s original proposal, says Scott Irwin, agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.
118;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-05-11T19:29:04Z;Cargill seeks fresh recipe for success;The world’s largest food supplier is going through a lean period;A muddy industrial complex on the Saskatchewan prairie is a crossroads of Canadian agriculture. Bags of seed are stacked in a shed, awaiting sale to farmers. Wheat and barley are piled in concrete silos, ready to fill trains to Pacific ports. Shrouded in fragrant steam, the world’s largest canola processing plant crushes 1.5m tonnes of the oilseed every year.The hub in tiny Clavet is one of many far-flung outposts in the empire of food built by Cargill, the biggest food commodities trader and processor on the globe. The company is now spending another $100m there to refine canola oil for use in McDonald’s deep fryers.“It was a bit of a no-brainer investment,” said Paul Conway, a Cargill vice-chairman.The company needs more of them. Recent investments, from a 65m bird-a-year chicken processor in China to the purchase of Australia’s top malt producer, had failed to boost lacklustre returns in the past few years, senior executives said in interviews with the Financial Times. Cargill’s net profit totalled $1.45bn in the first nine months of its current fiscal year, the second lowest in the past eight years.David MacLennan, who took over as the company’s ninth chief executive in December, faces a tough situation. If he stays until the mandatory retirement age of 65 he has a decade to leave his mark.“We are on a mission to improve our financial performance,” Mr MacLennan said, fresh from a two-day meeting of Cargill’s top leadership. “We’re a growth company”.With revenues of $136.7bn last year, US-based Cargill is one of the largest private companies in the world. It is central to the global food supply, using a vast network of ships, silos and warehouses to move 185m tonnes of wheat, corn, oilseeds, cocoa and other commodities to customers in more than 125 countries.About 100 members of the founding Cargill and MacMillan families control the company. Cargill shareholders leave nearly 90 per cent of cash flow and 80 per cent of net profits inside the company for reinvestment, Mr Conway said.But performance is a concern. In the last financial year declared dividends were $385m, down from $475m the year before.Cargill has invested more than $1bn in Russia since entering the country in 1991, giving it a stake in the outcome of the Ukraine crisis.Read moreThat’s surprising because, with crop output, demand and trade all on the rise, these should be boom times for the industry. But Cargill and rivals such as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus Commodities have all wobbled.“The grain business right now is not a lot of fun,” said Carl Casale, chief executive of CHS, a US-based farmer co-operative in joint ventures with Cargill.Despite enormous crops in North America, consumers replenishing supplies after the drought of 2012 have kept stocks relatively slim. As a result grain for immediate delivery costs about as much as grain delivered months later when, ordinarily, futures prices would be higher. “We don’t make any money storing grain,” said Cargill’s Ryan Neubauer, deep inside the 42,000-tonne silo complex he manages at Clavet, Saskatchewan. “This place ideally would be like a pipe, an eaves trough”.Other challenges are particular to Cargill. In Anhui, China, Cargill spent $250m to build a facility able to breed, hatch, raise, slaughter and process poultry. After health scares swept the national flock, “we’re feeling the effects of decreased chicken demand”, said Mr MacLennan, known internally as “D-Mac”.In response, Cargill executives have outlined a mix of cost-cutting, shedding businesses and investing in new ones. For example, this year the company said it would cease trading global coal and European gas and power.Cargill’s budget for capital expenditures will total more than $4bn for this year, Mr Conway said. Mr MacLennan said the company planned to invest about 60 per cent in internal projects and the balance on acquisitions.Recent results on the latter have been patchy.Despite having investment-grade rated debt itself, Mr MacLennan warned that low interest rates available to less creditworthy peers had led to rich valuations in the sector. Cargill’s recent negotiations to buy ADM’s cocoa business collapsed over price.Investment in the new canola refinery in Clavet reflects Cargill’s aim to be the “partner of choice” for customers such as McDonald’s, who can ensure steady demand. It will refine oils extracted in part from seeds bred at Cargill labs and grown under contract by area farmers – what managers call a “closed loop”.As farmers and food companies lock in commodity prices with Cargill, it creates opportunities for teams in Minneapolis, Winnipeg or Geneva to trade around the deals as they try to anticipate future supply and demand.“For them [customers], volatility is anathema. For us, it’s opportunity,” said Mr Conway.Such opportunities carry significant risks: Cargill lost money trading US electricity during a price spike this winter. Standard & Poor’s, in a note last month, warned of “potential for earnings volatility and liquidity requirements from trading losses”.They are unlikely to put the company off.“If you just want to trade futures only, all you need is a computer and a desk,” said Dave Baudler, president of Cargill AgHorizons US, which buys grain from farmers and sells them inputs. “Our role in the world marketplace is understanding the actual physical flow of product and translating that into trading revenue”.
119;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-05-11T17:17:40Z;Cargill could do better, declares chief;;Cargill, one of the largest suppliers of agricultural products and foods, is looking to raise its game after several years of disappointing results, according to its new chief executive.“Our performance over the last several years is not meeting my expectations or the expectations of the leadership team. I think we can perform better, and I believe we will perform better,” David MacLennan told the Financial Times.Steps had been taken to make the nearly 150-year-old company, with interests ranging from grain silos in Canada to chicken farming in China, more agile and decisive, he said in an interview.Cargill leads a small group of companies that dominate flows of agricultural commodities. Its annual revenues of more than $135bn are equivalent to AT&T’s. As one of the biggest privately owned companies, it seldom makes public more than summary comments on its financial performance.A net profit of $1.45bn in the first nine months of its current fiscal year was Cargill’s second lowest for the period in the past eight years. Profit margins, measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation as a percentage of revenue, have declined to 5 per cent from 7 per cent five years ago.Rival agricultural houses such as New York-listed Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, and Wilmar of Singapore have also reported soft results despite record crops and demand in emerging economies that cannot grow enough to feed themselves.Mr MacLennan, 54, said the company, which has more than 140,000 employees in 67 countries, needed to “move faster” and “take appropriate risks” in order to improve performance.Executives have also outlined plans to cut costs such as on back-office services and to offshore jobs. Cargill would abandon businesses where it had a small presence and invest “where we could be an industry leader”, Mr MacLennan said.Mr MacLennan – a company veteran and son of a former Cargill grain merchant – replaced Greg Page, who became executive chairman. About 100 members of the Cargill and MacMillan families, descendants of founder William Wallace Cargill, own about 90 per cent of the company’s common stock.Paul Conway, a Cargill vice-chairman, said the “dissatisfaction” level at the company was “pretty high,” but helping to spur change.In 2012 “we had a very poor performance”, Mr Conway said. “We cleaned things up and had a nice rebound last year to a very solid result. But we’ve not kicked on this year. That’s where the dissatisfaction comes from.”Cargill’s latest quarter was challenged by a loss in electricity markets and a costly move by China to reject imports of some US corn, contributing to a 28 per cent decline in net profit from a year earlier.Mr MacLennan said it had been difficult to find acquisition targets that met returns criteria because ultra-low interest rates had pushed up valuations. “It’s pricey,” he said.
120;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-04-29T17:39:13Z;Weather dents ADM’s core grain division;;Archer Daniels Midland reported lower than expected first-quarter earnings after weaker margins and adverse winter weather hit the US-based agricultural trader’s grain operations.“Our businesses delivered mixed results in the first quarter,” said Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chairman and chief executive, adding that the company’s agricultural services unit, its largest division in terms of revenue, “generated weak results due to a low margin environment as well as logistics and weather challenges in the US”.Net income fell to 40 cents a share compared to 41 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding inventory costs, were at 55 cents compared to forecasts of more than 70 cents a share.ADM’s announcement follows a 28 per cent fall in first quarter net profits at rival Cargill, after reduced opportunities in storing and trading grain as well as the tough winter weather affected the transportation of grains in North America.Despite the mixed results for the first quarter, ADM expects this year’s grain harvest to provide a better profit environment as farmers are likely to release the inventories which they have been hoarding. Ms Woertz said that the “latter half of the year has good opportunities for us”.Operating profits at the agricultural services was almost flat from the year before at $153m, up from $151m. Earnings at the merchandising and handling division fell 20 per cent due to the adverse pricing structure in the grain markets.The transportation division rose more than fivefold as pent-up barge freight demand caused by the harsh winter pushed freight rates up significantly. Milling operations fell 14 per cent due to the structure of the wheat futures market.However, a strong ethanol market boosted the company’s corn business, which saw operating profits rise 28 per cent to $196m, while strong margins in soyabean crushing helped the oilseeds processing division post a 9.5 per cent increase in operating profits to $334m.ADM said its cocoa operations returned to the black, posting operating profits of $30m in the first quarter compared with losses of $27m a year before, as stronger demand for chocolate pushed up processing margins.The company had been negotiating with Cargill to sell its global cocoa business since late last year, but it recently announced that the parties had abandoned talks. ADM said it would seek buyers for a smaller string of chocolate factories, which accounted for “a third of the value of the cocoa business”.
121;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-04-25T11:40:48Z;Dreyfus begins search for new chief;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, has launched the search for a new chief executive as the privately held company continues to overhaul its corporate structure ahead of a possible stake sale or stock market flotation.Dreyfus, as the company is known, and its rivals Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill are the “ABCD” group of companies that dominate global flows of food commodities.In a statement, Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, chairwoman and majority shareholder, said “conditions” were right to find a replacement for Ciro Echesortu, who asked to step back from his role as chief executive.“One year ago, we agreed with Mr Echesortu to begin a transition under his leadership, aiming to adapt our strategy and accelerate the group’s transformation, in order to reinforce our leading position in the industry,” said Ms Louis-Dreyfus.“Thanks to our solid performance in 2013, the conditions are now right to implement a longer term solution and the supervisory board has therefore initiated an active search for a new CEO.”People familiar with the situation said that Dreyfus, the world’s largest rice and raw-cotton trader, had appointed a headhunting group that would look outside the company for its new chief executive.“The inclination is also [to] go for someone outside of the industry,” said the person. “Dreyfus has all the trading talent it needs in-house.” An appointment is expected before the end of the year.March 31-April 2, Lausanne: Industry leaders, bankers and traders gather to discuss the changing commodities businessDreyfus is in the middle of a transformation, tapping the capital markets to help finance acquisitions and investments.The 163-year old trader, which reported a fall in annual profits last month, is planning to spend $4bn over the next four years as it attempts to double in size and keep pace with a wave of consolidation across the global agribusiness industry.It is also reorganising its business model and operations so they are more closely aligned with a publicly listed company. Earlier this month, it appointed three new members to the supervisory board of its holding company, including the chairman of Syngenta, the agricultural chemicals producer.While there are no immediate plans for a stake sale or an initial public offering, Ms Louis-Dreyfus wants the company to be prepared for either a stock market listing or a partial sale to a strategic investor. That means having an independent board and an experienced manager as chief executive.Last month, Ms Louis-Dreyfus told the Financial Times at its Global Commodities Summit that she did not want Dreyfus to abandon its privately owned status but the trading house had to be ready for every eventuality.The 163-year old trader, which reported a fall in annual profits last month, is planning to spend $4bn over the next four years as it attempts to double in size and keep pace with a wave of consolidation across the global agribusiness industry“We will do what’s best for the company. And if at a given moment we find, not for financial but for strategic reasons, that we have to work with a partner or the stock market, then we’ll be ready.”The multibillion-dollar stock market flotation of Glencore in 2011 raised expectations that rival traders would follow suit. That has not proved the case, with traders instead opting for hybrid strategies of tapping bond markets or seeking strategic investors while maintaining the flexibility and lower public disclosure permitted by private ownership.Since the death of her husband Robert in 2008, Ms Louis-Dreyfus has consolidated control of Dreyfus through a family trust and spearheaded its expansion.The trust, called Akira, now owns 65.1 per cent of Louis Dreyfus Holdings, up from 50 per cent five years ago, with the remainder owned by other members of the Louis-Dreyfus family. In turn, Louis Dreyfus Holdings controls 85 per cent of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, with the balance owned by approximately 500 senior employees.Mr Echesortu, a company veteran, was appointed CEO in June 2013. He replaced Serge Schoen, who stepped aside after a successful eight year reign. Mr Schoen became CEO after Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a great grandson of the company’s founder, took control of the trading house in the mid-2000s and aggressively restructured the business.
122;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-04-15T22:03:01Z;Archer Daniels Midland abandons sale of cocoa unit;;Disagreement over price led Archer Daniels Midland to abandon talks to sell its global cocoa business and narrow its focus to finding a buyer for a smaller string of chocolate factories instead.New York-listed ADM, the agribusiness group, was in final negotiations to sell its third-ranked cocoa processing business to number two Cargill, the Financial Times reported late last year. Industry executives estimated it was worth about $2bn.ADM said on Tuesday that it would keep the majority of its cocoa press operations. Separately, it has engaged advisers to pursue the sale of its chocolate business. Cocoa processors turn beans into cocoa butter and powder, while chocolate manufacturers produce the chocolate.Juan Luciano, ADM president and chief operating officer, said the cocoa business “is probably the most global” of the company’s businesses, with dispersed operations, multiple plants and many employees.“Both parties assigned a different value,” he said. “At the end of the day, it ended up being an issue of value, as normally happens in these deals.”He declined to specify what price ADM had sought. Cargill said it was always looking at potential investments and assessing business opportunities, but declined to comment on cocoa negotiations.Mr Luciano said: “Over the last month we’ve been negotiating, we came to the conclusion that there is more value for the shareholders of ADM to proceed with this smaller transaction in chocolate.” ADM has chocolate manufacturing operations in Canada, the US, Belgium, Germany and the UK.The move comes as ADM attempts to achieve returns on invested capital that are at least 2 percentage points above its weighted average cost of capital. Returns have fallen short of this goal.The company’s “cocoa and other” segment had an operating loss of $33m last year, after an operating profit of $276m in 2012. While the cocoa grinding business will meet goals for investment returns, “we don’t believe the same for the chocolate business and we are divesting,” Mr Luciano said.ADM said it had reached an agreement to sell a fertiliser blending business in Brazil and Paraguay to Mosaic, the New York-listed crop nutrients group, for $350m.ADM said it would take full ownership of Alfred C Toepfer International, a Hamburg grain trading subsidiary, by acquiring the remaining 20 per cent stake it does not already own for €83m from French farming co-operative Union InVivo.Toepfer has strong relationships with farmers in eastern Europe and Argentina, both large agricultural exporters. The unit has struggled with problems including corn shipments that were turned away by Chinese inspectors.Shares of ADM fell 0.9 per cent to $44.27, while Mosaic rose 2 per cent to $48.37.
123;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-04-04T07:31:06Z;Commodities Summit: Lessons from Lausanne;The top industry players share their thoughts on the future;A dozen things we learnt at the FT’s Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne this week.1) Glencore Xstrata chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, does not think private equity and mining mix.“It’s never worked in the past . . . the problem with the commodity space, if you have high gearing, is that you are not running Boots Pharmaceuticals, where you have a pretty constant earnings base. When you hit bad times, like we did recently . . . how are you going to feed your debt?”2) But energy and private equity do, according to Marcel van Poecke, managing director of Carlyle International Energy Partners.“I have never seen a market with so many good assets for sale . . . We see more and more assets being sold by major oil companies. So that gives a good potential for good returns, especially if you focus outside the US. Outside the US there is less capital available. So it is a buyer’s market.”3) Paul Reed, the head of BP’s powerful oil trading arm, voiced concerns about regulation:“The threat to business can be quite significant if we get it wrong,” he said. “A lot of the rules coming in could have the opposite effect to what they were intending to achieve.”4) While Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, was relaxed about China Inc’s push into the global agribusiness market:“I think it is wholly consistent with the food security strategy of the Chinese five-year plan. It makes all the sense in the world that China wants to be connected somehow directly to the source.”5) Juan Luciano, chief operating officer of Archer Daniels Midland, was also calm.“They have just abandoned the objective of self-sufficiency in grain, which I think is a smart thing to do, because I think it’s taking too much of a toll on their resources.”6) Marco Dunand told us Mercuria and JPMorgan were a good cultural fit.“If you look at the JPMorgan commodity business it is actually quite complementary to what we do today. It’s more like a merger than a takeover.”7) Pierre Lorinet, the chief financial officer of Trafigura, explained why oil trading margins were under pressure.“You look at businesses which have been successful in our sector over the last 10-15 years and obviously that attracts new entrants. You’ve got national oil companies wanting to go further up the chain, you’ve got new players coming in, and private equity groups buying traders.”“All of these things is clearly creating a bit of a crowded place. You’ve got a lot of people looking at those markets and that puts pressure on margins.”8) He also explained why the received wisdom on oil prepayment deals with companies like Rosneft was wrong.“It’s not our own balance sheet that we are putting on the line. We are effectively helping arrange a transaction that is being syndicated in the market with banks, institutional money, whatever. So really we are used as a conduit to originated transactions.”9), Yusuf Alireza, the chief executive of Noble, talked business models.“None of us should be arrogant to assume one model is right and one model is wrong . . . from a Noble perspective, our core competence is in the middle part of the supply chain . . . We are not miners, we are not farmers, we are not a bank.”10) and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus said she wanted Louis Dreyfus Commodities to look like a publicly listed company.“The message is clear: we will do what’s best for the company. And if at a given moment we find – not for financial but for strategic reasons – that we have to work with a partner or the stock market, then we’ll be ready”.11) But Vitol’s chief financial offer, Jeffrey Dellapina, said there were no plans for an initial public offering.“We are not constrained capital-wise at the moment and I don’t really foresee any of our plans being interrupted by a need for more equity capital.”12) And the company’s chief executive, Ian Taylor, had some nice things to say about investment banks.“I hate to say it, but I’m quite keen to see Goldman Sachs stay in the [commodities] business.”The Commodities Note is a regular online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
124;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-04-01T16:36:35Z;Commodities trading houses see more assertive China;Beijing steps away from its policy of grain self-sufficiency;Leaders of two of the largest agricultural trading houses have outlined a more assertive role for China in global food commodities markets as Beijing steps away from its policy of grain self-sufficiency.Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, and Juan Luciano, president and chief operating officer of Archer Daniels Midland, both manage US-based companies with operations in large grain and oilseed imports into China.They said recent moves by China National Cereals, Oil and Foodstuffs Corp (Cofco) to take controlling stakes in foreign food trading houses recognised that the country will become more dependent on imports.“I think it is wholly consistent with the food security strategy of the Chinese five-year plan. It makes all the sense in the world that Cofco China wants to be connected somehow, some way directly to the source,” Mr Schroder said on Tuesday at the FT Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland.China already imports 69m tonnes of soyabeans annually, or two-thirds of globally traded supplies. Imports of corn will treble to 22m tonnes in the next decade, the US Department of Agriculture estimates.In recent policy pronouncements, Beijing abandoned its traditional reluctance to look abroad for feed grains such as corn.Cofco in February agreed to buy a controlling stake in Dutch agricultural trading house Nidera valued at close to $1.3bn, giving it direct access to supplies in South America.Cofco was this week poised to announce it would also buy a majority stake of the agricultural commodities unit of Singapore-listed trading house Noble Group, bankers said.“As I think of them being more reliant on global markets, it makes sense that they will have a strategy to have a higher ability to originate those grains around the world,” Mr Luciano said.While Cofco may now bid for cargoes against international peers such as ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, business volumes may increase overall as Chinese imports grow.“My view is that Cofco will continue to buy and transact with all commercials in addition to this. China is bigger than one or two companies. But it is a way to deal with the fact that they no longer are claiming to be self-sufficient,” Mr Schroder said.Both Bunge and ADM already have substantial investments inside China. Bunge’s plants there have the capacity to crush 6m tonnes of soyabeans, Mr Schroder said.ADM is constructing a new animal feed “premix” plant in the city of Nanjing, in addition to its existing trading and processing plants and stakes in trading houses Wilmar of Singapore and Alfred C Toepfer of Germany, both suppliers to China.
125;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-04-01T10:54:44Z;Archer Daniels Midland hopes to increase GrainCorp stake;;Archer Daniels Midland may increase its stake in GrainCorp after the Australian government blocked its bid for the grain trader late last year, a top executive has said.Juan Luciano, president and chief operating officer of the New York-listed agricultural behemoth, said ADM was “slammed by a little bit of fear and nostalgia” when Canberra shot down the A$3.4bn ($3.1bn) takeover on national interest grounds.ADM continues to maintain a 19.85 per cent stake in the company. Australia’s treasurer has said he was inclined to allow ADM to own up to 24.9 per cent.GrainCorp is important to ADM’s efforts to diversify sources of grain beyond its historic US base. Australia is one of the world’s top exporters of wheat and is relatively close to fast-growing markets in Asia.“We are a 112-year-old company,” Mr Luciano said on Tuesday at the FT Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland. “We think long-term, Australia’s strategically positioned to build our Australasian strategy. We’re going to hold to our 20 per cent and we’re going to try to increase that, to get to the final goal.”GrainCorp, founded almost a century ago as a government agency, owns 280 grain storage facilities and seven of the eight ports that ship grain in bulk from the nation’s east coast.“It’s the last Australian asset in the east, and as I said we were slammed by a little bit of fear and nostalgia,” Mr Luciano said. “We are committed to working with the government and the farmers to placate those fears and dissipate those fears,” he said.Global agricultural trading has been swept up in a wave of dealmaking, including state-owned Cofco of China’s moves to buy majority stakes of agricultural traders, Marubeni of Japan acquiring Gavilon of the US and Glencore paying more than $6bn for Toronto-listed Viterra to get access to wheat exports from Canada and Australia.Mr Luciano said: “I think overall, we’re going to continue seeing consolidation. The task of feeding the world with increased quality and increased quantity I think is the domain of big companies with big balance sheets and big infrastructure and investments,” he said.
126;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Louis Dreyfus Commodities gets ‘IPO-ready’;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities is taking steps to ensure that it is ready for either a stock market listing or a partial sale to a strategic investor, as one of the world’s largest food trading houses navigates a fast changing landscape for natural resources.In a rare interview, Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, majority shareholder, said the 163-year-old trading house did not want to abandon its privately owned status and had no immediate plans for an initial public offering, but had to be ready for every eventuality.“The message is clear: we will do what’s best for the company. And if at a given moment we find – not for financial but for strategic reasons – that we have to work with a partner or the stock market, then we’ll be ready,” she said at the FT Commodities Global Summit in Switzerland.Louis Dreyfus Commodities and its rivals ADM, Bunge and Cargill make up the “ABCD” group of companies that dominate global flows of commodities. It is the world’s largest rice and cotton trader, according to a recent bond prospectus, and second biggest in sugar and grain. The company has never revealed a public valuation, but based on rivals’ profits and stock market valuations, it could be worth more than $6bn.The trader has been slowly moving into the public arena after several years of rapid expansion. It has raised money from the bond market three times over the past 18 months and now publishes semi-annual financial statements.Industry leaders gather in Lausanne to discuss the future of the commodities business. For full coverage, including videosContinue readingHowever, the move to align its business model and operations more closely to that of a publicly listed company – which will accelerate with the appointment of three non-executive directors in the next week and later in the year a strengthened management team – marks a shift in the company’s thinking and strategy.“People don’t want to believe it is possible to just keep all our options open. But right now that is the best approach for the company,” said Ms Louis-Dreyfus.The multibillion-dollar stock market flotation of Glencore in 2011 raised expectations that rival traders would follow suit. That has not proved the case, with traders instead opting for hybrid strategies of tapping bond markets or seeking strategic investors while maintaining the flexibility and lower public disclosure permitted by private ownership.In order to survive, companies are aligning with each other for strategic reasonsMs Louis-Dreyfus said the big disadvantage of public companies was that they were exposed to the “mood of the market” and the “short-term delivery of profits”. Nevertheless, Louis Dreyfus Commodities had to be “pragmatic”. She also said the listing of BioSEV, its Brazilian sugar subsidiary, had been a positive experience for the company and had provided deeper access to capital markets.The agribusiness sector has seen a wave of consolidation in the past two years, with Glencore spending $6bn to buy Toronto-based grain trader Viterra and Marubeni, the Japanese trading house, spending $2.7bn, excluding debt, for the US-based grain trader Gavilon.ADM bid for GrainCorp of Australia in a $3bn deal that was subsequently rejected by Canberra on national interest grounds, while Hong Kong-based Noble is poised to sell a stake in its agribusiness to China National Cereals, Oil and Foodstuffs Corp (Cofco).“In order to survive, companies are aligning with each other for strategic reasons. I would say that if the moment comes when . . . we can no longer withstand external pressures, we will have to be smart and prepared,” said Ms Louis-Dreyfus.Since the death of her husband Robert in 2008, Ms Louis-Dreyfus has consolidated her control of the company and spearheaded its expansion.Akira, a family trust she controls, now owns 65.1 per cent of Louis Dreyfus Holdings, up from 50 per cent five years ago, with the remainder owned by other members of the Louis-Dreyfus family. In turn Louis Dreyfus Holdings controls 85 per cent of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, with the balance owned by approximately 500 senior employees.Under an agreement carved out by her late husband, Ms Louis-Dreyfus has an obligation to buy shares other family members tender until 2031. Ms Louis-Dreyfus said she wanted to increase her shareholding if the opportunity arose.Last year, Louis Dreyfus Commodities shipped 77m tonnes of agricultural commodities, roughly 9 per cent of global flows, according to the company’s annual report. However, the trader suffered a sharp drop in net profit after a US drought disrupted grains markets and sugar and other soft commodities were hit by oversupply.The company is aiming to invest $4bn, or on average $800m a year, between 2014 and 2018, to grow its industrial footprint and expand in Asia and Africa.
127;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-03-31T11:51:48Z;Cofco set to buy stake in Noble’s agricultural commodities unit;;China is poised to announce its biggest venture to date into the global agribusiness market, with state-owned Cofco buying a majority stake of the agricultural commodities unit of Singapore-listed trading house Noble, bankers said.China is one of the world’s largest buyers of agricultural commodities but until now Cofco (China National Cereals, Oil and Foodstuffs Corp) and other state-owned importers have limited themselves to buying from global agricultural trading houses.But several recent deals suggest a new approach by Beijing, with Cofco now able to buy directly from farmers around the world, and placing the company in direct competition with traders such as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities – long known as the “ABCD” companies.Cofco is one of a growing number of Chinese enterprises with global ambitions. The deal with Noble comes just weeks after Cofco bought a majority stake in Nidera, a 94-year-old Dutch-based agricultural trader.It is looking at buying businesses in South America and was also interested in buying the JPMorgan commodities platform which was sold a few weeks ago. Cofco’s five-year plan calls for investments of $10bn in overseas mergers and acquisitions by 2015. Other goals include raising its processing capacity from 50m tonnes in 2012 to 77m tonnes a year by 2015.The Cofco-Noble deal has been delayed for several months by complications in carving out the business from Noble.Noble has extensive credit and trade facilities, and the group has deliberated over which liabilities to transfer to the new venture, in which Noble will retain an equity stake and will jointly manage with Cofco.Estimates of the value of the operation run from $1bn to more than $2bn, the bankers added. “That’s why this deal has been imminent for months,” said one banker.Cofco declined to respond to requests for comment.The move to build a global supply chain is in line with a shift in priorities for China. Rising incomes and richer diets have collided with a shortage of arable land and clean water, leaving the world’s second-largest economy to abandon its traditional reluctance to look abroad for feed grains.China is already the world’s top importer of soyabeans, buying most of the harvests from the US, Brazil and Argentina. Analysts expect China’s corn imports will treble in the next decade, as rising incomes spur demand for meat and the feed grains used to fatten chickens and livestock.Meanwhile, Noble has had a volatile ride in recent years as it embarked on a more asset-heavy strategy just as commodities fever peaked. But recently, its performance has stabilised and its share price has rallied.The sale of a majority stake in the agricultural business will allow Noble to reduce its exposure to upstream, or production, assets. The trader’s agribusiness has also been plagued by overcapacity in several key markets, including Brazilian sugar-milling and Chinese soyabean crushing. This has weighed on the company’s share price.Agriculture is the smallest part of trader’s business, accounting for 15 per cent of fourth-quarter sales in 2013. The rest is accounted for by energy and metals trading.Any sale will be good news for China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth fund, which is already Noble’s biggest outside shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, which it purchased before the slide in commodities prices.The agricultural trading sector has seen a flurry of deals over the past 18 months. Glencore paid more than $6bn for Toronto-listed Viterra to get access to wheat exports from Canada and Australia. Marubeni of Japan acquired Gavilon for $2.7bn, excluding debt – a move that gave it access to grain infrastructure in the US and positioned it for a rise in Chinese demand,A similar strategy saw ADM bid for GrainCorp of Australia in a $3bn deal that was subsequently rejected by Canberra on national interest grounds.
128;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-03-26T17:25:32Z;Louis Dreyfus profits drop after grain surplus;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s largest food trading houses, has reported a sharp drop in annual profits, weighed down by weakness in several of its key markets including sugar.The privately owned company, which along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill, dominates the world’s commodity food flows, said adjusted net income from continuing operations fell to $640m in the year to December from a record $970m in 2012.A global sugar surplus and poor yields from its Brazilian orange juice crop because of heavy rains before harvest led to operating results at the trader’s “tropicals” business, which includes sugar, cotton and coffee, halving to $437m.Profits were also lower in the company’s “proteins” division, which encompasses oilseeds, grains and vegetable oils, although margins recovered towards the end of the year.The worst drought in half a century in the US in 2012 led to stockpiles of grains and oilseeds falling to the lowest levels in decades, limiting processing and training opportunities for agricultural trading houses in the first half of 2013.That situation started to reverse in the second half of 2013 as ample harvests of grain and oilseeds materialised.“2013 witnessed a transition in the supply of agricultural products, from inventories limited by exceptional climate events in 2012, to replenishment with abundant crops during the year,” said Serge Schoen, chairman of parent company Louis Dreyfus Commodities Holdings, in the company’s annual report.“With the entire industry impacted, Louis Dreyfus Commodities responded successfully, delivering a solid performance with $63.6bn in sales and $1.7bn in operating profits,” he said.Dreyfus said second-half profits were in-line with the average of 2009-2011, excluding its Brazilian sugar subsidiary Biosev. In the first six months of the year, the trader reported $258m in net income, down 13 per cent on the same period a year earlier.The company, owned by the Louis Dreyfus family and some of its executives, has been increasing its public exposures in recent years. After tapping the bond market for the first time in its 160-year history, Dreyfus now files its accounts with the Singapore Stock Exchange.It has also embarked on a large spending programme to keep pace with a wave of consolidation across the global agribusiness industry. The expansion has been spearheaded by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who has consolidated control of the 163-year-old trading house since the death of her husband Robert Louis-Dreyfus in 2009.Last year, Ms Dreyfus increased her stake in the trader’s holding company to 65.1 per cent, buying a 4 per cent holding from a family member. The deal valued Louis Dreyfus Holdings, which controls 80 per cent of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, at $6bn.In the annual report, Ms Louis-Dreyfus said the family trust she controls would buy more shares if the opportunity arose.“I would be pleased for the Akira Foundation, established by Robert Louis-Dreyfus, to indirectly increase its stake in Louis Dreyfus Commodities,” she said.
129;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-03-10T16:44:00Z;Trade fears sprout in the GMO divide;;In a video advert for Syngenta’s new genetically modified seeds, the camera pans across a row of immature corn stalks, then cuts to dozens of pallid worms gnawing on a root. “There’s a ticking time bomb in your fields,” it warns farmers. “It can eat into your profits and sink your entire operation.”It is not a new message: the fight against corn rootworm, a common pest, is perennial in agriculture. But Syngenta’s latest attempt to protect crops from the larval creature, by adding a new genetically modified ‘trait’, has triggered a new battle – involving biotechnology companies, the grain trading industry and the government of China.As the US corn belt prepares for its planting season next month, Syngenta’s Agrisure Duracade seeds have been approved inside the US – but not yet in China. As one of the world’s emerging corn import heavyweights, however, China’s stance on genetic modification has the potential to transform agricultural markets.Late last year, China’s decision to reject imports containing another unapproved corn trait caused losses of hundreds of millions of dollars at commodities trading houses globally, including Archer Daniels Midland and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, industry executives say. Now, traders are alarmed that Duracade corn will leak into their export stream, making it unsaleable in China.This impasse highlights the risk to agricultural traders as the world’s growing dependence on agricultural imports collides with national policies. China’s timeline for approving biotech grain imports lags behind months or years that of the US.“There’s been trade disruption because a product is in US commerce but is not approved in China,” explains Eric Trachtenberg, director of food and agriculture at McLarty Associates, a Washington advisory firm.Traders say Duracade is the biggest genetically modified crop controversy to shake US grain exports since StarLink corn, which was not approved for human consumption but turned up in food products more than a decade ago.New York-listed ADM says it will refuse to accept Duracade corn, while Cargill will not take it for export contracts and reserves the right to test deliveries. But one senior trader claims that even the most rigorous tests will not eliminate the risk that some corn arrives in Chinese ports.“We could test every truckload,” he says. “Yet, if the Chinese authorities . . . find two kernels in a 2m-bushel Panamax vessel . . .” He warns that such a discovery could lead to the rejection of an entire shipment. US corn exports to China totalled $1.2bn last year.Associations of US grain exporters and silo operators have demanded that Syngenta halt commercial sales of Duracade as well as Viptera – the corn variety already rejected by China – until Beijing and some other foreign markets have given their approval, warning of “serious economic harm to exporters, grain handlers and, ultimately, agricultural producers”.Swiss-based Syngenta, the largest agricultural chemicals company by sales, is not backing down, though. It has outlined a spring planting “launch zone” from Colorado in the west to New York in the east – and has teamed with Gavilon, a subsidiary of Marubeni of Japan, which promises to buy any Duracade corn that farmers harvest.Chuck Lee, who leads Syngenta’s corn work in North America, estimates only about 3,500 US farmers will plant Duracade seed this spring. In total, the company expects it to be sowed across 250,000 acres – a sliver of the 92m acres to be planted.Farmers must also sign “stewardship agreements” – acknowledging that the corn is not for export – and follow protocols to prevent it being mixed with other types, such as planting border rows and cleaning farm equipment.He adds that the agreement with Gavilon will ensure a marketing option for farmers. “You tend to see bad behaviour when people don’t have options,” he notes.Corn with the Viptera trait was first planted in the US in 2011. Until China first turned away cargoes last autumn, most of the corn it imported from the US probably had Viptera in it, Mr Lee points out. “Clearly they knew we were selling Viptera and they knew it was being planted in the US,” he says.Some western analysts have also noted that Chinese authorities began rejecting US imports as its domestic corn prices were falling, and questioned whether Beijing took action to protect its local farmers.“The Chinese system lacks transparency,” said Scott Sindelar, a Beijing-based US agricultural official, at a conference in Washington last month. “One can reasonably question China’s commitment to science-based rules or ask if China is not simply using food safety requirements to manage trade.”China’s vice-agriculture minister Niu Din told Reuters last week its process to approve Viptera corn is under way after Syngenta submitted additional information.Joseph Glauber, the US Department of Agriculture’s chief economist, is hoping a resolution can be reached quickly. “China needs calories. They need corn. This hopefully is a temporary situation,” he says.
130;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-03-05T17:13:38Z;Minor global agribusiness deals expected;;A wave of big takeovers in global agribusiness stalled late last year, when the Australian government said no to Archer Daniels Midland’s $3.1bn bid for local grain exporter GrainCorp.But bankers and executives say more deals are to come – just minor ones.New York-listed ADM is keeping its 19.8 per cent stake in GrainCorp, saying it is happy with the company’s proximity to Asia. Meantime, ADM has allocated $1.4bn for capital spending and “small M&A” this year.Bunge, its rival, recently told investors that M&A activity would be focused on “filling gaps” in its global agricultural trading operations and expanding in food and ingredients businesses, such as wheat milling.The company is meanwhile considering a sale of its sugarcane mills, one of several Brazil-based operations to struggle with low sugar prices and policies adverse to making ethanol.Cargill has signalled it would invest more in its own assets and less in substantial deals after the $2.1bn acquisition of animal nutrition company Provimi, its largest ever. Recent takeovers have been too modest to make headlines, including an olive oil company in India and a dog treat manufacturer in California.Glencore Xstrata has also moved into agriculture through the $6.1bn purchase of Viterra, a Toronto-listed grain trader. However, it remains a relatively small player in the industry with a narrower geographic focus than many of its rivals. According to analysts, Glencore has holes in two critical areas for agriculture, the US and Brazil, and the only way it can fill them is via acquisitions.The US Department of Agriculture projects world trade in “coarse grains” used to feed livestock – such as corn and barley – will rise 25 per cent to 179m tones in the next decade. Soyabean trade will grow almost half to 152m tonnes.This requires stronger links between regions of fast-rising demand, such as China, with areas of surplus grain supply such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Russia, Ukraine and the US.In trading and processing businesses, where profit margins are measured in pennies per pound, consolidation can make sense as a way to maximise the capacity of silos and ships. Cargill, CHS and ConAgra are awaiting antitrust approval to form a three-way joint-venture in US flour milling.However, many of the bigger potential deals have already been realised. What is left are smaller traders such as The Andersons, a $1.6bn-market capitalisation company based in Ohio.In some fertile regions it can be tough to do business. International traders have fought tax evasion complaints in Argentina, while Russia declared a cereals export ban in 2010. One Ukraine oilseed and grain merchant to catch the eye of foreign executives is Warsaw-listed Kernel, but the country’s uncertain regime makes it difficult to evaluate, industry advisers and investors say.One possibility that is rarely discussed is one of the big global traders merging with another, perhaps involving a western behemoth and one of the rising houses based in Asia. This would undoubtedly raise competition concerns, but one adviser suggests that given the success of recent cross-border deals, these may be surmountable.“There’s not a lot to buy unless you go very, very big,” he says.
131;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;China’s Cofco takes on global trading houses;;"Two years ago China’s state-owned grains trader announced a $10bn war chest for foreign mergers and acquisitions. It has now shown the will to act.China National Cereals, Oil and Foodstuffs Corp last week charged into South American markets with a deal to buy a controlling stake in Nidera, a 94-year-old trading house.The company known as Cofco is now in talks with Hong Kong-based Noble Group, one of Asia’s leading commodities traders, to establish a joint venture in sugar, soyabeans and wheat.The deals will put China’s top grains importer directly in competition with global agricultural trading houses such as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus Commodities – long known as the “ABCD” companies – and commodities powerhouse Glencore Xstrata.“This is a big deal. It transforms them into a major player, and gives them a diversified footprint that they don’t have now,” says Philippe de Lapérouse, managing director at consultancy HighQuest Partners and a former Bunge executive.Cofco has the budget to assemble a formidable international presence. But with 106,000 employees and a long history as a state monopoly, it is more likely to buy for China than arbitrage between markets. Cofco’s revenues rose 13 per cent last year to $31.7bn, but profits fell 20 per cent to $585m. By contrast, Cargill earned $2.31bn, on revenues of $136.7bn.The move to build a global supply chain is in line with a shift in priorities for China. Rising incomes and richer diets have collided with a shortage of arable land and clean water, leaving the world’s second-largest economy to abandon its traditional reluctance to look abroad for feed grains. “We will encourage agriculture to go global and actively use foreign resources,” the Ministry of Finance said in its annual budget released on Wednesday.China is already the world’s top importer of soyabeans, snapping up the lion’s share of that harvest from the US, Brazil and Argentina. Demand from Chinese dairy farms has driven up North American alfalfa hay prices. Rice from Thailand, barley from Australia and cocoa from west Africa all find their way to China.A wave of big takeovers in global agribusiness stalled late last year, when the Australian government said no to Archer Daniels Midland’s $3.1bn bid for local grain exporter GrainCorp. But bankers and executives say more deals are to come – just minor ones.Continue readingThis year’s annual rural policy document specifically called for more corn imports. “The trade volume thus far is still small relative to the overall corn market, but it’s growing and the potential is very large,” says Joseph Glauber, chief economist at the US Department of Agriculture. The US is the world’s top corn exporter.Recent agribusiness deals have invoked Asian demand as a rationale. Glencore’s $6.1bn purchase of Toronto-listed Viterra gave it access to wheat exports from Canada and Australia. Marubeni of Japan last year closed on Gavilon of the US for $2.7bn, excluding debt – a move that gave it access to grains infrastructure in the US and positioned it for a rise in Chinese demand. A similar strategy motivated ADM to bid for GrainCorp of Australia in a $3bn deal rejected by Canberra on national interest grounds.Cofco’s five-year plan calls for investments of $10bn in overseas mergers and acquisitions by 2015. Other goals include raising its processing capacity to 77m tonnes a year by 2015, from 50mtpa in 2012. Some of that oilseed crushing or corn grinding capacity is in joint ventures with the international trading groups with which it will now compete.Sugar is a second area of focus, after grains, given Cofco’s roster of processed food brands. In 2011 it bought Tully Sugar, an export sugar mill operator in Australia. But Cofco’s war chest is unlikely to be spent solely on bulk commodities. It also counts Great Wall wines, Mengniu Dairy products and a number of packaged food brands among its products; and is on the lookout for more.A deal with Noble would strengthen Cofco’s hand in sugar and grant a beachhead in the US grain market. China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth fund, is already Noble’s biggest outside shareholder. “Noble Group has a very deep background in China and enjoys a close relationship with the government,” says Ma Wenfeng of Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant Co.With Cofco’s Nidera move and with Noble, you’re almost creating another credible competitor to the ABCDs nowNidera – an acronym formed from Netherlands, India, Germany (Deutschland), England, Russia and Argentina, the countries where it started trading in the 1920s – has been in need of working capital, bankers and agricultural investors say. Cofco invested almost $1.3bn for a 51 per cent stake.Frank Ning, the US-educated chairman of Cofco, deemed the transaction “in line with Cofco’s strategy to become a global player in the agricultural industry”.“With Cofco’s Nidera move and with Noble, you’re almost creating another credible competitor to the ABCDs now,” says one banker who advises agribusiness companies.Chinese bureaucrats have an uneasy relationship with international grain traders, with some harbouring fears they wield too much pricing power. China’s ministry of commerce required that Marubeni and Gavilon keep soya sales channels to China firewalled as a condition of approving that deal. Companies including ADM and Dreyfus have seen corn shipments turned away at Chinese ports in recent months over concerns they contained unapproved genetically modified seeds.Not everyone is cheering Cofco’s transformation into China’s international agricultural trading arm.Private feed producers such as New Hope Group, China’s largest private agricultural business, have lobbied for many years to open China’s corn imports but still have limited access to imported grain.“There must be an enterprise to take the lead when it comes to China’s overseas agricultural business. Right now, Cofco is doing it, but I hope more private enterprises in China will be able to participate as well,” adds analyst Ma Wenfeng."
132;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-02-26T11:08:21Z;Grain traders’ profits hit as US farmers hoard corn;;Hoarding by US corn farmers has pinched profits at some of the world’s biggest grain merchants, even as the nation wallows in its largest harvest in history.Analysts and executives had expected companies such as Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland to report huge profits from buying and storing corn this year. But quarterly results have been underwhelming, they say.“This year’s US corn crop was really, really big. And most of us were forecasting big results because of it,” a disappointed Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, told industry executives this month.Merchants say US farmers are clinging to their 13.9bn-bushel corn crop after prices fell 35 per cent in the past year, setting up a test of wills as Brazil prepares to launch its own huge harvest on to the export market.“Farmer selling has been a little bit slower, I think, than in the past years. They have got used to selling $6 and $7 corn, and $4.50 to $5 corn is not as exciting,” Michael Anderson, chief executive of The Andersons, a US merchant, told analysts.The biggest US trading houses, including ADM, Bunge, Cargill, CHS and Gavilon, a unit of Japan’s Marubeni, have added about 1bn bushels of US storage capacity in the past decade, bringing the total to more than 5bn, according to Sosland Publishing’s 2014 Grain & Milling Annual.But soaring cereals prices after the worst drought since the 1930s in 2012 enabled farmers to reinvest income in their own storage bins. US on-farm storage capacity totals 13bn bushels, 2bn more than 10 years ago.“The bins were empty because we’ve had two years of poor crops. So a lot of corn went into farmers’ bins because they didn’t like the price and had the space,” said Soren Schroder, Bunge’s chief executive.ADM this month in part blamed slow farmer corn sales as quarterly operating profit in its merchandising and handling segment fell by a third to $84m. Juan Luciano, chief operating officer, said the situation had begun to improve in 2014.Merchants make money buying grain when it is cheap and plentiful and selling it forward, earning a profit when their sale price exceeds the costs of storage and interest.Markets have not helped this “carry” trade, however, as futures prices are weak compared with spot purchase prices. On Tuesday the price of May-delivered corn was just 5.5 cents above the $4.5575-a-bushel price for March delivery.MaxYield Cooperative in Iowa, the top corn-growing state, was forced to offer farmers a premium to Chicago futures prices when it would normally offer a discount, said Harry Bormann, grain team leader.“We had to pay too much for fall corn,” Mr Bormann said.Some farmers have lately begun to release corn stocks, increasing supplies to the market softening local prices. “Now it’s difficult for us to sell corn and have any margin in it,” Mr Bormann said.The US Department of Agriculture forecasts corn will average $3.90 a bushel after another record harvest. Many analysts are sceptical. Farmers hoarding corn may be, too.Farmers “don’t believe the USDA is right about the price”, said Gary Blumenthal of World Perspectives, an agriculture consultancy in Washington.
133;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-02-25T05:26:15Z;Expansion back on track as Wilmar shifts focus;;For an Asian agribusiness that spent its first two decades impressing western rivals Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland with breathtaking rates of growth, the past two years have been anything but smooth for Wilmar.The Singapore-listed company, the world’s biggest producer of palm oil, a key ingredient in processed food, has seen its share price fall by 44 per cent, making it the worst performer in the Straits Times index and dragging its market capitalisation down to about US$17bn.But there are signs that Wilmar could be on the mend, just as the fortunes of fellow Asian agribusiness, Singapore-listed Olam, are also starting to recover after the company’s bruising battle last year with US shortseller Muddy Waters.Investors had fretted over the one thing that helped drive Wilmar’s growth for years: China.Kuok Khoon Hong, Wilmar’s co-founder and a nephew of Robert Kuok, the billionaire Malaysian entrepreneur, pushed into the country in the 1990s, setting up soyabean processing plants. He was betting that the growth of China’s middle class would spur demand for protein-based foods such as meat, and hence demand for the soyabean meal fed to cattle and pigs.That bet paid off handsomely for years, until an aggressive expansion by China’s state-owned processors caused overcapacity, squeezing soyabean margins.Now, that business appears to be recovering as capacity growth has been “more disciplined” across the industry, Standard Chartered says. Earnings last week showed Wilmar’s oilseeds division posted its sixth consecutive quarter of profits, with pre-tax profit in the three months to December of $116m. That helped drive a 5 per cent rise in group net profit for the year to $1.32bn.Shares in Wilmar were up 2.6 per cent at S$3.48 at midday on Tuesday.The recovery in oilseeds was also reflected in the earnings of Noble Group, a rival Singapore-listed agribusiness, which on Friday highlighted “better crush margins in China”.Mr Kuok remains bullish on China even though the pace of its economic growth has moderated. “Every time there is a bearish [research report] on China . . . our share price will drop. But in all our businesses we have volume and margin growth and we are becoming stronger against competitors. So maybe this slowdown is good for us,” he says.Yet Wilmar’s recovery has as much to do with expansion beyond China. The company is pushing into palm oil and edible oils in Africa, where it made its first investment in 2007 and where lower mortality rates and greater spending power are creating a new consumer class, according to Mr Kuok.Wilmar also has been muscling into sugar, a business long dominated by Cargill, ED & F Man, Sucres & Denrées and Dreyfus. It made its first acquisition in 2010, buying Australian sugar company Sucrogen.Wilmar’s business empire may have its roots in Asia but its largest single shareholder after the Kuok family is firmly planted in the vast agricultural plains of the US Midwest: Archer Daniels Midland.The US agribusiness has a 17 per cent stake and was a key partner for Wilmar as the two expanded in China in the 1990s. Speculation persists that they may eventually combine.Continue readingLast week, Wilmar entered India, the world’s second-largest sugar producer, with a $200m investment in a sugar joint venture with Shree Renuka. The Indian group also has 100,000 hectares of sugar cane in Brazil, the world’s largest sugar exporter, which Wilmar sees as complementary to its Indian investment.Sugar now accounts for 7 per cent of group pre-tax profits, while oilseeds has shrunk to account for 13 per cent, from 26 per cent in 2009.“If you aggregate all the operations excluding the China soyabean business they have been steadily increasing their profit contribution. And those businesses are generally higher-return businesses,” says Adrian Foulger, head of soft commodities research at Standard Chartered.At the group level Wilmar has managed to boost net cash flow by 52 per cent year-on-year, after reining in capital expenditure. That fell to $1.4bn in 2013 from $1.7bn the previous year and this year should be “somewhere around $1bn”, says Ho Kiam Kong, chief financial officer.Yet Wilmar cannot take all the credit. Some of its improved performance is due to structural changes beyond its control, as the moderating capacity in Chinese crushing shows, and shifts in market behaviour.Ephrem Ravi, analyst at Barclays, says that while the sugar acquisitions have been “a milestone in terms of operational and geographical distribution”, the seasonality of the crop inevitably will mean earnings volatility.In palm oil refining, which accounts for 48 per cent of group pre-tax profit, Wilmar is facing tougher competition from refiners in Indonesia adding capacity to take advantage of government tax incentives aimed at developing local industry. Wilmar’s refining margins shrank in the fourth quarter.The company has managed to offset that partially by expanding into higher-margin areas such as oleochemicals and speciality fats.However, Conrad Werner of Macquarie Securities warns: “We see [crude palm oil] margins as the more important fundamental driver for Wilmar and are cautious on them [amid] rising competition.”
134;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-02-25T01:49:01Z;Key Wilmar partner stakeholder provides western link;;Wilmar’s business empire may have its roots in Asia but its largest single shareholder after the Kuok family is firmly planted in the vast agricultural plains of the US Midwest: Archer Daniels Midland.The US agribusiness has a 17 per cent stake and was a key partner for Wilmar as the two expanded in China in the 1990s. Speculation persists that they may eventually combine.Wilmar’s shares are relatively tightly held, with only about 31 per cent publicly traded. The biggest shareholders are the wider Kuok family with 18 per cent, followed by ADM, with Kuok Khoon Hong and an associate, Martua Sitorus, holding a combined 22 per cent.Asked if he could envisage a deal between the two, Mr Kuok says: “We’ll get married one day. There are definitely a lot of areas [in which] we can work together. They have got good knowledge of what’s happening in the west, we’ve got good knowledge of what’s happening in the east.“But unless conditions for marriage are good, we’ll just work closely with each other. So far we have not found the right conditions,” Mr Kuok says.ADM and Wilmar were valued at about the same a year ago but the US group is valued at more than $26bn, while Wilmar’s market capitalisation is about $17bn.
135;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-02-16T19:21:25Z;Bumper profits threaten US ethanol support;;The US ethanol industry is enjoying bumper profits again, placing it in an awkward position as it battles plans by the Obama administration to scale back government support.Plentiful corn, the main US ethanol feedstock, and foreign demand from sugarcane ethanol-rich Brazil have allowed refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy and Valero to sharply increase output and biofuel incomes. The US is the world’s biggest ethanol producer.Their robust financial health contrasts with the bleak tone industry groups have adopted in response to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to reduce ethanol blending requirements for the first time.Growth Energy, an ethanol lobby group, warned last month that the EPA’s proposal will have a “significant adverse impact” on the industry, forcing plants to close, thousands to be sacked and billions of dollars in revenues to disappear.Green Plains, which annually sells more than 1bn gallons of ethanol, trebled net income in the fourth quarter of last year and expects the first half of 2014 to be its strongest on record.“Ethanol margins have expanded and demand is better than we’ve ever seen it,” Todd Becker, chief executive, told the Financial Times. While the government mandate is in the best interest of industry, “as a company, our perspective is we can compete in any environment”, he added.The biofuels division at Archer Daniels Midland, which makes more than 1.7bn gallons of ethanol per year at six plants, swung to a $134m operating profit in the fourth quarter, from a $94m loss a year earlier. “We are expecting strong margins going into 2014,” chief operating officer Juan Luciano told analysts this month.Valero, also the biggest oil refining company, reported a $269m operating profit at its ethanol division in the quarter, its highest ever.The strong performance comes despite a stagnant domestic market. The Energy Department forecasts drivers will consume about 135bn gallons of petrol this year, which leaves room for about 13.5bn gallons of ethanol blended at the usual 10 per cent rate. EPA has proposed slashing the corn ethanol mandate for the first time to 13.01bn gallons this year, down from the 14.4bn legal requirement.Net ethanol exports have filled the gap, rising 24 per cent in 2013 and flowing to countries including Canada, the Philippines, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates.“It is a broad spectrum of countries, and the list is getting bigger. The US is very competitive,” said Soren Schroder, chief executive of Bunge, which produces ethanol in at sugar mills in Brazil and has a stake in a US corn ethanol refinery.Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, said: “It’s difficult for me to construct a scenario where these proposed rules have anywhere near the kind of dire implications for the US domestic industry that lots of arguments have thrown around.”
136;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-02-09T12:50:43Z;Commodities traders take aim at rule to limit speculation;;Some of the world’s biggest commodities traders will take a strong line against a new plan to limit market speculation, arguing it would derail the everyday business of buying and delivering shipments of grain, oil and metals.A lobby group representing companies including Archer Daniels Midland, BP, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities intends to file a sweeping critique of the “position limits” rule proposed by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in formal comments due on Monday, according to a draft letter seen by the Financial Times.The commission should “reconsider and revise” its proposal and “avoid any wholesale redesign of the current regime”, the Commodity Markets Council’s draft letter said.The lobby group represents some of the largest global trading houses, which use futures markets to insure against a rise or fall in the price of inventories they buy and sell. It also includes futures exchanges and some proprietary trading groups and exchanges.Its membership includes speculators targeted by the CFTC proposal and merchants that are supposed to be exempted from it. Some trading houses also manage in-house hedge funds for investors.The CFTC rule aims to prevent “excessive speculation” from distorting commodity prices. Congress included it as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in response to notorious spikes in oil and wheat prices in 2008.Under the 164-page proposal, commodity merchants must certify they are holding large futures positions to hedge against physical inventories in order to claim the exemption from the limits. CMC members believe it will disallow positions opened ahead of pending purchases of commodities, such as yet-to-be harvested corn.“Our main concern is that, if it is done poorly, this rule has the perverse effect of taking away risk management tools that we’ve used in the ag and energy sector for decades,” said Gregg Doud, CMC president.If it is done poorly, this rule has the perverse effect of taking away risk management tools that we’ve used in the ag and energy sector for decadesPosition limits have been among the most contentious of the dozens of derivatives rules the CFTC has unveiled in the past three years. The current proposal is the regulator’s second attempt after a federal court rejected the initial version in response to a lawsuit brought by Wall Street.The EU is developing its own set of commodity position limits.The CFTC’s proposed rule invokes the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the silver market in the late 1970s and the spectacular collapse of hedge fund Amaranth over natural gas bets in 2006 to explain the need for the new limits, which apply to all futures and swaps linked to a list of 28 commodities.The CMC letter said the proposal would “exceed the mandate of Congress”, though Mr Doud said the group was not interested in litigating the issue.Bryan Dierlam, director of federal government affairs at Cargill, said: “We want the final rule to reflect the needs and concerns of the commercial marketplace”.
137;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2014-02-04T19:43:12Z;ADM hit by problems at international grain trading unit;;Archer Daniels Midland has undertaken an aggressive effort to steady its international grain trading subsidiary after it struggled in markets from South America to Asia.Problems at its Hamburg-based Alfred C Toepfer International unit ranged from a recently settled bribery probe to corn shipments that were turned away by Chinese inspectors.Toepfer weighed on otherwise strong results for New York-listed ADM, one of the world’s biggest agricultural trading houses. The company reported net profit of $374m, or $0.56 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from $510m or $0.77 per share a year earlier.ADM in part blamed “poor international merchandising”, a reference to Toepfer. “We fumbled and we will correct that,” Juan Luciano, chief operating officer, said.ADM owns 80 per cent of Toepfer, which was founded after the first world war. Of the 1.8m tonnes of merchant storage capacity ADM holds outside North America, most is controlled by Toepfer.“We had some execution issues, whether it was in Brazil, or Argentina, or Ukraine or China,” Mr Luciano said. “So we have launched a significant review of our operations.”Among the issues were a smaller wheat crop that led to export cancellations in Argentina, China’s decision to reject foreign corn grown from unapproved genetically modified seeds and arbitrage strategies that “didn’t go our way”, Mr Luciano said.ADM in December agreed to pay $54.3m to resolve charges that Toepfer had bribed government officials in Ukraine in return for tax refunds between 2002 and 2008.Mr Luciano said experts from ADM’s Decatur, Illinois headquarters were examining “some of the procedures that we have in the rest of the world”.US farmers compounded ADM’s difficulties in grain trading as they hoard corn until merchants offer higher prices.But cheaper corn aided ADM’s vast ethanol and sweetener businesses by reducing costs. “With the drop in corn prices, ethanol is a very competitive fuel, so the export demand has been very strong to traditional places and sometimes not so traditional places,” Mr Luciano said.Europe’s ethanol industry lobby claimed on Tuesday that Peru was sending more sugar-based ethanol to the continent and replacing its volumes with imports from the US.“It is apparent that US ethanol producers are ultimately gaining from this operation at the expense of European ethanol producers,” the ePure lobby group said.ADM shares closed at $38.23 in New York, down 1.75 per cent.
138;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-12-20T23:01:23Z;ADM to pay $54m to settle bribery charges;;Archer Daniels Midland has agreed to pay $54.3m to resolve civil and criminal charges that a subsidiary bribed government officials in Ukraine in return for tax refunds.The deal with US authorities ends an embarrassing chapter for the company, which has sought to polish its image after pleading guilty in a high-profile price-fixing scandal in the 1990s.However, it could portend increasing scrutiny of the global grain trading business, as previous actions under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act have led to industrywide sweeps. New York-listed ADM is one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders and processors, handling commodities from corn to cocoa.US authorities accused Alfred C Toepfer International, a Hamburg-based subsidiary, of paying $22m to Ukrainian officials to recover more than $100m in unpaid tax refunds.In one scheme, Toepfer made payments to a shipping company in the port of Odessa for artificially inflated invoices, a piece of which was passed as bribes to Ukrainian officials, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged. One set of disbursements was disguised “as prepayments for feed barley”, its complaint said.In another, the company drafted fake contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums that were paid to Ukraine officials.Toepfer’s Ukraine office pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and agreed to pay $17.8m in criminal fines, the Department of Justice said Friday.ADM also agreed to pay $36.5m to settle the SEC’s civil charges of failing to prevent the illicit payments. Toepfer also paid an unspecified penalty to German authorities.“ADM’s lacklustre anti-bribery controls enabled its subsidiaries to get preferential refund treatment by paying off foreign government officials,” said Gerald Hodgkins, associate director in the SEC enforcement division.The alleged bribes went on from 2002 to 2008 despite concerns raised inside ADM, including an email that questioned potentially illegal “donations” made to recover the tax refunds, authorities said.Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive since 2006, said the company hired outside law and accounting firms to investigate the transactions after becoming aware of them in 2008.“The conduct that led to this settlement was regrettable, but I believe we handled our response in the right way, and that the steps we took, including self-reporting, underscore our commitment to conducting business ethically and responsibly,” she said.Certain Toepfer executives were fired and ADM voluntarily co-operated with the SEC and DoJ, the complaint said.ADM in the 1990s pleaded guilty to charges it fixed lysine and citric acid prices in a case that resulted in prison terms for three former executives.In 2004, ADM paid $400m to settle a class-action lawsuit over sales of high-fructose corn syrup. The investigation leading up to the cases was the basis for a popular book and film, The Informant.
139;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-12-11T06:55:58Z;Australia coal: beggars can’t be choosers;Is coal deal waiver good news for other blocked bids?;ADM, your turn might yet come. Less than a fortnight after the Australian government blocked the takeover of GrainCorp by US agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland on shaky national interest grounds, Canberra has waived its demand for China’s Yanzhou Coal to sell down its holding in Yancoal, its local subsidiary.The link between the two boils down to what’s hot, and what’s not. Mining investment in Australia is still generally good but the prospects for coal are far chillier. As a sector, miners have attracted one-fifth, or $6.3bn, of cross-border deals into Australia this year, according to Dealogic. Over the past decade, the industry, including coal, has drawn more than 25 per cent of all overseas inflows. In 2009, when conditions were first imposed on Yanzhou following its takeover of Felix Resources, thermal coal prices were over $100 a tonne and coking coal was above $200 and on its way to $350. Moody’s thinks that prices next year will remain flat at about $85 and $100 respectively, hit by rising low-cost Indonesian supply and Aussie coking coal producers taking advantage of their weaker currency to raise output. Yancoal is roughly split between the two types. In August, prices forced it to take a A$343m impairment charge.Joe Hockey, Australia’s treasurer, mentioned the industry’s problems in his decision to drop the demand that Yanzhou sell down from 78 per cent to 70 per cent. Yanzhou has pledged to back Yancoal, extend loans and support expansion. Yikes. No wonder Yanzhou’s shares fell 2.6 per cent, taking their year-to-date losses past two-fifths. Perhaps being limited to a 25 per cent holding is not the worst thing for ADM. It restated its commitment to Australia after its GrainCorp bid was rebuffed. If Yanzhou is anything to go by, ADM might only have to wait until attention and money has moved on.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

This year, European deliveries fell 10 per cent, far worse than the wider market.Other unions on Friday attacked their senior management, accusing executives at Air France-KLM, the lossmaking airline, of “shocking” golden pensions.BlackBerry clears out senior managementBlackBerry, the struggling smartphone maker, on Monday cleared the ranks of its senior management as part of a reorganisation by interim chief executive John Chen, writes Daniel Thomas in London.Brian Bidulka, chief financial officer, will be replaced by James Yersh, the group’s former controller and head of compliance. The company’s chief marketing officer and chief operating officer will both leave and not be replaced.In all the analysis of the gold price falling to parity with virtual currency Bitcoin, one factor has been overlooked: the demise of DelBoy/1980s football manager chic. With fewer punters wishing to drip in 9ct gold, pawnbroker Albemarle & Bond is now melting down its medallions, chains and sovereign rings – and set to flood the market . . .Mr Chen, who was appointed as acting chief executive in mid-November, said he looked “forward to working more directly” with engineers and sales and marketing teams “to facilitate the BlackBerry turnround and to drive innovation”.Mr Chen was appointed after the group dropped a $4.7bn planned sale to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings. Mr Chen has the task of turning round the group that has had its share of the smartphone market plummet in the past few years.The management changes come alongside a wider restructuring of the business, which will cut 4,500 jobs, or 40 per cent of its workforce, in an attempt to curtail heavy losses.BlackBerry agreed a $1bn financing package led by Fairfax to help its turnround strategy.The management cull is the first big decision made by Mr Chen, who is seen by analysts as acting as a permanent, rather than temporary, chief. He took over from Thorsten Heins, who resigned after the failure of BlackBerry’s latest range of smartphones.Australia blocks ADM pursuit of GrainCorpWhen the Liberal-National coalition won the election earlier this year prime minister Tony Abbott promised Australia was open for business, write Neil Hume in London and Gregory Meyer in New York.Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader, might beg to differ after the government this week blocked its proposed A$3.4bn (US$3.1bn) takeover of GrainCorp on national interest grounds.If the prospect of spending Christmas slaving over a hot stove brings you out in a cold sweat, spare a thought for all at Ibstock Brick. Having spent the past five festive seasons with their feet up, they will be keeping their kilns alight all winter to meet demand from the Help to Buy housing scheme. Beats playing with Lego. Or not.The acquisition of GrainCorp, the biggest grain handler on the east coast of Australia, was central to the trader’s plan to broaden crop supplies away from the US. More than 70 per cent of ADM’s long-life assets are in the US, leaving it vulnerable to localised crop shortfalls as other agricultural exporters grow in importance.ADM now appears out of options in its pursuit of GrainCorp, one of the few remaining independent agricultural assets of size left on the market.“There are no appropriate conditions that would mitigate the national interest concerns [associated with the deal],” said Australia’s treasurer Joe Hockey. ADM had unveiled sweeteners for farmers and politicians opposed to the deal earlier in the week.While Mr Hockey has left the door open for ADM to increase its investment to 24.9 per cent of GrainCorp, from 19.85 per cent, that still will not deliver control.“We will look at that, though it’s too early to say what we will do,” ADM said, adding that it would continue to seek investments in other regions, including South America and eastern Europe.Co-op Bank drama shifts to hedge fund bond saleIt has been another eventful week for the Co-operative Group and its troubled banking unit, writes Patrick Jenkins, Banking Editor.Nothing could compare, in terms of titillation, with earlier revelations about the misdeeds of former chairman Paul Flowers – the methodist minister exposed as apparently knowing more about recreational drugs than the bank’s balance sheet. In recent days, the drama shifted to the investor base, with the Financial Times revealing on Thursday night that Aurelius Capital Management, the leading player in the restructuring of the bank, had sold its stake down to a negligible level.The US hedge fund, backed by a pool of other funds, led the campaign that was instrumental in forcing the Co-op Bank to abandon its mutual structure. The bank, faced with a regulatory capital hole of £1.5bn, was planning to swap debt for equity but, after pressure from the hedge funds, agreed to invert the normal ranking of bondholders to give more equity to the hedge funds. Commercial investors are set to end up with 70 per cent of the equity.It is unclear why Aurelius sold out so quickly, transferring its stake to Perry Capital, another US fund. Aurelius is thought to have controlled a bondholding of as much as £100m.Late Friday night, retail bondholders voted almost unanimously in favour of the rescue restructuring, with results from an early vote showing more than two-thirds of investors submitted their forms. Of those that did 99.91% supported the recapitalisation. The Co-op admitted on Thursday that the bank’s recent woes might have caused “some brand and reputational damage” and contributed to a loss of current account customers.Accor’s asset-hold plan disappoints investorsOne of French business’s biggest recent surprises was sprung this week in the basement of a slightly shabby hotel on the outskirts of Paris, where Sébastien Bazin told investors that hotel group Accor would not sell any more of its properties, writes Adam Thomson in Paris.Investors had been hoping – indeed expecting – that Accor’s new chief executive would push the company towards an “asset-lite” model, under which many of Accor’s competitors have sold assets to concentrate on the business of hotel management and franchising.Doing that would doubtless have meant a substantial extraordinary dividend for shareholders as the company looked to return the resulting cash. Accor, which has suffered management upheavals in recent years, owns nearly 300 hotels and leases about 1,100 more. In total, the French group operates about 460,000 hotel rooms.What would have been done by an outside owner if he had bought the assets, we will do internallyBut Mr Bazin, who until recently sat on Accor’s board as a representative of private equity firm Colony Capital, went the other way. As part of a much-awaited strategy announcement, he said that the company would keep all its 300-odd properties unless they were underperforming.He also said the company would divide into two units – the first specialising in management and franchises, and the second in property ownership and investing. “What would have been done by an outside owner if he had bought the assets, we Accor will do internally,” he told the FT.Mr Bazin said it made more sense, and would unlock more value over time, to maintain the assets. The onus is now on Mr Bazin to show investors that he can do it. On Wednesday, the day Mr Bazin unveiled the plan, Accor shares fell more than 7 per cent.
141;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-11-29T18:23:33Z;Wall Street suffers last-minute sell-off;;Friday 18:15 GMT. US stocks suffered a last minute sell-off at the end of a shortened trading week that dragged the S&P 500 back from a record high, as early bullishness following signs of strong consumer demand in the holiday shopping season faded.Broader sentiment in the markets this week was helped by mostly encouraging data on the US housing and labour markets – even though it did little to dispel speculation that the Federal Reserve could begin scaling down, or “tapering”, its stimulus measures before year-end.Oil prices were in focus at the start of the week following Iran’s agreement to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of sanctions.The S&P 500 equity index ended Friday’s half-session with a drop of 0.1 per cent – leaving it with a weekly gain of 0.1 per cent, and a rise of 2.8 per cent in November as a whole.Across the Atlantic, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended just a fraction firmer on the day, but still at a five-year peak. The index gained 0.6 per cent over the week and 1 per cent in the month.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 per cent on the day, but still managed a weekly rise of 1.8 per cent, reaching a near six-year high in the process and an impressive gain of 9.3 per cent in November.The strong performance of the exporter-sensitive Nikkei was largely down to the weakness of the yen.The currency hit a six-month low against the dollar overnight before steadying after the release of strong Japanese inflation data that appeared to vindicate the anti-deflation policies of Shinzo Abe, prime minister. The dollar rose about 1 per cent over the week to Y102.24 and about 4 per cent over the month, .“We expect dollar/yen to keep the pressure on the upside as the composition of portfolio flows appears consistent with renewed investor confidence in ‘Abenomics’,” said Hans Redeker, head of global FX strategy at Morgan Stanley.“We believe the way is now open for gains to target the Y103.75 May high.”Analysts at Danske Bank noted Japan was one of the few leading world economies to see consumer prices accelerating – and that this was the first time since 1998 that Japan has had higher inflation than the eurozone.“It shows what to do if you want inflation to go higher: print a lot of money,” Danske said.Indeed, while the latest eurozone consumer price data showed the year-on-year rate of inflation increasing slightly in November after the previous month’s worryingly soft outcome, money supply and lending figures released earlier in the week ratcheted up pressure on the European Central Bank to be even more accommodative.“The ECB will probably hold fire on taking any further action at its 5 December policy meeting given that it only cut its refinancing rate in November and inflation has moved up from its October low,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.The ECB will probably hold fire on taking any further action at its 5 December policy meeting given that it only cut its refinancing rate in November and inflation has moved up from its October low. However, we expect the ECB will take further action before long, most likely in the form of another Longer-Term Refinancing Operation, especially given latest data showing a further and deeper fall in bank lending to businesses in October.“However, we expect the ECB will take further action before long, most likely in the form of another Longer-Term Refinancing Operation, especially given latest data showing a further and deeper fall in bank lending to businesses in October.”In spite of such expectations, the euro remained resilient, rising 0.4 per cent against the dollar over the week to a one-month high above $1.36. The single currency also hit a five-year peak against the yen.Sterling also put in a strong performance amid growing optimism about the UK economic recovery, touching a two-year high against the dollar within a whisker of $1.64.The Bank of England unveiled an overhaul of its Funding for Lending Scheme that would scale down stimulus to the housing sector, a move seen by many as paving the way for a shift away from ultra-loose monetary policy.But there was no getting away from the fact that the Fed’s policy stance will be the biggest influence on global markets. While US data releases this week were mostly encouraging, the key is likely to be next week’s November jobs report.“We anticipate a gain of 180,000 in payrolls, which could just be enough to persuade the Fed to begin tapering its asset purchases later in December,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.But government bonds showed relatively little concern about such a prospect at this stage, with US and German debt holding within well-established ranges. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up 1 basis point on Friday at 2.74 per cent, down just 1bp over the week. The Bund yield slipped 1bp on the day and was down 5bp on the week at 1.69 per cent.Gold rallied off a four-month low of $1,227 an ounce hit at the start of the week. The metal on Friday rose $8 to $1,251, a $7 rise over the five-day period.In industrial commodities, Brent sank as much as $3 a barrel on Monday in response to Tehran’s nuclear deal. But it very quickly recovered and on Friday was trading at $110.71, down 15 cents on the day and just 34 cents on the week.Copper rose 0.5 per cent in London on Friday to $7,055 a tonne, but fell 0.6 per cent over the week and 2.7 per cent over the month.
142;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-11-28T23:32:50Z;Australia blocks ADM takeover of GrainCorp;;The Australian government has blocked Archer Daniels Midland’s A$3.4bn (US$3.1bn) takeover of GrainCorp, saying the acquisition was not in the national interest.The surprise decision follows months of wrangling between members of the ruling Liberal National coalition over the deal, which would have seen Illinois-based ADM take control of the largest grain handler in eastern Australia. The decision also comes just months after newly elected prime minister Tony Abbott declared that Australia was open for business.ADM had tried to win support of farmers and politicians wary of the deal with a package of measures aimed at showing the importance of the takeover for the agricultural trader’s plans to broaden crop supplies away from the US.Don Taylor, GrainCorp chairman, said: “Today’s events will have enduring implications that will be felt not only by our shareholders but by the entire industry. Australian agriculture has been prevented from realising the potential benefits from the significant capital ADM would have invested in the long term future of the industry.”Australia is usually the world’s third-largest wheat exporter after the US and Canada, and is close to fast-growing markets in Asia and the Middle East.ADM’s commitments included a pledge to invest additional A$200m in Australian agricultural infrastructure and cap rises in grain handling charges at silos and ports for three years.Joe Hockey, the Australian treasurer, said the proposed acquisition had been one of the most complex undertaken by the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which could not come to a consensus view on the sale.But after “long and careful deliberation” Mr Hockey said he had decided the takeover risked “undermining” public support for foreign investment and was therefore not in the national interest.“Many industry participants, particularly growers in eastern Australia, have expressed concern that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition and impede growers’ ability to access the grain storage, logistics and distribution network,” he said.“Given that the transition towards more robust competition continues and a more competitive network is still emerging, I consider that now is not the right time for a 100 per cent foreign acquisition of this key Australian business,” Mr Hockey said.The last big deal rejected by Australia was the proposed A$8.4bn takeover of ASX, the securities exchange, by Singapore Exchange just over three years ago.ADM’s takeover offer won the approval of GrainCorp’s board in April but has been fiercely opposed by some farm groups and the Nationals, who argue a sale could put Australia’s food security at risk. GrainCorp owns 280 grain storage facilities and seven of the eight ports that ship grain in bulk from the nation’s east coast.Mr Hockey’s decision to block the deal is a blow to ADM. Although it is one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities the company is looking to diversify its assets beyond the US. After an unprecedented wave of consolidation in the agricultural trading sector, GrainCorp was one of the few remaining assets of size and close to fast-growing markets in Asia.ADM agreed to pay GrainCorp shareholders A$12.20 per share in cash, plus a one-time A$1.00-per-share special dividend.Shares in GrainCorp lost 22 per cent of their value on Friday, closing at A$8.72.Mr Hockey said he had decided not to cap ADM’s investment in GrainCorp, which stands at 19.85 per cent.“In fact, to encourage ADM to demonstrate its commitment to the Australian grains industry through its continued investment in GrainCorp, I am inclined, based on current circumstances, to approve any proposals from ADM to increase its shareholding in GrainCorp up to an interest of 24.9 per cent.”ADM said it would look to work with GrainCorp to “maximise returns on our investment and create value for both companies”.Patricia Woertz, ADM chairman and chief executive, said: “Throughout this process, we worked constructively to create an arrangement that would be in Australia’s best interests and made substantial commitments to address issues that were important to stakeholders.”
143;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-11-27T04:51:16Z;ADM seeks to win over Australian farmers;;Archer Daniels Midland has tried to win the support of wary Australian farmers as its offer to buy GrainCorp faces intensifying political scrutiny in Canberra.The measures – new infrastructure spending and a temporary cap on handling fees – promised to farmers illustrate the importance of the A$3.4bn ($3.1bn) takeover for the agricultural trader’s plans to broaden crop supplies away from the US. GrainCorp is the largest grain handler in eastern Australia.The deal won the approval of GrainCorp’s board in April but faces questions from farmers suspicious of a foreign grain handler. Joe Hockey, Australia’s treasurer, has said he will decide whether to approve the takeover by December 17.ADM’s new package, announced early on Wednesday Sydney time, includes commitments to invest an additional A$200m in Australian agricultural infrastructure, especially railways, and cap rises in grain handling charges at silos and ports for three years.Ian Pinner, ADM grain president, said: “These investments and commitments – developed following extensive input from Australian stakeholders – will help ensure the GrainCorp network remains an attractive option for growers and third-party grain traders, and also remains a competitive source for global grain buyers.”GrainCorp shares rose 5.1 per cent to A$11.75 on the announcement. ADM in April agreed to pay shareholders A$12.20 per share in cash, plus a one-time A$1.00-per-share special dividend, before the deal closes.To proceed, ADM still needs the approval of Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which advises Mr Hockey, and China’s ministry of commerce. ADM is one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities but Patricia Woertz, chief executive, wants to diversify its assets beyond the US.Australia is usually the world’s third largest wheat exporter after the US and Canada, and is close to growing markets in Asia and the Middle East.GrainCorp was formed in 1916 as part of the government of New South Wales and privatised in 1992. Some members of parliament want the company to stay in Australian hands.“GrainCorp is to Australian agriculture what BHP is to our mining and resources sector and we should not so readily part with our iconic local assets,” Don Seaton, a large GrainCorp shareholder, wrote in The Australian newspaper last week.ADM said the new commitments would bring its total added capital investment in GrainCorp to A$250m, or “a 100 per cent increase in GrainCorp’s original A$250m capital expenditure budget prior to ADM’s proposal”.
144;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-11-10T12:35:42Z;‘Chocfinger’ looks to offload Armajaro Trading;;Armajaro, the commodity and hedge fund group co-founded by Anthony Ward, the cocoa trader dubbed “Chocfinger”, is seeking a buyer for its cocoa, coffee and sugar trading arm.Several suitors are understood to be circling Armajaro Trading, after a deal with a prospective buyer recently fell through, according to people familiar with the matter. The company was valued at about $200m-$300m last year, but a difficult trading environment for “soft commodities” such as cocoa, coffee and sugar, has since weighed on its profitability.The trading arm could be broken up and sold separately to different buyers, according to people familiar with the situation.Cocoa trading is capital intensive and margins have been volatile due to bad weather and bouts of political instability in key growing areas, while coffee and sugar prices have slumped due to plentiful supplies.Some large agricultural commodity traders have been looking to shed their soft commodity operations. Bunge, one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities, recently put its sugarcane milling business on the block, while Archer Daniels Midland is in talks to sell its cocoa operations to Cargill.London-based Armajaro came under the spotlight in 2010 when the hedge fund run by Mr Ward – a veteran in the cocoa trading business known in the industry for his high profile cocoa trades – bought a large quantity of cocoa beans, leading to a surge in prices. Over the past few years, he has been focused on his hedge fund, CC+, which along with other commodity funds are owned by Armajaro Asset Management, which sits alongside the trading arm, buying physical commodities from producers and selling to processors.Mr Ward’s move away from the physical trading arm has coincided with difficult times for the operations. In the 12 months to September last year, Armajaro Trading reported a net loss of $10.3m, compared with a profit of $24.3m in the 17 months to the end of September in 2011.In 2012, Mr Ward and co-founder Richard Gower, along with director David Tregar provided Armajaro Holdings, the parent group, with a capital injection of $20m through a share issuance.The trading arm’s talks to buy Plexus Cotton, a Liverpool based cotton merchant, broke down earlier this year, while it changed two chief executives in quick succession this year.It is unclear what would happen to the 6 per cent stake held by IFC, the investment arm of the World Bank, which invested in Armajaro Trading last year. Mr Ward and co-founder Richard Gower own the bulk of the company, with the remainder held by management and employees.Armajaro declined to comment. The IFC was unavailable for comment.
145;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-10-29T17:20:01Z;ADM warns against cut in biofuels mandate;;Archer Daniels Midland has cautioned US officials against a change to biofuels policy as Washington considers cutting an ethanol consumption mandate for the first time.The comments from ADM, one of world’s biggest grain traders and processors, show the importance of biofuels to the economics of the agricultural sector. Since the US Congress dictated sharply higher biofuel use for drivers in 2007, farm incomes and corn prices have hit records. ADM invested $1.3bn in ethanol plants in Iowa and Nebraska.The White House is reviewing reductions to the US biofuels mandate in the face of tepid demand for petrol and oil companies’ refusal to blend more than 10 per cent ethanol into motor fuel.Juan Luciano, chief operating officer, said: “If there were changes in policy I would be highly disappointed, since we invested based on a policy and we invested for the long term.”His statements came as ADM’s bioproducts division reported an operating profit of $71m in the third quarter ended September 30, reversing a loss of $26m a year earlier.Market conditions are otherwise improving for ethanol producers. The price they pay for corn has declined with a record US crop that ADM estimated at 14bn bushels. ADM can produce 1.72bn gallons of ethanol annually at eight plants, or 13 per cent of overall US capacity. Weaker competitors have idled their operations.But the US Environmental Protection Agency is considering whether to reduce its corn ethanol consumption mandate from 14.4bn gallons to 13bn gallons in 2014 as weak petrol markets and the oil industry’s aversion to the fuel limit blended volumes. The agency said its proposal was “undergoing inter-agency review”.ADM also said that sales of soyabean oil, a feedstock for biodiesel, were buoyed as the fuel’s refiners increased output before an industry tax credit expires at the end of the year.“Certainly it will be a negative if the subsidy is not renewed,” Mr Luciano said.ADM said the huge corn crop was making ethanol cheaper relative to petrol and should encourage sales of “E85” – fuel made with up to 85 per cent ethanol.The company’s overall net profit was $476m, or $0.72 per share, in the third quarter, up from $182m, or $0.28 per share, in the same period a year earlier.Shares rose 3.8 per cent to $41.36 as ADM outlined a “very pronounced increase in profits” in its agricultural services division next year as silos fill up with grain.
146;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-10-10T23:12:53Z;US eyes cutting ethanol usage;;The US would ratchet back its ethanol consumption mandate for the first time under a proposal that would ease costs for oil refiners and cool demand for farmers’ corn.The White House is considering a plan to require 15.21bn gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be blended into motor fuels next year, well below the 18.15bn mandate dictated by Congress.The proposal, outlined in draft documents seen by the Financial Times, comes almost six years after lawmakers passed the mandate in an attempt to wean the US from foreign oil and back income for corn belt states.This policy crashed into the unexpected reality of weaker fuel consumption and an oil industry reluctant to sell petrol containing more than 10 per cent ethanol, making the targets unachievable in a problem known as the “blend wall”.The Environmental Protection Agency’s preferred option would hit not only Brazilian sugarcane growers, who export ethanol to the US, but for the first time cut required volumes of ethanol refined from corn. Less than 13bn gallons of corn ethanol would have to be sold under the draft proposal, below levels in force in the past two years and well below the 14.4bn statutory mandate for 2014.This would hit US ethanol refiners, such as Archer Daniels Midland and Poet as well as the farmers who sell them 35 per cent of the nation’s corn crop.EPA has sent its draft proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review and has not released it for public comment. The agency, largely closed owing to the federal government shutdown, did not respond to requests for comment.A September 6 document indicates EPA plans to invoke powers to declare “inadequate domestic supply” as a way to justify the deviation from the congressional mandate. The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuels lobby group, said this would be “patently unlawful”.“There is no basis to suggest that the strict criteria for a general waiver are met today,” said Bob Dinneen, RFA president.The renewable fuel and oil sectors have been at war with one another over the biofuels mandate, even as fuel retailers need some ethanol to meet emissions and octane requirements.Oil refiners’ shares responded positively to reports of the proposal. Valero, which also runs ethanol plants, closed 4.7 per cent higher, while HollyFrontier was up 6.1 per cent, Marathon was up 5.2 per cent and Phillips 66 was up 2.9 per cent.The American Petroleum Institute argues that the law’s requirements should be waived for next year on the grounds that because of the limit to ethanol use set by the blend wall, the mandate would cause “severe economic harm,” including “significant increases in the cost of fuel and substantial fuel supply shortages in the United States”.Patrick Kelly of the API said if the reported EPA proposals were confirmed, “directionally they’re doing the right thing, although we just think they could have gone a little further”.Jason Bordoff of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy said that if the figures were confirmed, he would expect a sharp fall in the price of the biofuels credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers, used by fuel suppliers to meet their regulatory obligations.“This potential reduction is more than what many in the market were expecting,” he said. “Industry could comply with these renewable fuel obligations without the incentive of a high RIN price to build out E85 infrastructure or produce more biomass-based diesel.”
147;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-10-10T08:58:37Z;Chocolate whispers: ADM and Cargill’s antitrust headache;Speculation is swirling about possible divestments needed to satisfy the European Commission;With Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland expected to agree to a second M&A cocoa deal in a year, things are hotting up in the world of chocolate.Numbers bandied around by executives and traders go as high as $2bn, but few industry participants believe Cargill – the number two in the cocoa processing industry – will be able to buy the whole of the operations of ADM – ranked number three.A straight merger would mean that the combined Cargill/ADM operations would have 35 per cent of the processing market, with Swiss group Barry Callebaut, which bought Petra for $860m this year, accounting for 25 per cent.Both Cargill and ADM have an extensive production network in Europe, and industry chatter has focused on what would need to be divested in order to satisfy the European Commission.Since Reuters reported the talks between the two companies last week, various scenarios have been flying around on who would buy which divestment. If every rumour came true “ Cargill wouldn’t be left with anything”, chuckles an industry veteran.There are a handful of second-tier cocoa traders and processors both in Europe and Asia that are making their mark in the global cocoa industry. Malaysia’s Guan Chong is rapidly growing, while Ecom Trading, the privately owned agricultural trading house, and Olam of Singapore are also making their presence known.One of the likely divestments is ADM’s deZaan operations in the Netherlands, which is known for high-quality products made from grinding cocoa beans.“DeZaan is the jewel in the crown,” says Jonathan Parkman, co-head of agriculture at commodities brokers Marex Spectron in London.ADM’s deZaan plant north of Amsterdam is just across the River Zaan from Cargill’s own processing facilities, making ownership of both probably impossible.Cocoa processors produce cocoa butter, powder and liquor from the beans, and with its knowhow to create different flavours, colours and qualities, deZaan has long been regarded as a leader in the powder business.However, talk of a sale comes at a time when prices for cocoa powder – used in drinks, cakes and biscuits – are almost at four and a half year lows as Asian growth demand has slowed, distorting potential valuations.In the rest of Europe, the two companies also overlap in Germany and Belgium, while in South America executives expect Cargill to divest ADM’s processing facility in Ilhéus, Brazil, where both companies have plants. Industry observers are also wondering about the fate of production facilities in Africa, where both companies have processing plants in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.Cargill and ADM declined to comment.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times.
148;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-10-09T17:42:34Z;Cargill net profits down 41 per cent at drought effects;;Cargill reported a drop in net profits as supply scarcity resulting from last year’s US drought held back its global grain trading and processing business.The world’s biggest agricultural trading house by volume reported net income of $571m in the first quarter to the end of August, down 41 per cent from a record quarter of $975m a year earlier.The US company’s origination and processing business, which buys grains, oilseeds, cotton and sugar from farmers and ships them worldwide, was the biggest contributor to results, but profits declined from last year as grain handling volumes shrank.The agricultural trading sector has been challenged by low grain supplies in the US, where the extreme drought of 2012 diminished harvests. Cargill, along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Glencore Xstrata, dominate international flows of food commodities.As of September, US corn stocks were the lowest since 1996, while soyabean stocks were the lowest in four years.“Cargill did an excellent job managing the remaining effects of last year’s severe drought and smaller crops,” said Greg Page, the privately owned group’s chief executive.Meagre grain stocks led spot prices to rise far above prices for future delivery, forming treacherous conditions for managing assets such as silos and processing plants.In the coming year, the situation is expected to change as the US eyes bumper corn and soyabean crops that will keep assets operating closer to capacity.Massive crops in Brazil have also buoyed volumes. Cargill noted that its South American origination and processing businesses “performed well, utilising the region’s big crops to serve strong export demand”.Cargill’s food ingredients business, which includes mills that produce flour and corn syrup, also saw a moderate fall in profit from a year ago and was the second-largest contributor to results.Results at the company’s industrial and financial services segment were “down significantly” from a strong quarter last year, with Cargill emphasising “weak performance” by its energy businesses “due to the combined effects of mild weather, soft demand and low market volatility”.David MacLennan, who is set to take over as Cargill’s chief executive on December 1, has said he wants to invest more in physical trading of energy commodities such as coal, oil and natural gas.Cargill, owned by about 80 members of the family that founded it 148 years ago, does not provide detailed information about segment performance. First-quarter revenues of $33.8bn were the same as the year before.
149;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-10-08T06:29:27Z;Cargill in final talks over ADM cocoa unit;;Cargill, the world’s top agricultural trading house, is in final negotiations for the purchase of rival Archer Daniels Midland’s $2bn cocoa business, although a potential deal is likely to face challenges from antitrust authorities in Europe.The combination of Cargill, number two in the cocoa processing business, and ADM, which ranks at number three, would catapult the merged operations to the top spot with more than 35 per cent of the $13bn market. People familiar with the situation said that if a deal were agreed, Cargill would have to dispose of some assets in order to satisfy competition concerns.A potential acquisition by Cargill will effectively create a duopoly in the cocoa processing industry, which turns beans into cocoa butter and powder, with the Cargill and ADM combination and Swiss group Barry Callebaut – which bought the cocoa ingredients division of Singapore’s Petra Foods– accounting for almost two-thirds of the market.With substantial overlap in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, antitrust issues could yet derail a potential deal.The European Commission’s approval of Swiss cocoa group Barry Callebaut’s $860m purchase of Petra this year was based on the existence of competition from ADM and Cargill. As part of its approval in June, the commission said: “The merged entity would also continue to face competition from two strong competitors (ADM and Cargill) as well as from a sufficiently large number of smaller players.”In addition, both ADM and Cargill have processing plants in Brazil, Ivory Coast and Ghana, although there is little overlap in the US.Any deal would also raise worries among chocolate makers, such as Nestlé and Mars. The talks between Cargill and ADM come as demand for luxury chocolate is recovering in the US and Europe, the largest chocolate market, and prices for cocoa ingredients have surged.“[Cargill and Barry Callebaut] will have pricing power,” said Kona Haque, commodities analyst at Macquarie in London.With its latest results showing a $28m operating loss for the six months to June, compared with a $211m profit the year before, the volatility in the operation’s profitability has also led to variable valuations among potential bidders for ADM’s cocoa business.The deal is the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the global agribusiness sector during the past few years as players have sought to build up their positions in the food supply chain.Shuanghui of China has acquired Smithfield, the leading US pork producer, for $7bn, while Glencore and Marubeni of Japan have both made purchases of grains businesses. ADM itself has agreed a A$3bn takeover of Australian grain handler GrainCorp.A sale of ADM’s cocoa business will refocus its agricultural portfolio on bulk cereals – such as corn and soyabeans – at a time when demand from emerging markets, including China, is growing sharply. Any proceeds from a sale could be used towards the GrainCorp acquisition. The disposal of the cocoa operations will also help ADM’s return on capital, according to industry executives.Both Cargill and ADM declined to comment.
150;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Drought of 2012 hangs over Louis Dreyfus;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities reported a double-digit drop in first-half profits after the continued effects of last year’s devastating US drought hit trading and processing of the agricultural trader’s grains and oilseeds business.The privately owned company, which along with Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill, dominate the world’s food commodity flows, said net income, excluding discontinued operations, fell 13 per cent to $258m in the six months to June.Including Biosev, its Brazilian sugar operations that was moved to a separate holding vehicle at the end of last year, net income fell 45 per cent.Last year’s poor harvest in the US has meant that the country’s inventories of grains and oilseeds have been at the lowest in decades, limiting processing and trading opportunities for the agricultural trading houses.In July, Bunge said second-quarter net income had plunged 58 per cent, and it was also forced to close a soyabean processing plant because of a lack of supplies.Many traders were also hit by problems in South America, where trading was hampered by transport problems in Brazil and “sales strikes” by farmers in Argentina hoarding supplies in the face of rising inflation and currency fluctuation concerns.Dreyfus, headquartered in the Netherlands, said tight supplies in North America because of last year’s harvest had led to “limited export and crushing opportunities”.Meanwhile, a good crop in South America translated to more exports, but also “drove logistics issues at origin”.Operating results at the company’s “protein” division, which includes oilseeds, grains and vegetable oils, fell almost a third to $428m, while the “tropicals” business, which includes sugar, cotton and coffee, fell 44 per cent because of discontinuing operations.The company said that its sugar division had “enjoyed growth, both organic and also due to the recent acquisition of Imperial Sugar, whose distribution brands performed well”.The results were the first under Ciro Echesortu, who took over as chief executive in June. Mr Echesortu, who was head trader and operating chief, succeeded Serge Schoen, who was appointed chairman of the commodities trading house last month.Dreyfus tapped the public capital markets last year for the first time in its 160-year history, issuing bonds. Analysts said that Mr Schoen’s appointment could pave the way for Dreyfus to consider a potential float.
151;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-09-25T21:34:56Z;Ex Louis Dreyfus Commodities chief takes chair;;Serge Schoen, the former chief executive of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, has been appointed chairman of the trading house’s board, as the group explores options for growth.Mr Schoen, who has been at the helm of the privately owned trading house for the past eight years, retired from the post in June, although he retained his board seat.Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, chairman and the biggest shareholder of the overall group, said Mr Schoen would “concentrate on the strategic decisions connected to the long-term future of our company”.The appointment comes as other leading agricultural commodities traders have made changes at the top. Cargill recently announced David MacLennan as its new chief executive, while Bunge has also appointed a new chief.Louis Dreyfus is the “D “ in the “ABCD” group of companies, along with ADM, Bunge and Cargill, which dominate global flows of food commodities. Over the past five years, trading houses have faced financing challenges, and companies have tapped public capital markets, issuing bonds and equity.One observer said Mr Schoen’s appointment as chairman of the trading house would fuel speculation that Louis Dreyfus was considering a potential float. In the past, Louis Dreyfus has ruled out a public listing, but earlier this year, Mr Schoen told the Financial Times that the options were open: “I’m not sure that in the next phase, the next five years, we can necessarily stay private,” he said.Mrs Louis-Dreyfus said that “over the next few years, the commodities industry was expected to undergo significant transformation”, adding that the company was “constantly working on adapting its strategic positioning to the new challenges, in order to keep growing and continue to deliver extraordinary results”.● Gunvor reported a 4.4 per cent rise in half-year net profits for the six months to June. In a filing to the Singapore stock exchange, the Geneva-based commodity trading house said it made net profits of $162.6m, on revenues of $47.7bn, which were down slightly on the first half of the year. People familiar with the situation said the rise in net profits reflected better oil trading.This article has been amended to clarify Louis Dreyfus’s corporate structure
152;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;E85 hopes up as US refines biofuels needs;;The US ethanol industry is reaching for a stronger brew in a last, best hope to avert a looming quandary in federal biofuels policy.“E85” – fuel made with up to 85 per cent ethanol and a relative tincture of petroleum-based gasoline – is finally becoming competitive with conventional petrol in some parts of the US, analysts say.Better sales of the little-used fuel could reignite stagnant production at refineries owned by companies including Archer Daniels Midland, Koch Industries, Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Poet.But higher volumes would depend in part on the soaring price of government-authorised biofuel credits that some oil refiners complain will cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.E85’s prospects are brightening as the Obama administration prepares its biofuels blending requirements for 2014. For the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency has said it will reduce targets from statutory levels as consumption falls short.“Higher sales of E85 is one of the easy ways you can break the ‘blend wall,’ ” says Tom Buis of Growth Energy, an ethanol industry group.As it stands, most of the energy industry refuses to make finished petrol with more than 10 per cent ethanol. Several factors are behind the more favourable outlook for E85.The prospect of a record US corn harvest has pushed wholesale prices of corn-based ethanol down to about $1.63 per gallon for 2014, according to fuel price information service GasBuddy. Wholesale gasoline blendstock prices have meanwhile hovered at about $2.50 per gallon.“Corn prices have decoupled from oil to the extent that E85 should be competitive in certain places,” says Ben Montalbano of the Energy Policy Research Foundation in Washington.Juan Luciano, ADM chief operating officer, told analysts last month that the “market today provides an incentive for people to blend ethanol”, with volumes trebling for distributors “pricing it correctly”.Another impetus is the volatile market for biofuel credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (Rins). The biofuel industry says the price of these credits, up 1,800 per cent from a year ago, is crucial to production companies to blend higher volumes of ethanol. Ethanol Rins cost about 56 cents per gallon last week.Fuel blenders are granted a Rin with each gallon of ethanol they blend and are free to sell them on the open market. This enables blenders with a retail network to turn the windfall from Rin sales into a further E85 discount at the pump.“The Rin price going up means you pass that savings on to the consumer,” says Mr Buis.However, E85 faces multiple hurdles. Only about 3,000 service stations sell it and only “flexible fuel vehicles,” numbering between 8m-14m depending on the data source, are designed to burn it. E85 also contains about 25 per cent less energy per gallon than regular petrol, forcing drivers to fill up more often.But the US Energy Information Administration wrote last week that in the Midwest, the heart of the Corn Belt, recent declines have made E85 prices almost equal to regular gasoline on an energy-adjusted basis.Tony Bartys, chief operating officer at CST Brands, says just 40 of the petrol and convenience store chain’s more than 1,000 US stores sell E85, but the company is adding E85 pumps at new stores.“As a retailer, I am willing to sell anything that will power a car if it makes sense,” Mr Bartys says.His company was recently spun out of refiner Valero Energy, the largest gasoline producer in the US and also a leading ethanol producer. Valero says Rins will cost it about $600m-$800m this year and has asked the White House to waive the biofuel mandate.The oil industry believes high Rin prices will lead to higher petrol prices as refiners pass the cost along to consumers.“Voters would not be pleased with any system that artificially increases gasoline prices to try to lead them towards a fix for the ethanol industry,” Valero says.
153;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-09-18T17:03:31Z;Bunge, Cargill, Dreyfus and ADM face new challenges;;The people in charge of feeding the world are changing. Last week Cargill named the ninth chief executive in its 148-year history, a move that followed new CEO appointments at rivals Bunge and Louis Dreyfus Commodities in June.The leadership changes come as the “ABCD” companies that dominate global agricultural flows – Bunge, Cargill and Dreyfus plus Archer Daniels Midland – face a new set of challenges.The quartet are vital to the world food trade, using hard-to-duplicate networks of silos, ports, ships and farmer relationships to buy in surplus and sell to customers ranging from food groups such as Nestlé to Egypt’s state wheat buying board.They are not the only companies in the sector – Glencore Xstrata, the world’s biggest commodities trader, has expanded in agriculture – but they are the biggest.The world’s food import bill will total $1.09tn this year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates. ABCD revenue was collectively $348.7bn in their most recently reported 12-month periods. The sum includes businesses other than grain trading.Trade is “increasingly playing an important role in helping countries to cover their needs”, says Abdolreza Abbassian, senior FAO grains economist.Mayhem reigned in agriculture markets between 2010-12. Corn and soyabean prices surged to records last year as drought withered the US and Brazilian crops. In 2010, wheat prices spiked after Moscow imposed a cereals export ban in a panic over a heatwave in Russian growing regions.The volatility favoured the trading arms at the companies. Cargill reported record profit in the year that included the export ban. But as a group, the ABCD delivered erratic results, with profit at ADM, Bunge and Cargill all falling sharply in 2012.Now, a different scenario awaits Cargill’s David MacLennan and the new chief executives. The world is this year expected to produce record corn, wheat and soyabean crops. The prospect will damp the price swings that traders thrive on, but may still reap a net benefit to the companies.“At the end of the day, lower grain volumes are not as good for overall performance for these companies as more grain volumes,” says Chris Johnson, credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s, which last week raised its outlook on Cargill’s debt rating from negative to stable, citing rising profit.Argentina’s farmers are hoarding soyabeans. Months after harvest, sales have been slow in the world’s top exporter of the meal and vegetable oil crushed from the oilseed.Negotiations between farmers and merchants have long been a feature of agricultural markets. But high grain prices have strengthened growers’ bargaining power, squeezing trading house margins.continue readingThis is because the ABCD companies sunk billions into processing facilities in recent years. These assets became costly, underused millstones when grain fell short. Now, the prospect of higher grain stocks will put them to the test.“In varying degrees, all four of them have tried to become something more than trading companies,” says Bob Kohlmeyer, president emeritus at consultant World Perspectives and a former Cargill executive.Mr MacLennan, who is set to become CEO at privately owned Cargill on December 1 after being promoted from president and chief operating officer, says the majority of the company’s investments are now taking place outside the US. These include processing businesses such as a $40m plant to turn chickens into McNuggets for McDonald’s in Russia.“We use the phraseology ‘diverse, balanced and resilient’,” Mr MacLennan says. “The fact is, there may be struggles in one part of the world or one industry. But in other parts of the world, other geographies and industries, we’re doing quite well.”Soon after Soren Schroder stepped in as chief at Bunge at the beginning of June he said returns “must improve” and announced a $200m cut in capital expenditure to $1bn.Bunge this year idled a Kansas soyabean processing plant as US stocks of the oilseed dwindled too low to keep running. But Mr Schroder sees the possibility of big surpluses and lower prices, which he says will be “good for global consumption and customers”.ADM, which is poised to spend A$3bn ($2.8bn) to purchase Australia’s GrainCorp, meanwhile continues to be led by seven-year chief executive Patricia Woertz.ADM owns an asset-heavy empire of biofuel refineries and mills, with $23.4bn in gross property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet. It is also the most concentrated of the four in the US, where drought decimated the 2012 corn crop. The assets have dragged on earnings, with ethanol plants losing money until recently.“We have all these assets that we’ve talked about for the year that are not being utilised,” Craig Huss, chief risk officer, told analysts last month. Now, “we will be filling those assets”.Ciro Echesortu was head trader and operating chief at privately owned Dreyfus before becoming chief executive at the end of June. Dreyfus is in the middle of a transformation, tapping the public capital markets for the first time in its more than 160-year history, to finance acquisitions and investments.Louis Dreyfus’ executives call the company “asset-medium”, with fixed assets of $3.4bn.“They have much more of a trading focus,” says Philippe de Lapérouse, managing director at consultancy HighQuest Partners. However, the company plans to invest $5bn over five years “to master the entire distribution chain, from the farmer to refining as well as connection with final consumers”, its annual report says.Despite all the changes, the companies are not abandoning trading. World trade in grains and oilseeds rose 48 per cent to 453m tonnes in the past decade and will expand further in the next 10 years, according to the US Department of Agriculture.“Trading is still a very important competency at these companies, but it’s become a bolt-on activity to the processing operations,” adds Gary Taylor, former president of Cargill Cotton, who now heads an investment group.
154;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-08-06T12:34:34Z;ADM profits fall as it raises provision to resolve bribery probe;;Archer Daniels Midland reported lower net profit after losing money on currency hedges and setting more funds aside to resolve a protracted foreign corruption probe.However, signs of strength in its US corn ethanol business led the New York-listed company – one of the so-called “ABCD” of agricultural trading houses that shuttle commodities from corn to soyabeans between continents – to report improved quarterly operating results.Rival Bunge reported sharply lower profit last week, while Cargill is set to release results Wednesday. Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the fourth member of the group, does not reveal quarterly results.ADM is one of the largest ethanol producers in the US. The industry has been squeezed by short corn supplies after last year’s devastating drought, but ADM’s plants have returned to profitability as weaker operations were idled.“The team managed well through this period, as tight US crop supplies reduced volumes,” said Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive. “Also, corn results improved amid volatile ethanol industry conditions.”The company reported net profit for the second quarter of $223m, or 34 cents per share, down 21 per cent from $284m, or 43 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.Adjusted for one-off items including a $51m loss on currency hedges related to ADM’s pending acquisition of Australian wheat and barley merchant GrainCorp, earnings per share were 46 cents, up from 38 cents in the year-before period.ADM also boosted the amount it has set aside to resolve a longstanding foreign corruption probe by $29m to $54m. The company has been in discussions with the US Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission over possible violations of a law that prohibits the bribing of foreign officials. The transactions at issue date to 2008 and earlier.
155;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-07-25T13:04:08Z;Bunge profits dive as weather saps crops;;Bunge, one of the world’s biggest traders of agricultural commodities, reported a sharp decline in quarterly profit as the lingering effects of last year’s harsh weather shaved trading and processing volumes.The company, which competes with Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Glencore and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, said net income fell 58 per cent in the second quarter to $110m, or 75 cents per share, from $265m, or $1.78 per share, one year before.The steepest fall in profit came in Bunge’s agribusiness division, which shuttles soyabeans, corn and other crops between continents and processes them into food products. Earnings before interest and tax fell to $170m from $301m.Soren Schroder, Bunge’s newly installed chief executive, said: “We navigated the choppy markets well, but faced some challenges in North America, Europe and Argentina, which suffered from the continued effects of last year’s poor oilseed and grain crops.”Adjusted for a gain from the sale of Bunge’s stake in a soya ingredients company in the second quarter of last year, the segment’s results were off a more modest 21 per cent.The company said it was hurt by tight sunflower and rapeseed supplies in Europe, poor crops in the Black Sea, weak US grain exports and Argentine farmers who have been reluctant to give up stocks to merchants such as Bunge.The company pared losses in its Brazilian sugar business, where Bunge has invested heavily in recent years.Bunge also said it planned to reduce its 2013 capital investment by $200m to $1bn. “Projects that more immediately improve efficiencies and competitiveness – and that generate faster payback – will be priorities for Bunge,” Mr Schroder said.
156;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-06-20T21:27:10Z;ADM seeks buyer for $2bn cocoa unit;;Archer Daniels Midland, the global agricultural trading house, is looking to offload its $2bn cocoa and chocolate business, in the food industry’s latest M&A deal.ADM – which is the “A” of the so-called “ABCD” group of companies that dominate the world of agricultural trading, along with Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities – has approached a number of potential buyers, according to people familiar with the matter.ADM said: “We are currently engaged in discussions about the potential sale of our cocoa business. These discussions are ongoing, and there can be no assurance that they will result in the signing of a transaction or definitive agreement.”The company is number three in cocoa bean processing, handling almost a fifth of global supplies, and its cocoa business is worth about $2bn, according to industry executives.Its decision to sell the operation comes as agricultural companies seek to increase their exposure to the rapidly growing grain trade, which is being driven by China’s booming demand for food.Over the past 18 months, a series of mergers and acquisitions have taken place in the global agribusiness sector. Shuanghui of China made a $7bn bid for Smithfield, the leading US pork producer, earlier this month, while Glencore and Marubeni of Japan have both made purchases of grains businesses. ADM itself has agreed a A$3bn takeover of Australian grain handler GrainCorp.A sale of ADM’s cocoa business will refocus its agricultural portfolio on grains – such as corn, and oilseeds, including soyabeans – at a time when demand from emerging markets, including China, is growing sharply. Any proceeds from a sale could be used towards the purchase of GrainCorp.The move comes as the Illinois-based group looks to improve its return on capital. Cocoa and chocolate operations are capital intensive and margins have been volatile due to bad weather and bouts of political instability in key growing areas. In its latest quarterly results, ADM reported operating losses of $22m in “cocoa and other operations”, having made an operating profit of $159m in the same quarter last year.“[ADM] are not desperate, but they seem to be no longer interested in the business,” said one person who had been approached.ADM first sounded out potential purchasers about 18 months ago, and has held more discussions recently, people familiar with the situation said. The size of the business has limited the number of potential suitors.The cocoa processing industry, which turns beans into cocoa butter and powder, is dominated by Swiss group Barry Callebaut – which bought the cocoa ingredients division of Singapore’s Petra Foods – and the US-based Cargill and ADM. Together, they account for almost two-thirds of the market.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in Hong Kong and Gregory Meyer in New York
157;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-06-18T16:54:05Z;Soyabean near-term price premium boosted;Aftermath of last year’s brutal US drought shapes market;A depleted outlook for soyabean stocks is boosting the premium for supplies available in the near future, suggesting volatile trading ahead in Chicago’s futures markets.CBOT July soyabeans rose 1 per cent to $15.27½ a bushel on Tuesday. The contract sold for $2.33 above beans to be delivered in November, a premium that has expanded 71 per cent in the past three months.Soyabeans are crushed into vegetable oil and meal, and are used to feed swine and chickens.Traders’ willingness to pay a high price for immediately available supplies reflects the aftermath of last year’s brutal US drought, which reduced the harvest, and strong demand.Soyabean futures are also part of commodity indices such as the Dow Jones-UBS.The widening premium for spot contracts will boost returns for passive investors as they sell expiring higher priced futures and buy cheaper ones.US soyabean processing plants operated by companies such as Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge increased their monthly “crush” to 122.631m bushels in May, from 120.113m in April, the National Oilseed Processors Association reported this week.The US Department of Agriculture projects domestic soyabean stocks will dwindle to 125m bushels by September 1, the lowest in nine years.Don Roose, president of broker US Commodities in West Des Moines, Iowa, said: “We’re at what we believe is the pipeline minimum. We can’t go any lower than that just because we need that much beans in the pipeline.”Prices of spot soyabean markets have been kept from rising further thanks to Brazil, which has harvested its own bumper crop and in May exported record monthly volume of the oilseed.The US, the biggest producer, is expected to import 25m bushels this year to supplement scarce domestic supplies.Prices for beans for imminent delivery will probably stay strong to force plants to conserve supplies before the US harvest.“We have to slow down the crush,” Mr Roose said.Bunge’s massive processing plant in Council Bluffs, Iowa, was on Tuesday bidding $15.8125 a bushel for soyabeans, well above futures markets, according to its website.Spot markets could see fevered trading next week when the USDA updates quarterly estimates of national soyabean stocks on June 28. The numbers will force traders to reassess available supplies.After September, the soyabean market is expected to cool as the government forecasts US farmers will harvest their biggest crop ever of 3.39bn bushels.
158;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-06-17T08:16:24Z;Louis Dreyfus names new chief with Serge Schoen set to retire;;"Serge Schoen is set to retire as chief executive of Louis Dreyfus Commodities later this month after eight years in the post, during which he boosted the profitability of the privately owned agricultural commodities trading house.Dreyfus, as the company is known, and its rivals Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill are the “ABCD” group of companies that dominate global flows of food commodities.Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, chairman and the biggest shareholder, said in a statement the company had seen “exceptional growth” during the past few years under Mr Schoen. “It has more than tripled its turnover, multiplied its net results tenfold and increased its shareholder funds sixfold,” she said.Excluding its sugar subsidiary in Brazil, which was spun off, Dreyfus reported its best year in 2012, with net income rising to almost $1.1bn, up from $875m in 2011. Including the Brazilian sugar business, known as Biosev, it reported its second best year, with net income just above $1bn.Dreyfus is in the middle of a transformation, tapping the public capital markets for the first time in its more than 160-year history, to finance acquisitions and investments. The trading house raised $350m last year through a perpetual bond. Dreyfus has announced a $7bn spending programme for 2012-17, a 40 per cent boost compared with the 2006-11 periodMr Schoen suggested for the first time this year the next step could be abandoning its private status. The departing chief executive told the Financial Times Global Commodities Summit in Lausanne, Switzerland: “I’m not sure that in the next phase, the next five years, we can necessarily stay private”.The company said on Monday that Ciro Echesortu, until now chief operating officer, will take over from June 30. Mr Echesortu joined Dreyfus in 1985.Long tenures are the norm among agricultural trading sector bosses. This month Alberto Weisser stepped down as chief executive at Bunge after 14 years. He remains executive chairman. Greg Page has been chairman and chief executive at Cargill since 2007.The agribusiness sector has seen a wave of consolidation over the past 18 months, with Glencore spending $6bn to buy Toronto-based grain trader Viterra; Marubeni, the Japanese trading house, spending $2.6bn for US-based grain trader Gavilon, and ADM paying A$3bn for Australia’s GrainCorp.Mr Schoen become chief executive after Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the late husband of Ms Louis-Dreyfus and a great grandson of the founder, took control of the trading house in the mid 2000s, restructuring the business.Ms Louis-Dreyfus, last year increased her control over the holding company that owns Louis Dreyfus Commodities, buying shares from other members of the family. Through a family trust known as Akira, she raised her stake in Louis Dreyfus Holding to 65.1 per cent, up from 50 per cent five years ago. Louis Dreyfus Holding controls roughly 80 per cent of the trading house, with the balance owned by approximately 500 senior employees."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
160;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-06-12T23:07:52Z;Biotechnology;Big pharma faces new challenges, says Andrew Jack;It can trace its roots to Europe’s apothecaries in the Middle Ages and the 19th-century dye and bulk chemical producers of Germany’s Ruhr valley, but the pharmaceutical sector has become a significant global industry in its own right.Academic researchers and doctors make most breakthroughs, but the sector has supported the commercialisation of drugs that have contributed to a significant extension in the quality and length of life, with such benefits as higher productivity.Drugs to reduce cholesterol and hypertension have eased the threat of heart disease. Treatments for asthma, HIV and rheumatoid arthritis have turned debilitating illnesses into more manageable chronic diseases. An effective cure for malaria exists and one for hepatitis C is in sight.The sector employs hundreds of thousands of skilled staff, pays large sums in taxes, supports a global ecosystem of suppliers and spends more than $40bn a year on research and development – typically 10-20 per cent of sales is reinvested, the highest proportion of any industry.But big pharma companies are victims of their own success. New scientific breakthroughs have slowed, while rising regulatory and other barriers increase the costs of clinical development.Selling more high-priced, high-margin drugs has left a hole to be filled, with generic competition escalating and health services balking at the bill.The sector is busy trimming costs, re-examining pricing policies and outsourcing research to universities and smaller biotech companies.Treatments to offset the effects of ageing remain one of the biggest research challenges. But big pharma itself is in search of a remedy for its own ageing process.——————————————-Modern pharmaceuticals and biotechnologyWhen Greg Winter was a young scientist carrying out laboratory work in the 1970s, he saw the potential of using antibodies to tackle infection but had no idea of the extent to which his research would eventually be commercialised, writes Andrew Jack.His efforts to “humanise” monoclonal antibodies (MABs) derived from mice, to tackle disease without excessive side-effects, paved the way for a modern category of medicines that has helped build the modern biotechnology industry and resuscitate large pharmaceutical companies.Initially, much of the focus was on applications in cancer, and drugs such as Avastin for breast and colon cancer are among the results.MABs exist in multiple sclerosis, asthma and beyond, while the most important impact has been in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, leading to blockbusters such as Humira, the first fully human MAB, which is now the world’s second-bestselling medicine, generating more than $9bn in revenues last year. The success highlights how complex, global and uncertain the process of biotech drug development is, relying on academic and government-funded research, and the vagaries of commercial support for development.The UK Medical Research Council funded the original work in the 1970s of César Milstein and Georges Köhler to isolate MABs, for which they won the Nobel Prize. Winter humanised them, and his colleague Michael Neuberger developed a new technique to help. To date, the MRC has received some £600m in royalties as a result.Winter says that traditional big pharma companies were initially sceptical, and it was smaller US biotech companies – notably Genentech and Centocor (now known as Janssen Biotech) – that worked to develop these pioneering biological treatments.One of Winter’s own companies, Cambridge Antibody Technologies, which developed Humira, was acquired in 2006 by AstraZeneca, which in turn licensed the drug to Abbott Laboratories. Its success was so great that investors’ concerns that it would destabilise the rest of the business helped trigger the spin-off last year of Abbott’s pharmaceutical arm into AbbVie.Today, large pharmaceutical companies are keener than ever to buy biotech companies or license their most promising products. MABs and other biological drugs have provided an important shot in the arm for the survival of an industry dominated by chemicals until just a few years ago.…High-yield agricultureIn 1798 Thomas Malthus, the British theorist, postulated that the world’s population would eventually outstrip the planet’s ability to produce sufficient food for all, leading to widespread famine and death, writes Amy Kazmin.Nowhere did this dismal prediction seem likelier than India in the 1950s and early 1960s, when increases in grain production failed to keep pace with population growth, forcing New Delhi to depend on imported food aid. Fears of imminent famine intensified after two droughts in the mid-1960s.Today, however, India is self-sufficient in food grain. The turnround is the fruit of the Green Revolution, which brought high-yielding hybrid seeds and other high-tech, intensive farming techniques to millions of small farmers across Asia.The Green Revolution was driven by philanthropic organisations (the Rockefeller and Ford foundations), international agricultural research institutes that developed the new high-yielding seed varieties, and governments that ploughed money into fertilisers, irrigation networks and pesticides.The transformation of many Asian countries from subsistence to surplus food producers has created business opportunities. Commodity traders such as Glencore, Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Noble Group and Louis Dreyfus have made billions of dollars from the processing, storage, transportation and distribution of wheat, oilseeds, sugar and agricultural goods.Production of high-yielding seeds – dominated by Monsanto, DuPont and Syngenta – fertiliser and modern irrigation systems is also big business.The Green Revolution has its critics. In India, many believe intensive cultivation has damaged land fertility and strained north India’s water table, while many small farmers have been ruined by investing in expensive seeds that fail if there is not enough rain. But the avoidance of Malthus’s dire prophesy is certainly reason to cheer.
161;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-05-09T06:02:02Z;US targets commodities and corruption;Probe on ADM could lead to industry-wide investigation;Archer Daniels Midland is the first commodities trading house to be enmeshed in the US anti-bribery law. It may not be the last.The American company last week disclosed it had set aside $25m to cover potential penalties for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the law that the US Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission have in recent years started aggressively enforcing.Alston & Bird, the law firm, says in a client advisory that the case of ADM could be the tip of the iceberg. “Historically, FCPA ‘industry sweeps’ – such as those that targeted the oil and gas and pharmaceutical and medical device industries – have grown from an FCPA investigation into one company that led DoJ and the SEC to explore whether there was a broader industry-wide pattern of wrongdoing.”The commodities trading industry runs a high risk of dealing with corrupt officials in fragile states, according to a recent report by the Swiss government. “The awarding of public contracts, the granting of licences, the payment of royalties, the creation of monopolies, and the determination of customs policies are all procedures that tend particularly to attract incitement to bribery,” the report says.However, none of ADM’s rivals in agriculture, such as Bunge, Cargill or Louis Dreyfus Commodities, nor energy and metals traders such as Glencore, Trafigura or Vitol, have disclosed any similar entanglement with the FCPA.International traders must adhere to laws such as the 1977 FCPA, which bars companies subject to US jurisdiction from bribing foreign government officials to get business, and the more stringent UK Bribery Act of 2010.ADM said it is in settlement talks over grain and feed exports dating to 2008 that may have violated the FCPA. Ted Kang, an Alston lawyer and former federal prosecutor, said it is likely the discussions have educated the government about how agribusiness works, making it easier to build cases against others.“They find out where the touch points are for potential corruption, and as a result they focus on particular industries as they now have expertise,” he says.The government can also pressure a target to snitch on rivals. “Companies have very strong incentives to provide information and rat out other bad actors in their industry,” Mr Kang says.Corrupt dealing was not uncommon in the days before FCPA, industry executives say. One retired agricultural trader said that poorly paid government procurement officials sometimes requested cars and even tyres as a condition of doing business. This was especially prevalent in the Soviet bloc.In one unconfirmed story from the distant past, a grain vessel entered a port in Egypt “and chained to the top of the ship was a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. That’s what was required,” said another industry veteran.The scope for corruption may be declining as private companies take over from government purchasing agencies. But in many countries the line between public and private is blurry, with state-owned enterprises handling grain and oil imports.The Commodities Note is a regular online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
162;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM sets $25m aside for corruption case;;Archer Daniels Midland has set aside $25m for potential fines related to a longstanding foreign corruption probe, the company has revealed.The announcement represents the company’s first estimate of the size of possible penalties connected to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a US law that prohibits the bribing of foreign officials. ADM, one of the four leading global agricultural trading houses, buys, sells and processes grains and oilseeds in regions from North America to the Black Sea.The prospect of a penalty comes more than a decade after the US company pleaded guilty to charges that it fixed lysine and citric acid prices, paying a then-record $100m antitrust fine.Meanwhile, ADM confirmed it would proceed with its agreed $3.1bn takeover of Australian grain handler GrainCorp, funded by debt and cash flow from operations. The deal requires regulatory approval in countries including China, which has imposed strict conditions on one of the past year’s other big agricultural transactions, Marubeni of Japan’s $5bn purchase of US-based Gavilon.ADM first disclosed the corruption inquiry in 2011 and, since then, has warned investors it could be subject to civil penalties or criminal fines over certain transactions primarily relating to grain and feed exports dating back to at least 2008.On Wednesday, ADM added that its discussions with the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission should reach “a resolution some time this year”.“ADM believes it is appropriate to establish a provision of $25m ($0.04 per share) to cover the potential assessments that may be imposed by these government agencies,” the company said.Previously, ADM said the matter was not expected to have a material impact on its business or financial condition.The company made the disclosure in an earnings statement showing net profit of $269m, or $0.41 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, down from $399m, or $0.60 per share, in the same period a year earlier as the short harvest after last year’s US drought left assets, from soyabean crushing plants to barges, with extra capacity.The problems are likely to persist through the second quarter. “Until we have a new crop, we will struggle with a lack of volume,” said Juan Luciano, chief operating officer.ADM sees GrainCorp as a way to diversify both crop origins and end markets. Patricia Woertz, chief executive, called it “an excellent platform to serve growing global demand, particularly in the Middle East to Africa and Asia”.

164;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-04-26T07:57:56Z;GrainCorp agrees to ADM’s sweetened A$3bn offer;;GrainCorp, the largest crop handler in eastern Australia, has accepted a sweetened A$3bn (U$3.1bn) takeover offer from Archer Daniels Midland after rebuffing several previous approaches from the US-based commodities trader.ADM will pay A$12.20 per share in cash to acquire GrainCorp. It will also pay shareholders a one-time A$1.00-per-share special dividend before the deal closes. Including debt, the deal has an enterprise value of A$3.4bn.“We are pleased to have reached agreement with GrainCorp to conduct due diligence and, subject to that due diligence, put a recommended offer before GrainCorp’s shareholders,” ADM chief executive Patricia Woertz said.GrainCorp shares rose to a record high on the news. The stock closed up 7.9 per cent at A$12.81 on Friday in Sydney.Acquiring GrainCorp would give ADM a dominant presence in Australia, where it would control seven of the eight ports that ship bulk grain from the country’s east coast. GrainCorp is the only remaining publicly traded grain merchant in Australia following deregulation of the country’s wheat export system.ADM is the “A” of the so-called “ABCD” group of companies that dominate the world of agricultural commodities trading. The others companies are Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.The deal caps a torrid year and a half of mergers and acquisitions in the agricultural sector. Since late 2011, the grain trading industry has witnessed more than $10bn of M&A, with Glencore buying Toronto-listed grain trader Viterra for $6.1bn and Japan’s Marubeni acquiring US-based grain handler Gavilon for $5.3bn including debt.Most industry executives expect the wave of consolidation to continue. Ciro Echesortu, chief operating officer of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s largest agricultural commodities trading houses, last month said: “Competition in the marketplace remains steep and further consolidated following waves of sizeable deals in 2012 among some key players. This consolidation trend will likely endure into 2013”.However, GrainCorp management warned that a deal could take longer than usual to close, as it will likely be reviewed by China’s ministry of finance. “[Chinese approvals] tend to drag on longer than we would normally expect in the marketplace,” said Don Taylor, company chairman.Chinese antitrust authorities have recently taken a more aggressive approach in reviewing global deals, imposing significant conditions to clear Marubeni’s purchase of Gavilon and Glencore’s $65bn takeover of Xstrata.If there is a delay in the closing of the deal, which would be ADM’s biggest ever, GrainCorp will pay shareholders an additional dividend of 3.5 cents per month after October.The latest offer was the third since ADM’s initial approach. ADM began its pursuit of GrainCorp last year, when it took a 19.9 per cent stake in the company to diversify away from reliance on the US.GrainCorp rejected ADM’s original offer of A$11.75 per share in October, saying it did not properly account for the value of its port and storage assets in Australia, the world’s second-biggest wheat exporter.The Australian company subsequently rejected a sweetened offer of A$2.8bn, which it said had “not changed the board’s view”. However, the addition of the special dividend, and the absence of other bidders, appeared to have swayed the board.“Should the offer proceed, the addition of GrainCorp to our global network would fit our strategy and help to further connect Australia’s growers with growing global demand for crops and food, particularly in Asia and the Middle East,” said Ms Woertz. “ADM and GrainCorp have complementary geographies with little overlap and highly compatible cultures.”Barclays and Citigroup advised ADM, while Credit Suisse Group and Greenhill advised GrainCorp.
165;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-04-23T17:37:11Z;China clears Marubeni-Gavilon deal;;China has imposed significant conditions to clear Marubeni’s $5bn takeover of US-based grain trader Gavilon, in a new show of how Beijing’s antitrust regulators are flexing their muscle reviewing global deals.Chinese antitrust authorities have rarely intervened in mergers and acquisitions in the past. But the ministry of commerce, or Mofcom, has taken a far more intrusive role recently, including imposing last week far-reaching conditions to approve Glencore’s $65bn takeover of mining group Xstrata.Marubeni, one of Japan’s leading trading houses, or sogo shosha, initially announced last May the purchase of Gavilon, owned by hedge funds including Ospraie Management, led by Dwight Anderson, and Soros Fund Management. The Japanese company aimed to close the deal by September, but the lengthy review by Chinese regulators delayed it until now.Mofcom on Tuesday said that it has approved the deal subject to significant conditions in the Chinese soyabean market, including that Marubeni and Gavilon continue selling soya to China as separate companies, with two different teams and with firewalls between them blocking the exchange of market intelligence.“At present, China is highly dependent on soyabean imports, domestic soyabean crushers concentration is low …and bargaining power is weak,” Mofcom said on its Chinese web page. “This concentration of business operators may further weaken the bargaining power of the [Chinese] soyabean crushers.”China is the world’s largest soyabean importer, accounting for more than 60 per cent of global trade. Marubeni last year was the largest soya supplier to China, exporting 10.5m tonnes of the 58.4m tonnes the country bought overseas, ahead of rivals Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.Mofcom did not impose conditions in corn, wheat or any other food commodity. Marubeni bet with the acquisition of Gavilon, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska, that China would become a long-term importer of corn, in the process reshaping the global agricultural market. The last time that China become a large importer of a food commodity – soyabean in 1995 – it triggered a sustained increase in prices.China’s antimonopoly bureau of the commerce ministry is one of the world’s youngest and least understood regulators. Antitrust lawyers believe that in the case of Marubeni-Gavilon and Glencore-Xstrata the main issue for Beijing was not in reality market concentration, but access to key commodities.Glencore and Marubeni are significant suppliers to China, but their market share in key commodities such as copper for Glencore and soyabean for Marubeni is well below the 30-35 per cent threshold that European antitrust authorities usually use as a benchmark to decide whether to intervene in deals.The conditions set by China, after Marubeni presented a programme of remedies to Beijing’s antitrust concerns in early April, should allow the deal to close in the next few weeks. Gavilon declined to comment on Tuesday while Marubeni could not be reached outside normal business hours in Tokyo.Marubeni may be forced to pay much more than it first anticipated in local currency, as the yen has weakened more than 25 per cent against the US dollar since the deal was first announced in May. Rival commodities executives believe that Marubeni did not hedge its exposure to the currency market.The agricultural trading sector has experienced an unprecedented wave of consolidation over the past year and a half, with Glencore buying Toronto-listed Viterra for $6.1bn, Marubeni acquiring Gavilon of the US for $5.3bn including debt, and ADM trying to buy GrainCorp of Australia for A$2.8bn.Additional reporting by Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing and Pan Yuk in New York
166;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Margarita Louis-Dreyfus lifts stake in trader;Top shareholder increases control over holding company;Margarita Louis-Dreyfus has increased her control over the holding company that owns Louis Dreyfus Commodities, buying shares from other members of the family.Ms Louis-Dreyfus, through a family trust known as Akira, raised her stake in Louis Dreyfus Holding to 65.1 per cent at the end of last year, up from 61.1 per cent in 2011 and 50 per cent five years ago.Louis Dreyfus Holding controls roughly 80 per cent of the commodities trading house, with the balance owned by approximately 500 senior employees. Dreyfus and its rivals ADM, Bunge and Cargill are the “ABCD” group of companies that dominate global flows of food commodities.Ms Louis-Dreyfus, under an agreement carved out by her late husband Robert Louis-Dreyfus, has the obligation to buy shares that other family members tender during the period from “2011 until 2031”, according to Akira annual accounts.The purchase comes as the trading house suggests for the first time that it could abandon its private status at some point. Serge Schoen, chief executive of Dreyfus, told the FT Global Commodities Summit in Lausanne, Switzerland: “I’m not sure that in the next phase, the next five years, we can necessarily stay private”. In the past, Mr Schoen has ruled out a public listing, vowing to remain private.Louis Dreyfus Commodities has already ventured into the public arena over the past year. The trading house raised $350m last year through a perpetual bond, and has started to publish semi-annual financial statements publicly. The company may return “soon” to the debt market, Mr Schoen told the conference.In the trading house’s annual report, published this month, he said that Dreyfus planned to be “ambitious” on its financing, “and to increase our access to public capital”. So far the company has not detailed its plans. But Dreyfus is thinking about launching a Eurobond this year, say people familiar with the situation. When Trafigura debuted in the Eurobond market in 2010, the trader raised €400m.Louis Dreyfus Holding is also experimenting with the public equity market through its Brazilian sugar subsidiary BioSEV. The sugarcane company raised nearly $410m through an initial public listing in the São Paulo stock exchange. BioSEV was formed after the 2009 merger of Dreyfus’ Brazilian sugar assets with Santelisa Vale and it ranks as the world’s second-largest sugar cane processor.Dreyfus last year shipped 70m tonnes of agricultural commodities, roughly 9 per cent of global flows, according to the company’s annual report. Excluding BioSEV, Louis Dreyfus Commodities reported its best year in 2012, with net income rising to almost $1.1bn, up from $875m in 2011. Including BioSEV, it reported its second best year, with net income at just above $1bn.
167;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-03-27T18:04:50Z;US drought a bounty for Dreyfus;;Louis Dreyfus Commodities, one of the world’s biggest food trading houses, enjoyed a surge in profits last year as it stepped in to supply agricultural markets hit by the devastating US drought.The family-owned, Geneva-based trader said net profit rose 36 per cent to $1bn last year.Excluding a $93m loss from its Brazilian sugar business, Biosev – which has been moved to a new holding vehicle ahead of a planned flotation – the company’s profits were the highest on record.Louis Dreyfus Commodities and its US-based rivals ADM, Bunge and Cargill are known in the industry as the “ABCD” group that dominates agricultural commodities flows. Serge Schoen, chief executive of LDC, said that the company now accounts for more than 9 per cent of all global trade in agricultural products, having traded more than 70m tonnes last year.The worst US drought in half a century and the resulting spike in prices of food staples including corn, soyabeans and wheat last summer was a boon for many of the world’s top agricultural commodity traders. Cargill’s profits in the July-September quarter quadrupled, and Bunge’s profits in the same quarter more than doubled.LDC said that its grain and oilseed division had experienced a strong year, with oilseed trading enjoying a “stellar success”.The company said it had reacted to lower US production by supplying its customers with commodities from other parts of the world. LDC said in its annual report that it had “adjusted to lower US corn exports by supplying customers with corn originating from Brazil, Argentina, and Ukraine”.The drought also created a rare opportunity shipping agricultural staples to North America– traditionally the world’s largest exporter. LDC said that in the second and third quarters of last year, it had “benefited from abundant export capacities to North America, with import demand rising significantly following poor weather conditions and reduced crops”.Mr Schoen reiterated the company’s plan to invest heavily over the coming years, saying the company planned to spend $900m this year.The agribusiness industry is undergoing a rapid consolidation, with Glencore buying Canadian food trader Viterra for C$6bn, Marubeni agreeing to buy US-based grain trader Gavilon for $3.6bn and ADM pursuing a $2.9bn bid for Australia’s GrainCorp.“Competition in the marketplace remains steep and further consolidated following waves of sizeable deals in 2012 among some key players,” said Ciro Echesortu, chief operating officer of LDC. “This consolidation trend will likely endure into 2013, calling for continuing effort on our side, as we seek to maintain or gain leadership in all our markets.”
168;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Groups combine to create largest US miller;;Cargill, ConAgra Foods and CHS co-operative plan to form the biggest flour miller in North America as bad weather and low grain stocks cause wheat prices to fluctuate.Their new Ardent Mills joint venture, with a combined $4.3bn in revenues last year, comes as processors seek to maximise production capacity amid uneven supplies. US wheat production will fall by 7 per cent this year, the Department of Agriculture says.Minnesota-based Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trader, and ConAgra, a New York-listed food company, will each own 44 per cent of the venture, while CHS will have a 12 per cent stake. Trade publication World Grain called the deal “the largest merger in flour milling history”.Bankers said the deal will be examined by antitrust regulators. Industry data show the combined Ardent Mills with more than a third of US flour milling capacity. The closest competitor will be Archer Daniels Midland, with 17 per cent of capacity, according to Grain & Milling Annual.Ardent will be a further consolidation in milling after Cargill and CHS formed their existing joint venture, Horizon Milling, in 2002. ConAgra recently closed its $5bn acquisition of private label food company Ralcorp and may use a distribution from the new venture to pay down debt, said Tom Graves, analyst at S&P Capital IQ.Scott Portnoy, Cargill corporate vice-president, said the Ardent milling venture would provide bakeries and other customers with more supply locations and better ways to protect against grain price swings and manage inventory.“It is our intention at this stage that all of the mills within the ConAgra Mills system and the Horizon Milling system will be necessary to service the marketplace. This is not about reducing capacity,” he said. “To the contrary, it’s about making sure that the full extent of both companies’ asset footprints are made available to our customers as they expand regionally.”ConAgra said it had no plans to close any mills.Ardent will run 44 mills, three bakery mix facilities and a speciality bakery in the US and Canada. Dan Dye, Horizon Milling president, will serve as chief executive. Ardent would operate independently, financing itself through cash flow from operations and its own bank debt and credit facility. The owners said they intend to receive between $800m-$1bn in cash distributions from Ardent at closing.Gary Rodkin, ConAgra chief executive, said: “Ardent Mills will set the new industry standard by addressing the most important issues facing customers, such as commodity price volatility, increasingly sophisticated food safety requirements, the need for more cost-effective supply chains and growing market demand for more innovation in products and processes.”
169;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-02-12T18:33:13Z;South American harvest hits grain prices;;Agricultural markets retreated on Tuesday, with corn falling for the eighth session in a row as rising expectations for South American crops relieved worries about tight supplies in the northern hemisphere.Corn for March delivery was below $7 a bushel for the first time since January 11, trading 1.1 per cent lower at $6.94¾ by midday on the Chicago Board of Trade.CBOT March soyabeans weakened 0.8 per cent to $14.20½ and March wheat dropped 1.7 per cent to $7.29.Selling has snowballed since the US Department of Agriculture raised estimates of global corn, soyabean and wheat stocks in a report late last week. South America is expected to produce record corn and soyabean harvests just as stocks in the US run low.Brazil will overtake the drought-plagued US as the world’s largest corn exporter this year, with export prices at the port of Paranagua consistently cheaper than corn along the US Gulf of Mexico, USDA said.“The current crop is also expected to be a bumper harvest,” the agency’s foreign agricultural service said in a circular last week. =Cheaper grain and oilseeds will bring relief to the food industry, especially livestock and poultry companies. Tyson Foods, a top US chicken and beef producer, anticipates feed costs will rise by $600m this year.“At these price levels, this is an attractive buying opportunity for some end users” of feed, said Erin FitzPatrick, commodity analyst at Rabobank.The sharp retreat of grain prices has caught many speculative traders by surprise. Money managers have been building net bullish positions in corn since early January, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, suggesting some are now being flushed out of the futures market.Analysts warn that prices of grain futures for imminent delivery could nevertheless jump as Brazil’s transportation network strains to move a huge crop to the world.Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, two of the largest international merchants in the region, have reassured investors they had expanded storage silos and invested in port facilities to handle massive exports, but some in the market worry about a short-term squeeze until South American supplies reach international markets.Oil World, a German oilseed market consultant, described a “long line of ships waiting for soyabeans at Brazilian ports” and “unusually small farmer selling” in Argentina, partly because they are waiting for a peso devaluation that would increase the local profitability of export sales.“Any delays in transporting the commodities to the ports can, in turn, delay the expected global replenishment,” Chris Narayanan, agricultural analyst at Société Générale, said in a report. He added that while this could temporarily keep prices high, bullish surprises from South America were becoming unlikely.
170;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM lifts profits despite US drought;;Archer Daniels Midland overcame a stubborn US drought to report sharply higher profit in the last three months of 2012, but had little to say about its $2.9bn bid for Australia’s GrainCorp.The New York-listed company’s shares jumped more than 5 per cent after it posted net earnings of $510m, or 77 cents per share, in the three months to the end of December – a sixfold increase on an exceptionally poor quarter a year earlier.The stronger results came in spite of low Mississippi river water conditions that have complicated the flow of grain exports and persistent losses from refining ethanol fuel amid scarce US corn and weak petrol demand.ADM’s business of shipping and processing soyabeans and other oilseeds helped offset these problems. Operating profit in the oilseeds division was $411m, up from $202m in the same quarter a year earlier.The company’s soyabean operations, which include a vast processing plant at its Decatur, Illinois headquarters, ran at record capacity during the quarter.Last year ADM took a 19.9 per cent stake in Australian wheat exporter GrainCorp and offered A$2.8bn ($2.9bn) for the entire company. It wants to diversify supply sources as US grain shipments fall short.GrainCorp has argued the bid “materially undervalues” its network of grain storage and transportation assets and its proximity to Asia and other importers.Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive, said: “There’s been no further conversation with them since the rejection of our last proposal.”ADM’s stake in GrainCorp, which the company quietly began building in June, appreciated by $62m during the quarter.Shares of ADM were 3.2 per cent higher at $29.35 in afternoon trade in New York.GrainCorp closed at A$12.09 per share Tuesday, A$0.11 below its suitor’s current offer.
171;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2013-01-30T09:21:23Z;Commodities trading becoming more complex;Conference to focus on challenges to companies and regulators;BP hosted an entertaining table outside the annual conference of the Commodity Markets Council, a US trade group, held in Florida this weekVisitors could sit at laptops and simulate trading WTI oil futures. I made a virtual $409,500 in 10 minutes, a feat that might seem impressive were I not down $100,000 in the first five.The simple exercise of going long or short crude stood out as an anomaly at a conference where the increasing complexity of trading commodities emerged as a theme. This is posing a challenge both to companies and to regulators seeking to peer more deeply into their trading operations.The Commodity Markets Council’s members include the “ABCD” of agricultural trading – Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities. It also includes growing ranks of companies that trade energy, such as BP, Mercuria and AGL Resources.Speakers at the conference noted it is no longer enough for the energy sector to focus solely on oil, natural gas or power. It is also not enough for food companies to consider themselves hedged using grain futures alone.Jack Bienkowski, senior director at Mondelez International – the snacks group spun out of Kraft Foods – said there was a “blurring of the space” between commodities. Trading strategies have evolved in response, in some cases to bundle a position in a few commodities rather than try to neatly hedge the price of, say, wheat.“You used to have an oilseed trader or a corn guy,” he said. Now, “we look at all of that together”. Managing grain costs is impossible without first looking at energy markets. “Energy to us is the floor,” Mr Bienkowski said.Andy Milnes, head of oil supply and trading for BP in North and South America, said company analysts are watching not only petroleum fundamentals but Brazilian sugarcane – a source of ethanol fuel. “The market’s definitely way more sophisticated now,” he said.The complexity complicates the process of matching physical commodities exposures to financial derivatives designed to hedge them. This is especially true with many derivatives migrating from the tailor-made swaps world to more generic futures, speakers said.The blurring of commodities positions also makes it tougher for companies to prove they are genuinely hedging as they seek exemptions from new US rules limiting commodity speculation. The rules are on hold pending a court appeal.Lance Kotschwar, senior counsel at Gavilon, the US-based commodities merchant, said that as for “this notion that there’s a direct tie between a physical position and a derivatives position . . . It doesn’t work that way. We’re never perfectly hedged.”It all made simulated oil-trading look easy.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
172;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-12-17T09:09:12Z;Processing capacity grinds cocoa industry;Rush to build facilities has led to weak margins and volatile prices;The oil industry isn’t the only sector of the natural resources industry suffering from a surfeit of processing capacity.Cocoa is the antithesis of oil. Yet, its industry has become the latest to be hit by the mismatch of processing capacity and demand. The result? As in oil, weak refining margins and volatile prices.The overcapacity has hit the industry just as cocoa processors were expanding beyond their traditional centre of the Netherlands and Germany.Over the past decade, expectations of a rise in demand has led to the rush to build “grinding”, or processing facilities, in Asia, while tax incentives have boosted processing capacity in cocoa nations in Africa.In Indonesia, processing capacity grew by 2.4 times in the past seven years, and almost 40 per cent in Malaysia in the past six years, according to the International Cocoa Organization.In Africa, grinding capacity has risen more than 50 per cent in Ivory Coast – the world’s top cocoa exporter – in the past five years. Ghana, the second-largest exporter, has seen a 2.5 times jump in processing capacity in the past seven years.The extra capacity and, thus, the over production of cocoa products – referred by the industry as butter and powder – pushed grinding margins into negative territory in 2012. “There was a large build up of stock in products as there was too much output compared to demand,” says a top cocoa processor.For most of the year, margins, or the “combined cocoa ratio”, which measures the combined sales price for cocoa butter and cocoa powder relative to the cocoa bean price, have been below the level at which it is profitable to grind the beans.Leading processors have been affected: the cocoa ingredients division of Petra Foods, which has just been bought byBarry Callebaut, reported a 29 per cent plunge in earnings before interest tax and amortisation for the first nine months of the year. Archer Daniels Midland, a top processor and cocoa trader, noted “weaker cocoa press margins” in its latest results release.Processing margins have come back thanks to a recent rebound in cocoa butter prices, “but overcapacity remains and there are risks of negative margins again in 2013”, notes Rabobank, one of the top lenders to the industry.Tax incentives and subsidies, particularly in Africa, will help the industry to weather the problem.However, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the situation in Ivory Coast, which recently announced an export tax on semi-finished cocoa products. With the Ivorian issue coupled with a sluggish economy in Europe, many of the processors will be braced for what could be another tough year.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times.
173;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM / GrainCorp – separating the chaff;Trader should commit to a deal soon or walk away;Ever felt like someone you’re dating is messing you around? Archer Daniels Midland’s 19.9 per cent stake in GrainCorp and its takeover offer would seem a solid statement of intent towards the Australian grain handler. On the other hand, the small increase it made last week to its original offer made it look less than fully committed.GrainCorp is playing hard to get. On Thursday, the company rejected ADM’s A$12.20, or A$2.8bn, bid, which was a 4 per cent improvement on its original offer. The shares have traded up to at least A$12.30 since the revised bid was made. What next? ADM could of course pay up. Its current price values the company at about 8.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. An A$13 offer would value GrainCorp at 9.5 times its ebitda over the cycle, smoothing out last year’s bumper harvest, according to Macquarie. That is roughly in line with prices paid in similar deals.ADM risks a credit downgrade, depending on how the deal is financed. But the rating agencies’ warnings come with caveats, and ADM has plans to raise some cash through divestments. Or it could play the long game. It has a record of long-term minority investments, although investors might like to ask what its A$500m outlay so far is getting them. But its one-fifth stake and its low offer do not preclude a rival bidder. The longer it takes for one to emerge, however, the less likely one becomes since Australia’s “creep” rules allow ADM to raise its holding by 3 per cent every six months without triggering a full bid.ADM would profit itself if a higher bidder emerges but it does seem to want a deal, if not one at any price. Discipline is good, but it has space to raise its price if it really wants the business. Sometimes you’ve got to ask whether you’d like your date seeing others. If you don’t, either commit properly or walk away.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
174;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-12-13T03:47:58Z;GrainCorp rejects higher ADM offer;;GrainCorp, Australia’s largest listed agricultural company, has rejected an increased offer from Archer Daniels Midland, saying the A$2.8bn ($3bn) bid did not reflect its unique portfolio of strategic assets.Sydney-based GrainCorp said the new offer of A$12.20 per share had “not changed the board’s view” that ADM’s proposal “materially undervalues” the grain handler.“GrainCorp’s board will be constructive in any dealings in relation to proposals that have the potential to be in the best interests of shareholders,” GrainCorp said.Last month, GrainCorp rejected ADM’s original offer of A$11.75 per share, arguing the price did not reflect the value of its port and storage assets in Australia, the world’s second-biggest wheat exporter.GrainCorp is one of the few midsized international grain merchants left after a consolidation spree this year. The company handles 90 per cent of eastern Australia’s bulk grain exports through its seven storage and loading facilities.ADM responded last week by increasing its offer to A$12.20 per share – or A$12.55 including dividends shareholders will be allowed to keep – and raising its stake in GrainCorp to 19.9 per cent from 14.9 per cent.GrainCorp’s board is believed to be holding out for an offer of at least A$13 per share but it is unclear whether ADM, one of the world’s largest agricultural traders, is prepared to pay that much. The acquisition of GrainCorp would be ADM’s biggest-ever deal.GrainCorp had several conversations with its American suitor before rejecting the increased bid, people familiar with the situation said. Although the two sides could not agree on price, GrainCorp made it clear that lines of communication were open if ADM made a materially improved offer.Moody’s, the rating agency, placed ADM on watch for a downgrade last week after the New York-listed company sweetened its offer. Analysts at JPMorgan believe ADM can increase its bid by another A$100m-A$200m, or A$0.44-A$0.88 per share, without materially affecting its credit position or changing the “deal metrics”.On Thursday ADM defended its revised proposal, which is conditional on a recommendation from the board of GrainCorp and confirmatory due diligence.“We believe that our revised proposal properly values GrainCorp’s business,” ADM said. “We intend to consider all our options with respect to GrainCorp and our 19.9 per cent shareholding.”Shares in GrainCorp, viewed as the last asset of size in the southern hemisphere grain market, eased 0.5 per cent to A$12.32 at Thursday lunchtime. They have consistently traded above the level of ADM’s proposals.Analysts have said the latest offer values GrainCorp at 8.7 times underlying earnings, below recent deals in the global agribusiness sector which have been struck at between 9.5 and 9.7.Rikki Bannan, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said she was not surprised by GrainCorp’s rejection of the higher offer.“Given the revised $12.20 offer was only 4 per cent higher than the original $11.75 proposal, that in GrainCorp’s view materially undervalued the company, it is not surprising that it has been knocked back,” she said.“While there is still a chance that ADM’s offer price moves higher, this is largely factored in following the stock’s 40 per cent rally from pre-bid levels, and there is no guarantee an agreement will be reached at a higher price with ADM or other potentially interested parties.”Stuart Jackson, an analyst at JPMorgan, said he believed GrainCorp was “open to renegotiating an outcome” but the ball was “now back in ADM’s court”.Advisers to ADM say GrainCorp deserves a lower multiple because earnings from Australian agricultural companies are more volatile due to less predictable weather patterns. Industry executives believe that the profits of GrainCorp are at a cyclical high as it cashes in from good weather and a record crop.According to the US Department of Agriculture, Australia will harvest just 21m tonnes of wheat in the 2012-13 season, down nearly 30 per cent from 29.5m tonnes in 2011-12, which was the biggest harvest in at least four decades.
175;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM raises GrainCorp offer to A$2.8bn;;Archer Daniels Midland has sweetened its cash offer for GrainCorp and acquired a further 5 per cent of its shares in a stock market raid as it tries to bring the directors of the Australian wheat trader to the negotiating table.GrainCorp, Australia’s largest listed agriculture company, rebuffed a A$2.7bn approach from New York-listed ADM last month saying the bid “materially” undervalued its unique portfolio of ports and silos in a country where agricultural exports are poised to double by 2050.GrainCorp is one of the few midsize international grain merchants left after a consolidation spree this year.ADM responded on Monday by raising its offer 3.8 per cent to A$12.20 a share in cash. The increased offer, which is subject to a number of conditions including a board recommendation, values GrainCorp’s equity at A$2.8bn ($2.9bn).Including a dividend of A$0.35 a share announced last month – which under the terms of the revised proposal shareholders are allowed to keep – the new offer is A$0.80 a share more than ADM’s initial proposal. ADM’s acquisition of a further 5 per cent of GrainCorp’s shares at the new offer price took its stake to 19.9 per cent.Shares in Sydney-based GrainCorp rose 3.2 per cent to A$12.32 on Tuesday as investors bet that ADM would be forced to further increase its offer.The board of GrainCorp has yet to review the revised offer, people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday, and will not be rushed into a decision. But it is unlikely to recommend the increased bid, the people said.ADM’s offer is only 3.8 per cent more than its previous proposal of A$11.75 a share, which GrainCorp dismissed as not reflecting the strategic importance of its assets and Australia’s proximity to growing food importers in the Middle East and Asia. Last week, GrainCorp secured regulatory approval for long-term agreements with users of its seven bulk grain ports on Australia’s eastern seaboard.“We note that the board recently stated that ADM’s offer of A$11.75 materially undervalued the company. We don’t view the increased offer as a material uplift in valuation,” said RBS Morgans analyst Belinda Moore.ADM has responded to those arguments by drawing attention to Australia’s variable crop sizes. Australia’s wheat exports are forecast to decline 33 per cent in the 2012-13 season, according to the US Department of Agriculture.“Our proposal also offers more certainty, greater value and immediate realisation of potential future value for GrainCorp shareholders than GrainCorp’s standalone plan,” said Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive.“ADM is a disciplined buyer, and any combination with GrainCorp must meet our key financial hurdles, taking into consideration the impact of the Australian agricultural cycle on GrainCorp’s earnings power.”Traders believe GrainCorp is holding out for at least A$13 a share but are not sure ADM is prepared to pay that much. Standard & Poor’s placed ADM on watch for a possible ratings downgrade following its original approach to GrainCorp in October.However, JPMorgan analyst Stuart Jackson said ADM could bump up its offer by another A$100m-A$200m (A$0.44-A$0.88 a share) without “materially” affecting the attractiveness of the deal or its credit rating “beyond the expected one-notch downgrade from the original offer”.ADM, US-based Bunge and Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities of France form the “ABCD” of global grain trading houses that handle a large share of agricultural commodity flows.ADM targeted GrainCorp as it seeks to diversify assets from its historic base in the US, where a severe drought will this year curb export volumes.
176;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-26T15:56:22Z;Cocoa prices break mould of volatility;;Cocoa has long been a commodity market known for its large swings. Prices have often rallied, only to plunge soon afterwards in a series of boom-and-bust cycles.The volatility has made millions of pounds for some hedge funds, creating trading legends such as Anthony “Chocfinger” Ward, co-founder of commodities house Armajaro.Not this year. After years of rollercoaster prices, cocoa has been trading in a narrow band of between £1,400 and £1,700 a tonne. The slim trading range is in sharp contrast to the past two years, when it surged to a 30-year high of £2,465 a tonne, only to tumble a few months later to £1,287 a tonne.Cocoa prices have not rallied this year by more than 8 per cent over a single month, nor dropped by more than 4 per cent. In the past decade, the market has seen monthly rallies of 30 per cent and suffered monthly price collapses of 20 per cent.The lack of volatility has limited the trading opportunities in the cocoa market, long a niche of the commodities industry and often seen as the realm of just a handful of experienced physical traders and specialist hedge funds.“People who were willing to play the [narrow trading] range did quite well, although not many did that,” says one fund manager in soft commodities.Although the year has seen the occasional price rally caused by worries over production in the key supply region of west Africa, the usual big fluctuations have been largely absent. There are two reasons for cocoa’s new-found stability.The first is the new system that Ivory Coast, by far the world’s largest producer, uses to sell its crop. Until this year, exporters, including top trading houses such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Barry Callebaut, Olam and Armajaro, had been free to buy and sell the commodity with the price dictated by the market in London.This fully liberalised system, which left farmers exposed to the international cocoa price set in London, came under the auspices of the World Bank in 1999. Critics have blamed the system for causing extra volatility as the private sector sold large chunks of the crop at the same time, usually near the start of the harvesting season in October and November, moving the market.Under President Alassane Ouattara, who came to power last year, the Ivorians have reintroduced a centralised system. The new Ivorian regulator, the Cocoa & Coffee Council, has since February sold forward its 2012-13 crop, which started to be harvested last month. The regulator has smoothed out the sales over about nine months, compared with the burst of selling typical under the older system.Paul Davis of Holland Capital, an investment manager, says Ivory Coast has created a “completely stable system”, surprising the industry.Justin Grandison, head of cocoa brokerage at ABN Amro in London, adds that the “usual hedging pressure associated with this time of year” – referring to the start of the harvest in west Africa – is not present, reducing price swings.The lack of volatility has had a knock-on effect on the use of derivatives, in particular options used to hedge against extreme price movements. Jonathan Parkman, co-head of agriculture at commodities broker Marex Spectron, says: “We’ve been used to high volatility levels. That has come off significantly.”The second reason behind cocoa prices’ stability is two years of supply surpluses, which have allowed chocolate manufacturers, the main users of cocoa, to stock up and reduce the risk of finding themselves without supplies.The market endured three seasons of shortages until the end of 2010, reducing the amount of cocoa that chocolate manufacturers had to hand to about two to three months of supplies on average, making them vulnerable to squeezes.However, in the 2010-11 crop season, the cocoa market had a huge surplus of 340,000-440,000 tonnes, followed by a 40,000-80,000 tonne surplus in 2011-12, according to industry estimates. Global cocoa production is about 4m tonnes.Barry Callebaut, a leading cocoa processor, said this month that the “industry was well covered”. Cocoa traders believe chocolatiers have stocked up to seven months worth of consumption, double what they had two years ago.The healthy level of stocks is a far cry from 2010, when chocolatiers worried the market was about to experience severe shortages. “The risk to the chocolate manufacturers has been drastically reduced,” says Mr Parkman.
177;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-20T10:08:31Z;Zhongfu wins approval for $728m Australia sugar investment;;"Chinese investment in Australia raises concerns, not least in agriculture: there are few inward investments anywhere that generate as much controversy as foreigners buying control of land.But these worries haven’t stopped the authorities in Western Australia from going ahead with a US$728m Chinese-backed project to develop a sugar industry – even though there was a big local bidder in the shape of the Australian Agricultural Company, with plans to grow cotton. It’s easy to see why Perth prefers the Chinese proposal – 350 jobs in the construction phase and 400 in production afterwards.According to a statement from the government of Western Australia, Shanghai Zhongfu Group plans to invest up to A$700m (US$728m) in the next six years in developing land in the far north and building a sugar mill that will produce about 4m tonnes of sugar cane and 500,000 tons of sugar crystal for export annually. The company will lease 13,400 hectares (33,100 acres) of government-owned land for periods of 10 years to 50 years.Premier and state development minister Colin Barnett said in the statement: “This investment in large-scale agricultural industry and downstream processing will be the start of an exciting new era for the East Kimberley and northern Australia.”The move is the latest in a spate of foreign investments in Australian agriculture, as rising incomes and global population growth boost demand for food.Bloomberg said Archer-Daniels-Midland of the US last month offered to buy GrainCorp, eastern Australia’s largest grain handler, for A$2.68bn. Last year, China’s Cofco won control of Tully Sugar, and Thailand’s Mitr Phol Sugar agreed to buy Queensland’s MSF Sugar.However, foreign investment in agriculture has sparked a political backlash. Opposition leader Tony Abbot in August proposed increasing scrutiny over foreign bids for Australian farmland. It won’t be the last such proposal.Related reading:

178;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-16T20:38:36Z;US will not ease corn ethanol mandate;;The White House on Friday rejected requests to halt a government mandate to blend billions of gallons of corn-based ethanol into US petrol supplies, keeping alive a big factor in the bull market for food commodities.State governors allied with livestock and poultry producers petitioned to waive the Renewable Fuel Standard, as the worst drought in half a century scorched the US corn crop and sent prices to record highs.However, the US Environmental Protection Agency turned down the call, its second such refusal since a 2007 law prescribed rising volumes of biofuel in the national motor fuel supply.“We recognise that this year’s drought has created hardship in some sectors of the economy, particularly for livestock producers,” said Gina McCarthy, an EPA assistant administrator.“But our extensive analysis makes clear that Congressional requirements for a waiver have not been met and that waiving the RFS will have little, if any, impact.”Corn prices peaked at $8.43¾ a bushel in August after extreme dryness and temperatures above 38°C (100°F) gripped grain states such as Illinois and Indiana. Record prices have pressured farm operations dependent on corn for animal feed.The corn market weakened as the US harvest arrived but remains up 12 per cent this year. Futures rose on Friday as word leaked of the EPA’s decision but traded lower on the week, with CBOT December corn down 1.6 per cent at $7.27.The government is allowing up to 13.2bn gallons of corn-based ethanol to meet the renewable fuel mandate this year. The ethanol industry will consume 42 per cent of the latest US corn crop, or 4.5bn bushels, the US Department of Agriculture estimates.However, high corn prices, weak petrol demand and a separate rule limiting the percentage of ethanol in the retail fuel mix has kept a lid on output even without a waiver. Output is down from a year ago and refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland are losing money making ethanol.EPA said its analysis showed suspending the mandate was “highly unlikely” to have a significant impact on ethanol production and would have “little or no impact on corn, food, or fuel prices”.A bipartisan group of governors from states including Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia had petitioned for a waiver, claiming it was causing severe economic harm to their chicken and livestock industries.A coalition of meat industry groups said the EPA’s decision was “going to cost more American jobs, put family farmers and ranchers out of business, create an animal feed crisis and cause food costs to soar in the coming months”.
179;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-15T09:28:56Z;GrainCorp’s ADM defence ignores weather;Australia’s large climatic variability affects grain crops;"It was fighting talk from GrainCorp, the Australian grain trader, in its defence against an unsolicited A$2.7bn takeover bid from rival Archer Daniels Midland of the US: record profits, a strategic update full of “game changers”, and the promise of significantly higher earnings by 2016.Yet, its claims ignore one crucial factor – the weather and its impact on Australia’s grain and oilseeds crop.GrainCorp argues that the offer from ADM of A$11.75 a share “materially undervalues” the company. That is true if you look at the annual results that the Sydney-listed trader has just published.But taking a medium-term perspective reveals a flaw. The variability of the weather in Australia – with periodic droughts that savage the wheat crop – is so large that industry executives and bankers say the country’s grain handlers deserve to trade at a discount to those with operations centred in North America and western Europe.The weather – and thus the size of the crop – is three times more variable in Australia than in Canada and the US, the two regions that have seen recent agribusiness transactions, with Glencore buying Toronto-listed Viterra for $6.1bn and Marubeni of Japan spending $5.3bn to purchase Gavilon of the US.Ross Kingwell, of the University of Western Australia, argues in a recent article in the Farm Policy Journal that “Australia consistently has experienced greater wheat revenue variance than the other nations, but especially more so over the last decade”.The variability is important because GrainCorp’s profits depend, at least in part, in moving as much grains and oilseeds as possible through its vast network of silos, elevators and port facilities.Industry executives believe that the profits of GrainCorp are at a cyclical high as it cashes in from good weather and a record crop. Next year, earnings are likely to drop due to lower volumes. The company, nonetheless, is investing in new areas less exposed to the weather vagaries, such as malting barley, in an effort to smooth its profitability.The eastern side of Australia is expected to harvest in the 2012-13 season a relatively good crop of about 18m tonnes of wheat, barley, sorghum and canola, down 12.6 per cent from a record of 20.6m tonnes the previous season. But the region has seen crops as low as 7m tonnes in 2006-07; 6.8m tonnes in 2002-03, and 4.2m tonnes in 1994-95 due to bad weather. Australia is particularly exposed to the El Niño weather phenomenon, a recurring climatic event in the Pacific region.The large harvest swings mean that GrainCorp’s profitability, from time to time, would suffer big drops. Hence the valuation discount that almost everyone in the grain trading industry applies to Australian agribusiness assets.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times"
180;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-15T06:22:26Z;GrainCorp comes out swinging against ADM;;GrainCorp, the Sydney-based grain handling company, appeared headed for a standoff with Archer Daniels Midland over the US company’s A$2.7bn ($2.8bn) takeover proposal.Trumpeting GrainCorp’s “outstanding” annual results and “compelling” prospects, chief executive Alison Watkins said the company, which handles three quarters of eastern Australia’s grain crop, had little difficulty rebuffing ADM.“We’ve looked at the underlying earnings for GrainCorp, the growth initiatives we are confident of delivering, and formed a view on fundamental value which is materially different from the ADM proposal,” Ms Watkins said on Thursday.ADM, one of the world’s top agricultural commodities traders, responded with a statement standing firm on the A$11.75 a share cash offer it made almost a month ago after building a 14.9 per cent stake in GrainCorp.The offer “represented a significant premium to the prevailing GrainCorp share price at the time of our approach. We believe it remains an attractive proposal,” ADM said.Shares in GrainCorp gained 0.2 per cent to A$12.20 on Thursday, while ADM was up 0.4 per cent to $24.63 at mid-day in New York.GrainCorp’s decision to reject ADM came as it unveiled record profits and an increased dividend. The company said net profit after tax rose 19 per cent to A$205m for the year to September on the back of a bumper crop, and outlined a range of “growth initiatives” to boost underlying earnings by around A$110m over the next four years.Ms Watkins declined to say if GrainCorp was prepared to sit down and hold talks with ADM on an increased offer. “Our board, like any board, would naturally respond to any proposals that are in shareholders’ interest,” she said.The agricultural trading sector has experienced an unprecedented wave of consolidation this year, with Glencore buying Toronto-listed Viterra for $6.1bn and Marubeni of Japan acquiring privately held Gavilon of the US for $5.3bn including debt.People familiar with the situation said ADM was unlikely to be spooked into making a higher bid for GrainCorp, the last independent grain handler of its size in Australia, and that chief executive Patricia Woertz would instead adopt a wait-and-see approach that could last a year.The New York-listed trading house is betting that GrainCorp’s shares will start to trend lower next year in the absence of a counter-bidder and its profits suffer from a smaller wheat crop in Australia.The US Department of Agriculture has forecast that Australia will harvest just 21m tonnes of wheat in the 2012-13 season, down nearly 30 per cent from 29.5m tonnes in 2011-12, the highest harvest in at least four decades.A smaller crop would hurt the profitability of GrainCorp, which in part depends on moving as much wheat as possible through its network of silos and ports, according to industry executives. GrainCorp operates seven out of the eight bulk export grain terminals on the east cost of Australia.Yet GrainCorp lifted long-term earnings forecasts and highlighted its ability to benefit from an expected doubling in Australian agriculture exports by 2050.“The grain trade has doubled in the last 40 years, so has malt, and edible oils has tripled in the last 10 years. We expect this kind of demand to continue unabated,” said Ms Watkins. “Australia is in the right place at the right time to participate in that growth.”
181;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-13T21:29:58Z;Carlyle finds cashew group to its taste;;Carlyle is to lead a $210m private equity investment in an African agricultural commodity merchant that is one of the world’s largest traders of cashew nuts, the latest in a wave of transactions to sweep the agribusiness industry.The purchase of a minority stake in Export Trading Group will give the Tanzania-based company an enterprise value of more than $1bn, according to people familiar with the deal. It is currently owned by its management.Alongside Carlyle, the Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Fund, a South African private equity fund, Standard Chartered and ETG’s management will also contribute to the $210m cash injection. Standard Chartered has invested $74m in the company.The deal comes amid a wave of dealmaking among agricultural traders as they seek to profit from rising trade in food commodities due to strong demand in emerging economies such as China.This year, several multibillion-dollar deals have been announced, including Glencore’s purchase of Viterra of Canada for more than $6bn, Marubeni’s acquisition of Gavilon for $5.3bn and ADM’s near $2.8bn offer for GrainCorp of Australia.ETG, which has operations in 30 African countries, specialises in trading niche commodities such as sesame seeds, cashew nuts and pulses. With Singapore-listed Olam, it says it is among the world’s top cashew nut traders.The capital injection will be used to fund a programme of investment in processing facilities that produce higher-value products such as vegetable oils, flour or ground coffee. The company’s net profits rose 44 per cent to $47.3m in the year to March.Ketan Patel, managing director of ETG, said the company was well positioned to capitalise on growing strains in global food supplies.“The last place that has huge tracts of lands that could potentially feed this population of 10bn we are expecting in the next few years is Africa,” he said. “We believe Africa is becoming a more and more important player in the agricultural markets globally.”Carlyle’s investment is the first by its new sub-Saharan Africa fund, which is expected to raise about $500m. Marlon Chigwendge, managing director of the fund, said that the investment was a bet both on rising demand for food commodities and on African growth.“The broad story of growth across Africa is there and it is not just a commodities story, it is an internal domestic growth story,” he said.The deal is the latest sign that the trend of agribusiness transactions is spreading to second-tier players. Armajaro Trading – the commodities trading group made famous by its co-founder Anthony “Choc­finger” Ward– recently agreed to buy Plexus Cotton, a Liverpool-based trader of the fibre with net assets of just under $17m.Industry executives believe that medium-sized traders such as Touton and Sucres et Denrées of France, and Ecom Agroindustrial, a family-owned trading group based in Switzerland, could also be involved in future M&A deals in the sector.
182;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-09T09:02:34Z;US farming co-op leads agricultural traders;Earnings at CHS surpass those of ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Dreyfus;The world’s most profitable agricultural trading house is a US farmers’ co-operative with roots in rural activism.CHS this week reported record net profit of $1.26bn in fiscal 2012, up 10-fold from a decade ago and its first earnings to crack $1bn. The co-op’s results surpassed the fiscal-year net profits of Archer Daniels Midland, which made $1.22bn, Bunge at $942m, Cargill’s $1.17bn and $735m for Louis Dreyfus Commodities – the so-called ABCD that dominates the agribusiness sphere.The announcement comes amid a consolidation wave in the sector, the latest example being ADM’s bid for Australian exporter GrainCorp. CHS, one of the handful of big grain traders left, shows why large additional deals may be few and far between.The co-op will pay $600m to member-shareholders including 75,000 farmers and 1,100 local co-ops with another 250,000 farmer members. “Come March, there will be individual farmers who get cheques in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. There are co-ops that will get cheques of well over a million dollars,” CHS’s Lani Jordan told me.Farmers are already receiving record prices for their crops. CHS members are concentrated in the far northern US, an area that did not suffer as badly in this year’s drought (the corn crop in the CHS home state of Minnesota is the biggest ever). So the cheques are a bonus.CHS’s complicated ownership structure will make any M&A deal difficult. A similar impediment faces any investor sizing up CBH Group, the largest farming co-op in Australia, with which CHS has a joint venture to source wheat.“Because we’re a co-operative, that would be a really, really difficult thing to do,” Ms Jordan said of a possible sale.CHS, founded in the 1930s by the National Farmers Union activist group, now handles about 52m tonnes of grains and oilseeds a year from the US, South America and the Black Sea region for sale to China and other consumers. The co-op also owns a quarter of a wheat milling business and half a grain export venture on the Pacific coast in joint ventures with Cargill.But it was oil, not corn and soyabeans, that drove this year’s 31 per cent rise in annual profit. CHS owns two refineries in Montana and Kansas, locations which benefit from crude prices discounted by the supply boom in the central US and Canada. Grain trading profits were about flat as big harvests in the Black Sea, South America and Australia reduced exports from the group’s core US assets in the past year.In a 1912 pamphlet, National Farmers Union secretary-treasurer A C Davis bemoaned a challenge facing the American farmer: “the distribution of your crops at a price that will remunerate you for the toil and labour of production.”“The solution,” he wrote, “can only be worked out by a system of co-operative marketing.”If only he had lived another century.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
183;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
184;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-11-07T00:31:34Z;GrainCorp battles ADM $2.8bn takeover bid;;GrainCorp, the Australian grain trader, is mounting a defence against a $2.8bn unsolicited takeover attempt by much bigger rival ADM, sounding out potential third-party bidders and reaching out to its own core shareholders about valuation.Advisers to the Sydney-listed company have informally approached some of the world’s largest trading houses to gauge their interest. But so far industry executives said that none is planning to counter bid owing to concerns about valuation, their capacity to pay A$2.7bn in cash and antitrust restrictions.“We have been approached and we will take a look,” one senior executive at a major trading house said. “But I do not expect we will be bidders”. Another executive at a different house also confirmed informal talks through bankers.GrainCorp denied “speculation” that the company was directly courting rival commodities trading houses, but declined to comment further. Industry executives said that several trading houses were using bankers as intermediaries in the talks.The company’s main defence strategy to ADM is to convince its own shareholders that the A$11.75 per share offer that ADM has tabled does not recognise GrainCorp’s growth prospects, according to people familiar with the company’s view.One investor, after recent conversations with management, said that GrainCorp was “not focusing on showing they are worth more than what ADM offers”. But the investor said that an interloper would reinforce the case made by GrainCorp.ADM launched a raid in late October on GrainCorp, increasing its stake from just under 5 per cent to 14.9 per cent. The New York-listed company, one of the world’s largest agricultural commodities traders together with rivals Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, later made public its desire to acquire GrainCorp, one of the last independent medium-size grain traders not to have been swallowed by a bigger rival in the current wave of industry consolidation.Industry executives believe that unless GrainCorp attracts the interest of a Japanese trading house, or sogo shosha, ADM would ultimately take control of the company as major shareholders are seen as keen sellers. Sumitomo is the only sogo shosha with significant interests in the Australian agribusiness industry, but industry executives believe that the company is not interested in a bid for GrainCorp.The bid for GrainCorp follows a series of deals that has transformed the agribusiness industry this year. Toronto-listed Viterra has been acquired by Glencore for $6.1bn, while Marubeni of Japan swooped on privately held Gavilon of the US for $5.3bn including debt. ADM lost out to Glencore in the race for Viterra earlier this year, a setback for chief executive Patricia Woertz’s aim to expand beyond its core businesses of corn in the US.GrainCorp so far has said that it was reviewing the proposal from ADM and had “not yet formed a view on its merit”. Earlier, the company said that in addition to any proposal from ADM, the board would review “other options to maximise value”, suggesting that it could try to stay independent or seek third-party offers.GrainCorp shares have rallied 37.5 per cent over the past two weeks to A$12.16 per share, above the A$11.75 at which ADM bought its latest stake. The rally suggests that investors are hoping the company will attract other bidders.But some analysts believe that GrainCorp could still remain independent, particularly after it received a boost last week when a bill to deregulate fully the Australian wheat industry was unexpectedly pushed through the lower house of Parliament.Dismantling the last vestiges of wheat export regulation will give GrainCorp greater control over its seven ports on Australia’s east coast, analysts said. Although GrainCorp will still have to make its ports accessible to rivals it will now be able to strike long-term contracts with major customers.
185;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Ukraine fails to call a spade a spade;Kiev’s directive to stop grain exports remains in place;The US government has shocked the commodities trade industry. It has just commended Ukraine for showing restraint and not imposing an export ban on grains. But Washington is well aware that Kiev is indeed restricting exports, even if Ukraine has decided to keep its decision under the radar.Ukraine gathered the largest grain trading houses late in October and told them, in unequivocal terms, that exports should slow down to a trickle from November 15, according to trading executives and diplomats familiar with the meeting.Days later Mykola Prysyazhnyuk, the country’s agriculture minister, confirmed the imminent prohibition: “There will be a full ban from November 15. There will be a government order about this. We are not playing games here,” he told Reuters.Kiev now maintains it is not prohibiting wheat exports and officials have since then said that the government would not issue an export ban on November 15. But traders say that the overall directive to stop exports from the middle of the month has not changed. Ukraine is simply not calling a spade a spade.Grain traders report that on top of the clear message from the government to reduce exports significantly, Kiev has also started to use administrative means to make sure the grain flows stop. The government is using sanitary and quality inspections to block shipments, and slow down approval of paper work.The impact of the de facto export restriction will be felt by US companies such as ADM, Bunge and Cargill – among the world’s largest traders of agricultural commodities – and consumers, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region, which usually buy the bulk of their needs from Ukraine and Russia. Other large trading houses, including Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Glencore, would also suffer the forced decline in wheat exports from Ukraine.The agricultural commodities market has been roiled by a series of export restrictions since the food crisis of 2007-08, when countries from Vietnam to Argentina either banned or restricted the export of commodities such as rice, soyabean and wheat. In 2010-11, Russia imposed an export ban after the country’s grain crop was damaged by drought.The G20 has since urged agricultural commodities exporters not to restrict overseas sales. The US, in a statement issued by its mission in Rome to the United Nations food agencies on Monday, said that governments “have exercised prudence and responsibility in policy-making regarding current high food prices, including by avoiding export bans that exacerbated volatility in 2007-2008”. Washington added in its statement: “We are particularly glad to see that the government of the Ukraine has clarified that it has not put an export ban in place.”The commendation, however, contrasts with the situation on the ground. Ukraine may have clarified its position. The problem is that it forgot to tell the traders.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
186;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-30T12:36:26Z;ADM’s quarterly earnings plunge 60%;;ADM, one of the world’s largest agricultural commodities traders, on Tuesday said its net profits plunged 60 per cent in the most recent quarter as US corn supplies, one of its leading revenue drivers, declined due to the worst drought hitting the country in half a century.Archer Daniels Midland said it earned $182m, or 28 cents per share, in the three months to the end of September, down from $460m, or 68 cents per share, in the same period last year. Patricia Woertz, chairman and chief executive, described the past three months as a “complicated quarter, challenged by the drought”.“We are implementing plans to navigate the tight US crop supply,” Ms Woertz said in a statement. The US Department of Agriculture forecast the country’s corn harvest would drop in 2012-13 to just 10.7bn bushels, the lowest since 2002-03.ADM is far more focused on the US market than rivals such as Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities. The four houses make up the so-called ABCD group that dominates global flows of food commodities.The group has promised to expand beyond its US domestic operations and recently proposed an all-cash takeover of GrainCorp of Australia valued at about $2.8bn. The company has already bought a 14.9 per cent stake in GrainCorp at A$11.75 a share, a premium of about 33 per cent from previous share prices.The potential deal would be the latest in an unprecedented wave of consolidation in the agricultural trading sector this year, following the acquisition by Glencore of Toronto-listed Viterra for $6.1bn and the purchase by Marubeni of Japan of privately held Gavilon of the US for $5.3bn including debt.ADM lost out to Glencore in the race for Viterra earlier this year, a setback for Ms Woertz’s expansion plans.“GrainCorp is a well-managed company, and together with ADM would be better positioned to connect Australia’s farmers with growing global demand for crops and food, particularly in Asia and the Middle East,” Ms Woertz said earlier this month.ADM said it lost money in ethanol production during the past quarter as corn prices surged earlier this year and lost $26m in its bioenergy business, down from profits of $153m in the same quarter of last year. “The ethanol industry experienced sustained negative margins,” Ms Woertz said. Corn prices in Chicago jumped to a nominal all-time high of $8.4375 a bushel in August.But the trading house profited from soyabean crushing in Latin America, reporting profits of $336m in the quarter, up from $220m in the same period last year.The company reported net sales of $21.8bn, slightly down from $21.9bn.
187;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-25T18:11:45Z;US farmers reel from soaring feed prices;;One of the biggest US pork and turkey producers is taking radical action against the effects of soaring feed prices. It is sending animals to slaughter with less meat on their bones, rather than fatten them on the farm.“We lose less money if we sell less pounds,” says John Prestage, senior vice- president at Prestage Farms. “These high feed prices are absolutely killing us.”It is large grain consumers such as Prestage that will determine the direction of agricultural commodities markets in coming months. With much of the US corn and soyabean crop harvested after the worst drought in decades, and the South American season just starting, demand is driving grain prices.Corn and soyabeans are used in industries from animal feed mills to biofuel refiners. So-called demand rationing, the painful process of livestock culling and plant shutdowns, should keep grain stocks from falling to critically low levels. But the early evidence suggests such rationing has not gone far enough.The US National Oilseed Processors Association, which includes Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, says its members crushed more soyabeans in September than the same month a year ago. “That will have to slow, and eventually it will because we’ll just run out of soyabeans, but right now it’s not happening,” says Darrel Good, agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.Indeed, China, the destination for more than 60 per cent of the world’s soyabean exports, imported record tonnage in September and advance sales from the US are galloping ahead of last year’s pace. The government has been supporting pig farmers by buying frozen pork and “hog supply continues to rise despite the slowdown of China’s economy”, Rabobank says.Bunge, the soyabean processor and agricultural trading house, has said stronger currencies and low freight rates had blunted the impact of higher commodities prices for many Asian consumers. “The demand out of Asia remains pretty strong,” Drew Burke, chief financial officer, said on a conference call on Thursday.View the effects of the extreme drought faced in the US heartland in our interactive graphic.The US Department of Agriculture forecasts that Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam, each a top 10 soyabean importer, will increase purchases this year.Washington, meanwhile, is buying $100m of pork and $50m of chicken to help domestic farmers struggling with high feed costs and low meat prices. In the US livestock and poultry industries, demand rationing has been uneven.The government’s quarterly pig report showed a breeding herd 5.8m strong – a minuscule 0.3 per cent decline from a year earlier. New York-listed Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork producer, has not cut back on the 135m bushels of corn and wheat and 1m tonnes of soya meal it feeds pigs each year.“Our farms are running at or near capacity,” the company says. Many companies, including Smithfield, hedged feed costs at lower levels earlier this year, leaving them much less sensitive to high prices now. Prestage of North Carolina says its use of feed has declined about 7.5 per cent since it began selling lighter pigs and turkeys.At chicken farms, the number of eggs placed in incubators to be hatched into broiler chickens was running at or above last year’s levels until just last week, when it fell 4 per cent to 177m eggs. Sanderson Farms, a New York-listed chicken producer, can process 9.4m birds a week. But it will slow operations starting next month, says Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer.“We plan to run at 96 per cent of full capacity for the foreseeable future,” he says. “We believe high-priced grain is a reality until we get into next spring and maybe get some help from South America.”Beef producers are rationing demand more vigorously. The number of cattle placed on US feedlots, vast pens where they feast on corn before shipment to meatpackers, fell 19 per cent on year in September, the USDA reports. The ethanol industry, the largest single user of the US corn crop, has cut output about 10 per cent from a year ago, with a corresponding reduction in corn demand. Yet it is still expected to use 42 per cent of the US corn crop.Barring blockbuster South American crops in the next six months, some argue prices will need to rise again to really deter consumers – and spur serious rationing. “You can’t use corn and soyabeans at the rate you used them last year. There is not enough,” says Chris Hurt, agricultural economist at Purdue University. “You’ve got to ration.”Additional reporting by Emiko Terazono in London
188;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-25T14:05:58Z;Bunge doubles its profits amid US drought;;Bunge, one of the world’s largest agricultural trading houses, doubled quarterly profit amid a devastating US drought as it tapped diverse global grain piles to supply customers.The company demonstrated the value of export infrastructure in countries including Brazil, which is set to sell record amounts of corn abroad after prices surged inside the US.Net profit in the third quarter ended September 30 rose 112 per cent year on year to $297m, and earnings per share rose 116 per cent to $1.92 from 89 cents in 2011. Results fell short of expectations.Bunge’s shares have risen since June as investors anticipated it would weather tight supplies despite droughts that hit the Brazilian soyabean crop, the US corn and soyabean crops, and the Russian wheat crop. Investors pushed shares up 2.8 per cent to $70.18 on Thursday.“The beauty of this quarter was that every geography, every portfolio, and every business unit performed well,” Alberto Weisser, chief executive, told the Financial Times.Bunge’s stronger results follow a 300 per cent rise in quarterly profit at rival Cargill. Along with Archer Daniels Midland of the US and Louis Dreyfus Commodities of France, the quartet form the so-called “ABCD” of companies that dominate global grain flows.The importance of access to various origins for grain has been heightened by this year’s US drought, which is expected to reduce corn exports to the lowest levels in 40 years. ADM has sought to diversify origins by offering A$2.7bn ($2.8bn) to acquireGrainCorp, a leading Australian wheat merchant.Mr Weisser declined to comment on GrainCorp. In Australia, where Bunge has a small team, “we’re looking at opportunities for expansion. At the same time, we have a tradition of being disciplined buyers. So we are not going to overpay,” he said.The company’s agribusiness segment, which processes oilseeds such as soyabeans and buys crops from farmers in places such as the US and South America for sale to importers such as China, fuelled most gains in the quarter, with quarterly earnings before interest and tax almost trebling to $406m from a year ago.Tonnage hauled and processed by the segment increased 15 per cent on the year, in part thanks to investments in new US grain and port facilities, large South American grain supplies and strong export demand, Bunge said. Operating profit margin in the third quarter more than doubled to 2.6 per cent of $17.3bn in net sales.Despite high grain prices Bunge executives reported solid consumption, including from the struggling US livestock industry.“We would expect a drop-off in demand here,” said Mr Weisser, whose headquarters are in the US. “We’re not seeing it yet, so we are wondering why. It’s somewhat of a reduction, but not massive.”
189;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-23T16:34:29Z;Crop traders forced to move into new fields;;The worst drought in decades has decimated US corn and soyabean crops, forced ranchers to sell cattle and driven up food prices. It has also quickened efforts to build a global footprint among the world’s largest agricultural trading houses.The US is set to export the least corn in 40 years, exposing the dangers of concentration in any one region for companies moving millions of tonnes of grain each year.Archer Daniels Midland last week underscored the need to diversify when it revealed hopes to buy GrainCorp, a wheat, barley and canola exporter from Australia. Almost 90 per cent of its grain storage capacity is in North America.ADM belongs to the group of global trading houses linking the world’s surplus food regions with fast-growing importers in Asia and the Middle East. New York-listed Bunge, Cargill of the US, Louis Dreyfus Commodities of France and Noble of Hong Kong are among a handful of big rivals.The drought in the US, the smallest Russian wheat harvest in nine years, a de facto Ukrainian wheat export ban and a disappointing 2012 Brazilian soyabean crop have reorientated these companies towards what Cargill calls “atypical trade flows”. Brazil has lately been tapping neighbours for soyabeans. Pig farmers in the US, the world’s leading corn grower, have been forced to import corn from Brazil.The changing map favours traders able to source supplies from a variety of origins. Australia is a top wheat exporter and in the southern hemisphere, harvesting when northern supplies run low.As agricultural trading houses begin to report results from a quarter plagued by drought, performance may vary.View the effects of the extreme drought faced in the US heartland in our interactive graphic.More than half of Bunge’s long-lived assets are in Brazil, which in the past year exported a record 19m tonnes of corn. Company executives recently forecast a “strong finish” for its main trading segment. Third-quarter results are due on Thursday.Privately-held Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trader, has already reported a 300 per cent rise in net profit in the quarter that ended August 31 but said the drought impact “has been mixed”.Both Louis Dreyfus and Glencore, which have strong operations in the Black Sea region, were profiting strongly from the grain trade disruptions, according to people familiar with their operations.In August, Christopher Mahoney, Glencore’s head of agriculture, described a “good” environment with “high prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities”.In ADM’s fiscal year to June 30, operating profit from merchandising and handling grains fell 39 per cent as low grain and oilseed stocks and high prices reduced US exports. Now the US corn crop is projected to be the smallest in six years. In July ADM said it was buying a port in Brazil.“Because of different footprints, the companies have different relative strengths. The historical rule of thumb was that companies would rather have large volumes, not low volumes,” says Gary Blumenthal of World Perspectives, a consultancy.ADM faces not only lower US export volumes but higher input costs for its business that processes corn into products from sweeteners to ethanol. In its home town of Decatur, Illinois, the company has been drilling wells in search of alternative water sources for its massive corn and soyabean processing facilities as drought empties a local lake.The company’s footprint is partially extended by a majority stake in Hamburg-based trader Toepfer and a 16.4 per cent investment in Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil processor.Commodity price volatility has added headaches for risk managers at trading houses who need to hedge fluctuations in commodity prices, freight costs and foreign exchange.“The current environment has been volatile, complex and stressful for everyone who participates in our industry,” Alberto Weisser, Bunge chief executive, told investors last month.Emery Koenig, Cargill chief risk officer, nonetheless embraced the new landscape: “It’s important to allow markets to work and fluctuate properly and not squelch price volatility, because therein lies the incentive for the innovation needed – better yielding crop varieties, better farming practices, better equipment – to help feed the world.”Additional reporting by Javier Blas

192;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-22T11:16:44Z;ADM / GrainCorp – grain assault;Bid war for Australia’s last sizeable handler begins;Resources? So last year. Agriculture is Australia’s next big chance to sate emerging Asia’s hunger, according to a report published by ANZ just as Archer Daniels Midland triggers an almost certain bidding war for the country’s last sizeable grain handler. Trading houses such as ADM should know more about price discipline in excitable markets than most. A battle for GrainCorp will be a test.ADM has offered A$2.7bn, or A$11.75 a share for GrainCorp – a one-third premium to the undisturbed price. Other interested parties include, potentially, all of the big trading houses. There are reasons to rush for GrainCorp. It owns the bulk of Australia’s east-coast grain ports and it is the last sizeable independent trader. There is also the attraction of access to southern hemisphere production – only Australia and Argentina add significant supply in the northern hemisphere’s winter. ADM’s offer, plus net debt, gives GrainCorp an enterprise value of about 8.5 times 2013 earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation. A Glencore-led consortium paid about nine times this year’s forecast ebitda for Viterra while Gavilon went for just over eight times to Marubeni.Agriculture looks like a long-term bull market. The UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation thinks agricultural production could grow by 50 per cent by 2050, or 1.1 per cent a year. ANZ’s report (albeit written by a parliamentary candidate for a rural seat, a fact not disclosed) thinks global output could double by 2050. Small wonder investors have sent GrainCorp shares to A$12.30.ADM showed price discipline this year when it walked away from Viterra. And the trader has played the GrainCorp deal well so far. Its quiet accumulation of 5 per cent, then its Friday swoop on a further tenth puts it in a strong position to take the prize, or at least profit from a rival’s profligacy.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
193;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-22T02:48:44Z;ADM to sell tortilla maker to fund GrainCorp bid;Proceeds of sale to go towards $2.8bn bid;Archer Daniels Midland plans to sell its stake in the world’s biggest tortilla maker as it pursues an A$2.7bn ($2.8bn) cash offer for Australia’s GrainCorp.New York-listed ADM said it had reached a preliminary agreement with entrepreneur Fernando Chico Pardo to sell its 23.2 per cent investment in Gruma as well as minority holdings of flour mill joint ventures with the Mexican company.The Gruma equity stake is worth about 5.1bn pesos ($400m) exclusive of the joint ventures. Mr Pardo is chairman and majority shareholder of Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (Asur), which operates nine airports in southeast Mexico.ADM, a top agricultural commodity trader, has been scouting acquisitions to procure more grain outside its home base in the US, where a severe drought has cut export volumes.Late Thursday ADM added a 10 per cent interest to its existing 4.9 per cent stake in GrainCorp, which stores and moves a third of Australia’s wheat crop, and made public its desire to acquire the company.The agreement to sell its Gruma stake was forged last week. Proceeds might help fund a GrainCorp deal, a person familiar with the matter said.ADM said the Gruma decision reflected “ongoing portfolio management,” the same terminology it used to characterise its GrainCorp move. The agreement with Mr Pardo is not binding and subject to negotiation, board approval, regulatory and other approvals and rights of first refusal, ADM said.GrainCorp surged 39 per cent Monday as trading resumed after ADM lodged its A$11.75 a share offer. Shares reached a record A$12.30 – a 4.7 per cent premium to the offer – as traders bet on a counter bid or a better offer from ADM.The Sydney company said it was evaluating the offer. “GrainCorp has a unique portfolio of integrated, strategic assets and is confident in its outlook and strategy to continue to deliver shareholder value,” it said.The bid for GrainCorp follows a series of deals that have transformed agribusiness this year. Toronto-listed Viterra has been acquired by Glencore for $6.1bn, while Marubeni of Japan swooped on privately held Gavilon in a deal worth $5.3bn including debt.Gruma, founded in 1949, has had a remarkable comeback after bets on dollar exchange rates that went horribly wrong in 2008. Shares are up 49 per cent in peso terms this year and hit a five-year high on Monday, bringing its market capitalisation to 22.2bn pesos ($1.7bn).With operations as far-flung as Shanghai and Ukraine, Gruma reported sales of about $4.2bn last year – a 25 per cent increase on the previous year.ADM, which first took a stake in Gruma in 1996, has suffered a weak share price as investors worry about the effect of high corn prices and low stocks.Neither Asur nor Gruma responded to interview requests via email.
194;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-19T09:20:59Z;ADM snaps up stake in GrainCorp;;"Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s top agricultural commodities traders, has bought a large stake in smaller rival GrainCorp of Australia as a first step towards a possible all-cash takeover valued at almost $3bn.The potential deal would be the latest in an unprecedented wave of consolidation in the agricultural trading sector this year, following the acquisition by Glencore of Toronto-listed Viterra for $6.1bn and the purchase by Marubeni of Japan of privately held Gavilon of the US for $5.3bn including debt.New York-listed ADM said it controlled a 14.9 per cent interest in GrainCorp, after adding a 10 per cent interest to its existing stake after the market closed on Thursday. The company has approached its Australian peer with the aim of agreeing a “cash acquisition”.ADM lost out to Glencore in the race for Viterra earlier this year, a setback for chief executive Patricia Woertz’s aim to expand beyond its core businesses in the US.“GrainCorp is a well-managed company, and together with ADM would be better positioned to connect Australia’s farmers with growing global demand for crops and food, particularly in Asia and the Middle East,” Ms Woertz said.The worst US drought in a half century has buffeted ADM shares as a smaller corn crop raises costs for its corn processing business and reduces export volumes.GrainCorp, one of the last independent grain traders in Australia, said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Friday that ADM had informed it that it had bought a stake “and wishes to engage in discussions” about a potential transaction. ADM added the 10 per cent stake at a 33 per cent premium to Thursday’s close of A$8.85. The purchase values GrainCorp at A$2.7bn ($2.8bn).The Australian grain trader said it had yet to receive a formal takeover bid and suggested it could seek third-party offers in an auction. “Should GrainCorp receive a proposal from ADM, the board will review the proposal as well as other options to maximise value,” it said. Its shares were halted from trading until next Tuesday.Japanese trading houses could be bidders in an auction, industry executives said. Bunge, a rival of ADM also listed in New York, has also indicated it wanted to grow in Australia. Raul Padilla, managing director of Bunge Global Agribusiness, recently told investors the trader was “actively working on the ways to secure the dedicated asset necessary to replicate” in Australia its business in the Americas and Europe.GrainCorp has been the focus of intense takeover speculation since the acquisitions of Viterra and Gavilon for any rival looking to expand in Asia. Its shares hit a four-year high earlier this year and are up 15.6 per cent since January. ADM shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.89 in early New York trading.Rikki Bannan, analyst at Macquarie Securities in Sydney, said that given favourable underlying global agricultural market trends, “agriculture businesses are increasingly attractive acquisition targets”. Australia was last year the world’s second-largest wheat exporter, meeting the food needs of Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. GrainCorp operates seven of the eight ports that ship in grain from Australia’s eastern seaboard as well as warehouses.ADM and rivals Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, known as the “ABCD” of food trading for their initials, dominate the agribusiness sector.The recent wave of takeovers in the agribusiness industry marks the most significant upheaval in the sector since Cargill bought Continental Grain in 1998 for about $1bn, and ADM and Hong Kong-based Noble Group snapped up assets in 2000-01 from the bankruptcy of André & Cie, the Swiss company that until its collapse was the world’s fifth-largest grain trading house by volume.The potential takeover of GrainCorp will intensify speculation about further consolidation. Industry executives said a potential takeover target is The Andersons, a Nasdaq-listed grain trader with a $900m market capitalisation. Any subsequent takeover would have to focus on privately owned companies whose controlling families have so far shown little interest in selling. Among them are Canada-based Richardson International, Peterson Grain and Parrish & Heimbecker; Dutch group Nidera; and Ameropa of Switzerland."
195;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-10-11T16:06:42Z;Cargill quarterly profits surge 300%;;Cargill, the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, reported a 300 per cent surge in profits in its first quarter as it benefited from customers seeking to offset a shortage in US grain supplies due to a severe drought.The family-owned trader on Thursday said it earned $975m in the three months to the end of August, up from $236m in the same period of last year. The quarter is one of the best in its history, on par with earnings during the 2007-08 food crisis.The surge in profits marks a significant improvement for Cargill, which in its full fiscal 2012 reported net income of just $1.17bn– its worst result in nearly 10 years. It also bodes well for other trading houses with significant exposure to grain markets, including ADM, Bunge, Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Glencore.Cargill said it was “tapping the full resources” of the trading house to offset the effect of the US drought and weather problems in other crop-growing areas, including the Black Sea region of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.Gregory Page, chief executive, said: “Now more than ever Cargill is using our knowledge and market insight to help customers manage in this time of tighter supplies, higher prices and more volatile markets.”Corn prices hit in August a nominal record of $8.43¾ a bushel after the worst drought in 50 years hit the farmbelt of the US Midwest. Since then, prices have fallen somewhat as consumers reduced demand. The US Department of Agriculture on Thursday revealed the drought has reduced the country’s corn supplies even more than previously feared, sending prices higher again.As the US exports roughly 40 per cent of the world’s corn, a third of the world’s soyabeans and up to a fifth of the world’s wheat, changes in the country supply have a significant effect on global agricultural markets.Cargill, which trades, stores, processes and transports food commodities from wheat and corn to sugar and cocoa, said it was finding “alternative sources of supply” to its customers suffering from shortages because of the drought in the US.“The weather has altered the normal distribution of raw materials around the world, and that is pushing more international buyers to non-US origins,” it said. “As a result, Cargill expects more atypical trade flows.”The quarterly profits are higher than what the trading house earned in any full fiscal year before 2003. The quarter is also one of the best in its history, particularly considering Cargill no longer benefits from the contributions from Mosaic, the fertiliser company in which it had a 64 per cent stake until splitting it off last year.Cargill said revenues in its fiscal first quarter stood at $33.8bn, down from $34.6bn in the same period of last year. The company, that is the largest US privately-held corporation by sales, does not disclose further financial details.The surge in profitability will benefit the roughly 80 members of the Cargill and MacMillan families – descendants of William Wallace Cargill, the founder of the trading house in 1865 – who control the closely held company. The trading house does not disclose its dividends policy to the families, but according to a report by Moody’s, it limits payouts to 20 per cent of trailing two-year earnings.
196;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Tight corn stocks curb ADM results;Losses on ethanol production and exports struggle;Low US corn stocks have hurt Archer Daniels Midland as the grain merchant and processor lost money on ethanol production and struggled to export the most widely used feed grain.The weaker results at ADM, which processed nearly 25m tonnes of corn last fiscal year making it the US’s largest corn processor, illustrate how widely depressed inventories of US corn have affected the agricultural sector. ADM’s storage silos and grain barge network are concentrated in the US, leaving it more vulnerable than some competitors to low supplies there.Corn prices have been elevated for the past year and recently soared to new records of about $8 a bushel. US stocks, close to record low levels, may decline further as drought ravages this year’s crop.Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive, acknowledged the drought has led to discussion “about who experiences the pain associated with higher prices”.ADM’s net profit fell 25 per cent to $284m, or 43 cents per share, in its fourth quarter ended June 30. This compares with $381m or 58 cents per share a year earlier.The New York-listed company is one of the two largest US producers of corn-based ethanol, with capacity to refine 1.7bn gallons per year of the fuel additive. The company lost money producing ethanol as stocks are high, petrol demand is weak and the amount of corn left over from last year’s harvest has dwindled.The division that includes ethanol plants reported a $61m operating loss in the quarter, down from a $111m operating profit one year earlier. ADM recently closed one ethanol plant in North Dakota.“Industry supply exceeded demand,” said Juan Luciano, chief operating officer. “Margins continue to be extremely volatile, because as the industry is trying to reduce inventories, corn prices have been moving at the same time.”The weak results in ethanol mirror broader strains in the biofuels industry. Valero Energy, a US oil refiner and major ethanol producer, on Tuesday cited “rapidly rising corn prices and continued high inventories” as it reported negative ethanol profit margins.Mr Luciano called the US ethanol business, comprised of both listed companies such as ADM and small farmer co-operatives, a “relatively new industry that needs to mature and consolidate”.ADM’s agricultural services division, which buys, stores, transports and sells grains around the world, reported that operating profit fell 64 per cent to $123m as tight US corn stocks curbed export volumes.As it attempts to diversify its global footprint of grain origins and destinations, the company also said it plans to buy a port terminal in the Brazilian state of Pará and upgrade it to handle 3m tonnes per year of soyabeans and other crops as well as fertilisers.“This port will enhance ADM’s global reach, better connecting the Brazilian harvest to markets including Europe, the Middle East and even Asia,” said Valmor Schaffer, president of ADM South America.Shares in ADM closed 5.1 per cent lower at $26.09 in New York.
197;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-06-27T10:57:40Z;Marubeni eyes more deals to supply China;Japanese trading house seeks Latin America expansion;Marubeni, the Japanese trading house, has vowed to follow up its record $3.6bn acquisition of Gavilon with more deals, as it seeks to challenge Archer Daniels Midland as the biggest supplier of US grains and oilseeds to China.In an interview with the Financial Times, Daisuke Okada, head of the food division, said he had promised managers of Gavilon that the company’s new owners would deliver their “dream” of further growth, chiefly by targeting supplies in Latin America to satisfy voracious Chinese demand.“We will expand in Latin America, maybe eastern Europe, Australia and Africa. We need to spend more money in the future to become a real grain major,” Mr Okada said. “So if we think about future demand in China, we need to have more certainty of supply.”Mr Okada expects that, by 2020, China’s imports of corn will more than quadruple to 15m or 16m tonnes, while its imports of soybeans will increase from 60m to 90m, to feed its rapidly expanding herds of livestock. “Once people eat meat, they never go back,” he said.The acquisition of Gavilon, the US-based grains supplier and trader, announced last month, provoked comment from rivals that the Japanese trading company, the smallest of the big five by market capitalisation, was biting off more than it could chew. Including debt, the deal values Gavilon at about $5.3bn. Until this year, the most Marubeni had spent on acquisitions was the $1.3bn it paid for stakes in Chilean copper projects in 2008.“This is the most ambitious deal, certainly on a relative size basis, that we’ve ever seen from a trading house,” said Penn Bowers, analyst at CLSA in Tokyo.But Mr Okada said that winning the auction for Gavilon was essential to beat rival trading companies to a rare available asset and also to get bigger in an industry where scale is “the only name in the game”.The deal brings together Marubeni’s network of 60 US grain-loaders, concentrated near the Canadian border, with Gavilon’s 140, mostly in Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska.“The merit of scale is always in reducing the cost of transportation,” said Mr Okada. He added that Marubeni was now in discussions with grain majors in New Orleans, where Gavilon has no outlet, to use their facilities.In addition, buying Gavilon deepens Marubeni’s control of actual grain supplies. If the company can now add more local co-operatives in Brazil and Argentina, said Mr Okada, it should make Marubeni a more formidable prospect in China.Last August, Marubeni entered into a feedstuff co-operation agreement with Sinograin, the Chinese state-owned stockpiler, and Shandong Liuhe Group, the country’s largest farming company.“At the moment, customers see us like intermediaries, arranging vessels and buying grain from majors. We’ll keep doing that. But if we can originate for ourselves at the same time, we can say the quality control is done by us. This is a big sales point,” he said.Including the benefits of refinancing Gavilon’s bank debt more cheaply, total synergies are “uncountable,” said Mr Okada, a 33-year Marubeni veteran who also serves as chairman of the group’s China business strategy committee.Mr Okada denied reports that the group was planning to sell Gavilon’s smaller fertiliser and energy-trading divisions, which complement existing businesses at Marubeni. “All three of our divisions are very excited,” he said.
198;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-05-29T15:48:15Z;Marubeni/Gavilon: trading places;ConAgra’s former trading arm will double Japanese group’s grain-handling;In the 1983 movie Trading Places, the two old codgers who run Duke & Duke try to corner the market in frozen concentrated orange juice. Move over, OJ. Now the action is in trading grains, resources and metals, and commodity trading is a global business riding the rise of China. It is dominated by firms in US/Europe and Asia. Japan, a one-time trading house stronghold, is conspicuous by its absence from the top. Marubeni’s $3.6bn purchase of Gavilon is an attempt to change that.The global trading business is dominated by the so-called ABCD (Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus) and NOW (Noble, Olam and Wilmar) camps. Marubeni and its fellow Japanese sogo shosha (general trading houses) – Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Itochu – have a way to go to join them. But they have something in their favour: the strength of the yen, which has risen by a third against the US dollar since the global financial crisis. The Gavilon deal will roughly double Marubeni’s 2012 grain-handling volume to 55m tons, compared with 70m at the likes of Cargill. It also gives the Japanese company a stronger US and Latin American presence.Gavilon, the former trading arm of ConAgra, is privately owned and profits are not disclosed. With the addition of nearly $2bn of debt, the deal puts an enterprise value of up to $5.5bn on the company, about three times its 2011 gross revenues (and half of Marubeni’s market capitalisation). The purchase looks pricey for Marubeni, which has a net debt equity ratio of nearly two.The strong yen will cushion some of that. Indeed, the rising currency has led Marubeni on an overseas buying spree: $1.3bn for a stake in a shale gas project in Texas and a big investment in UK wind turbine projects so far this year.Some air has leaked out of the commodity price bubble, but demand is on a fundamental upturn and is on Japan’s doorstep. Do not rule out the sogo shosha as the commodity traders enter a post-bubble bout of consolidation. (Duke & Duke went bust, of course.)Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
199;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Doubts raised over food stocks growth;;At a New York conference two years ago, an executive from Archer Daniels Midland outlined “three long-term global trends that offer sustained growth opportunities for ADM”: population growth, biofuels and the rise of renewable industrial products.The trends have more or less followed his script. But ADM’s net profit per share has been stuck at $3 a year.ADM’s stagnant performance is indicative of a broader problem for investors in agribusiness stocks. Surging crop prices tend to lift agribusiness shares, but the sector is uneven.Since the start of 2010, when grain markets began their latest ascent, the S&P Global Agribusiness index, which tracks 24 listed companies in the sector, has gained about 4 per cent, underperforming the total return of the S&P GSCI agriculture sub-index, which tracks commodity futures.Individual shares in the agribusiness index have performed very differently to each other. In the same period, tractor maker John Deere gained almost 40 per cent, while seed breeder Monsanto lost about 10 per cent and ADM rose about 3 per cent.Assuming agribusiness names are a proxy for rising grain markets is therefore risky. Companies’ efforts to diversify have cushioned them from sharp swings in commodities but exposed certain sectors to risks. For example, even as the price of soyabeans has risen, too much capacity for crushing them into vegetable oil and animal feed has pinched margins for processors.Analysts question whether the narrative of a commodities “supercycle” reflects what is happening in agriculture, a sector which has defied predictions of a global food shortage for decades despite steadily growing consumption. The US, the top corn exporter, is set to plant its highest corn acreage since 1937 after prices hit a record last year.“Unlike oil and metals, agriculture represents renewable commodities,” says Gary Blumenthal, president of World Perspectives, an agricultural consultancy in Washington. “We can see that in the extraordinary corn crop potential this year.”
200;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-05-10T19:20:17Z;Asia’s agribusinesses: three storylines;Tempting but wrong to lump traders together in times of mixed fortunes;"It is easy for stockbrokers to sell the story that Asia’s agricultural traders are hitting a rough patch. Mixed first-quarter results this week from Singapore-based Wilmar and Noble of Hong Kong suggest that sitting on China’s doorstep is no guarantee of riches. Shares in Olam, the Singapore trader, have fallen by a fifth since February. The three companies were meant to be the new threat to ABC – Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill – whose results showed signs of recovery in the first quarter.The problem with the storyline is how different these companies are. Wilmar is the biggest agribusiness in Asia with a market capitalisation of $24bn. It is focused on palm oil and soya. Noble, meanwhile, is a quarter of its size but more diversified. Only one quarter of its revenue is from agricultural trading; most is from energy. It is the fifth-largest distributor of electricity in the US, for example. Olam is a niche trader in cocoa, garlic, milk and tomatoes, among a gazillion other things.Wilmar’s soya-crushing business in China marred its first quarter. Poor expected harvests in South America meant China stocked up: soyabean imports rose by a fifth in the first quarter. That hurt prices in China but they have risen elsewhere. Combined with overcapacity, that destroyed Wilmar’s margins. Its soyabean-crushing business made a pre-tax loss of $52m in the first quarter. The same time last year it was making up two-fifths of the group’s income before tax. Hence the stock’s 9 per cent drop yesterday.Noble’s profit also fell, on losses in supply chain assets, although operating income from its core supply business was up marginally from a year ago. Earnings have been revised downward at yet-to-report Olam, but it is in so many products and countries that parallels are hard to make. Blame China, by all means. But investors must still make distinctions between traders.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
201;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-05-04T16:29:39Z;Vodka market nears bubble territory;;"When Beam paid $605m for vodkas of the marshmallow, whipped cream and gummy variety, investors could be forgiven for gulping.Some analysts believe vodka, America’s top-selling spirit which accounts for nearly a third of the market by volume and half of its growth, is moving into bubble territory. This is highlighted by an expanding range of flavours, new entrants and flat pricing.Indeed, Jamie Isenwater, analyst at Deutsche Bank, likens vodka to bottled water – a colourless liquid plagued by price deflation and falling margins – but without its advantage of economies of scale.“We’re in pretty extreme territory when it comes to vodkas and flavoured vodkas,” he says, pointing to the rising numbers of flavours that include caviar, curry and Jaffa cake.The vodka market is increasingly fragmented, but Diageo’s Smirnoff continues to lead both globally and in the US. Pernod Ricard’s Absolut is in second place, with Pinnacle – maker of the flavours bought by US spirits maker Beam – providing competition in the US last year.Those who back flavours, including Beam, say the trend has further to run, and with reason. Stripped of new flavours and marketing, differentiation among vodkas is slim. A blind tasting conducted by Mr Isenwater was won by the own label of supermarket chain Asda.Beam, justifying the price tag – 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – with the help of cost saving worth a fifth of sales, is unrepentant. It sees vodka as an established and growing market and says the trend to flavours is durable.Beam’s vodka acquisition could have the useful side effect of keeping predators at bay, analysts say.The maker of Jim Beam, the number two bourbon, was effectively put into play after last year’s spin-off from Fortune Brands, a conglomerate with interests ranging from golf tees to doorknobs.The company, under Matt Shattock, a former Cadbury executive, insisted it had a future as an independent entity – and went on to prove its point by trumping expectations with a maiden set of results under the new structure.Bolting on a $605m acquisition makes it less digestible still. Diageo and Pernod Ricard, the two biggest alcohol companies, both have vodkas – and, indeed, are unlikely to want most of Beam’s extremely long tail of drinks.However, much will depend on Diageo’s talks with tequila maker Jose Cuervo about a potential takeover or equity stake. If Diageo fails to nail a deal in the next few months, it may be left without a mass market tequila – and thus could yet set its sights on Beam, whose portfolio includes Sauza, the number two tequila. – Louise Lucas“Vodka is an inherently profitable category,” says Matt Shattock, Beam’s chief executive, says. “It’s a product you make and sell quite quickly. You don’t lay it down [like Scotch whisky] and tie up capital.”Gross profits are marginally below the spirits industry due to slightly lower prices for vodka, but the negligible capital requirement means this translates into higher returns on capital employed.The flipside, as the naysayers point out, is that anyone can easily pile in. Few know this better than White Rock Distilleries, the private company that sold Pinnacle to Beam – less than five year after selling the not-dissimilar Three Olives to family-owned Proximo Spirits.Size is no barrier to entry. Mr Isenwater sites Wódka Vodka, which entered the US in 2010 and expects to sell 100,000-plus cases by the end of the year – and has only eight employees.Of the vodka industry, he says: “Bottling can be outsourced; new media reduces scale benefits in advertising; and working capital requirements are basically zero since you can sell/consume the product as soon as it is distilled.”Distilling is seldom done in-house he adds, with many buying in alcohol from industrial players like Archer Daniels Midland.Mr Shattock is unperturbed by White Rock’s ability to make and sell flavoured-vodka companies. “Pinnacle is a differentiated brand; it has found a sweet spot and is a much bigger brand [than Three Olives],” he says, adding that Beam has secured non-compete agreements.It is sweet, but some analysts think the younger audience to whom these confectionery drinks appeal could bring distillers under increased regulation. “You only need to go on Google and type in “under-age drinking” and “flavoured vodka” to see that quite a few hits pop up,” says Ian Shackleton, analyst at Nomura. “It’s a drink that appeals to younger consumers, and reminds me a little bit of the alcopop ready-to-drink phenomenon in the early 2000s.”However, he adds that to regulate by means of higher tax, as was the case with the flavoured alcopops, is a trickier proposition for flavoured vodkas given their broader range of drinkers.It would also be tough to raise prices. While volumes are growing 6 per cent each year, or double the spirits industry, increased competition is keeping a lid on prices, says Trevor Stirling, at Bernstein Research.“The fragmented nature of the market and low barriers to entry make it difficult to take price,” he says. “Today discounting is decreasing, but you could not say this is a robust category when it comes to pricing.” Investors, witnessing vodka buyers struggle to reach payback on highly priced deals, could find this unpalatable."
202;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-05-04T09:56:31Z;Ivorian uncertainty weighs on cocoa industry;Concern surrounds Ivory Coast’s market reforms;As the leading cocoa traders, buyers, producers and confectioners sit down for their triennial bash at London’s Grosvenor House on Friday night, they will be aware of the various uncertainties surrounding the industry.Those assembled will hear talk about the worries over real supply figures in Ghana – the second-largest producer of the commodity used to produce chocolate. They will also discuss the weather impact on the new crop. But everyone will be voicing their opinions on the industry’s biggest uncertainty: Ivory Coast’s new cocoa marketing system.The west African nation, by far the largest producer of cocoa, providing more than a third of the world’s output, is in the process of reforming the trading and pricing of cocoa exports, its main source of income.Until now, exporters, including top trading houses such as Cargill, ADM, Barry Callebaut, Olam and Armajaro, have been free to buy and sell the commodity with the price dictated by the market in London. The fully liberalised system, which left farmers exposed to the international cocoa price set in London, came under the auspices of the World Bank in 1999.The country is now reversing tack. Under President Alassane Ouattara, who came to power last year, the Ivorians have created a new regulator – Cocoa & Coffee Council – as well as initiating daily auctions to sell part of Ivory Coast’s next crop, to be harvested from October 2012. Based on the auctions, the cocoa and coffee regulator, led by Massandjé Touré-Litsé, will set a guaranteed price for farmers, as well as the export price of cocoa.The Ivorian forward sales have already weighed on the cocoa market as they have come on top of forward selling by the Ghanian authorities, which have traditionally released their crop ahead of the next harvest. Ghana has for years run a state-controlled system in which the government fixes a price for farmers, guaranteeing them a stable income.Industry estimates of how much the Ivory Coast has auctioned since January range between 400,000 to 550,000 tonnes – just under half the Ivorian annual production of about 1.3m tonnes. “In effect, you now have two crops being forward sold at once,” says one leading cocoa trader.Apart from the price pressure, the Ivorian auctions are deemed to be going smoothly, and ahead of the cocoa dinner, the CCC gave a presentation on Thursday at the Sofitel in London on the reforms.Mme Touré-Litsé confirmed that the purchase limit for each exporter or trader in the auctions for the earlier “main crop” between October and March was 110,000 tonnes. She also noted that a “stabilisation fund” to make up for the discrepancy between the price paid to farmers and the export price would total CFA Fr70bn ($140.4m). The auction system will also be launched for coffee from June, she added.She also announced that auditors PwC were conducting a study on the economics of cocoa grinding. This will help the Ivorian government’s decision on controversial tax incentives for large foreign processors with cocoa grinding operations in Ivory Coast.However, the CCC had little to offer on two key questions – maintaining quality control of the beans and the mechanism at which prices are set – issues yet to be resolved between the Ivorians and the exporters.Those who buy cocoa from Ivory Coast currently discount the price they pay for inferior-quality beans brought in by the farmer. However, the new rules ban discounting from the price set by the CCC leaving the exporters without a means for quality controlIndustry executives are also worried about how their costs and margins will be factored into the regulated pricing.A stable source of good-quality sustainable cocoa from the world’s largest producer is essential for the cocoa industry, which needs the Ivory Coast’s reforms to succeed. However, industry executives are worried that the push for reforms without important details could lead to a rocky time ahead for the market.One executive at a leading trading house warns there could be a short-term physical shortage in the market once the 2012-13 harvest starts in October unless the details are not ironed out soon. “In general people are nervous, so they will want to make sure they are not short,” he says.
203;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-05-01T18:18:14Z;Chesapeake shares rise as US markets rally;;Chesapeake Energy shares jumped as much as 11 per cent on Tuesday after the US natural gas producer said chief executive Aubrey McClendon would step down from his role as chairman.The company also reported it would terminate a contentious scheme that allowed Mr McClendon, co-founder, to invest in up to 2.5 per cent of Chesapeake’s new wells.Shares in Chesapeake finished 6.3 per cent to $19.60 as investors welcomed the news. Some analysts have referred to the impact of Mr McClendon, who will remain on board as chief executive, as having a discounting effect of up to 10 per cent on the company’s share price.Chesapeake shares remain down 15 per cent over the past month, with natural gas prices having touched near 10-year lows.Peter Miller Jr, Chesapeake’s lead independent director, said the board believed the separation of Mr McClendon’s roles and the early termination of the well-investment option would send a positive signal to the market.Chesapeake’s rally helped to move the S&P 500 energy index 1.4 per cent higher, making it the leading sector group on the benchmark US index.Anadarko Petroleum, one of the largest independent US oil groups, share rose 2.5 per cent to $75.06 as it said high oil prices helped the company increase underlying profits 30 per cent in its first quarter. Despite low prices in natural gas, the company reported post-tax profits increased 30 per cent to $475m compared with the same period a year ago.The average selling price of a barrel of the company’s oil increased to $111.07 in the three months to March from $94.58.The S&P 500 moved 0.6 per cent higher to 1,405.82.Shares on the main US market, muted at the start of the trading day, were lifted by manufacturing data that tempered fears of slowing growth in the US economy.The news that the US purchasing managers’ index for April came in above expectations, rising to 54.8 from 53.4 in March, also boosted shares on the other main US indices.The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest point since December 2007. The blue-chip heavy index gained 0.5 per cent to 13,279.32, moving into territory it has not tested since late-2007.The Nasdaq Composite Index moved 0.1 per cent higher to 3,050.44.PF Chang’s, the Chinese restaurant chain, rose 29.6 per cent to $51.46 as it accepted a takeover offer by the private equity group Centerbridge Partners. The deal to take the company private is valued at about $1.1bn, with Centerbridge taking ownership of all common stock for $51.50 a share. That price represents a 30 per cent premium to PF Chang’s shares over the past 30 days.Rick Federico, chief executive and chairman of PF Chang’s, said: “We are confident that being a private company will provide us with greater flexibility to focus on our long-term strategic plan of elevating our guest experience.”On Tuesday, PF Chang’s reported first-quarter results that showed revenues rose less than 1 per cent to $318m compared with the same period a year ago. Net income, however, declined 41 per cent to $6.3m.Sears Holdings, parent company of big-box retailers Kmart and Sears, was the biggest riser on the main US market, gaining 15.4 per cent to $62.05. The company said on Tuesday it saw first-quarter earnings a share coming in between $1.46 and $1.86 after selling some stores in the US and Canada during the period.Avon, the cosmetics retailer, fell 8 per cent to $19.87 as it reported first-quarter profits that were 82 per cent lower at $26.5m, or 6 cents a share, compared with a year ago. The company, repelling an unsolicited $10bn takeover bid from Coty, a private fragrance group, said labour expenses and other costs hurt gross margins in the period.Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural commodity trading house, said lower ethanol production margins were to blame for a 31 per cent decrease in net profits for the third quarter of its financial year. Shares in ADM gained 7.1 per cent to $33.02 in spite of the earnings report.Five of the big US banks rose more than 1 per cent to put the S&P 500 financial index, up 1.1 per cent, just behind the energy sector on the day. Recording the gains were Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, with each managing to outpace Goldman Sachs, which was up just 0.2 per cent to $115.33.
204;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-05-01T13:58:23Z;Ethanol margins squeeze ADM profits;;Archer Daniels Midland blamed lower margins in ethanol production for a 31 per cent drop in net profits in the quarter to the end of March compared with the same period a year ago.However, the New York-listed agricultural trading house topped Wall Street’s expectations for the first time in four quarters, sending its shares sharply up. In early trading in New York, ADM shares rose 7.6 per cent to $33.20.“We delivered very good results despite difficult margin environments, particularly in ethanol and European oilseeds,” said Patricia Woertz, chief executive. The company tried to reassure investors, saying that “depressed US ethanol margins have slowed industrial production”, bringing supply and demand in line.The trading house said it earned $399m during the third quarter of its fiscal year, or 60 cents per share, down from $578m, or 86 cents, in the same period of 2011. ADM said that excluding one-off adjustments and restructuring costs, it earned 78 cents a share, down 12 per cent from the same period last year.The drop in profits comes after Bunge, one of its closes rivals, announced last week that its net profit fell 60 per cent between January and March compared with the same period of 2011 due in part to lower ethanol margins. Cargill, the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, has seen strong profit growth.ADM said its corn processing unit, which makes ethanol, suffered a 36 per cent drop in operating earnings to $130m in the quarter as demand for the fuel additive dropped. Operating profits at its oilseeds processing unit, which crushes soyabean into oil and feed meal, were down 22 per cent to $395m.However, the agricultural services division, which buys and sells bulk commodities such as corn and wheat in international markets, fared much better, posting a nearly 5 per cent increase to $179m. The increase came on the back of a strong recovery in exports from the Black Sea region, where in 2010 ADM had been wrongfooted by the export bans imposed in response to the worst drought in a century.ADM said net profits for the first nine months of its fiscal year were $939m, down more than 40 per cent from $1.66bn in the same period of its 2011 fiscal year.ADM and its competitors Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities are known in the industry as the ABCD group and dominate agricultural commodity flows. In addition to the leading group, a new generation of Asia-based commodities trading houses are bringing fresh competition to agriculture. The group is known as the Now companies, an acronym of Noble, Olam and Wilmar.Glencore, the world’s largest trading house, expanded its agricultural business with the C$6.1bn ($6.2bn) acquisition of Viterra of Canada in March. ADM withdrew from Viterra’s takeover battle, not submitting a final bid, after the company said that valuations had reached a level that did not meet is return target.Industry executives believe agricultural trading is set for further consolidation, with the sale of Gavilon, a US-based grain trader owned by several top Wall Street names, and the partial privatisation of United Grain Company, a leading agricultural trading house in Russia. Ms Woertz left open the door for future acquisitions, saying companies, including ADM, were “looking for a global scale”.
205;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Cargill regains footing as it manages risk;;Cargill regained its footing in a tumultuous global economy as agile commodities trading and strong sales of food ingredients helped stabilise profits in its third quarter.The world’s biggest agricultural trading group reported $766m in net profit in the quarter to February 29, $3m more than the same period a year ago. Excluding earlier contributions from its former stake in fertiliser company Mosaic, Cargill’s quarterly results broke records.The quarter coincided with stronger economic data in the US and signs Europe’s leaders will contain the continent’s debt crisis. Cargill, which trades and processes commodities from corn to cocoa, said it had become more successful at managing macroeconomic risks.“Although it continues to be an unsettled year for the global economy, we did a better job navigating the uncertainty,” said Greg Page, chief executive of the Minnesota-based company.In the first half of its fiscal year, Cargill had blamed political uncertainties for weak results. Net profit in its first nine months was $1.1bn, compared with $2.29bn in the same period a year before.The announcement could be a positive portent for New York-listed commodities traders such as Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, which have also struggled recently and are due to report results in coming weeks.Cargill, the largest privately owned company in the US, said its 40 food ingredients businesses together earned the most of any third quarter, as sales of products such as sweeteners and vegetable oils rose. The business line includes value-added products that analysts say are an increasing share of earnings for Cargill, historically known for trading bulk commodities.Commodities trading also bounced back from a weak second quarter, though results were below that of the year before. The origination and processing segment that buys, sells and transports grains, soyabeans and other crops around the world “established favourable trading positions in most parts of the business, even though the slowdown in US grain exports, the build-up in global oilseed processing capacity and geopolitical tensions made for challenging market conditions”, Cargill said.It also said its energy group, which trades coal, natural gas and petroleum, had “much stronger” results.Cargill’s agricultural services segment, which buys grain from farmers and sells them animal feed, had lower profits than last year because the company bought more US grain than usual in the first half of its fiscal year, curtailing flows in the third quarter.Cargill’s beef business was also squeezed by high cattle prices and weak consumer demand in North America. An extraordinarily mild US winter also meant weak sales of road salt, a historic pillar of Cargill’s industrial segment.Revenues in the third quarter were $31.9bn, 5 per cent more than the same period the year before.
206;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-30T17:17:27Z;Grain traders set for wave of takeovers;;When the farmers of Bulyea, a community of little more than 100 people in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, built a grain silo in 1925 they could have hardly imagined they were setting in motion a multibillion-dollar industry.The silo was the first of what, over many years, become Viterra, the Toronto-listed grain trader that Glencore bought this month in an all-cash C$6.1bn deal.That transaction is the latest sign that the industry started by farmers-cum-businessmen across North America is in the midst of its latest wave of consolidation.Over the next few months, industry executives believe billions of dollars of assets in grain trading will change hands. It will be the most significant upheaval since Cargill bought its rival Continental Grain in 1998, and ADM and Noble bought assets in 2000-01 from the bankruptcy of André & Cie, the Swiss-based company that until its collapse was the world’s fifth-largest grain trading house by volume.This wave of consolidation reflects the turnround in the agricultural market, which for most of the 1990s and 2000s was seen as a backwater even among commodities traders.However, since the 2007-08 food crisis, the industry has offered rising profits on the back of escalating trading volumes. According to the US Department of Agriculture, global exports of wheat are up 40 per cent since 2000-01, corn exports have risen 24.6 per cent, and soyabean overseas sales have surged 66 per cent.ADM, Bunge and Cargill – all US-based – and Swiss-based Louis Dreyfus Commodities, known as the “ABCD” of agriculture, dominate the sector. In addition, a new generation of Singapore-listed traders are bringing competition. This group is known as the “NOW” companies: Noble, Olam and Wilmar.Glencore now joins the top table and indicates it has the appetite for more deals. The FTSE 100 company is strong in several producing regions: Canada, the Black Sea countries and Australia, but still has holes to cover in two other critical areas for agricultural commodities: the US and Brazil.“[We are] looking to expand also in the US,” says Chris Mahoney, the former Olympic rower turned trader who runs Glencore’s agricultural business. But any suggestion that the company will buy more in the near future seems unlikely as Glencore focuses on digesting Viterra.However, its rivals are already lining up to buy Gavilon, the US-based grain trader owned by several Wall Street big names, which is for sale for at least $5bn. Noble, supported by CIC, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund, is interested, as are Wilmar, Bunge and the Japanese trader Mitsui & Co, industry executives say.The sale of Gavilon, which includes among its owners the hedge fund managers George Soros and Dwight Anderson, could precipitate further deals. One company in particular – GrainCorp of Australia – is the talk of the industry.“It’s a very nice company – it’s like a mini-Viterra, with good assets such as silos,” says the head of a top grain trading company. This week, GrainCorp shares hit a four-year high, valuing it at $1.8bn, after a 15 per cent rally over the past three weeks.Another takeover target is The Andersons, a $900m market capitalisation, Nasdaq-listed grain trader. The company, based in the centre of the US corn belt, is among the few remaining publicly listed independent grain traders in North America.Besides The Andersons and GrainCorp, any further consolidation will need to focus on privately owned companies whose controlling families have so far shown little interest in selling. Among them are Canadian-based Richardson International, Peterson Grain and Parrish & Heimbecker, which all could attract interest as the country’s wheat market opens to competition for the first time since the second world war.Dutch-based Nidera, another privately held grain trader, is seen as a good fit for Asian traders seeking exposure to Argentina. Toepfer International is also regarded as a desirable asset, but the Hamburg-based trader is already controlled by ADM – which has been a shareholder since 1983 and has an 80 per cent stake – and the French farming co-operative InVivo, with a 20 per cent holding. The shareholders are unlikely sellers.Industry executives, seeking potential deals, stretch the list of targets in the grain sector to include several trading co-operatives. But they recognise that buying companies such as US-based CHS or CBH Group of Australia would be difficult because of their ownership structure.Nevertheless, the valuations of the Viterra deal – a 45 per cent premium to the share price before the company announced it had been approached – could yet entice owners to sell. As the farmers of Bulyea proved nearly a century ago, trading grain can be very profitable.
207;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-20T13:45:45Z;Glencore agrees C$6.1bn Viterra deal;;Glencore has agreed to buy Canadian grain trader Viterra for C$6.1bn (US$6.1bn) in cash in a deal that will give the London-listed trading house a foothold in the crucial North American grain market.Viterra, based in Regina in the rural province of Saskatchewan, has been the focus of a hotly contested takeover battle in recent months as traders seek to capitalise on the imminent deregulation of the Canadian wheat market.The C$16.25-a-share offer, which still must be approved by regulators and Viterra’s shareholders, represents a 48 per cent premium to the share price the day before talk of the deal emerged this month. It values the company at 22 times consensus forward earnings, according to Bloomberg data.Archer Daniels Midland, which with Glencore had been seen as a frontrunner in the bidding war, said in a statement that it had ultimately decided not to bid because the acquisition “would not meet our return objectives” at the valuation the Glencore consortium put on the company.Glencore has agreed to sell parts of Viterra to two other Canadian companies, Agrium, a fertiliser producer, and trader Richardson International, for a total of C$2.6bn in cash. The side deal would ensure that the majority of Viterra’s Canadian assets remain in Canadian hands, the companies said.The move to split the company would help to appease Canada’s regulators who have blocked several large foreign acquisitions in recent years, according to people familiar with the situation. Moreover, Glencore would base its new North American agricultural division in Regina, Saskatchewan, the company said.“We don’t expect any problems with regulatory approval”, said Chris Mahoney, head of Glencore’s agricultural division.The deal has the support of Viterra’s board and its largest shareholder, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. Mayo Schmidt, chief executive of Viterra, said that a counterbid was unlikely: “It would be my view that the process had come to a conclusion with the best buyer for the assets emerging.”The move on Viterra comes as Glencore is also trying to merge with Xstrata, the London-listed miner, to create a $90bn natural resources powerhouse. Glencore’s acquisition of Viterra makes a purchase of Gavilon, a US-based trading house that is also being circled by bidders, less likely, people familiar with the situation said.However, Mr Mahoney declined to comment on Glencore’s interest in Gavilon, saying only that Glencore was “looking to expand also in the US” and that such an expansion was likely to be through acquisition.Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore chief executive, has made no secret of his desire to expand the company’s agricultural trading division, despite a loss of more than $330m last year trading cotton.Viterra handles up to 45 per cent of the Canadian grain and oilseed market, according to analysts at Macquarie. It also owns almost all of the grain storage capacity in South Australia, through the acquisition of ABB in 2009.The acquisition will put Glencore in pole position to capitalise on the deregulation of the Canadian wheat market, one of the most important export markets for the grain, which is a staple for many of the world’s poor.The Canadian Wheat Board, with sales of $5.1bn in 2010, has enjoyed a monopoly to market wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada for decades. But the ruling Conservative government has introduced legislation late last year to end the CWB’s grain monopoly by August.Glencore was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets. Viterra was advised by Canaccord Genuity. Glencore shares rose modestly after the deal was announced, but remained lower on the day, tracking the broader market. Viterra shares were marginally lower at C$15.91.Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui and Javier Blas

209;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-20T10:42:59Z;Grain traders eye further consolidation;Interest in Viterra and Gavilon suggests appetite for more deals;The grain-trading industry is witnessing a consolidation wave not seen since the merger of Cargill with Continental in 1998, with billions of dollars worth of assets such as silos and port terminals set to change hands.Glencore is in exclusive talks to buy Toronto-listed grain trader Viterra for about C$5.9bn ($6bn). The takeover of the Canadian company, which could be formally announced as early as Tuesday, is the start of the race.Gavilon, the privately owned US grain trader, has been put up for sale by its owners, who include top Wall Street names such as hedge fund managers George Soros and Dwight Anderson, with a price tag of at least $5bn. With companies such as Wilmar of Singapore and Mitsui of Japan expressing interest, a sale could be announced soon.The wave of consolidation reflects the turnround in the agricultural market, which for most of the 1990s and 2000s was seen as a backwater among commodities traders. But since the 2007-08 food crisis, the industry has offered rising profits for top traders, including the so-called ABCD companies: ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.Who else could follow? The industry is largely consolidated, but still a few grain traders remain independent and could become takeover targets. Industry executives say the interest in Viterra and Gavilon, suggests appetite among buyers for more deals.Among the independent traders, GrainCorp of Australia is regarded by many in the industry as a potential target. The company, listed in Sydney, has seen its shares rise almost 8 per cent since Viterra disclosed a week ago that it had been approached by third parties. The deregulation of the Australian wheat market in the 2000s has boosted interest in the group.Nidera of the Netherlands is another potential target, although the three families who control the privately held trader have not indicated any desire for a sale. Industry executives said that several companies had looked at buying Nidera, which was founded in 1920 in Rotterdam, over the past few years.Nidera, whose name is made up of the initials of the countries the company covered in the 1920s – Netherlands, India, Germany (Deutschland), England, Russia and Argentina – is seen as a particularly good fit for Asia-based traders seeking exposure to Latin America and the Black Sea region.Toepfer International, is also regarded as a desirable asset, but the Hamburg-based trader is already controlled by US agricultural trader ADM – which has been a shareholder since 1983 and has an 80 per cent stake – and France farming co-operative InVivo, with a 20 per cent holding. The company, founded in 1919 by Alfred Toepfer, is one of the largest grain traders in Europe and the former Soviet Union and a big supplier to the Middle East and north African region. Due to ADM’s large shareholding, a sale to a rival trader is unlikely.Industry executives stretch the list of potential targets in the grain sector to include several trading co-operatives. But they recognise that buying companies such as US-based CHS Inc or CBH Group of Australia would be very difficult due to their ownership. Nevertheless, the valuations of the Viterra deal – Glencore is likely to pay a 45 per cent premium – could yet entice farmers to sell.The final grain candidate is not a takeover target, but rather a spin-off that could add to the changes in the industry. Noble Group, the Singapore-listed multi-commodities trader, is considering listing its agriculture division to create a company valued at about $5bn to be called Noble Agri Ltd. Noble filled an initial application last year to float the unit, but later pulled its plans amid volatile equity markets.Yet whatever the spin-offs or mergers, the agriculture industry is set for more changes among large companies in the near term.
210;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-20T10:15:55Z;Viterra: a grain of hope;Commodity trader Glencore wins the $6bn battle for Canadian grain trader;Big companies can dominate small markets. Not so in Saskatchewan. The Canadian province made its name in 2010 when mining company BHP Billiton’s bid for PotashCorp was blocked. On Tuesday, it emerged that commodity trader Glencore, in conjunction with Canadian agricultural groups Agrium and Richardson, have won the fight for grain group Viterra – at a price of about $6.1bn – while the world’s four dominant agricultural dealers, ADM, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus (ABCD) looked on.This was perhaps expected. The ABCD group controls up to 90 per cent of the world’s grain trade. The problems of dragging competition authorities across the line (not to mention the negative exposure as lobby groups accuse them of pushing up world food prices) is something none of the companies needs. And although Glencore is the world’s biggest commodities trader by sales, it has very little presence in both Canada, and agriculture globally. Indeed, it generated just $17bn worth of sales from its entire agricultural products division (less than a 10th of its top line) last year. Viterra’s revenue from grain handling and marketing – which is derived only in Canada and Australia – would add half as much again to Glencore.So far so good. But the hitch could be an unusual back-to-back deal structure. Glencore plans to sell on Viterra’s 260 farm supply stores to Agrium. Added to Agrium’s own 75 stores, the producer of farm products will have a stranglehold on the market in some regions that many farmers may object to. In spite of that, the consortium will almost certainly find a way to complete the deal. After nationalistic fervour killed BHP’s attempt at Potash, Canada’s politicians are under pressure to remind the world that the country is open for business. It can now do so without involving the grain world’s big dogs.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
211;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-19T23:28:12Z;Glencore in exclusive talks over Viterra deal;;Glencore has entered exclusive talks to buy Viterra, the Canadian grain trader at the centre of a takeover battle, according to industry executives.The Canadian group said on Monday that it had entered “exclusive discussions with a third party regarding the possible acquisition of Viterra”.It declined to identify the other party but industry executives told the Financial Times that Glencore was the suitor. The London-listed commodities trading house, which is also attempting a $90bn merger with Xstrata, has joined forces on the bid with two Canadian companies, Agrium, a fertiliser producer, and Richardson International, a privately owned grain trader.If the bid is successful, the companies plan to split Viterra into three parts, with Glencore taking the grain business, Agrium the retail fertiliser business and Richardson the food processing business.The exclusive talks will come as a blow to other traders, including Archer Daniels Midland and Bungeof the US, which have been working on bids for Viterra.The interest in the company, which is listed in Toronto, comes as the lucrative Canadian grain market, one of the largest in the world, opens to private sector competition for the first time since the second world war.In a statement, Viterra said that the negotiations were based on a price “consistent with our previous statement”. Viterra referred to “reports speculating about …third parties’ expressions of interest of approximately C$16 per Viterra common share”.Shares in Viterra edged 1.48 per cent lower to C$15.97, although they were still up about 45 per cent since the grain trader revealed that it was in talks over a possible bid 10 days ago. A C$16 a share bid would value the whole company at C$5.9bn ($6bn).Glencore declined to comment while Viterra did not comment beyond its statement.The acquisition of Viterra’s grain trading business would give Glencore a strong position in global wheat and barley export markets.In addition to a 45 per cent share of the Canadian grain market, Viterra has significant operations in Australia, where it bought ABB, the Australian trader, for $1.2bn in 2009. Glencore already has a large presence in Australia and the Black Sea region.
212;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Glencore poised for joint bid for Viterra;;Glencore is in advanced talks with two Canadian companies to launch a joint bid for Viterra, the Toronto-listed grain trader now at the centre of a takeover battle.The London-listed commodities trading house is preparing a bid with Agrium, a fertiliser producer, and Richardson International, a privately owned grain trader. A formal offer is expected as soon as early next week, industry executives said.New York-listed grain traders Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge are also planning to bid for Viterra, industry executives said. However, Cargill, the world’s biggest food commodities trader, does not plan to bid. ADM is seen as the top rival to Glencore, executives said.Glencore’s attempt to expand in agriculture comes as Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive, is trying to merge his trading house with Xstrata, the London-listed miner, to create a $90bn natural resources champion.Viterra said on Thursday it had started a formal sale process, providing potential bidders wanting to carry out due diligence with access to its financial information. The company said it was aware of speculation of interest at C$16 a share, although it said “there can be no assurance that a transaction will occur” or at what price.Viterra shares jumped 9 per cent after the announcement to C$16.07, valuing it at more than $5.5bn. The shares have risen more than 45 per cent since the grain trader disclosed on Friday it had been approached.The price tag would remain a challenge for the bidders because leading shareholders are asking for C$15-C$19. Amit Wadhwaney, at Third Avenue Management, the third-largest shareholder in Viterra, said a deal would be only possible in the “high teens”.The interest on Viterra comes as the lucrative Canadian grain market, one of the largest globally, opens to private sector competition for the first time since the second world war.The end of the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board is set to boost the profitability of the commercial traders. The CWB, with sales of $5.1bn in 2010, has had exclusivity in the marketing of wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada since 1942. But the ruling Conservative government introduced legislation late last year to end the monopoly by August.Glencore is planning with its partners to split Viterra into three parts, with the trading house taking the grain business, Agrium buying the retail fertiliser business and Richardson taking over the food processing business.Mr Glasenberg met investors in the US this week and made no secret of his desire to bulk up Glencore’s business in asset-heavy agriculture trading in North America. However, people who met Mr Glasenberg in New York suggested that Glencore had limited interest in retail assets.Glencore would also be likely to sell Viterra’s stake in the Medicine Hat fertiliser complex, the people added, with its partner CF Industries seen as a likely buyer for the stake. Viterra owns 34 per cent of Canadian Fertilizers Limited, which built the Medicine Hat plant in the 1970s, while CF Industries holds 66 per cent.Glencore, Viterra, Bunge, ADM and Cargill declined to comment. Agrium and Richardson did not immediately return calls seeking comment.Additional reporting to Anousha Sakoui in London
213;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;People on the move;;After a strategic review that called for a shift in focus, Ayman Safadi has been named chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Media, the government company that owns the United Arab Emirates daily newspapers The National and Al-Ittihad, as well as a number of investments in film, television and online content.Mr Safadi, who has served as Jordan’s deputy prime minister and adviser to its king, has previously worked as a newspaper editor, both at Al-Ittihad and Al-Ghad, a Jordanian independent daily. His experience in Arab media and politics will come in handy at ADM, which has said it plans to focus more tightly on the production of locally relevant, Arabic-language content.Malcolm Wall, Mr Safadi’s predecessor, will become an adviser to the ADM board after his short stint as chief executive. The former executive at the UK’s Virgin Media was appointed to the top job at ADM in June 2011.……………………………………………………………Fraser Curley will become the chief executive officer of Zain Saudi Arabia, the Saudi subsidiary of Kuwait-listed regional mobile operator Zain.He replaces Zain group veteran Khalid al-Omar, who is retiring after a 26-year career with the company. Mr Curley has previously led the mobile telecommunications business of Deutsche Telekom subsidiary Detecon, as well as having a number of other roles in the European telecom industry.In replacing Mr Omar, who was widely seen as an interim CEO, Mr Curley becomes the third chief executive at Zain Saudi Arabia in the past six months. Last October, Saad al-Barrak, a veteran Zain executive who resigned as group chairman in 2010, quit as chief executive of the Saudi subsidiary.…………………………………………………….Kamal Ahmed, Bahrain’s minister of transport, has been appointed acting chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the kingdom’s business promotion body. He replaces Sheikh Mohammed bin Essa Al Khalifa, who has been named adviser to Bahrain’s crown prince, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, a role he has held on a de facto basis for many years.An engineer by training, Mr Ahmed was the EDB’s chief operating officer until last February, when he was appointed as cabinet affairs minister at the height of last year’s destabilising unrest.Sheikh Mohammed is moving to the court of the crown prince amid continuing domestic tensions and opposition pro-democracy protests.

214;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-13T10:15:41Z;Viterra bidders need local ‘face’ for deal;Investors set to hold out for C$15-C$17 per share;"The companies circling Viterra, the Toronto-listed grain trading house, are working quickly on a crucial element for a successful bid: a Canadian face for the deal.Whoever tables a formal offer – and I believe Glencore, Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge are leading the race – it is likely to need a local partner to make the deal more palatable to politicians and farmers.The involvement of a local partner would help soothe local opposition to a foreign takeover. Viterra is based in the rural Canadian province of Saskatchewan, home too of PotashCorp. In 2010, the Canadian government blocked BHP’s $40bn hostile takeover for the fertiliser company, saying the sale would not provide a “net benefit” to the country.Brad Wall, Saskatchewan’s premier, said on Monday that his government would review any takeover, echoing comments by federal officials in the capital Ottawa. But in a sign that a deal faces significantly less opposition, he clarified that Viterra was not “strategic” for the Canadian province, unlike PotashCorp.Industry executives and investors say, nonetheless, that a local face would be extremely helpful to secure the takeover. “This [takeover] is not without political sensitiveness,” Amit Wadhwaney, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, the third-largest shareholder in Viterra, told me.The bidders have several local partners to choose from.The most likely candidates are Richardson International, the privately owned Canadian grain trader; Agrium, the Calgary-based fertiliser company; the $107bn mammoth Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, and the Alberta Investment Management Corp., a $70bn asset manager for several Canadian pension funds.Richardson looks the most obvious candidate. The Winnipeg-based company is already the second-largest grain trader in Canada and is building a substantial retail business in fertiliser, pesticides and seeds. Richardson could try to snap up the retail business of Viterra and some small grain assets, industry executives said.Agrium could play a similar role. The fertiliser company is already familiar to the sector. It bought the former Australian Wheat Board for $1.2bn two years ago, keeping the fertiliser and retail business and offloading the grain trading business to Cargill.Canadian pension funds, which have a strong appetite for deals in infrastructure and the commodities sector, are likely to get involved.The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan already tried in February 2007 to push the consolidation of the Canadian grain sector. It supported a merger between Agricore, a trader then listed in Toronto, and Richardson. The OTPP would have ended with a 20 per cent stake in the resulting company with an investment of $266m. The deal was, however, disrupted by Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, which came in with a higher offer. The merger in August 2007 of Saskatchewan and Agricore formed today’s Viterra.Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMco as the company is known, is also seen as a potential local partner. AIMco is already the largest shareholder in Viterra with a 17 per cent stake and last year publicly demanded changes to the company’s board to improve shareholder returns. Brian Gibson, a senior manager at AIMco who sits on the Viterra board, was a key figure of the merger proposal between Agricore and Richardson in 2007 from his position then as a portfolio manager at OTTP. Many in the industry see Mr Gibson as a key figure in any Viterra deal.Industry insiders added that two other large pension fund managers – the $160bn Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and the $150bn Canada Pension Plan Investment Board – could be regional partners to any deal.Yet a local partner would not resolve all the obstacles. The price tag would remain a challenge for the bidders. I heard from several top-20 shareholders in Viterra that they would only sit down to discuss an offer in the C$15-$17 range. Viterra, which has rallied more than 30 per cent over the past two days, closed on Monday in Toronto at C$14.45 per share."
215;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-03-09T21:34:15Z;Viterra shares soar on takeover interest;;Viterra shares soared 24 per cent to a three-year high after the Toronto-listed grain trader said it had received expressions of interest from third parties.The company is seen as a natural takeover target as the lucrative Canadian grain market, one of the largest globally, opens to private sector competition for the first time since the second world war. The end of the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board is set to boost the profitability of the leading commercial traders in the country, Viterra and privately owned Cargill and Richardson International.Viterra, based in Regina in the rural province of Saskatchewan, said in a statement on Friday that it had received expressions of interest only hours after Mayo Schmidt, chief executive, told Canadian television the company was not a takeover target.Asked specifically whether Viterra had been approached, Mr Schmidt had said: “No, we haven’t been approached”.The company declined to name the parties, but industry executives said that Glencore, US-based traders Cargill, ADM and Bunge, France’s Louis Dreyfus Commodities, and Singapore-listed Noble Group and Wilmar could be interested in the business. After the surge in Viterra’s share price, the company’s market value rose to C$5bn.Industry executives said several parties could buy Viterra, splitting the assets it owns in Canada and Australia. “Everyone is looking at them,” said a senior executive of a leading trading house. “They have lots of grain elevators and terminals that are very attractive,” the executive said. Bankers said the Canadian company was likely to run an auction process leading to a sale.The Alberta Investment Management Corporation, the largest shareholder in Viterra with a 16 per cent stake and one of Canada’s largest pension funds, last November publicly criticised the company for failing to improve shareholder value. The pension fund said on Friday it stood by its earlier comments.The Canadian Wheat Board, with sales of $5.1bn in 2010, has enjoyed a monopoly to market wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada since 1942. But the ruling Conservative government, fresh from an election success, introduced legislation late last year to end the CWB’s grain monopoly by August.The CWB rents silos and export terminals to commercial traders such as Viterra, which controls 35 per cent of Canada’s grain supply chain. The end of the monopoly would allow Viterra to trade the grain itself, boosting profits.“The removal of the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board bodes very well for our business,” Mr Schmidt said on Canadian television on Friday. “Viterra’s assets are the envy of our sector today,” he added.The consolidation of Canada’s grain trading industry has already begun. In January, Richardson International, one of Viterra’s main competitors, announced the acquisition of grain handling facilities in Alberta from Great Northern Grain.With sales of 15.5m tonnes of wheat and 5.5m tonnes of other cereals last year, the CWB is the world’s biggest trader of wheat. Such is its size that its sales of the grain are larger than the shipments of some of the world’s leading wheat exporting countries.The battle for CWB and the approaches to Viterra echo the consolidation that took place in Australia after the country dismantled its grain monopoly, the Australian Wheat Board, in 2008. Over the next three years, the decision reshaped the country’s agribusiness industry. Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader, bought AWB and Viterra expanded heavily in the country through its acquisition of Australian grain trading house ABB Grain for $1.2bn in shares and cash.Viterra closed at C$13.58 per share in Toronto, up 23.7 per cent on the day. The shares earlier touched C$14.10, the highest since July 2008.The potential sale of Viterra comes as Gavilon, the US-based grain trader, has put itself up for sale. Gavilon, which bankers say could be sold for as much as $5bn, has attracted some interest from Glencore, Bunge and Wilmar, bankers said.Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui, Gregory Meyer and Jack Farchy
216;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Noble warns of ‘stressful’ year ahead;;Noble Group, one of Asia’s largest commodities traders, warned investors that 2012 would be another “stressful” year as it posted a 57 per cent fall in fourth-quarter net profit.Hong Kong-based Noble, which is listed in Singapore, made a net profit of $105.7m in the three months to the end of December, having shocked the market in the third quarter with its first quarterly loss in more than a decade.Richard Elman, Noble's acting chief executive, said 2012 would be “challenging”.“It’s steady as she goes, cautious, watching everything very carefully, not doing anything silly, and continuing to grow and build the business,” said Mr Elman, who founded Noble in 1987.“There will be some opportunities during the year no doubt, but I think it’s going to be another stressful year.”The group reported net profit of $431.3m for 2011, down from $605.6m for 2010.Tanuj Shori, analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong, said the earnings were “bang in line” with the market’s estimates.“Everyone should have been expecting a weak result for Noble because markets were weak, so I don’t think these earnings should come as a surprise,” said Mr Shori.The commodities trading industry suffered a sharp drop in profitability in the second half of last year amid weaker demand and widespread defaults in some markets such as cotton.Glencore, the world’s largest commodity trader, lost more than $330m trading cotton last year, contributing to an 18 per cent drop in earnings in its trading business. Other agricultural traders such as Cargill, Bunge, and Archer Daniels Midland have also reported tough trading conditions.ADM, Bunge and Cargill, along with Louis Dreyfus Commodities of France, are known by their initials as the “ABCD” of companies that dominate global agricultural trading flows. But trading houses based in Asia, including Noble, Olam and Wilmar, are challenging their dominance.The weakness in Noble’s metals and minerals division, which reported a 66 per cent year-on-year drop in its operating income, stands in contrast to Glencore’s metals trading business, which reported relatively firm earnings for the second half of the year. Noble however is more reliant on iron ore trading, which suffered from low freight rates and a fall in exports from India.Noble, which has net debt of $4.6bn, sought to reassure investors about the strength of its balance sheet.The company said its $1.5bn of gross cash was double its entire 2012 refinancing needs, and that it had unused committed banking facilities of $4.5bn.Noble said it had not yet decided when to launch an initial public offering of shares in its agricultural division, called Noble Agri.The shares closed up 0.3 per cent at S$1.38.The results came as Singapore-based Wilmar International announced the acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in Goodman Fielder, Australia’s largest listed food company, for $124m.The news pushed shares in Goodman up 30 per cent as traders bet it could be the prelude to a full bid or further share buying.Additional reporting by Neil Hume in Sydney
217;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-02-24T14:29:03Z;Singapore’s GIC builds stake in Bunge;;Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund has built a large stake in Bunge, a leading agricultural trader, in the latest example of Asian and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds buying into commodities trading houses.The investments by GIC, which has bought a 5 per cent stake in the New York-listed company worth nearly $500m at current share prices, come as Asian and Middle Eastern countries are looking to secure sources of metals, energy and food as their economies expand and populations grow.GIC will become the largest shareholder in the trading house, ahead of blue-chip asset managers such as Vanguard Group, Fidelity and BlackRock.GIC is already a major shareholder in Glencore, the London-listed commodity trader, through convertible bonds and shares, alongside Aabar, one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign funds. Singapore’s other sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, is the second-largest shareholder in Olam International, the Singapore-listed trader. Beijing’s China Investment Corp holds 14.5 per cent of Hong Kong-based Noble Group, the second-largest investor after the trading company’s chairman.Both Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the agricultural trading house, and Mercuria, a leading oil trader, have also in the past indicated that they may seek strategic investments from sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East.Although Asia and Middle East countries are trying to secure access to oil and commodities, their investments in the trading houses appear, so far, to be largely financial. “They are interested in returns, not commodity supplies,” said the chief executive of a trading house which counts an Asian sovereign wealth fund as a significant shareholder.Industry executives said that Asian investors, particularly sovereign wealth funds, were ready to pay higher multiples for commodities trading houses than western investors. While Olam and Wilmar trade in Singapore at a forward earnings multiple of 11-13 times, Bunge trades in New York at a multiple of 9 times, according to Reuters data.Bunge and its rivals ADM, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, are known by their initials as the “ABCD” group that dominate global agricultural trading. Asian based traders include Noble, Olam and Wilmar International, while European commodity trading houses include Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, Gunvor and Mercuria.This month Bunge warned of tough market conditions, but Alberto Weisser, chief executive, said at that time that the world’s growing demand for food meant that trading groups would need to grow as well, boosting the profitability of the commodities houses.It is unclear over what period of time GIC built up the stake, but the trading company’s shares have been rising steadily since the start of the month, and on Thursday were at $67.83, up 18.4 per cent since the beginning of February.GIC, whose holdings in Bunge were revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the New York market close, did not return calls seeking comment. Bunge was not available outside regular business hours in New York.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London
218;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-02-22T20:12:42Z;Wilmar: greasing investors palms;Palm oil producer reported a 21% profit rise but disappointed investors;Palm oil refiners look to be out of a sweet spot. Wilmar, the world’s biggest refiner of the product used in everything from chocolate bars to instant noodles and biofuels, said on Wednesday that its net profit rose by 21 per cent in 2011. This might sound admirable, but it missed consensus forecasts. As a result, investors promptly wiped 11 per cent off the Singapore company’s share price.At least these investors appear to be living more in the here-and-now. After all, crude palm oil hit an eight-month high on Wednesday. The theory is that rising prices will place pressure on refining margins, which fell by one-third at Wilmar in the last three months of 2011. Since palm oil refining and trading comprises half of Wilmar’s revenue, it is more exposed than its “ABCD” western peers (ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus), which deal in a far wider range of agricultural products.Wilmar, though, has some long-term advantages. It resides on the doorstep of the biggest palm oil consumers – China, Indonesia, India and Malaysia. These countries comprise almost half of global palm oil consumption, according to Oil World consultants. Wilmar has refineries in all of them bar India, giving it unrivalled access compared with ABCD. Wilmar has also moved into branded goods – it holds 45 per cent of China’s branded cooking oil market, for example.The margins of these consumer brands were hurt last year when the Chinese authorities imposed price controls in an attempt to curb inflation. But they doubled in the last three months of the year after Wilmar was allowed to raise prices again.Agricultural commodity traders are going through a tough time as raw material prices soar. Wilmar trades at a premium of one-third to Bunge’s multiple and 14 per cent to ADM’s. That seems justified. Palm oil and Asia go well together.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
219;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-02-22T18:43:10Z;Wilmar falls more than 10% after profits drop;;Shares in Wilmar, Asia’s largest agricultural commodities trader, fell by more than 10 per cent after it reported a sharp drop in profits at its palm oil and soyabean businesses due to weak demand in Asia and Europe.The Singapore-listed company reported net earnings of $500m for the quarter and $1.6bn for the full year, up 56.9 per cent and 20.9 per cent respectively from the same periods in 2010.However, the results were flattered by a one-off revaluation of Wilmar’s plantations.Wilmar’s palm oil processing division – traditionally the most important driver of its earnings – saw a 36 per cent drop in pre-tax profit from a quarter earlier, driven by a 30 per cent contraction in refining margins. Profitability at its oilseed processing unit fell 98 per cent. Wilmar is the world’s largest processor of palm oil, used in everything from cooking oil to shampoo.The company said that “unfavourable market conditions in China and India, the financial crisis in Europe and the disadvantaged position of Malaysia given the new Indonesian export duty structure” had contributed to the lower margins.The disappointing results follow lower agricultural earnings at other large commodities traders such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Glencore.The shares, which had rallied sharply since the start of the year to touch a 14-month high, fell 10.9 per cent on Wednesday as investors digested the poor results. “This result, we think, will be a big disappointment,” said analysts at Macquarie.Wilmar has launched an aggressive expansion in recent years, moving into sugar with the purchase of Sucrogen, an Australian sugar company.Kuok Khoon Hong, Wilmar’s chief executive, said the company remained on the prowl for deals: “We are exploring closer collaborations with various parties in many of our businesses to meet the growing demand for agricultural products.”“With Wilmar’s healthy balance sheet, improved range of downstream product offerings, strong infrastructure in Asian countries and further expansion in Africa, we are well positioned to capture emerging markets growth as well as other agri-related expansion opportunities which might arise,” he added.
220;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-02-09T14:56:47Z;Bunge warns on a challenging 2012;;"Bunge, one of the world’s leading suppliers of agricultural commodities, reported sharply lower results in international trading and foresaw tough market conditions in the year ahead.The New York-listed company reported that operating profit in its main agribusiness segment dropped 46 per cent to $203m in the fourth quarter of 2011 from a very strong quarter a year ago. The agribusiness group buys grain and soyabeans from farmers for processing or export.Bunge is not alone in encountering a difficult trading environment. Last week, Archer Daniels Midland said profit plunged 89 per cent in the same quarter, while privately-held Cargill suffered similar declines in its most recent quarter.“We should be realistic that there’s an economic crisis out there in the world,” Alberto Weisser, Bunge chief executive, told the Financial Times. “This means things are volatile. You have issues; people get nervous. Farmers are a little bit more cautious. Customers are a little bit more cautious. Everybody pulls in their horns.”The conditions have put pressure on profit margins, Mr Weisser said. On a conference call with analysts, Bunge said its trading became “very, very conservative” late last year.ADM, Bunge and Cargill, along with Louis Dreyfus Commodities of France, are known by their initials as the “ABCD” of companies that dominate global agricultural trading flows. This dominance is facing increased competition from trading houses based in Asia, including Hong Kong-based Noble Group and Olam and Wilmar of Singapore.Mr Weisser said that as food demand grew – the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates production needs to increase 70 per cent by 2050 – trading groups will need to grow as well.“You have a situation where most of the growth is going to come in the areas where there’s no agriculture or no potential for expansion,” he said. “There’s room for many competitors. But they all will have to grow.”Grain flowed more freely in late 2011 as Russia and Ukraine returned to international markets after lifting export bans. Bunge said trading volumes increased 22 per cent to 39m tonnes mainly because it sold more grain from the Black Sea region and started buying to supply a new export terminal on the US Pacific coast aimed at customers in Asia.Bunge’s fourth-quarter net income was $254m, or $1.65 per share, down more than 15 per cent from $301m, or $1.95 per share, a year before.The company’s sugar cane and ethanol business, hurt by a shortfall in the Brazilian sugar crop, was barely profitable in the quarter. A fertiliser unit lost money.For the full year net income was $942m, less than half of 2010, when earnings were boosted by the sale of a fertiliser business. Mr Weisser said that when combined, Bunge’s agribusiness, edible oils and milling units generated record annual results."
221;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-02-02T10:35:09Z;Corn traders get in touch with their crude side;Farmers need to keep an eye on ethanol and oil markets;Ethanol refiners are the US corn farmer’s biggest customers, buying 40 per cent of the crop. So traders concerned about demand for corn should keep an eye on an emerging trend in ethanol exports.Those exports reached a record 121,000 barrels a day in November, according to Department of Energy data released this week. They have significantly boosted sales for the US ethanol industry and by extension, for the Corn Belt farmers who supply it.Now, anecdotal evidence shows exports are losing altitude.Decelerating shipments could shave demand for corn. Archer Daniels Midland, one of the US’s top two ethanol refiners, says exports declined into December.“Exports are starting to pick up, but they are still reduced,” Juan Luciano, ADM chief operating officer, told analysts on Tuesday. He expects net exports to total about 500m gallons this year – or about 32,000 b/d.Valero, the oil and ethanol refiner, forecast US ethanol exports of between 100,000 b/d-120,000 b/d this year. But the market is going through a “soft period right now,” Gene Edwards, chief development officer, told analysts.Ethanol exports surged last year as US petrol demand faltered and high sugar prices made Brazilian ethanol less competitive. Current US rules prevent fuel companies from blending more than 10 per cent ethanol into petrol, in most cases, which caps domestic use of the fuel additive in spite of mandates requiring more and more of it.Exports are the obvious outlet, but they haven’t been enough to evacuate excess supplies. “So we’ve been building inventories,” Mr Edwards said.This should concern farmers and merchants who have stored last year’s corn in anticipation of higher prices. As profit margins contract for ethanol refiners, weaker hands will be forced to reduce operating rates and, eventually, their corn purchases. Ethanol now tops animal feed as the leading use of the US corn crop, though some ethanol byproducts are fed to animals too.The strengthening bond between energy and corn markets was underscored by Soren Schroder, head of agribusiness Bunge’s North American unit, at a meeting of the Commodity Markets Council this week.“The two are forever linked. Even if you didn’t have mandates, there’s an economic value of corn that is tied to the price of gasoline,” he said.He said that based on their caloric values alone, corn would be between $5-$5.50 a bushel when crude oil is $100 a barrel. WTI crude, the US benchmark, closed at $97.61 a barrel yesterday, while corn was $6.42 a bushel.“You’d better know your stuff in ethanol if you want to trade and manage risk in global feed,” Mr Schroder said.The Financial Times is hosting its first Global Commodities Summit on April 24-25 in Lausanne, Switzerland.

222;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Canada prepares for open wheat market;Board loses monopoly after more than 70 years;Cherilyn Nagel made history on the Canadian prairies in January. She signed a contract to deliver 1,000 tonnes of durum wheat in October from her family farm in south-central Saskatchewan to a nearby elevator owned by Viterra, a multinational grain trader based in Calgary.Ms Nagel’s contract marks the first time in more than 70 years that a western Canadian farmer has sold wheat or barley to anyone other than the Canadian Wheat Board. “It was pure pleasure, and it was a very good price,” she said.Like Ms Nagel, farmers and businesses across the prairies are preparing for far-reaching changes at the start of the next crop season in August when the Wheat Board is due to lose its monopoly over wheat and barley exports. Farmers will then be able to sell their crops either to the board or to private traders.The Conservative government pushed through the enabling legislation late last year in the face of strenuous opposition from the CWB, which up to now has been the world’s biggest single wheat exporter. A group of dissident farmers, led by former board directors, have challenged the law in a Manitoba court.Besides giving farmers more choice, the new system opens up new opportunities for traders and processors. At present, the traders act only as agents for the CWB, so cannot reap the full benefits of their presence.Three companies – Viterra, Cargill and Winnipeg-based Richardson International – have a head start thanks to their extensive networks of silos and export terminals, which they rent to the CWB.But others, such as US-based Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Louis Dreyfus of France and London-listed Glencore, are expected to become increasingly active in the Canadian market. ADM, for instance, is already a big player in the unregulated canola market, and operates six wheat mills across the country.Alliance Grain, a Saskatchewan-based grains processor, said the ability to buy wheat directly from farmers has encouraged it to build a C$50m pasta and pulse-milling plant in Canada, rather than in the US or Australia.Murad al-Katib, Alliance’s chief executive, explained: “We have to be able to control the quality and the flow of our goods to provide a consistent branded food product. If we can’t control the input, we can’t control the output.”Farmers are not totally unfamiliar with a free-market system. Many already sell canola, lentils and other crops on the open market.Even so, Brad Vannan, president of ICE Futures Canada, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange, said: “The marketplace has gone 69 years without an open market and price discovery. I get the impression that farmers are actively educating themselves on what options and opportunities they have.”ICE recently launched futures contracts in milling wheat, durum and barley to help farmers gain greater transparency on market prices and manage their trading risks.“This way, a farmer can measure the results of his own decision-making against the decision-making of the board,” Mr Vannan said.Richardson International said that, in anticipation of the changes, it was “bolting on a few parts to our existing machine”. It has hired more sales staff and is seeking out potential customers, such as millers and pasta plants, in other parts of the world.“We’re trying to find out who those buyers may be and introduce ourselves to them,” the company said.Richardson takes the view that much of the competition for farmers’ business will be based not on price, which is set by the market, but on customer service. It recently extended its network of almost 80 grain storage and handling facilities by buying an operation in north-west Alberta.“We’ve spent a lot of time and a lot of dollars improving our grain handling network,” it added. “We think we can hold our own very well.”Many predict that the Wheat Board, like its former Australian counterpart, will eventually be taken over by one of the private traders.For the time being, the prospect of competition is forcing even the board to raise its game. It unveiled a raft of new sales tools for farmers two weeks ago, including futures contracts, a pooling mechanism to contain risk and marketing advice.Many farmers are expected to hedge their bets initially by splitting sales between the CWB and private grain traders.
223;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-01-31T15:08:33Z;High corn prices hurt Archer Daniels Midland;;Archer Daniels Midland, a leading merchant and processor of agricultural commodities, saw profits tumble after being hit by high corn prices, shifting global grain supplies and poor margins for processing oilseeds.Net income fell 89 per cent to $80m, or 12 cents a share, from $732m, or $1.14 per share, in the second quarter ended December 31 from the same period a year earlier.After adjustments for one-time factors including the shutdown of a bioplastics business, the company earned 51 cents per share, down 58 per cent on year.ADM is the latest agricultural trading house to report weak results. Profits at Cargill, the biggest agricultural trader, dropped 88 per cent in its most recent quarter, while Hong Kong-based Noble Group late last year reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years, leading to the departure of its chief executive.“It was a tough quarter,” said Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive. “The operating environment was challenging.”New York-listed ADM foreshadowed its difficulties earlier this month when it announced it was trimming 1,000 staff from its 30,000-person payroll. Cargill, based outside Minneapolis, is cutting 2,000 workers.ADM said its agricultural services business, which sources grain from major exporters such as the US, South America and the Black Sea and sells it to importers, including Asian countries, saw operating profits fall 63 per cent on what it called “on poor international merchandising results and lower US export volumes”.The return of Russia and Ukraine to global cereals markets after export bans ended last summer has unleashed a flood of new supplies to the global marketplace, making US grain less competitive.The business line that includes ADM’s ethanol refineries also suffered as the cost of corn, the main ethanol feedstock, remained relatively high. Operating profits fell by more than half to $133m, excluding the bioplastics closure.“We expect poor spot ethanol margins to continue,” said Juan Luciano, chief operating officer.While global demand for soyabeans is strong, analysts say abundant capacity for crushing them into edible oils has hurt processing margins. Operating profits at ADM’s oilseeds processing business declined 22 per cent.
224;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-01-26T21:41:18Z;Russian turnround hits US wheat prices;Wheat futures down 24% from a year ago;"From the state of Kansas, where he grows 2,000 acres of wheat, Jerry McReynolds watched with disappointment last year as the price of the grain kept falling. “It has dropped like a rock, unfortunately,” says the American farmer.The cause had little to do with the drought that has wiped out much of the 2011 winter wheat harvest in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Instead, Mr McReynolds’ bottom line was hit by a force thousands of miles to the east, where Russian wheat exports have poured through the Bosporus strait, depressing global prices.The world’s wheat supply has gone from grave to plentiful, illustrating how quickly agricultural markets can turn with the seasons. Stocks are forecast to top 200m tonnes by mid-2012, the highest in more than a decade.The price of wheat has eased, with CBOT soft winter wheat futures on Thursday selling for $6.53½ a bushel, down 24 per cent from a year ago. Plentiful wheat has also pressured corn prices as farmers feed it to animals, showing the perils of viewing commodity markets in isolation. Today a bushel of wheat is 19 cents more than corn; two years ago it carried a $1.30 premium.The main drivers of change are Russia and, to a lesser degree, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.In August 2010, Moscow imposed a year-long grain export ban as its worst drought in a century devastated crops. CBOT wheat rose to almost $9 a bushel, the highest since the commodity price spike of 2008, while countries such as Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat importer, sought alternative supplies.Russian wheat exports plummeted to 4m tonnes, from 18.6m, in the crop marketing year that ended last June. The US, the largest wheat exporter, saw foreign sales jump by almost half.But once the export ban was lifted last year, Russian farmers and international trading houses re-entered the market with alacrity. From July through December, Russia had exported 14.8m tonnes of wheat. Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness, has emphasised how the export rebound boosted trading results.“If we did not have a recovery in wheat in the [Commonwealth of Independent States], we would have been in a situation far, far different than the one we are in today. Luck hit,” says Abdolreza Abbassian, grain economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome. Wheat, along with rice, are the world’s primary staple grains.However, Russia’s wheat export boom may be set to slow. Russian officials last year suggested capping exports if grain shipments reach a record 23m-24m tonnes this year. Amy Reynolds, senior economist at the International Grains Council, a London-based intergovernmental group, says most people believe a new curb is unlikely to happen.“But if it does, there’s no shortage of wheat anywhere else,” she says.The US agricultural attaché in Moscow last week forecast a a “dramatic slowdown in exports” during the rest of the Russian marketing year, noting that exports from the three major southern growing regions “has largely finished”.More pressure on wheat prices could be on the way. In the southern hemisphere, Australia and Argentina both had good crops. Global wheat supplies are anticipated to reach a record 690m tonnes this year.In the US, the largest exporter, farmers added 3 per cent to land they planted with winter wheat, a crop to be harvested at midyear. In a strange twist, the drought in plains states such as Kansas may well lead to more winter wheat, after farmers ploughed under stunted corn fields and replaced them with wheat.“Of all the crops we grow, wheat requires the least amount of moisture,” says Mr McReynolds, a past president of the US National Association of Wheat Growers.Resurgent wheat supplies have also helped avert a dire situation for corn, a key input for animal feed and biofuels. Corn prices, while historically high, have dropped sharply from records near $8 a bushel reached last year as analysts disavow forecasts of critically low stocks.“Ample supplies of wheat and the strong unexpected recovery in supply have definitely weighed on corn prices, and to some extent diminished the tightness we were anticipating,” Mr Abbassian says.Wheat futures have gained 7 per cent in the past week as cold air settles over Russia and Ukraine, threatening to damage plantings that lack enough snow cover, forecasters Commodity Weather Group said in a note.But fears over the weather and export policy will need to become more than mere speculation if they are to keep the rally going amid large harvests.“We think that ultimately, prices get resolved to the downside,” says a longtime agricultural trader at a US hedge fund."
225;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;MF Global: Uncertain futures;The question is how can regulation now be tightened;"David Kasouf did not feel like celebrating over the festive season. The 32-year-old independent futures trader from Long Island is one of the 36,000 former customers of MF Global whose money is yet to be returned to them in full.Almost three months after the spectacular collapse of the broker-dealer, former customers such as Mr Kasouf, as well as farmers, grain transporters and small manufacturers, are still waiting to find out the whereabouts of $1.2bn in missing funds. Until regulators and investigators discover what happened, more than a quarter of the money once held in MF Global customer accounts will remain frozen.People such as Mr Kasouf increasingly feel they will never get their money back. As Christmas app­roached, with a wife and two children to support, he considered selling his house or declaring bankruptcy. Ultimately, the 72 per cent of his funds MF Global’s bankruptcy trustee has since returned prevented this, but his view of the markets has been shaken. “This has practically destroyed my trust in the whole system,” he says.Since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31 and revealed that customer money was missing, attention has been focused on Jon Corzine, the firm’s former chief executive. Once a Wall Street “master of the universe”, with a career including stints as head of Goldman Sachs, a US senator and governor of New Jersey, Mr Corzine is now one of the most reviled figures in finance.There has also been intense scrutiny of CME Group, America’s biggest futures exchange operator and the in­dustry body responsible for regulating MF Global’s commodities business. Some customers are angry at what they say was a lapse in oversight; others say a for-profit entity should not be regulating its own customers. CME responds that no watchdog can guarantee against fraud.But the MF Global scandal is more than just a question of tarnished reputations. It has had a profound effect on the entire financial industry. The realisation that customers could lose money kept in segregated accounts separate from the firm’s own money – thought by many to be as safe as a bank – has severely damaged confidence in the 163-year-old US futures market. Before the financial crisis, futures were among the fastest-growing of all exchange-traded products.“This is unprecedented. It’s the single biggest blow the industry has ever had to its business and credibility,” says a former senior CME executive. “It has forced us to ask the question: is the model of the futures industry so flawed that it can never be the same again?”Such soul-searching is rare for a business that in the past 30 years has transformed itself from an agricultural backwater. Futures markets – which enable producers such as manufacturers to fix for the longer term the prices at which they buy or sell rather than expose themselves to the risk of volatility on the daily spot markets – were once seen chiefly as a system of crop insurance for farmers. Today investors trade agreements to buy and sell in the future anything from oil to financial products.MF Global’s fall is a fresh embarrassment for an industry that has worked hard to disown a history of scandal, writes Gregory Meyer.Since the US futures markets were founded in the 19th century, many scandals have involved “corners” – buying up large quantities of a commodity to drive up the price. In 1888 Benjamin Hutchinson, known as Old Hutch, amassed wheat supplies and shipped them out of town in order to corner the Chicago futures market, according to a book on futures by Robert Kolb and James Overdahl. The resulting scarcity meant traders who had agreed to deliver the grain to him and other buyers at a lower price found it extremely costly if not impossible to honour their contracts. Some reportedly killed themselves in the face of financial ruin.In the 20th century’s most notorious corner, the Hunt brothers tried to gain control of the silver futures market in 1979-80, more than quintupling the price. This unleashed a flood of scrap silverware into the market – which, combined with the intervention of regulators, deflated the bubble.With the advent of financial futures in markets from interest rates to currencies, the industry has attracted a broader clientele, from Wall Street banks to pension funds. “It had much more of a Wild West feel, with many larger-than-life characters, prior to the 1980s,” says Professor Craig Pirrong of the University of Houston.Still, in 1985 the fall of the Volume Investors brokerage over a gold trade cost customers money. In 1998 the bankruptcy of Griffin Trading, a Chicago-based futures firm, caused big losses to traders in London, driving several out of business.“The futures industry has worked very hard for decades to overcome that stigma and image of itself,” says Emily Lambert, author of The Futures, a market history.The sector is proud to have made itself a central element of global financial institutions’ risk-management strategies. CME, once a member-owned trading club, is now one of the world’s most powerful exchange groups. The MF Global debacle threatens to undermine those achievements. The most obvious indication of the loss of trust in the industry is a fall in futures trading volumes since the collapse of MF Global, which was a dominant force in Chicago’s agricultural trading markets and the largest broker on the New York Mercantile Exchange, an energy-trading venue also owned by Chicago-based CME. Most ob­servers say the effect ofMF Global’s collapse is the primary explanation.The impact has reverberated across the industry. “Even brokers who didn’t necessarily have their accounts at MF Global are seeing incredible trepidation, especially from international market participants,” says Christine Cochran of the Commodity Markets Council, a Washington industry group whose members include big agricultural traders such as Archer Daniels Midland, food companies such as Kraft, hedge funds and futures brokers. “They will pull their money out every night …It remains to be seen if that trust can be repaired.”At groups such as Scoular, which handles grain at 58 silo complexes in North America, risk managers are rethinking how to insure against price fluctuations. “The industry felt using the commodity exchanges was a way to transfer risk without having to worry about counterparty risk [that trading partners would go bankrupt],” says Bob Ludington, Scoular’s chief operating officer. “When the MF Global situation happened, that really woke everybody up. They said: ‘Wait a minute, there is counterparty risk.’ Then the question is, who do you do business with?”Regulators have viewed futures as a model for reforming the vast markets in swaps – derivatives that are privately negotiated rather than traded on exchanges – such as the credit default swaps made infamous by the financial crisis. But the collapse of MF Global has prompted some grain merchants to move in the opposite direction. Scoular, for example, is buying from big banks more agricultural swaps, where physical delivery of the underlying commodity is not required. Unlike futures, these derivatives are not “cleared”, or protected against the risk of default by an exchange clearing house. “It’s basically taking bank counterparty risk as opposed to [futures broker] counterparty risk,” says Mr Ludington.…Before MF Global fell, CME often touted the fact that no customer had lost money as a result of a clearing member default. Futures brokers reiterated that claim, leading customers to leave plentiful money in their accounts to cover margin calls – increases in the deposit traders must leave at the exchange clearing house to indicate good faith in fulfilling their contracts. Indeed, futures brokers depend on this, making their profits by reinvesting excess capital and receiving interest on the investments.As it turns out, unlike bank deposits, futures trading accounts are uninsured by the federal government. And there is no industry body akin to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which has a reserve covering securities customers for up to $500,000, to help clients of failed futures brokers.In the wake of MF Global’s collapse, traders are scrutinising brokers more closely. However, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Washington futures watchdog, this week said 70 firms subject to an emergency spot check were compliant.“People are really evaluating, who am I doing business with?” says Scott Cordes, president of Country Hedging, a Minneapolis-based futures broker. The lack of trust, he adds, could prompt clients to take their chances in spot markets. “If we can’t restore the integrity back in the marketplace, long term I think you’ll have people taking on more risk than they should be. They might not be hedging.”Since the missing money was held in MF Global’s own accounts, CME is not legally obliged to make up the shortfall in customers’ funds. Had this happened before CME became a public company a decade ago, its members might well have clubbed together to bail out its traders. Now, its shareholders would be loath to do so.CME did offer a guarantee of $550m to encourage the bankruptcy trustee to release more frozen funds. That has not, however, stopped calls for CME to come up with all the money itself.Yet even if the money is found or replaced, it is far from clear confidence can be rebuilt without a change in oversight. “The damage has been done,” says John Lothian, who runs MarketsWiki, an industry website. “There are some structural issues that need to be addressed – bankruptcy, self-regulation – and they will be.”…The affair has already spurred changes. Last month the CFTC revived a rule limiting brokers’ investment options for customer cash. On January 11, as it passed new rules imposing stricter protection for big traders that use cleared swaps, it said it might consider similar safeguards for futures.Self-regulatory bodies including CME and the National Futures Association are working on possible rule changes for customer funds. The Futures Industry Association, which represents brokers, has set up a task force to suggest reforms.CME’s role as a designated self-regulatory body is under intensifying scrutiny. Barney Frank, the congressman who spearheaded the overhaul of financial regulation, has suggested stripping it of this function. “How did the government allow a for-profit company to have such major regulatory authority?” asks the head of one Chicago futures broker. “It would certainly appear that there’s a conflict of interest there.”CME demurs. “The self-regulatory model is really a misnomer for a complex system of organisations that work together to ensure effective regulation,” says Anita Liskey, a CME spokeswoman. “It is a proven system that has withstood the test of time. For over 75 years, customers have lost money due to a shortfall in their segregated accounts only once, and that was due to a firm’s actions in violations of law. That record compares very favourably to alternative approaches.”CME argues that because it guarantees trades, it has a vested interest in ensuring firms are fully compliant. It also says it has the expertise to do so and notes that self-regulation does not cost taxpayers. It employs 200 auditors and regulators, at an annual cost of $40m, to carry out its duties.Brokers, too, face further scrutiny. “CME, along with the industry, is ex­ploring additional protections for customer collateral held at the firm-level,” says Ms Liskey. “That is where the failure occurred, not at the clearing house, and that is where we and others in the industry believe we need to focus.”The debate has gone further, however, with some questioning the very structure that allows brokers to make profits. “The model has always been that you hold the customers’ cash, you invest it and keep the interest,” the former CME executive notes. “It’s the customers’ money – why shouldn’t they keep the interest?”Already, changes made by the CFTC threaten brokers’ business model. Limiting their investment options will cut a crucial source of revenue. Fees might be increased as a result, which could put off retail investors.Ultimately, a quick fix looks un­likely. “Trust has been completely shaken and it’ll be a long, slow, hard climb back,” says the futures broker’s head. “When farmers and small-town banks don’t trust us, we need to take a long look in the mirror.”"
226;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2012-01-20T22:42:40Z;Commodity merchant Gavilon looks at sale;;Gavilon, a commodity merchant backed by high-profile names on Wall Street, has hired bankers to explore a possible sale.The company has emerged as the largest fertiliser importer, one of the top three grain handlers and a major crude oil trader in the US since it was acquired by hedge funds Ospraie Management, Soros Fund Management and private equity firm General Atlantic in 2008.The owners now appear to be feeling out possible buyers, a move recently conveyed to employees, according to a person with knowledge of the company.“Gavilon has strengthened and firmly established its position as a leading global commodity company with a robust pipeline and growth opportunities,” a spokesman said. “The company has decided to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives that may further its growth and create additional value for our stakeholders.”Morgan Stanley has been hired to advise the Omaha, Nebraska, company on possible alternatives, the person close to the company said.Ospraie, Soros and General Atlantic paid $2.8bn for the former trading arm of ConAgra Foods at the height of the last commodity boom, renaming it for a variant of the Spanish for hawk. They have since grown aggressively, both through acquisitions such as DeBruce, a US grain handler, and investments. Gavilon recently completed construction of 4m barrels of crude oil storage tanks at Cushing, Oklahoma, the centre of the US oil market.The company remains smaller than rivals that dominate agricultural commodities.Gavilon’s revenues in the 12 months ended September 2011 totalled $15.6bn, according to Moody’s Investors Service. By contrast, Cargill reported $33.3bn in revenue in its most recent quarter.Agricultural traders generally have net incomes of between 1 and 2 per cent of revenues. By this rule of thumb, Gavilon’s annual profit would be in the range of $150m-$300m. The company declined to disclose financial details.Gavilon is likely to attract interest from European and Asian commodities trading houses, although industry executives who have looked at the grain trader in the past said that they had been put off by the high price expectations of its current owners.Glencore, the world’s largest trading house, could be a potential bidder as it has a relatively small agriculture division. Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore chief executive, has said in the past that he wants to expand in the US agribusiness sector.Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the Geneva-based privately owned house, and Olam International, the Singapore-listed company, could also be bidders, industry executives said. Louis Dreyfus and Olam held merger conversations last year. Wilmar, the Singapore-listed trader, could also be a bidder as the company seeks to diversify from its palm oil focus into sugar and other grains.The Japanese trading houses, or sogo shosha, have recently embarked on a buying spree and some, such as Marubeni, already have large interests in agricultural commodities. Tokyo has urged the five sogo shosha – Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni – to use the current strong exchange rate of the yen to secure natural resources.The sale of Gavilon would, in any case, further consolidate the agricultural commodities industry, which is dominated by the so-called “ABCD” companies, for the initials of Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Dreyfus.
227;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Archer Daniels Midland to cut 1,000 jobs;;Archer Daniels Midland is to cut its global workforce by 3 per cent, becoming the second major agribusiness in two months to reduce headcount in response to profit pressures.The first broad global reduction in the company’s history will eliminate the jobs of about 1,000 of its 30,000 employees in an effort to shave annual pre-tax expenses by more than $100m, ADM said on Wednesday.ADM follows larger agribusiness rival Cargill in making headcount reductions as volatile agricultural commodity markets increase the risks and costs of trading.Cargill, which on Tuesday announced its lowest quarterly profit in a decade, is in the process of cutting its workforce by 2,000 people, or 1.5 per cent.ADM’s move comes as the prices of commodities such as corn and soyabeans are near historical highs and global demand for food grains and animal feed is growing. It also runs counter to the declining trend in US unemployment.But the company, among the so-called ABCD of top agricultural traders that also includes Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, faces new competitors in Asia as well as shifting market dynamics as countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Ukraine challenge the US’s long-held dominance in grain exports.“This is about the increasingly competitive global operating environment,” an ADM spokesman said. “Having an efficient organisation is vital to long-term success in a commodity business, where we compete on cost.”ADM’s shares have declined 10 per cent in the past year even as corn futures have gained 7 per cent. High commodity prices do not necessarily bring windfalls for agribusinesses, which make money on the price arbitrage between two places of delivery or from processing commodities such as corn into products like ethanol or animal feed.ADM’s operating profit margin in the 12 months ended September 30 was 3.4 per cent, according to Capital IQ. Its most recent quarterly profits disappointed analysts. Results for the second quarter, which ended in December, are scheduled for release January 31.“These actions will help us enhance our productivity and earnings power,” Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive, said.The company plans to first offer voluntary early retirement to older US workers, then proceed with redundancies to achieve its goal.The company expects to record a pre-tax charge of $50m-$75m related to the reductions in the current quarter and begin to see benefits by midyear. ADM’s selling, general and administrative expenses totalled $1.6bn in its last fiscal year, up 1.6 per cent from the prior year.ADM shares rose 0.7 per cent to $28.97 after the announcement.
228;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-12-07T22:43:19Z;Canada court overrules wheat board plan;;"A Canadian court has ruled that the Conservative government acted illegally in moving to abolish the Canadian Wheat Board’s 76-year monopoly on wheat and barley exports.However, Gerry Ritz, agriculture minister, said the government was determined to press ahead with its plan to repeal the existing Wheat Board Act by the end of the year and that the wishes of parliament would override Wednesday’s court judgment.“At the end of the day, every farmer will have the right to choose how they market their grain,” Mr Ritz said. The government will also appeal the judgment.Under the proposed law, prairie farmers will have the right to market their own grain from next season, starting in August 2012.The legislation would open up a multibillion opportunity for private-sector commodity traders, such as Cargill, Bunge, Archer Daniels Midland and Viterra. The board, with sales of C$5.1bn (US$5bn) last year, is the world’s biggest single grain exporter.According to the court, the government failed to adequately consult farmers, as required under the existing law.Justice Douglas Campbell said that ""had a meaningful consultative process been engaged to find a solution which meets the concerns of the majority, the present legal action might not have been necessary"".He added that the government should be “held accountable for [its] disregard for the rule of law”.The board has fought the government’s plans tooth and nail. It organised a plebiscite during the summer in which almost two-thirds of wheat farmers and 51 per cent of barley producers voted to retain the board’s monopoly.Allen Oberg, the board’s chairman, said on Wednesday that ""the minister now needs to do the right thing, obey the law and hold a vote – as he should have done from the beginning.""The government contends that the end of the board’s monopoly will attract investment, encourage innovation and create jobs. It has taken the view that farmers gave it a mandate to abolish the single-desk system by overwhelmingly supporting the Conservatives in a general election last May.The board maintains that its negotiating clout provides farmers with prices and freight rates that private traders cannot match, especially in tough times. It also provides Canada’s biggest non-government weather service and offers low borrowing rates to farmers thanks to government guarantees.Under the new legislation, the board would continue to function as a voluntary pool. Many observers expect that it would eventually be acquired by one of the multinational trading companies, as happened with the Australian Wheat Board."

231;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-11-07T23:57:51Z;Aftershocks of MF Global bankruptcy continue;;Aftershocks from the MF Global bankruptcy spread on Monday, reaching a level that prompted a leading broker to ask the US government to delay crop reports because of the upheaval.Many problems involved shifting accounts of former MF Global traders to other clearing firms. As these accounts appeared on the books of new brokers, owners were hit with demands for extra margin deposits to maintain positions. RJ O’Brien, the Chicago futures broker that took over some accounts, told new arrivals to wire more money or liquidate.“There are people blown out of positions there’s no reason to blow out of,” said Tres Knippa, a broker and commodity trading adviser on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor.Adding to the short-term cash crunch, exchange operator CME Group directed brokers to delay distribution of customers’ funds until late Tuesday as it verifies that each one receives the right amount.Any impact on futures prices has been minimal since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities benchmark, on Monday rose a quarter of 1 per cent.However, RJ O’Brien warned of volatility ahead as it petitioned the US Department of Agriculture to postpone the release of two closely followed crop reports from Wednesday to next Monday. The broker said a delay would “mitigate the aftershocks of MFG’s bankruptcy to thousands of innocent market participants”.The USDA rebuffed its entreaty.Managers of the 12 clearing firms that took over 17,000 US accounts from the failed broker-dealer, which also include Rosenthal Collins, Dorman Trading and ADM Investor Services, a division of agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland, were scrambling to assess accounts transferred in bulk last week. MF Global was known for its retail customer base.A shortfall in customer funds at MF Global meant accounts were transferred with only 60 per cent of the margin required to back positions. CME and IntercontinentalExchange, the exchange and clearing house operators, eased the cost of margin calls by temporarily relaxing rules on deposits.Among the worst-hit traders were firms that invest client money in futures markets. These “managed futures” firms often apply one trading strategy to dozens of individual accounts. As account holders who had MF Global as a broker were forced out of the market, their losses influenced managed futures firms’ performance records.“The fallout has been pretty bad for money managers,” said Chad Butler, president of Clarke Capital Management, which oversees $150m in more than 200 managed futures accounts, 120 of them formerly with MF Global.US authorities and MF’s bankruptcy trustee are investigating the disappearance of some $600m in futures customer funds that disappeared in the days leading up to MF’s bankruptcy last week.“MF has gone a long way to destroy faith and trust in the good firms out there. The question on everyone’s mind is, how safe are they really?” Mr Butler said.
232;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-11-01T21:00:13Z;ADM: a cornucopia of demand;This area of the agriculture world deserves more attention;“Crushing margins” usually isn’t a phrase shareholders want to hear during a company’s results call. They are all in a quarter’s work for Archer Daniels Midland though, which processes and transports agricultural commodities in 75 countries.Parts of its business were not so much crushed as squeezed by the doubling in corn prices that began last summer. Prices for products such as starches and sweeteners rose too, but hedging contracts that helped tame surging input costs earlier this year did not contribute to the bottom line this quarter. Operating income for corn processing fell by nearly half, while oilseed processing fell close to a third on weak crushing margins.Transient weakness aside though, it is good to be ADM these days. Demand for grain and oilseeds keeps marching ahead with the dual demographic waves of more mouths to feed and more people in the developing world attaining the wealth for western levels of protein consumption. Even ADM’s large corn ethanol business, facing the loss of US subsidies, may hardly miss a beat next year as margins and federally mandated demand, augmented by exports to Brazil, keep mills humming.Just as the people who most reliably make money in a gold rush are purveyors of picks and shovels, it is the operators of barges, depots and processing plants who can be counted on to do well in an agricultural boom. Investors have been far keener on farmland or providers of seed and fertiliser such as Monsanto and PotashCorp, who help squeeze more out of each acre, than processors and transporters of crops such as ADM or Bunge. Prices may or may not keep rising, but demand surely will. Notwithstanding the occasional crushed margin, this duller part of the agriculture world deserves more attention.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
233;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
234;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-11-01T19:15:44Z;ADM boosted by return of Black Sea grain;;The Black Sea region’s return to global grain markets offset disappointing results at Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s biggest traders of food commodities.The Illinois-based company’s large agricultural services segment, which buys and sells bulk goods such as soyabeans, corn and wheat in international markets, increased operating profit by 85 per cent to $244m in its first quarter ended September 30, the company reported Tuesday. The gains came after Ukraine and Russia lifted grain export bans that tripped up ADM a year ago.The trading profits contrast with rivals, such as New York-listed Bunge and privately held Cargill, which blamed recent weak results on volatile market conditions that limited trading opportunities and made risk management a challenge.Pat Woertz, ADM chief executive, also identified a tough environment but the company was weighed down by shrinking profit margins at its processing businesses, not trading.“Always markets can be volatile. But I think we did OK considering these challenging conditions,” she said.Net profit of $460m, or 68 cents a share, was up from the same quarter a year ago but flattered by one-time accounting factors. On an adjusted basis, ADM generated net profit of 58 cents per share, 13 per cent lower than 67 cents per share in adjusted profit a year earlier.Shares fell 3.8 per cent to $27.85 midday in New York, outpacing broad market declines.Operating profit at ADM’s oilseeds processing segment, which crushes soyabeans into vegetable oil and animal feed, fell 28 per cent to $221m. At the corn processing segment, which makes sweeteners and fuel ethanol, operating profit fell by nearly half to $179m during a quarter in which corn peaked at a record of almost $8 a bushel, increasing input costs.In agricultural services, a strong recovery in exports from the Black Sea buoyed profits. A year ago, ADM had been wrongfooted by the export bans imposed in response to the worst drought in a century. The US Department of Agriculture projects Russian wheat exports will more than quadruple in the current crop marketing year.“We had a very difficult year last year in that they put export restrictions on,” Craig Huss, chief risk officer, told analysts. “This year we had very good crops …and there were a lot of trading opportunities.” ADM was selling grain from eastern Europe to Egypt, traditionally the world’s largest wheat importer, and “even in Asia”, Mr Huss said.ADM is the is the “A” of the “ABCD” group of trading houses, which include Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities, that dominate global agricultural commodities markets.Singapore-listed Wilmar, in which ADM has a 16.4 per cent stake, Olam and Noble Group are also big traders of agricultural commodities, as well as London-listed Glencore.
235;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-10-27T12:08:03Z;Bunge blames 33% profit decrease on volatility;;Bunge, one of the world’s largest traders of agricultural commodities, blamed volatile markets for a sharp drop in profitability in the quarter to the end of September.The New York-listed trading house said it earned $140m in the third quarter of the year, down about 33 per cent from $212m in the same period of 2010. Earnings per share dropped to 89 cents in the quarter, down from $1.36 between July and August 2010 and sharply below analysts’ expectations of $1.58 for the quarter.“The third quarter was a particularly volatile period,” Alberto Weisser, Bunge chief executive, said in a statement, adding that managing risk “proved to be challenging”. Bunge also suffered from lower sugarcane production in Brazil as bad weather in the world’s biggest sugar exporter affected output during the quarter.The company, however, painted a more positive outlook for the fourth quarter of the year and into 2012, saying that inventories of agricultural commodities were relatively tight. “Even with a scenario of lower economic growth, the world needs additional supplies of crops, so prices should remain at attractive levels,” Mr Weisser said.“We also forecast a much stronger performance in our sugar and bioenergy segment in 2012,” he added. “We are also on track to have 50,000 hectares of newly planted sugarcane ready for the next harvest, which will provide needed raw material for our mills.”The company announced earlier this year it planned to invest $2.5bn in Brazil to boost its sugar and biofuels business.The drop in Bunge’s profitability comes only weeks after Cargill, the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, reported a hefty 66 per cent drop in net income in the first quarter. The Minnesota-based company blamed rapid money flows in commodity markets and deep uncertainty over the global economy.Bunge share prices are down 8.8 per cent in the year to date, trading on Wednesday at $59.58 a shares. The share price peaked in April at a 2½-year high of $76.01.The company said that revenues rose in the quarter to $15.6bn, up from $11.6bn in the same period of last year. Earnings before interests and taxes, or ebit, dropped to $191m in the third quarter, down from $340m in the same period of 2010.Bunge is the “B” of the “ABCD” group of trading houses which include also ADM, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities and dominate global agricultural commodities markets.Singapore-listed Wilmar, Olam and Noble Group are also big traders of agricultural commodities, as well as London-listed Glencore.
236;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-10-19T15:35:39Z;Race on to launch Canadian cereals derivatives;;The end of the Canadian Wheat Board’s monopoly has triggered a race to develop futures contracts for the country’s farmers between the Winnipeg-based ICE Futures Canada and the US-based Minneapolis Grain Exchange.The battle between the two small commodities exchanges is the latest sign of how the end of the CWB’s monopoly next year would revolutionise the agribusiness sector in the world’s fourth biggest wheat and fourth-largest barley exporter.The CWB has enjoyed a monopoly to trade wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada since 1942. But the ruling Conservatives introduced legislation on Tuesday to end it by August 2012, although the CWB is fighting against the move.ICE Futures Canada on Wednesday said it would launch milling wheat, durum wheat – used mostly for pasta – and barley futures contracts if the monopoly ends as expected.The exchange, owned by Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange since 2007 and formerly known as the Winnipeg Commodities Exchange, said it planned to list the new contracts for delivery in October 2012.ICE will compete against the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, which in August said it would allow the delivery of Canadian wheat against its 128-year-old US spring wheat contract from mid-2013.The MGEX has until now banned the delivery of non-US wheat against the contract, a benchmark for bread bakers.The new ICE contract will be denominated in Canadian dollars, creating an advantage against the MGEX’s contract which is denominated in US dollars.But the MGEX could still attract business from Canada on the back of the liquidity of its well-established contract, which is widely used by traders in the US midwest.Industry executives and analysts said that the end of the CWB’s monopoly would pave the way for big traders such as US-based Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Geneva-based Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Glencore to buy cereals directly from Canadian farmers, boosting the need for hedging.But Dan Basse, of consultants AgResource in Chicago, warned that the farmers would need time before they felt comfortable about using futures contracts for hedging.“It is going to be a learning curve for them,” he said, warning that in Australia, where the government dismantled a few years a similar wheat board, futures trading has not picked up.Brad Vannan, president of ICE Futures Canada, said, nonetheless, that market participants had expressed substantial demand for global benchmark futures contracts designed specifically for Canada.“These contracts recognise Canada’s central role in the global agricultural market place and they serve an essential role in providing transparent price discovery and risk management tools,” he said.The battle for CWB echoes the fight when Australia dismantled the country’s grain monopoly, the Australian Wheat Board, in 2008, which has reshaped the country’s agribusiness industry.Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader, bought AWB, and rivals such as Viterra, GrainCorp, Glencore, Nidera, Toepfer and Bunge entered the market, although wheat futures traded in Australian exchanges have not seen a meaningful pick-up in activity.
237;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-10-17T21:09:15Z;Canada to rule on abolishing Wheat Board monopoly;Government aims to pass the law by the end of the year;Canada’s Conservative government will table legislation on Tuesday to abolish the Canadian Wheat Board’s 76-year monopoly on grain exports, paving the way for competition from private-sector commodity traders.Announcing the move to a group of Alberta farmers, Gerry Ritz, agriculture minister, said on Monday that the government aimed to pass the law by the end of the year. The board, with sales of C$5.1bn last year, is the world’s biggest wheat and barley exporter.The end of the board’s monopoly will enable private-sector traders to deal directly with farmers. At present, the private companies act only as agents for the board, providing shipping and handling facilities and other infrastructure.The biggest players are currently Cargill, Viterra, and Winnipeg-based Richardson International. But others, such as Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, are also gearing up for the new era of competition.The new law is aimed at “getting the government out of the way so that farmers can do what they do best”, Mr Ritz said. Referring to recent experience in Australia and the Canadian province of Ontario, he predicted that the new regime would attract investment, encourage innovation and create jobs.While details of the legislation were not immediately available, the government has previously said the board’s “single desk” marketing system would come to an end next August.The CWB has fought a vigorous rearguard action against the government’s plans, maintaining that its negotiating clout provides farmers with prices and freight rates that private traders cannot match, especially in tough times.The board also provides Canada’s biggest non-government weather service and offers low borrowing rates to farmers thanks to government guarantees.Almost two-thirds of wheat farmers and 51 per cent of barley producers voted to retain the board’s monopoly in a plebiscite organised by the board during the summer.However, Mr Ritz pointed to the strong mandate that the Conservatives received from farmers in last May’s general election, turning their five year-old minority government into a majority. The wheat board reforms were a prominent part of the Tories’ campaign platform. “We made a handshake with farmers to proceed”, he said.The reformers have said that the wheat board can continue to operate in a more competitive environment, probably in the form of a co-operative.But the board and its supporters have warned that it is likely to be swallowed up by one of the private-sector traders, as happened in Australia, because it has no grain-handling infrastructure of its own, and no capital base for borrowing or financing operations.
238;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-10-10T15:03:21Z;Cargill profits fall 66% on global turmoil;;Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trader, blamed rapid money flows in commodity markets and deep uncertainty over the global economy as it reported a 66 per cent decline in net profit.The Minnesota-based company, with businesses from corn syrup to financial derivatives, said it earned $236m in the first quarter to August 31, down from $693m a year ago. Year-ago results excluded profit contributions from Mosaic, the fertiliser maker from which Cargill spun off its stake in May.Revenue rose 34 per cent to $34.6bn from the same quarter last year, meaning privately held Cargill’s profit margins shrank. With commodities such as corn and oil steered as much by macroeconomic headlines as supply and demand, the company chose to risk less capital in trading strategies, a spokeswoman said.The results could intensify investors’ focus on listed agricultural traders such as Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland, which report results October 27 and November 1 respectively. Cargill’s performance would also worry investors in Glencore, the world’s largest commodities house, which trades crops such as wheat and corn. The most recent fiscal year, which ended in May, was Cargill’s best ever with $4.24bn in earnings, including Mosaic’s contribution.“It was a tough quarter. With results down from recent levels, we’re focused on regaining our earnings momentum,” said Gregory Page, Cargill chief executive.Cargill attributed the poor earnings to the sweeping macroeconomic tides that have also wrongfooted stock pickers and hedge fund managers over the past few months. “Cargill has such an advantage in trading because they are involved in the physical markets. Even with that advantage, these results highlight the challenge of managing through these volatile markets,” said David Nelson, global strategist at Rabobank.The company, with operations in 63 countries, said the macroeconomic uncertainty “limited prudent trading opportunities”. It added: “The prevailing ‘risk-on, risk-off’ dynamic in financial markets also caused capital to move in and out of commodities rapidly, which reinforced taking a disciplined approach to risk-taking.”Four of Cargill’s five business segments reported lower performance, including the sprawling origination and processing segment that buys, sells and processes bulk agricultural commodities such as grains, cotton and sugar.Cargill’s risk management and financial segment, which includes hedge fund group Black River Asset Management, suffered from “stress in financial markets caused by growing economic, fiscal and political concerns on both sides of the Atlantic,” Cargill said.
239;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Noble shares jump on spin-off prospect;;Noble Group, the Asia-based commodities trading house, is considering spinning off its agricultural businesses through an initial public offering in Singapore that could raise as much as $5bn.Investors responded to Noble’s disclosure on Wednesday by pushing the Hong Kong-based company’s shares up 5.8 per cent to S$1.275 on the Singapore Exchange. The benchmark Straits Times index fell 0.1 per cent.Noble said it had not made a final decision on the proposed listing, which is unlikely to go ahead until the current global market volatility has eased. But executives have held extensive discussions with bankers about a listing following a collapse in Noble’s shares, which have fallen by nearly half from S$2.3054 in January to S$1.25 at the close on Tuesday as investors shy away from commodities.The move to spin-off the agricultural business comes at a period of change among the world’s largest trading houses as they expand from their traditional business as middleman – which involves large volumes but razor-thin profits – to storage and production, which are more profitable.But relying on their own cash flow or debt markets limits their ability to expand, industry executives and bankers say, so trading houses are looking for other ways to raise funds to continue expanding.Glencore, the world’s top commodities trader, raised $10bn earlier this year in an IPO in London and Hong Kong, while Swiss-based Trafigura has said it is planning to list one subsidiary worth $3.5bn.Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader, last year sold a 50 per cent stake in its petroleum terminals and storage business to a subsidiary of Malaysia’s national oil company Petronas for $735m in cash.Analysts have applauded Noble’s efforts to transform its business from trading to running an integrated supply chain including producing, processing and transporting energy and agricultural commodities.Some analysts said spinning off the agricultural assets would benefit shareholders because such businesses typically trade at a higher multiple than the group’s industrial commodity businesses, which include iron ore and aluminium. Tanuj Shori, commodities analyst at Nomura, said Noble’s agricultural businesses were worth between $3.3bn and $5bn at current valuations.But other analysts and industry observers questioned whether Noble Group could raise as much money as it hopes with a spin-off, noting that the share prices of trading houses focusing on agricultural commodities, including New York-listed Bunge and ADM, and Singapore-listed Wilmar and Olam, have also suffered from investors’ lack of appetite for the natural resources sector.Noble Group’s share price has fallen 34.6 per cent over the past 12 months. In the same period the share price of Olam has fallen a similar 30.8 per cent, while Wilmar has dropped 24.7 per cent.Critics added that the spin-off could lower the trading multiple of the original company as investors could treat it largely as a mining or oil company, rather than as a trading house.Noble’s agricultural businesses include sugar cane mills in Brazil, soyabean crushing plants in Brazil, China and Argentina, and smaller cotton, coffee and grain businesses. Combined, they account for a little under a third of the trading house’s operating revenues. The trader reported record net profits of $606m in the year to December and said it was on target to double net profits to $1bn by 2013.Ricardo Leiman, Noble’s chief executive, said in February that the group was “positive” about the current year and was “not concerned about short-term fluctuations”.
240;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-09-12T18:51:54Z;Canada to press ahead with wheat reform;;Canada’s Conservative government has vowed to press ahead with plans to dismantle the Canadian Wheat Board’s monopoly on grain exports, despite a vote by prairie farmers to preserve the 76 year-old system.Almost two-thirds of wheat farmers and 51 per cent of barley producers voted to retain the board’s monopoly in a plebiscite organised by the board as a rearguard action against the government’s plans. The results were announced on Monday.Gerry Ritz, agriculture minister, responded that “regardless of the plebiscite results, every farmer will have the right to choose how they market their grain just like farmers in the rest of Canada and around the world”.The board, with sales of C$5.1bn last year, is the world’s biggest wheat and barley exporter. Liberalised trade would create a significant opportunity for private-sector commodity traders, such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Viterra.The Conservatives, fresh from an election in May that turned their five year-old minority government into a majority, plan to introduce legislation this autumn ending the “single desk” system on August 1 2012.Allen Oberg, the board’s chairman, said that “we will fight to have this democratic decision respected and honoured …We'll put on as much political pressure as possible.”Mr Oberg said the results showed that farmers did not want to be at the mercy of “giant corporations and foreign interests”.The board maintains that its negotiating clout provides farmers with prices and freight rates that private traders cannot match, especially in tough times. The board also provides Canada’s biggest non-government weather service and offers low borrowing rates to farmers thanks to government guarantees.On the other hand, proponents of liberalisation have argued that opening up the market would give farmers more flexibility in marketing their crops, for example, by developing direct relationships with end-users or to carve out niche markets.Cargill, Viterra, and Winnipeg-based Richardson International are the biggest private-sector players in the Canadian grain trade. But they act only as agents for the board, so cannot reap the full profits of their presence. They have built a large network of infrastructure, including silos and export terminals, which they rent to the board, giving them an advantage over other private-sector players.Canada’s agriculture minister said: “We know that an open market will attract investment, encourage innovation and create value-added jobs …Every farmer will have the ability to choose how to market their grain, whether it’s individually or through a voluntary pooling entity.”MNP, the accountancy that conducted the plebiscite, said that 56 per cent of the 68,000 farmers entitled to vote had cast their ballots.
241;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-29T20:31:43Z;Archer Daniels Midland in US fines alert;;Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest agricultural traders, said it could be subject to criminal fines over possible violations of a US law prohibiting bribes to foreign officials.The first public disclosure comes 15 years after the company pleaded guilty to charges it fixed lysine and citric acid prices, paying a then-record $100m antitrust fine.In an annual report filed with regulators last week, ADM said it had hired outside lawyers to review transactions, mainly in grain and feed exports, that may have broken laws including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.The New York-listed company first informed authorities including the US Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2009 that it was reviewing the transactions and its anti-corruption compliance programme, the filing said.“In connection with this review, government agencies could impose civil penalties or criminal fines,” or order profits from any contracts involving inappropriate payments to be disgorged, the report said. The matter will not materially impact the company’s finances, ADM said. A spokesman declined to elaborate.The company, alone and through joint ventures, buys, ships and sells agricultural commodities in more than 75 countries and is a top trader of corn, wheat, soyabeans and cocoa.“Anybody involved in global trading can be subject to requests of things that are not acceptable common practices in the United States,” said David Nelson, global strategist at Rabobank.The low-profile company gained notoriety after the price-fixing scandal of the 1990s, which in addition to the fine, resulted in prison terms for three former executives. In 2004 ADM paid $400m to settle a class-action lawsuit over sales of high-fructose corn syrup.ADM has made a point of broadcasting an ethical corporate culture since the affair. When Hollywood director Steven Soderbergh was filming The Informant, a 2009 film about the scandal, his team was allowed on company property.“Throughout ADM, we are committed to achieving the right results, the right way,” the company said on its website.US prosecutors have been pursuing foreign bribery cases against companies across numerous industries, collecting billions of dollars in fines and forcing some companies to admit wrongdoing.Last autumn six oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines in a freight-forwarding probe for allegedly bribing customs officials to ease the entry of their rigs and other supplies into Nigeria and other North African countries.
242;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-24T08:48:14Z;Food giants clash over access to China;;A legal battle between two of the world’s most powerful agribusiness companies is shedding light about the growing role of China in agricultural commodities markets.Syngenta, the Switzerland-based agrochemicals producer, is suing New York-listed Bunge, one of the world’s largest food traders, for refusing to accept a type of its biotech corn. Bunge – the “B” of the “ABCD” group of companies that includes ADM, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus and control agriculture trading – refuses to buy from farmers growing Syngenta’s new Agrisure Viptera corn because it has not been approved for sale in China.Syngenta said the action was illegal and that its new corn is approved for sale into “major” export destinations, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Korea and Taiwan. But, it acknowledged, not in China.The lack of approval for sale into China would not have been a problem only a couple of years ago, as Beijing was self-sufficient in corn. But China has recently become a big importer. And Bunge said on Tuesday it was expecting that imports would “grow significantly this year”, one of the strongest statements yet from a trading house about the issue.The US Department of Agriculture estimates that China imported 1.5m tonnes of corn in the 2010-11 season, which is about to end, the highest since 1994-95. For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, China’s corn imports were negligible, at just a few tonnes. For 2011-12, the USDA forecasts imports of 2m tonnes. But private sector analysts are far more bullish, predicting imports anywhere between 5m-10m tonnes, the biggest ever.The legal battle between Syngenta and Bunge reveals that the trading house believes that imports from China would grow much more than the level suggested by the USDA. It also confirms an open secret in the industry: all the ABCD companies are battling to establish themselves as Beijing’s favourite party to carry the corn deals. Until now, Louis Dreyfus of France has been a leading seller, but Cargill and Bunge are battling to keep pace.The growing Chinese appetite for corn is helping to tighten the market, already suffering from disappointing crops due to bad weather and rampant consumption from the US-based ethanol industry. More imports, as suggested by the Bunge-Syngenta lawsuit, could further tighten the market, pushing corn prices even higher.The commodity hit an all-time high of nearly $8 per bushel in June. CBOT December corn futures, the benchmark for the forthcoming new crop, are already at $7.45 a bushel. Brace for higher prices.
243;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-16T16:03:59Z;Traders hope for Canadian wheat deregulation;;The world’s top agricultural commodities traders are salivating at the prospect of the lucrative Canadian grain market – one of the largest globally – opening to private sector competition for the first time since the second world war.The battle over the future of the Canadian Wheat Board could pave the way for companies such as US-based Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Louis Dreyfus of France and Glencore to buy cereals directly from Canadian farmers just as demand and prices for agricultural commodities rise sharply.The CWB, with sales of $5.1bn last year, has enjoyed a monopoly to market wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada since 1942. But the ruling Conservatives, fresh from an election in May that turned their five year-old minority government into a majority, has vowed to introduce legislation this autumn ending the monopoly by August 2012. The CWB is battling the move vigorously.“We’re at a watershed point for some fundamental changes in our grain marketing system”, says Richard Wansbutter, a vice-president at Calgary-based Viterra, one of the private companies that stands to gain from an end to the board’s monopoly.With sales of 15.5m tonnes of wheat and 5.5m tonnes of other cereals last year, the CWB is the world’s biggest trader of wheat. Such is its size, that its wheat sales are larger than the shipments of some of the world’s top-five wheat exporting countries, including Australia and Argentina. Thus the interest of the private sector.The battle for CWB echoes the fight when Australia dismantled the country’s grain monopoly, the Australian Wheat Board, in 2008. Over the next three years, the decision reshaped the country’s agribusiness industry. Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader, bought AWB and rivals such as Viterra, GrainCorp, Glencore, Nidera, Toepfer and Bunge arrived.Industry executives expect that if Ottawa ends the monopoly, the CWB will end up as a subsidiary of one of the large trading houses. They also say Canada will see a similar influx of international grain traders.Alberto Weisser, chief executive of Bunge, told analysts last month that it “would be very natural” that the trading house will add business in Canada if the CWB’s monopoly ends. However, he cautioned Bunge is still on a “wait-and-see” posture.Viterra, Cargill and Winnipeg-based, privately owned Richardson International are currently the biggest private-sector players in the country. But they act only as agents for the CWB, so cannot reap the full profits of their presence. Yet, they have built a large network of infrastructure, including silos and export terminals, that they rent to CWB and, thus, have a competitive advantage to others.The CWB and its supporters have launched a last-ditch effort to stop the government. The Canadian Wheat Board Act requires farmers to be consulted before any change and the CWB has mailed ballots to 68,000 farmers across the prairies asking whether they want to maintain CWB, or to sell through commercial traders.The results are due on September 9, and although the vote could give Canadian farmers the moral high ground, lawmakers can still bypass it.The board maintains that its negotiating clout provides farmers with prices and freight rates that private traders cannot match, especially in tough times.The board is trying especially hard to squelch the message propagated by reformers that farmers can have the best of both worlds: a co-operative system pooling wheat for smaller farmers, co-existing with a free market controlled by the large international trading houses.Allen Oberg, the board’s chairman, says he is “concerned” that some producers believe they can have both systems, noting that the CWB has no grain handling infrastructure of its own, and no capital base for borrowing or financing operations. Its debt is guaranteed by the government.But the government so far shows no sign of backing away, no matter which way the vote goes. Its supporters note that the Conservatives gained an unambiguous mandate by winning almost every rural seat in western Canada in May’s election.
244;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-11T18:29:30Z;Food commodities prices surge;;Food commodities prices surged after the US government slashed its forecast for the country’s crops due to the impact of a heatwave and drought.The US Department of Agriculture painted a bullish picture in particular for corn prices, saying: “Unusually high temperatures and below average precipitation during July across much of the Corn Belt sharply reduced yield prospects.”The buoyant outlook for food commodities prices bodes well for the agribusiness sector. The share prices of tractor manufacturer Deere & Co, traders Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge and fertiliser producers such as Potash Corp rose sharply on Thursday after the report.But it could reduce central banks’ room for manoeuvre as higher corn prices rapidly translate into more expensive beef, lamb, pork and poultry and, thus, higher food inflation. China, India and other developing countries have raised interest rates this year in part due to rising food inflation.The US is the world’s top exporter of food commodities, accounting for half the world’s corn, a third of the world’s soyabeans and a up to a fifth of the world’s wheat. As such, USDA forecasts have a big impact on global prices.“We are going to see higher corn prices for an extended period,” said Dan Basse, of consultants AgResource in Chicago, echoing a widely held view.The USDA said farms would yield 153 bushels per acre, down from a previous estimate of 158.7 bushels, sharply reducing the size of the crop. Although it also lowered its estimate for consumption due to the impact of higher prices, it said the key stocks-to-use ratio would drop next year to a near record low of 5.4 per cent. The USDA also cut its forecast for wheat and soyabean production and stocks.In early trading in Chicago, CBOT December corn, the benchmark contract for the new crop, hit the 30-cents daily limit to reach a session high of $7.18½ per bushel. It later pared gains, trading up 3.7 per cent to $7.14 per bushel.Corn prices hit an all-time high of $7.99¾ per bushel in early June. Since then, prices have declined as traders bet on a large harvest later this year. Corn is sown in the US in April-June and harvested in September-December.Analysts warned that corn prices were likely to rise further as the US Corn Belt continues facing higher temperatures, particularly at night. Mr Basse said that corn yields could fall to a low of 149 bushels per acre. Illinois, the largest corn-producing state, and much of the rest of the Corn Belt suffered their warmest July since 1955, with temperatures hitting levels historically associated with a 30 per cent yield drop.Hussein Allidina, head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley in New York, said corn “prices will need to move higher” to ration demand. In the US, the ethanol industry is the largest consumer of corn, followed by livestock producers.However, Chris Gadd, grain analyst at Macquarie in London, said that plentiful wheat supplies, which compete with corn as a feed commodity, would cap any rally. Russia, which last year suffered a heatwave and drought that devastated its grain crop, has returned to the market after a large harvest, providing cheap wheat.
245;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-09T18:06:57Z;Record earnings from Cargill on back of crop disruptions;;Cargill reported its best year on Tuesday, as its profits breached $4bn on the back of disruptions to global food supplies.The world’s biggest agricultural trader said its net profit rose to $4.24bn in the year to May, compared with a previous record of $3.95bn in 2007-08, and an increase of 63 per cent compared with the $2.6bn earned last year.The Minnesota-based company is controlled by 80 members of the Cargill and MacMillan families descendants of William Wallace Cargill, who founded the trading house in 1865. The company does not disclose its dividends policy to the families, but according to a report last December by Moody’s Investors Service, it limits pay-outs to 20 per cent of trailing two-year earnings.The record profit highlights the big margins in the sector led by Cargill, which rose to prominence in the 2007-08 food crisis, when agricultural commodities prices hit all-time highs. Cargill and its main competitors, including ADM, Bunge and France’s Louis Dreyfus are known in the industry as “ABCD” and together dominate global flows of agricultural commodities.Cargill benefited from disruptions in global grain trading over the past year. Russia imposed an export ban on wheat and barley last summer after a drought devastated its crop. Months later, as unrest gathered in the Middle East, countries from Algeria to Saudi Arabia announced extraordinary purchases of wheat. Stockpiling by governments combined with strong demand in emerging markets and disappointing crops drove the prices of key agricultural commodities higher.Sergio Rial, chief financial officer at Cargill, told the Financial Times the trading house had yet to see a slowdown in agricultural commodities demand, but warned about economic growth in the developing world.“As we have seen in China and a number developing countries controlling inflation, it is possible that the growth path of the so-called Brics may slowdown,” he said.The company is unlikely to repeat its record profitability anytime soon, after it spun off earlier this year its 64 per cent stake in Mosaic, the fertiliser producer, in a $24bn deal to satisfy a shareholder who wanted to cash out. The deal closed in May.The details of its complex deal to spin off Mosaic allowed outsiders to calculate the value of the trading house for the first time, with bankers putting it at about $50bn.Mr Rial insisted that Cargill did not have any plans to float it shares. “Public markets are not the only way of value creation,” he said.Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, raised about $10bn earlier this year in an initial public offering in London and Hong Kong.
246;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-08T21:46:20Z;Oil leads sell-off as raw materials tumble;Among leading commodities, oil led the correction;Commodities prices fell across the board with the exception of precious metals as investors worried that global economic growth is slowing down.The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities, fell 2.8 per cent by late afternoon in London, hitting 317 points, its lowest level since December, dragged down by a sharp drop in oil and copper prices.The index has fallen 14.3 per cent since a peak set in April.Natural resource stocks underperformed actual commodities prices by a large margin.Household sector names including Xstrata, Glencore, ConocoPhillips and Archer Daniels Midland saw their shares fall between 4 and 8 per cent on the day, extending last week’s large drop.Colin Fenton, head of commodities research at JPMorgan in New York, said that, in the near term, most commodity markets appeared “likely to convulse lower, as a growth scare dislodges physical inventories and impairs orders”.But Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in London, was somewhat more positive, telling clients that, although risk to the bank’s “constructive commodity views” had risen, he maintained an “overweight” recommendation on commodities relative to other asset classes.Among major commodities, oil led the correction as investors bet that an economic slowdown would cut demand for the commodity just as Saudi Arabia ramps up its production.In late afternoon trading in London, ICE September Brent fell nearly $7 to a session low of $102.70 a barrel, dropping below the crucial 200-day moving average. It was later down $6.17 at $103.20.The breakdown of the technical level suggest that prices could fall lower as speculators sell. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate fell $6.01 to $80.87 a barrel.But some analysts believe that the sell-off in oil markets could peter out soon.While the oil market has been affected by the “risk-on, risk-off” trend in the markets, the overall fundamentals in supply and demand have not changed, said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity market strategy at BNP Paribas.While the fall in appetite for risk has hit the oil price, “the overall picture which pushed oil above $100 hasn’t changed,” he said. “On a risk-reward basis, going long WTI at around $83 to $84 is very attractive,” Mr Tchilinguirian said.Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, agreed, saying he had yet to revise his price targets for oil prices.While financial markets were responding to the S&P downgrade of US debt, last week’s US employment figures painted a more positive picture of the country’s economic situation, he said.
247;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-04T18:05:08Z;Resource stocks take market’s full impact;;Even by the standards of the recent financial crisis, Thursday’s sell-off in stock markets was sizeable.The growing nervousness over the debt crisis in Europe, the risk of a “double-dip” recession in America and a view among investors that policymakers, including the Japanese government and European Central Bank, had failed to shore up confidence accelerated this week’s sell-off.The worst hit stocks were those of the world’s big natural resources groups, including miners, oil companies and traders. Despite the prices of many commodities remaining near recent highs, their shares prices tumbled, sending valuations to the lowest levels of the year.The divergence between resources stocks and the prices of actual raw materials evokes memories of mid-2008, when equity investors were quicker in anticipating the global financial crisis.Are equity investors right again? If so, a sharp economic slowdown, or worse, could be at hand. Other sectors, such as financial services, suffered steep falls too on concern over their exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the risk of more bad loans.There’s a lot of market noise, that’s distracting people from the real economic fundamentals. These are unambiguously weaker in all big economies. This is a validation of a low yield environment and is good for bondsThe list of tumbling resources stocks on Thursday included Xstrata, the London-listed miner, which fell 8.5 per cent, Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil group, which fell 5.2 per cent, and Vale of Brazil, the largest iron ore producer, which dropped 6.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, a top copper miner, fell 5.9 per cent and Archer Daniels Midland, one of the largest food commodities traders, was 4.5 per cent lower.After two weeks of heavy losses, the FTSE All World Mining and the FTSE all World Oil and Gas indices are up just 7.6 and 14.6 per cent, respectively, over the past year.In the same period, the benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a basket of commodities including oil, copper and wheat, is up 22.1 per cent.I don’t mean to trivialise things but equities can go up and down. You start to get worried by bond markets getting out of control. I still don’t see things spiralling that wildly out of control. There is nothing central banks can doGlencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, which came to the market in a $60bn flotation in May, is among those hardest hit. The company has lost 17.9 per cent so far this week. On Thursday, it closed at 391p, more than 26 per cent below its flotation price and 8 per cent down on the day.Equity investors appear far more concerned about the potential of a double-dip than commodities investors, according to industry executives.Investors say that high oil and food prices are forcing emerging countries’ central banks to tighten monetary policy, slowing economic growth in China, India and other big commodities consumers. That has compounded the negative sentiment surrounding the eurozone crisis and US fiscal burden.“We began the year expecting slow but persisting growth in mature economies with China compensating by continuing with its robust growth,” says Jon Bergtheil, mining analyst at Citigroup. “Those assumptions are being called into question”.Look at US growth and Italian bond markets and you’ve got a lot of the story. The US ability to dig itself out is crucial, and where Italian bond markets go, so goes global risk appetiteBut Colin P. Fenton, head of commodities research at JPMorgan in New York, warns against being too gloomy. “The global economy is weathering a soft patch, but is likely not heading into a double-dip recession”.Commodities prices are starting to fall, although from historically high levels. Brent crude, for example, fell on Thursday to a 5-week low, yet it remains about 40 per cent higher than in January 2010.Economic fears aside, another important factor behind the sharp falls in commodity-related share prices has been rising production costs, which have eroded companies’ profitability even as the selling prices of the raw materials they produce have increased. Tom Albanese, chief executive at Rio Tinto, said on Thursday that the sector was suffering from inflation hot spots: “Coupled with the increasing strength of the Australian and Canadian dollars, this has put pressure on our cost base.”The impact of that rising cost inflation is clear in iron ore. The price of the steelmaking commodity hit a 2½-month high of $179.5 a tonne on Thursday, up nearly 30 per cent year-on-year. Yet shares in the world’s largest ore miners – Vale of Brazil, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton – have tumbled 10-12 per cent this week.Other factors are weighing on share prices. Oil and mining groups have produced less than expected due to bad weather – for example, flooding in Australia – and labour disputes including strikes in South Africa’s mining sector, as well as political turmoil such as the civil war in oil-rich Libya. The resulting supply shortfalls have lifted commodities prices, but are eroding profitability as companies miss production targets.Total of France, Eni of Italy and Repsol YPF of Spain produced oil in Libya before the civil war started. Their net profits fell year on year in the second quarter despite higher year on year Brent crude prices. The boom in resources stocks already feels like history.
248;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-08-02T21:02:39Z;US stocks tumble most in a year;;US stocks fell the most in a year on Tuesday, their seventh straight losing session in a row, as worries about the economy outweighed the resolution of the debt ceiling deal.The resolution of the debt ceiling deal, with the Senate’s “yes” vote and President Barack Obama’s signature, only served to unleash a wave of selling, driving the S&P 500 index down 2.6 per cent, its biggest single-day drop since August of last year. The broad index is now down 0.3 per csent for the year.“Stock market sellers had been held in check by the prospect of a debt ceiling relief rally,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “The largest effect is that it allows investors to focus more fully on the deterioration in the economic fundamentals.”Consumer discretionary and industrial groups were pacing declines, dropping 3.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.Traders were disappointed early on by earnings at Archer Daniels Midland, the food processing group, and by a poor report on consumer spending.The S&P 500 index ended the session at 1,254.05, well below its 200-day moving average of 1,284. Technical analysts said the next resistance level was 1,250, its March low.The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.8 per cent lower at 2,669.24 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.2 per cent to 11,866.62.ADM shares fell 6.2 per cent to $28.60 after it reported second-quarter earnings of 60 cents per share, missing analysts’ target of 84.8 cents.Shares in Emerson Electric, a manufacturing conglomerate, slipped 4.1 per cent to $47.06 after the company warned that orders would slow in the latter part of the year. “US and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft patch,” it said.Parker Hannifin, a manufacturer of mechanical equipment, fell 8.5 per cent to $70.88, its lowest for the year, after it warned that orders from the military and defence sector would be soft, and provided guidance for the year below what analysts were expecting.Retailers began their portion of the earnings reporting season on Tuesday with Coach, the high-end designer, seeing sharp falls after it was reported that personal spending slipped 0.2 per cent in June, below the 0.1 per cent growth expected by economists.“The data on personal income and spending suggests that the third quarter begins with no momentum from the consumer sector,” said Mr Delwiche.Coach shares were off 6.5 per cent to $61.03, down from their all-time highs of $67 reached in July.Retailers are the last major economic segment to report earnings. Many of those reporting later this week were down, including Nordstrom, down 5.8 per cent to $47.05, and Macy’s, off 5.6 per cent to $27.63. Tiffany, the jeweller, paced all declines in the S&P, falling 8.2 per cent to $73.38.The fear is that the non-farm payroll report on Friday, a key measure of consumers’ ability to spend, could be as poor as last week’s GDP figures and Monday’s industrial production survey.“If retailers report weak numbers or guidance, we could see another leg lower in the S&P index,” said David Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The debt deal itself is, in part, adding to consternation as those who believe that US stimulus spending has played a crucial part in supporting markets fear that spending caps will make it nearly impossible to approve any additional government help.“We’ve been operating under the assumption for the last two years that equity investors should be bullish until the bill comes due, as democracies rarely choose deflation,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas. “But the bill has come due and we have to reduce our outlook.”Trading in consumer groups would be weaker if not for McGraw-Hill, the US publishing group that also owns Standard & Poor’s.Its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $44.43 after Jana Partners, a hedge fund, revealed that it had taken a stake, leading to speculation that the company may be broken up .Shares in Pfizer, the drugmaking giant, dropped 4.6 per cent to $18.14 despite it topping second-quarter earnings-per-share targets, coming in at 60 cents versus 58 cents. It said it was bracing for further declines in sales of established drugs such as Lipitor.Exchanges group NYSE Euronext was off by 4.9 per cent to $31.40. It reported earnings of 61 cents in the quarter versus forecasts of 59.5 cents, but warned that revenue capture could slow if trading volumes rebound.MetroPCS, the US wireless group, fell sharply by 37 per cent to $10.26 after it reported earnings well wide of the mark at 24 cents per share versus the 28 cents per share forecast.That result dragged down competitors as well with American Tower falling 3.8 per cent to $50.50.
249;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-07-12T19:02:09Z;US ethanol refiners use more corn than farmers;;US ethanol refiners are consuming more domestic corn than livestock and poultry farmers for the first time, underscoring how a government-supported biofuels industry has contributed to surging grain demand.The US Department of Agriculture estimated that in the year to August 31 ethanol producers will have consumed 5.05bn bushels of corn, or more than 40 per cent of last year’s harvest. Animal feed and residual demand accounted for 5bn bushels.The figures, from the world’s largest corn producer and exporter, come amid growing scrutiny of the biofuels sector and mounting concern over food inflation.Last month the G20 group of leading nations, in its first communiqué on agriculture, decided against calling for reduced biofuel use.In the US, key senators have reached a preliminary agreement to kill off tax and tariff support for the domestic ethanol industry though mandates requiring ethanol blending with petrol remain.“It’s a tipping point,” said Luke Chandler, Rabobank global head of agricultural research. Next year USDA expects ethanol groups will use another 100m bushels.The department cut its estimate of feed and residual demand for corn by 150m bushels, while raising its ethanol demand figure by 50m bushels as “margins have improved for producers”, said Jerry Norton, USDA grains analyst.Some corn used for ethanol will return to the food supply as animal feed and corn oil.Despite corn prices that are 90 per cent higher than a year ago, US ethanol production is expected to reach a record 13.7bn gallons this year, exceeding mandated levels by 1bn gallons, the Renewable Fuels Association said.Extra output has been exported abroad, including to Brazil, a leading sugar-based ethanol producer.The meat industry and some environmentalists say rising corn consumption by ethanol refiners including Archer Daniels Midland, Poet and Valero Energy has driven up food prices.Demand for corn, used to fatten cattle and make starches and sweeteners as well as ethanol, is also rising. USDA increased its global consumption forecast by 5.9m tonnes to 877.6m in the coming year because animals are eating more corn.China, once self-sufficient in corn, is now expected to import 2m tonnes after recent reported purchases from the US.High petrol prices have kept ethanol production attractive. Chicago ethanol futures were on Tuesday 30 cents cheaper per gallon than petrol futures traded in New York. Corn futures gained 2.8 per cent to top $7 per bushel, the highest level since June.
250;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-05-25T19:45:40Z;Ukraine removes grain export quotas;;Ukraine, one of the world’s leading grain exporters, has removed grain export quotas that have helped drive up global food prices and hit domestic agribusinesses hard.The decision will ease concerns in the wheat market about supplies in the second half of the year as western Europe and the southern US, two important producing regions, suffer a drought that is likely to reduce output.European wheat prices for the crop, which will be harvested in the next three months, have surged to €245 a tonne, substantially more than last year’s prices.Food company executives and traders fear further price rises unless it were to rain during the next three weeks in farming areas of France, Germany, the UK and Poland, which produce about 65 per cent of the European Union wheat crop.Export restrictions imposed last year by Russia and Ukraine, home to some of the richest farming soil, had rattled global grain markets. Russia would decide in the next few days whether or not to lift its export ban, Viktor Zubkov, Russia’s first deputy prime minister who oversees agriculture, said on Wednesday.Mykola Prysyazhnyuk, Ukraine’s agriculture minister, said Kiev’s cabinet had on Tuesday lifted the quotas, which were introduced last year to protect domestic food supply amid poor harvests in the Black Sea region after a drought.Agribusinesses that have invested heavily in Ukraine, such as Cargill, ADM, and Bunge, had criticised the restrictions, which were introduced in spite of a healthy grain harvest.However, government officials and market insiders said Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine’s president, was likely to sign legislation adopted by lawmakers last week that will introduce export duties of 9-14 per cent until January 2012.Grain traders on Tuesday had a lukewarm reaction to the government’s decision. They said an export restriction-free window of several weeks could free millions of tonnes of stockpiled grain for export before duties were introduced and the collection of this season’s harvest began.Jorge Zukoski, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said he hoped Ukraine’s government would postpone introduction of duties from June 1 to July 1.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London
251;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-05-25T14:57:32Z;Ukraine removes grain export quotas;;Ukraine, one of the world’s top grain exporters, has removed grain export quotas that have helped drive up global food prices and hit domestic agribusinesses hard.The move will ease concerns in the global wheat market about supplies in the second half of the year as western Europe and the southern US, two key producing regions, suffer a drought that is likely to reduce output significantly.European wheat prices for the new crop, which will be harvested in the next three months, have surged to €245 ($345) a tonne, significantly above last year’s prices.Food company executives and traders fear further price rises unless it rains over the next three weeks in farming areas of France, Germany, the UK and Poland, which produce about 65 per cent of the European Union wheat crop.Mykola Prysyazhnyuk, Ukraine’s agriculture minister, said Kiev’s cabinet had on Tuesday lifted the quotas introduced in 2010 to protect domestic food supply amid poor harvests in the Black Sea region following a drought.But government officials and market insiders said Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine’s president, is likely to sign off on legislation adopted by lawmakers last week that will introduce export duties of 9-14 per cent until January 2012.Export restrictions in 2010 by Russia and Ukraine, home to some of the world’s richest farming soil, rattled global grain prices.Global agribusinesses that have invested heavily in Ukraine, such as Cargill, ADM, and Bunge, criticised the restrictions, introduced in spite of a healthy harvest last season of nearly 40m tonnes of grain.Lobbyists representing grain traders described the quota system as “unjustified” and “non-transparent”, arguing that Khlib Investbud, a quasi-state company, had received the largest share of quotas.The previously little-known company also has exclusive contracts to buy grain for state reserves. It denies wrongdoing but declines to reveal who its majority private shareholders are.Morgan Williams, president of the US-Ukraine Business Council, described Ukraine’s handling of grain exports as the “Great Grain Robbery.”On Tuesday, grain traders gave a lukewarm reaction to the government’s decision. Mr Williams said traders considered export duties “the lesser of two evils.”Traders said an export restriction-free window of several weeks could release millions of tonnes of stockpiled grain for export before duties are introduced and the collection of this season’s harvest begins.Jorge Zukoski, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, hopes Ukraine’s government will postpone the export duties until July 1, instead of June 1.Referring to hundred of millions of dollars that traders and farmers have lost since the quotas were introduced he said: “The damage is not irreversible.“Allowing old stocks to be exported is a sign that the president understands market concerns and is moving towards a free market system.“If this happens, Ukraine can attract more investment and foreign players that will help more than double harvests in the coming decade.”Despite the export restrictions, Mr Prysyazhnyuk said Ukraine managed to export nearly 14m tonnes of grain. He said plans envisage that up to 20m tonnes will be exported from this season’s harvest.One trader said “uncertainty continues to loom” about government policy, its transparency and fairness.“Government hopes these export duties will raise additional revenues for their cash-starved budget coffers. But the pockets of farmers, the most unorganised and cash-strapped, will again be hit hard.”
252;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-05-23T15:03:07Z;Trading houses: Veil slowly lifts on a secretive profession;;"The alarm clock rings and the day begins. From the moment the lights are switched on, hot water runs in the shower, breakfast is served, and, later, the car sets off on the daily commute, we consume dozens of commodities: power, natural gas, coffee, wheat, sugar and petrol.Unawares, we use the services of the world’s largest trading houses, a cluster of publicity-shy companies that act as the link between producers and consumers of raw materials.For years, the world of trading companies – from Vitol, whose strength in oil, to Cargill, in grains, and Glencore, in metals – has been largely opaque. But the veil is slowly lifting, with the initial public offering of Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, bringing unprecedented attention.The industry is tightly knit: just a dozen or so companies share most of the revenues and profits. In oil, the top houses are Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura, Gunvor and Mercuria, all headquartered in Geneva.The Swiss city has emerged as the largest centre for trading physical energy commodities, rivalling London and outshining Singapore and Houston. In metals, Glencore and Trafigura dominate, with other operators on the sidelines.In agriculture, four big companies, known in the industry as “ABCD” based on the first letter of each name, dominate global flows: Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Commodities.In addition, Japan’s general traders, or sogo shosha, dominate at home and in the region: Mitsubishi, Mitsui & Co, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni.A new legion of originally Asia-focused trading houses, including Noble Group, Olam International and Wilmar, are expanding globally.In many ways, the trading houses are the hidden companies of the global economy.They are the nexus of the natural resources industry, linking producers such as farmers, oil and mining companies, with consumers around the world. Their importance is set to grow further, as food demand rises in China, India and in other parts of the developing world, and the use of biofuels grows in the west.Commodities and the big trading houses have been attracting increased attention from policymakers following the price spikes since 2003. Long the preserve of agriculture and mining ministers, commodities are now hotly debated by the Group of 20 leading industrialised countries.The biggest trading houses are set to earn between $25bn and $30bn in profits this year, according to analysts’ preliminary estimates, a significant rebound from last year’s lacklustre performance.The surge in profits is partly the result of rising commodities prices, which lift the performance of the production businesses of the traders. It also reflects supply dislocations. These include bad harvests last year followed by the imposition of grain export bans, and upheavals in oil producing countries of the Middle East.Amid surging profitability, the industry is in transition. For years, companies such as Phillip Brothers, Marc Rich and Metall­gesellschaft, focused on buying and selling raw materials, acting as mere middlemen. Now, many companies are leaving their traditional model behind – a business of large volumes but thin profits – and buying production assets and logistics businesses.The move from middlemen to vertically integrated companies owning oil terminals, warehouses, mines, farmland and processing plants is changing the face of the industry: boosting profitability, but at the cost of larger capital needs.As such, traders are looking for options: some are considering becoming publicly listed; others are tapping the bond market for the first time and some are seeking strategic investors to help finance their fixed assets.Glencore is leading those going public. Some executives, including Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Olam, the Singapore-listed agricultural trading house, believe the trend to go public will continue.Not everyone is convinced.Some executives see value in remaining private. Vitol and Cargill, the world’s largest oil and agricultural traders, respectively, say they will stay private, but bankers believe that Glencore’s IPO, with its sky-high valuation of about $60bn, and the need to raise finance, can bring changes to the industry.Louis Dreyfus Commodities, controlled since its foundation in 1851 by the Louis-Dreyfus family, is looking for a $10bn-$12bn sale, merger or IPO to fund its expansion plans, according to bankers and rivals.Last year, it approached Olam for a merger but talks collapsed amid dis­agreement among family members.Others are looking for partners to help finance their move outside the traditional role of buying and selling commodities.Vitol, for example, sold half its oil terminals and tanks business last year to a subsidiary of Petronas, Malaysia’s national oil company, for $735m in cash.Trafigura, too, is searching for a strategic investor for its oil terminals and storage business."
253;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-05-03T14:18:50Z;ADM profits rise on food and fuel demand;;Growing food and fuel demand boosted results at Archer Daniels Midland, but the US-based agribusiness said profit was flat in its largest segment, which trades commodities around the globe.Net profit for Decatur, Illinois-based ADM was $578m, or 86 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, up 37 per cent from $421m, or 65 cents per share, from the same period the year before. Results matched expectations.The results came in a period of severe price swings for the agricultural commodities from corn to cocoa.ADM businesses that that turn raw commodities into food, feed and fuel reported sharply higher results. The unit that crushes and refines soyabeans and other oilseeds increased operating profit by 26 per cent to $512m. At ADM’s corn processing segment, which makes ethanol and sweeteners, profit nearly doubled to $204m from the year-ago quarter.“Overall, global demand for crops and agricultural products remains relatively strong,” said Patricia Woertz. chief executive.The company’s agricultural services unit, which trades bulk commodities such as corn and wheat, increased operating profit by a marginal $6m to $171m. The segment is historically ADM’s largest by revenue.The trading results stand in contrast to rising commodity trading profits at rivals Bunge and Cargill. The company cited logistical challenges in shipping commodities to key importers as civil unrest gripped the Middle East and North Africa and an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan.To help finance the cost of soaring costs of buying raw materials, ADM’s outstanding debt increased $6.7bn from June 30 to $14.3bn.ADM shares fell 4.5 per cent to $35.34 in early trading in New York.
254;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-04-28T22:12:22Z;Bunge issues weather alert on tight corn supplies;;The head of Bunge, one of the biggest international grain traders, cautioned that strained global corn supplies will be at the mercy of the weather as the company reported its strongest first-quarter profit since the 2008 food crisis.Corn prices have doubled in the past year as growing demand for animal feed and biofuels draws down inventories. The increase has contributed to the inflation that is now a focus of central bankers. Other agricultural commodities have also gained in the past year, but good harvests in Brazil and elsewhere may ease fears of shortage.“The key issue today is corn,” Alberto Weisser, Bunge chief executive, told analysts. “If we have any kind of weather problem in the northern hemisphere, we don’t have enough corn” [by harvest time].Mr Weisser warned that the corn market is “clearly going to stay volatile all the way through the harvest, and it still might stay somewhat volatile into the South American harvest” in 2012.“We do need good weather. We need to replenish our stocks. Sugar is slowly being replenished. Soyabean is being replenished. Wheat is being replenished. But corn, not yet.”CBOT May corn traded at $7.30½ per bushel, down 2.9 per cent on the day, after the US revealed slowing exports of the grain.Bunge, along with Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Louis Dreyfus, is among the few companies that dominate the global grain trade. Networks of ports and processing facilities and relationships with farmers and importers tend to give trading houses superior market intelligence.Bunge reported $232m in net profit in the quarter ended March 31, up from $63m in the same quarter of last year, largely on results in the unit that buys, sells, transports and stores grains and oilseeds. Nearly 60 per cent of its assets are in Brazil, where the company is the largest agribusiness exporter and soyabean crusher.China, which purchases the majority of the world’s soyabean exports, is showing no signs of let-up.“We might have a situation where there is little bit more inventory and they are digesting the inventory. But the fundamentals of the demand in China continue to be very robust,” Mr Weisser said.
255;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67.

256;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-04-11T19:19:22Z;Glencore sparks ownership debate;;The decision by Glencore, the world’s top commodities trader, to become a public company has triggered a debate in the industry: to follow suit or to remain private.The discussion comes at a turning point for the commodities trading industry. Many companies are leaving behind their traditional model of pure traders – a business of large volumes but thin profits – and buying production assets and logistic businesses.The move from middlemen to vertically integrated companies owning oil terminals, warehouses, mines, farmland and processing plants is boosting profitability, but at the cost of larger capital needs. As such, traders are looking for options: some are considering becoming public, others are tapping for the first time the bond market and some are seeking strategic investors to help finance their fixed assets.Sunny Verghese, chief executive of Olam, the Singapore-listed agricultural commodities trading house, believes that the trend to become public will continue.“I would expect more companies to do this over the next few years,” he says.Among the world’s largest commodities traders there are already several listed companies, including Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge, both in New York. The Japanese trading houses, or sogo shosha, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni, are also public companies. Moreover, the new cadre of Asia-based traders, including Wilmar, Noble Group and Olam, are all listed in Singapore.But among the top houses, many still remain private. Cargill, the top agricultural trader, and its rival Louis Dreyfus Commodities, are both family owned.In oil, top houses Vitol – the largest energy trader – Trafigura, Gunvor and Mercuria are all owned by their employees. And some smaller traders, including Touton – a top player in cocoa – and Sucres and Denrées – a leading sugar trader – are also private.Some of the trading houses, including Vitol and Cargill say they will remain private, but bankers believe that Glencore’s IPO, with its sky-high valuation of about $60bn, and the need to raise finance, can entice changes on the industry.Louis Dreyfus Commodities, controlled since its foundation in 1851 by the Louis-Dreyfus family, is looking itself for a $10bn-$12bn sale, merger or IPO to fund its expansion plans, according to bankers and rivals. Last year it approached Olam for a merger but the talks collapsed amid disagreement among the family members.Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader, and Trafigura, number three in oil and two in metals, both believe in keeping their trading businesses private. But besides their middlemen business, both Vitol and Trafigura have each built a logistics businesses – mostly oil storage and terminals – which consume large amounts of capital. For that reason, both companies are diversifying their funding options.Vitol sold half of its oil terminals and tanks business last year to a subsidiary of Petronas, Malaysia’s national oil company, for $735m in cash.Trafigura is searching too for a strategic investor for its oil terminals and storage business. In a presentation to bondholders last year, Trafigura said that it was open to “attract a financial or industrial partner and/or access public equity markets” for its Puma Energy subsidiary, which focuses on oil terminals across more than 20 countries.Moreover, Trafigura last year tapped for the first time the bond market, issuing a €400m ($577m) Eurobond and the trading house is likely to raise more finance later this year or in early 2012, bankers say.Vitol is not opposed in principle to tapping the bond market, but so far prefers the discretion of the US private placement market.Cargill has repeatedly said it is not planning to become public. In the biggest sign that an IPO is out of question, the biggest trader of agricultural commodities has just finished a complex $24bn deal to spin-off a stake in Mosaic, the fertiliser maker, to allow the exit of one of its shareholders and avoid a listing.Additional reporting by Kevin Brown in Singapore
257;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-04-11T08:47:20Z;Will Glencore’s IPO spark an industry trend?;The flotation is a watershed moment, writes Javier Blas;Glencore is set to launch its multi-billion dollar initial public offer on Thursday. Barring a last minute glitch, the world’s largest commodities trader will be quoted on the London and Hong Kong exchanges by mid-May.Will the IPO entice rival traders to follow suit and leave behind years of private ownership?For sure, the attention of the whole industry, from Geneva to Singapore, is on it. And it should be – the flotation is a watershed moment which could change the industry for ever.Among the world’s largest commodities traders there are already several listed companies, including Mitsubishi of Japan, Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland, New York-based Bunge, Singapore-listed Wilmar, Noble Group of Hong Kong, and Olam of Singapore. For them, the IPO will change little, other than the frenzy around Glencore could prompt more investor’s interest in them, boosting their valuation.But among the top houses, many still remain private and publicity-shy: Cargill of the US, Louis Dreyfus Commodities of France and Swiss-based Vitol, Trafigura, Gunvor and Mercuria. Other smaller players, from French-based Touton and Sucres et Denrees to Hetco of the US and UK-based Arcadia, are also private.Louis Dreyfus Commodities, controlled by the Louis-Dreyfus family, is looking itself for a sale, merger or IPO. Glencore’s flotation could have a massive impact on its choice: on the one hand, a multi-billion-dollar successful IPO could convince Margarita Louis-Dreyfus to follow suit. On the other, Glencore could use the additional fire power of being a public company to attempt a merger. One way or the other, LDC is likely to have gone through a corporate event within the next year or so. LDC’s senior traders, which control a 22 per cent stake, could see a windfall when the moment arrives.The IPO is unlikely to affect Cargill. After all, the biggest trader of agricultural commodities has just finished a complex deal to wind down a stake in Mosaic, the fertiliser maker, to allow the exit of one of its family shareholders and remain precisely private. Don’t expect any changes here over the short term.Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader, and Trafigura, number three in oil and two in metals, are similar cases. Both believe in keeping their trading businesses private. Besides trading, Vitol and Trafigura have each built logistics businesses – mostly oil storage and terminals – which consume large amounts of capital. For that reason, both companies are seeking options to raise funding, but just for that area.Vitol sold half of its oil terminals and tanks business last year to a subsidiary of Malaysia’s national oil company Petronas for $735m in cash. Trafigura is searching too for a strategic investor – I’m told it has already had conversations with sovereign wealth funds in Asia. Over the medium term, Trafigura could consider an IPO of its logistics business, but I think the move is several years away.For the time being, Vitol and Trafigura will tap the capital market for debt. Vitol is using the US private placement market, and I believe the trend will continue for a while, as the company is sceptical of launching a public bond. Trafigura, meanwhile, raised €400m in a eurobond last year and I am expecting it would return to the eurobond market later this year to raise a similar amount.For the rest, the IPO of Glencore is an interesting spectacle to watch from the distance. But Gunvor, Mercuria and a constellation of smaller trading houses have no plans to go public or raise finance on the capital market. At least not yet.javier.blas@ft.com
258;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-04-06T17:37:02Z;Farmers look to earn their corn with new storage bins;;Soaring corn prices have sparked a rush by US farmers to build storage bins across the Midwest, with many hoping to profit from an expected shortage by hanging on to grain supplies.The rapid pace at which bins are being erected has made the glint of galvanised steel a more common sight in rural parts of the US, their growing presence a sign that farmers expect to fetch higher prices for their corn as the country’s stocks fall to critically low levels.“Storage has had an incredible boom,” said Michael Swanson, agricultural economist at Wells Fargo. “Farmers have built more on-farm grain storage in the last three to four years than they’ve built in the previous 30.”Government economists believe that US corn inventories will fall sharply before combine harvesters start rolling in the autumn, to 675m bushels by August. Corn futures prices have doubled in a year to surpass $7.70 per bushel, breaking records set in the commodity price spike of 2008.But farmers selling to merchants often fetch far less than Chicago futures prices, a discount known as “basis”. Holding back grain allows them to bet that discount will shrink, or futures rise, as supplies dwindle.The US Department of Agriculture counts 12.5bn bushels of capacity on US farms, 900m more than four years ago.“We’ve had our best years the last couple of years,” said Charles Sukup, president of Sukup Manufacturing, an Iowa bin maker.“It makes farmers pretty sick when they say, ‘Gee, if I only had a bin I could have stored this grain for a few months longer, and paid for the bin in one year’.”Brock Grain Systems, a unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, says on its website that storage “allows farmers to market their grain when they are ready”. The Indiana-based company did not return calls.Grain merchants such as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill are also adding millions of bushels of commercial silo capacity across the US, the world’s top exporter of corn, soyabeans and wheat.Many farmers are already cashing in. Between December and March the amount of corn stored on farms plunged 46 per cent to 3.4bn bushels, as corn was sold to grain elevators and ethanol plants. The price of corn sold for imminent delivery currently exceeds future delivery dates.Higher-yielding harvests can sometimes overwhelm silos, driving down the basis for farmers. This has also made storing grain on the farm more attractive.James Layton of the Chicago commodity consultants Laymac sees dozens of metal storage units bins rising as he travels the Midwest. “You can spot them because the new bins shine so much,” he said.Ethanol refiners, operating at record rates, are especially appealing to farmers because they need to run constantly and have little on-site storage of their own. They could bid up the price of stored corn until harvests begin in September.“The guys who can carry the corn the longest are going to have some big-time opportunities in the fall,” said Mr Layton.
259;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-03-22T17:02:22Z;Cocoa traders ready to pay Gbagbo;;Some cocoa traders are preparing to pay taxes to the regime of Laurent Gbagbo in a move that would hand a lifeline to the embattled former Ivory Coast president, who has refused to step down after losing elections last year.Cocoa traders fear Mr Gbagbo may confiscate stocks of cocoa worth $1.3bn if they do not pay export taxes by the end of March, as he has ordered. Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global crop.In January, the traders stopped exporting cocoa, depriving the Gbagbo government of revenue from export taxes, after the imposition of a ban by Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognised winner of November’s election, and European sanctions.But Ricardo Leiman, chief executive of Hong Kong-based trading house Noble Group, said that if Mr Gbagbo was still in control by March 31, the company would pay the export taxes.“If the local government who is in charge tells us to pay the taxes, we will pay the taxes. We abide by local law and international law,” Mr Leiman told the Financial Times in an interview.Noble Group later clarified that the company’s actions would be guided by its legal advice.The comments caused surprise in the cocoa trading community as other companies insisted they would resist paying the taxes, citing an informal agreement among the cocoa industry to present a unified front to Mr Gbagbo and to refuse to pay. “We will not pay. No way,” one European executive said.But another executive said that, while he did not currently plan to pay, he would have to “reassess the situation” if the threat of confiscation were to remain on March 31. “People may not have an option,” he said.The stocks under threat number about 400,000 tonnes of cocoa – worth $1.3bn at current prices. Given export duties of 22 per cent, they could be worth nearly $300m in taxes to Mr Gbagbo’s government. Diplomats believe he needs about $150m a month to keep the loyalty of military forces and civil servants. All of the top cocoa traders own large quantities of cocoa tied up in Ivory Coast, including Barry Callebaut, Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Olam, Noble, Touton, Ecom Agroindustrial and Armajaro.The dilemma for the cocoa industry comes as Mr Gbagbo’s grip on the country has weakened amid an escalation of violence. At least 30 people were killed in a mortar attack on a market in a pro-Ouattara neighbourhood of Abidjan last week.In the past two weeks, the cocoa price has tumbled from close to its highest in 33 years as investors bet that stocks in Ivory Coast would find their way out of the country.But brokers said big industry groups were buying options to protect against a rise in prices in case the stocks were seized or destroyed.Mr Leiman said that even if the European Union sanctions were to prevent the company from shipping the beans out of the country in the short term, “the beans will be exported one day”.
260;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-03-08T00:14:05Z;Ivory Coast move sparks cocoa fears;;Laurent Gbagbo, the Ivory Coast leader who the international community says lost presidential elections in November, announced he would nationalise the cocoa sector in a surprise move that threatened to drive the cocoa price sharply higher.The African country is the world’s largest cocoa exporter, accounting for 40 per cent of global supplies of the bean used to make chocolate. Cocoa prices are nearing three-decade highs amid the worsening crisis in Ivory Coast.Mr Gbagbo’s move comes after Alassane Ouattara , who won the elections according to UN certified results, extended for a second month a ban on cocoa exports that trading houses, including Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland of the US, Swiss-based Barry Callebaut, Olam of Singapore and UK-based Armajaro, are observing.The decree was read on state broadcaster Radiodiffusion Télévision Ivoirienne on Monday night and left the Ivorian cocoa industry in disarray amid lack of details about what exactly the new measures meant for the commodity trade.It said cocoa and coffee purchases and exports in Ivory Coast would now be “exclusively done by the state”, replacing trading houses. It did not spell out the future of cocoa bean stocks held in the country. During the ban, trading houses have accumulated about 400,000 tonnes of beans, worth $1.45bn at current prices, which could now be confiscated.A senior cocoa trader said the decree made “a difficult situation to say the least”.State television did not explain how Mr Gbagbo would finance the purchases of cocoa – the country’s annual crop is worth about $4.5bn at present prices – or which international customers will buy the beans.But industry officials doubted the plan could work. Eric Sivry, at Marex Financial, the London-based commodities brokerage, said the big question was who would buy “contentious cocoa” from Mr Gbagbo’s government.Cocoa is heavily taxed in Ivory Coast and is a key source of income for Mr Gbagbo, who diplomats say needs about $150m a month to pay civil servants and the military.The move came as forces loyal to Mr Gbabgo said rebels had seized a third town in the west of the country amid escalating violence since the election.
261;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-02-22T22:30:37Z;Lessons from a bumper harvest;Rural company has forged links with its traditional competitors;Gerard Keenan is searching for the right words to ex­press the difference between small and big companies.“It’s the ‘bejaysus’ factor,” he says suddenly, alighting on an Irish idiom to denote extreme, but pleased, surprise. He explains he means differences such as the can-do flexibility of smaller companies that continues to surprise his new partners. As big companies, they “kind of lose” that.“It’s like someone in one of these big feed companies said to me – [that] none of his guys understood what was meant by meeting payroll by Friday,” he says. A smaller business such as his specialist farm machinery exporter, Richard Keenan & Co, and its customers is always aware of issues such as costs and cash flow.Keenans, with a turnover of more than €50m a year, was started by Mr Keenan’s father in 1978. The family-owned company makes a mechanical cattle feeder that uses a patented process to maximise the nutrient and energy content of a cow’s ration. The machine helps raise milk and beef yields, while also decreasing the cows’ wind. It has 60 per cent of the UK and Irish market, and is market leader in several other countries.But two years ago, Mr Keenan, the executive chairman, and his board wanted to change the business model. Instead of relying on sales of machines to farmers, the company set out to monetise the patents, knowhow and knowledge of markets it had acquired over the years by seeking links with the big feed companies, which are its traditional competitors.“It was time to talk to the enemy,” says Mr Keenan, speaking at his headquarters in Borris, county Carlow, where the mud-spattered company cars outside are a reminder that this is deeply rural Ireland. This small company, by keeping its roots in remote rural Ireland while finding a new way to expand, offers a lesson in innovating to transform a traditional business.The Keenan family is entrepreneurial by background. Gerard’s father was one of three brothers running a contracting business before selling his share in 1978 to set up a specialist farm machinery maker with a former aeronautical engineer and a fitter, who is still in the business. Gerard was called home from his job at John Deere in Germany to help. His three brothers were all also in the business in the early 1990s, but a decision to specialise further as a nutrition systems company led to a boardroom shake-up. Gerard, now 55, emerged as CEO in 1992.“I suppose my elder brother Richard was sort of earmarked for the job but there was no plan,” he says.He is the only Keenan involved in the day-to-day management of the business. “I don’t think it actually needs a Keenan person working in the company, but we don’t rule it out either.”But for now the focus is on bedding down a series of partnership agreements with big feed companies such as Archer Daniels Midland in the US, which has sales of $60bn.The time seems right. The issue of feed efficiency – a measure of the conversion rate of dry matter to milk and beef – is becoming increasingly important as a surge in food prices reawakens concerns about how to feed the world’s population.Mr Keenan believes the big feed companies are changing from a preoccupation with selling feed inputs to considering the impact of their policies on the food chain, on food processors and ultimately on retailers – hence their interest in Keenan’s machines and knowledge.Meanwhile, agriculture is changing. “Farmers desperately need to find a sustainable way of staying in business – in a prosperous way, not just surviving,” he says. There is a trend in agriculture that is moving to produce food in a more environmentally friendly way, that is also good for animal welfare and which gives the food processors and supermarkets the consistency they want.Mr Keenan says he was inspired to change by learning about a complete­ly different sector – high-technology – at a series of lectures he attended at Harvard in 2005, as part of an entrepreneur competition run by Ernst & Young, the professional services firm. “I was fascinated [by] how high-tech companies build their businesses. They often have sol­utions to someone else’s problems and that someone else doesn’t even know they exist,” he says. “But the challenge is how do companies like ours break through? How can you find the right company, and find the right person in the right company?”In 2008, Keenans appointed Bentley Associates, a New York-based consultancy, to identify companies with ex­perience of joint ventures with small partners. “If a company was on that journey already they were far more likely to be responsive,” he says.The next hurdle was how to make contact. Bentley “kept saying ‘we need to identify what the feed company’s problem is, what their problem might be’.”Although the relationship with Bentley forced Keenans to ask this type of essential question, the key connection with ADM was actually made through a scientist friend of Mr Keenan’s. “These guys at the high end in the academic world are actually very strategic,” Mr Keen­an says. “They’re not just scientists.”Mr Kennan’s links with scientists were the result of his company’s decision to set up an in-house scientific advisory board, to achieve the validation that small companies need to be seen as credible in the eyes of the industry’s big companies. “The problem was: how do we actually get ourselves into a form that a big company can make a positive decision about us? Big companies are entrepreneurial but they’re also conservative at the same time,” he says. “As they become bigger they probably become more conservative. But scientific validation makes it an awful lot easier for them to accept what you’re doing.”As a small, family owned business that guards the secrets and reputation of its technology and its homegrown R&D, Mr Keenan had serious misgivings about formal relationships with a big partner. But, he says, it has turned out differently from how he had expected.Mr Keenan likens the relationships with big companies such as ADM to a trial marriage. Neither side wants to get bogged down by board meetings or other governance issues. Their more informal arrangements allow the big feed company to test Keenan’s technology but also for both sides to see how they might get on in a full-blooded commercial relationship.“Now, we’re asking do we want to get married? We’ve got a good bit of learning behind us. It means it’s an awful lot less risky than it would have been 18 months ago. We now know an awful lot. So do our partners.”What do other family shareholders, his brother Thomas who has retained a stake and his two sisters, think of the move? “From a family perspective, the opportunity to create major shareholder value is enhanced. This isn’t just us talking about ourselves. We now have someone else, who’s got major credibility, pushing us to the front.”Mr Keenan was never meant to take over the business, but he is confident he has mapped a way forward for the family and the company.
262;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-02-14T19:09:42Z;Louis Dreyfus merger talks with Olam break down;;"Merger talks between Louis Dreyfus and rival Olam International of Singapore to create the world’s third-largest agricultural trading house have collapsed amid a split among the owners of the French company about the future of the business.The merger would have created a company with an estimated market value of $15bn-$18bn. It would have been the third-largest trader after Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, and the biggest trader in a range of commodities including cotton and rice.“These discussions have petered out. They have ceased,” Sunny Verghese, Olam’s chief executive said on Monday, adding the companies had jointly decided that the talks, which were disclosed in September, would not lead to an agreement.“We have both decided that we gave it a good shot; we parted amicably, and we will continue to pursue our independent futures. We will continue to remain friends, but these discussions are not going to go anywhere as of now.”Louis Dreyfus’ future has been unclear since chief executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus died in 2009. His widow, Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who owns a controlling stake of more than 50 per cent, opposed the merger with Olam, people familiar with the company said. Louis Dreyfus’ shareholders are debating whether to take it public through a listing, a merger with a rival, or to remain private.Ms Louis-Dreyfus favours keeping the 159-year-old company private, but other family shareholders and the trading house’s management – who control about 20 per cent of the shares – favour a public listing. Louis Dreyfus declined to ­comment.Before his sudden death, Mr Louis-Dreyfus made financial pledges to buy out the rest of the family shareholders before 2012. Rival executives believe his widow, who controls with her three children the majority of the group in a trust established for 99 years, will struggle to finance such a move alone. Rival executives and bankers put the value of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, which reported revenues of $34bn in 2009, at around $10bn-$11bn.Some observers believe Ms Louis-Dreyfus could choose to scale down the expansion plans of the trading house to continue as a privately-held business. But such a move could trigger senior traders, who are pushing the company to expand, to leave the house, they said. In a rare press interview last May, Ms Louis-Dreyfus said her main ambition was to ensure the company remained in family hands.Olam reported on Monday record net profits for the first half of its fiscal year, which ended December 31, up 63.5 per cent to S$141.9m ($110.7m). The collapse of the talks is unlikely to have a significant effect on Olam, which is in the second year of a six-year strategic reorganisation under which it is expanding its range of commodities and adding plantation and processing to its core trading business."
263;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-02-11T09:01:45Z;Outrageous fortunes of a commodity trader;Why traders of agricultural goods are concerned;Several middle-aged American men sit around a breakfast table, eating eggs and sausage, sipping coffee and talking about weather. One notes that snow in North Dakota has buried the winter wheat crop and threatens epic floods in the spring. This leads another to joke that “when the Bible said it rained 40 days and 40 nights, we got a half-inch in Kansas”. A third replies: “Wheat is a weed. It’s hard to kill.”Farmers at a rural US café? Try executives at an oceanside resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The men were in town this week for the annual meeting of the Commodity Markets Council, whose membership includes the some of most sophisticated commodities traders on the planet.I had expected a pretty bright mood. Corn prices had just risen above $7 a bushel, the highest since the peak of 2008, and soyabeans and wheat were following along. On Thursday the agribusiness Bunge reported impressive quarterly profits, echoing results from rival Archer Daniels Midland. Both companies, among the few able to respond to global food and animal feed supply shortfalls, are CMC members.Jokes notwithstanding, I encountered anxiety instead.Regulations headlined the list of worries. The US Dodd-Frank reforms included sweeping new rules to the way derivatives are traded, including the over-the-counter swaps and options used to hedge or bet on commodity prices. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has proposed dozens of new rules to implement the law but has so far left companies guessing as to whether they will be highly regulated as “swap dealers”, and whether certain options heavily used in the farm belt would be newly regulated as swaps.Michael Dunn, who heads the CFTC’s agricultural advisory committee, acknowledged that the rule-making process had been less than perfect but said the agency was overwhelmed.“We’re getting a whole new big seven-course dinner set on a plate that’s already full,” he told the crowd.The CFTC is currently operating under a stopgap budget that is far less than needed to carry out Dodd-Frank. Some opponents see underfunding as a strategy to pursue on Capitol Hill, but Christine Cochran, the council’s president, said the CFTC’s “mandate had been expanded and it should have the resources necessary to fulfil it”.Gripes about government shouldn’t be too surprising at a conference hosted by a lobbying group whose job it is to try to influence government policy. But other anxieties did come as a surprise.Speaker after speaker lambasted the US’s heavily subsidised ethanol industry, which is using 40 per cent of this year’s scarce corn crop, even as executives from ADM (the second-largest ethanol refiner) and Gavilon (which trades a lot of ethanol) sat in the audience. Charlie Carey, vice-chairman of CME Group, warned that biofuels were “taking food prices to a level that’s not sustainable,” a rather brave stance as his exchange lists ethanol futures.Joe Glauber, chief economist at the US Department of Agriculture, described a “very, very tight situation” in corn, saying: “Obviously the main component that’s going on here is ethanol production.”Even high commodity prices had some attendees on edge. For trading houses – which make a profit on the thin price differences between the places or times that they originate and sell commodities – surging markets mean higher margin requirements on exchanges such as CME. In extreme cases, suppliers or customers could walk away from contracts signed in more normal times, a prospect keeping some traders up at night.
264;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-02-10T18:49:51Z;Bunge benefits from global food shortfalls;;Bunge, one of the world’s largest agricultural traders, reported stronger-than-expected results on Thursday as it benefited from shortfalls in global food output.The New York-listed company said that net income available to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of last year rose to $292m, or $1.95 per share, up from a loss of $28m in the same period of 2009.The surge in profitability in the fourth quarter, which easily beat Wall Street’s forecasts, come as agricultural commodities prices surge to levels not seen since the peak of the 2007-08 food crisis amid bad crops, export bans and booming demand. The supply disruption in the global food chain benefit trading houses.Anchoring results was the agribusiness division, which buys, sells, transports and stores grains and oilseeds. The unit benefited as drought devastated grain crops in the Black Sea region of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and buyers turned to global traders. Import demand for corn and soyabeans grew, notably in China, helping to fatten the results.The agribusiness division reported net income in the fourth quarter of $377m, up from $65m in the same period of a year earlier.Alberto Weisser, chief executive, warned that agricultural commodities price volatility and “ concern over high food prices will likely persist” in 2011. “At these times, the services that Bunge provides, which facilitate global trade and improve the efficiency of the food production chain, are more valuable than ever,” he said.Corn prices on Wednesday hit their highest level in 30 months, surging above the $7 a bushel level, after the US Department of Agriculture said that the country’s inventories of the grain would drop to near record lows by the end of the summer.The cost of soyabean, wheat and sugar, among the top commodities traded and processed by Bunge, has also risen sharply over the last six months.Executives expect that Bunge and its main competitors, including ADM, Cargill and France’s Louis Dreyfus, would be the main beneficiaries from the grain and oilseeds shortage. The four trading houses, known in the industry as “ABCD” based on the first letter of each name, dominate global flows of agricultural commodities.Drew Burke, chief financial officer, said last year’s favourable environment for the agricultural trading houses “should continue” in 2011. He added that global trade of food commodities will remain strong, benefiting Bunge’s trading operations.Bunge revenues surged to $12.7bn in the fourth quarter, up from $10.4bn in the same period of 2009. Earnings before interest and tax, or Ebit, rose in the fourth quarter to $381m, up from just $19m in the same period of 2009.
265;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-02-09T23:25:48Z;Rumours swirl of Tate & Lyle approach;Cargill’s plan for a spin-off has led to renewed talk of a bid;"Most often when a company sees a jump in the volume of its shares traded on a particular day, the cause of the surge is something it said. Not so for Tate & Lyle.Just a couple of weeks ago, the food ingredients group experienced its greatest daily trading volume for more than 18 months on a day when it made no market announcement at all.Instead, the increase – and the accompanying 4.9 per cent rise in the share price – came on the back of a plan revealed by US group Cargill to spin off its majority stake in Mosaic, the world’s second-biggest potash producer. This prompted renewed talk that the privately held agribusiness company might bid for Tate & Lyle.“Though anyone who understands the sector knows that there would be huge antitrust issues with an approach from Cargill, however, the rumours clearly touched a nerve,” says Julian Hardwick, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, Tate’s joint house broker.Other analysts agree. “I’m not an excitable M&A person, but even I would say that Tate is a plausible M&A prospect in the food sector,” says Martin Deboo, food analyst at Investec.Fresh interest in Tate as a target derives partly from how the group has changed since Javed Ahmed became chief executive in October 2009.Mr Ahmed’s strategy has been to focus Tate on its specialist ingredients business, to curb debt levels and expand into emerging markets. He also disposed of its EU Sugar Refining business to American Sugar Refining for £211m last June.Although emblematic of the group’s past, the sugar business was seen as a distraction and a lossmaking one at that without the European Union subsidies that were on the way out.“A lot of the share price recovery last year was on the back of the market’s hearing the group’s strategy and believing that if it’s executed well then profitability should improve significantly,” one analyst explains. “He has taken Tate in the right direction.”Conditions in the corn wet milling industry, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of Tate’s profits, have helped too. The US industry is concentrated both geographically, in the Midwest, and corporately.The process, involving softening corn in water and grinding it to produce starches for use in the food, drinks and paper industries, is mainly in the hands of a few big companies – Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Tate, and Corn Products International.“There are long-term consolidating pressures within the sector,” Mr Deboo says. “Productivity is increasing, while demand for high-fructose corn sugar is in long-term decline, as full-fat fizzy drinks lose out to low-fat ones.”In spite of those pressures for consolidation, antitrust concerns make it more likely that a suitor for Tate could come from outside the sector.Charlie Mills, food analyst at Credit Suisse, points to Bunge, a large agricultural trading group. In 2008 before the financial crisis it had sought an all-share takeover of Corn Products International, but the deal foundered when corn prices slumped and Bunge’s share price collapsed. Other analysts cite Bunge’s interest in getting into corn wet milling – through acquisition, so as not to further increase capacity.The $5.8bn (£3.6bn) agreed cash takeover of Danisco by DuPont, the US chemicals group, which was announced in January, has been another spur for renewed talk about Tate, suggesting wider interest in food ingredients companies.Danisco makes additives such as sweeteners and emulsifiers for a range of foods, drinks and animal feeds, as well as enzymes for detergents and industrial processes.But Mr Mills is not convinced that Tate would attract attention in the same way, even though a more elaborate version of fantasy M&A envisages Cargill outbidding DuPont for Danisco, leaving DuPont to buy Tate, with which it has a small joint venture.“DuPont is really interested in Danisco’s science side,” he says. “I would have thought that Tate was less scientifically focused and more directed towards
new product development.”Danisco’s research and development to sales ratio is about 6 per cent, compared with 3.3 per cent for Tate’s speciality food ingredients division.Those who are sceptical that Tate is on the verge of receiving an approach also point to its share price performance: its market value has risen by almost 50 per cent during the past year, making it a more expensive potential purchase.Such factors have not yet been enough to dispel the rumours.As one analyst puts it: “If you think, as many people do, that there will be a pick-up in M&A activity in the food sector, then Tate’s size, focus and reduction in debt mean that it would tick a lot of boxes in terms of a business that could be bid for.”"

This sent shares in the company up 5.5 per cent to $19.22.The industry bellwether posted income of $2.89bn, or 36 cents a share, up from $767m, or 10 cents a share a year earlier. Optimism over the stock was muted slightly, however, as the company gave a 2011 profit forecast that was below analysts’ expectations.Nevertheless, the news helped lift the rest of the pharmaceutical sector. Mylan, one of the world’s largest generic drugs companies, was up 1.6 per cent to $23.54 while Merck gained 2.5 per cent to $34.But the best performing sector on Wall Street was the materials sector, which was lifted by data showing booming manufacturing activity in the US and around the world.The S&P materials index was up 2.8 per cent to 246.02 as the ISM manufacturing composite index jumped to 60.8 in January, up 2.3 from December and ahead of the median forecast of 58. This was its highest level since May 2004.“Today’s report is another very strong signal regarding near-term manufacturing activity. To sustain this strength, much will depend on the consumer,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Among the stocks to gain were Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, which was up 4.9 per cent to $89.64 and Alcoa, an aluminium producer, which added 4.5 per cent to $17.32.This helped the S&P 500 close 1.7 per cent higher to 1,307,59 busting through the technically significant 1,300 mark that the markets struggled with last week.The S&P index lost 1.8 per cent late last week on disappointing GDP figures and concerns that the Suez Canal might be shut down due to the protests in Egypt. But the markets have now completely bounced back from those losses after two consecutive sessions of strong gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 12,040.16, the first time the index closed above 12,000 since June 2008. Last month, the index saw its best January performance since 1997. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent to 2,751.19 in the session.Central to investor confidence in the session was a string of healthy earnings reports. Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, reported that second-quarter earnings had jumped 29 per cent in the second quarter due to high grain prices and strong global demand. This sent shares in the company up 6.2 per cent to $34.70.ADM reported a net profit of $732m, or $1.14 per share, compared with a profit of $567m, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier and way ahead of analysts’ estimates of 78 cents per share.United Parcel Service also saw strong results, reporting a 48 per cent jump in profits due to strong demand over the holiday period. The logistics group also forecast that 2011 will see record earnings, eclipsing the 2007 peak in earnings. The news lifted the shares 4.2 per cent to $74.59.Fedex, another global delivery company, added 2.6 per cent to $92.69.Also helping to liven the S&P index were energy stocks, which saw strong gains as the Brent crude oil price hit $100 a barrel in the previous session for the first time since October 2008.ExxonMobil, the giant of the energy sector, was up another 4 per cent to $83.91 in the session. The company posted earnings on Monday close to the 2008 record, which sent the shares up 2.1 per cent. The stock is up 36 per cent since the start of September.Murphy Oil was up 3.1 per cent to $68.37 while the S&P energy index added 1.9 per cent to 554.13.Lexmark International, which makes laser and inkjet printers, saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 13.2 per cent to $39.45 after predicting strong first-quarter
profits.Baidu saw strong gains after the Chinese internet-search group said revenue had doubled in the fourth quarter and net earnings had increased by 171 per cent, beating analyst and company expectations. The stock was up 9.3 per cent to $118.73. Rival Google rose 1.8 per cent to $611.04"
267;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-02-01T19:53:21Z;Shortfalls spark record ADM grain shipments;;Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based agricultural trading house, shipped record amounts of grain from the US in the latest quarter as the group profited from global shortfalls.The strong second-quarter results came after severe drought in the Black Sea region and disappointing harvests in the US drove the prices of corn, soyabeans and wheat to the highest levels in two years and forced food importers to step up purchases from foreign sources.In the three months to December 31, ADM reported $732m in net profit, or $1.14 diluted earnings per share, up from $567m, or 88 cents per share in the same quarter a year before. In the first quarter, ADM was hit by Russia’s ban on wheat exports.The biggest boost to profit came from ADM’s agricultural services segment, the largest by revenue, which buys, stores, transports and resells commodities such as oilseeds and grains. Its operating profit rose 184 per cent to $426m. The same unit suffered lower profits in the prior quarter.“This quarter generally should reset discussions relative to the total earnings power of ADM’s global network,” said Patricia Woertz, chief executive.ADM, based in the Corn Belt state of Illinois, does business in 60 countries.ADM joins larger rival Cargill in capitalising on the disruptions in global agricultural markets on the back of bad weather and lower supplies.In the US, the largest crop exporter, stocks of corn will by August fall to the lowest level in 15 years, while soyabean stocks will shrink to the smallest amount in nearly half a century, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Demand for grain imports could increase as governments attempt to temper rising food inflation, a factor in the civil unrest that has spread across North Africa and the Middle East. Egypt is the world’s largest wheat importer, although ADM said it did not have boats in port there at present.Vincent Andrews, analyst at Morgan Stanley, called the supply problems in the Black Sea “a material tailwind to results”, but he warned that ADM’s trading business was “lumpy”.ADM shares rose 6.3 per cent to $34.72 at midday in New York.The company’s bioproducts division, which makes ethanol, more than doubled operating profit, which rose $161m to $280m.ADM’s net sales in the quarter were $20.9bn, up 32 per cent from $15.9bn a year earlier.
268;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-01-24T19:06:19Z;Cocoa traders halt Ivory Coast exports;;Cocoa traders are shutting down operations in Ivory Coast, in accordance with calls by the country’s internationally recognised president-elect to put pressure on Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent who has refused to step down.The price of the commodity used to produce chocolate rose as much as 7.5 per cent in London on Monday after companies including Cargill, the world’s largest cocoa buyer, said they had stopped buying cocoa in Ivory Coast, which accounts for 40 per cent of global supplies, worth $4.5bn annually at current prices.Alassane Ouattara, acknowledged by the UN as the victor in the recent disputed presidential election, sent a letter to leading cocoa exporters on Sunday ordering them to stop overseas shipments until February 23.In a statement, Cargill said it had “temporarily suspended” cocoa bean purchases in Ivory Coast. “We are working with others in the industry and with the authorities to clarify and resolve the situation as quickly as possible,” the Minneapolis-based trader said.Other top trading houses such as Archer Daniels Midland and Barry Callebaut said they were monitoring the situation, but senior executives privately acknowledged they were also scaling down operations.The decision by Cargill and other leading traders suggests that western commercial interests have little choice but to respect the international diplomatic consensus and heed Mr Ouattara’s order. The US government on Monday said it supported Mr Ouattara’s call for a cocoa export ban.But executives warned that the industry was carrying a huge risk.Mr Gbagbo’s government has threatened reprisals. “We are between a rock and a hard place,” said the head of a top cocoa trading house. “We need help from someone before our operations and our staff suffer.”After an early spike, cocoa pared its price gains, trading in London up 2.2 per cent to £2,160 a tonne. Eric Sivry, head of agricultural options at Marex Financial, the London-based brokerage, said market participants were buying call options to protect themselves against a further surge.“The cost of buying upside price insurance has shot through the roof,” he said. According to Mr Sivry, the cost of buying protection against a price surge to £2,500 a tonne before March has doubled during the past week.West African governments, led by Nigeria, current chair of the regional trade bloc, are hoping financial and other sanctions will eventually force Mr Gbagbo to cede power so that they do not have to intervene militarily.
269;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-01-24T15:39:12Z;Cocoa jumps as Ivory Coast bans exports;;Cocoa prices jumped as much as 7 per cent on Monday after the internationally recognised president-elect of Ivory Coast imposed a one-month export ban in an attempt to oust Laurent Gbagbo, who the international community said lost elections though he remains president.Ivory Coast is the world’s largest producer of cocoa, accounting for about 40 per cent of the global supply. The commodity is the main source of income for the government of Ivory Coast and any stoppage in exports would cut the funding Mr Gbagbo relies on to pay loyal civil servants and the military.Alassane Ouattara, acknowledged by the UN as the victor in the recent disputed presidential election, sent a letter to leading cocoa exporters on Sunday ordering them to stop overseas shipments for a month from Monday.“I am informing you to stop immediately all the exports of cocoa and coffee,” the letter, signed by Jeannot Ahoussou Kouadio, an ally of Mr Ouattara, says. “All operators who contravene these instructions would be exposed to national and international sanctions,” the letter, dated January 22, adds.“Therefore, the registry of cocoa and coffee exports … is suspended,” the letter says. The Financial Times obtained a copy of the letter, which was received by top cocoa and coffee exporters in Abidjan, the commercial capital of Ivory Coast.Cocoa for immediate delivery jumped to £2,307 a tonne in early London trading, up 7.4 per cent from Friday’s close and the highest in six months. In a volatile session, prices fell back during the afternoon to stand 2.5 per cent higher at £2,202 a tonne. The contract for delivery in May rose 2.7 per cent to £2,170, but brokers noted heavy activity in call options as market particapants sought insurance against higher prices.International trading houses in Ivory Coast were slowing down their operations as a first step to comply with the one-month export ban, several executives said. “Buying is slowing down across the board,” a senior trader told the Financial Times.The world’s largest cocoa traders, including Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Co, Barry Callebaut, Olam and Armajaro, held an emergency conference call on Sunday evening with the Federation of Cocoa Commerce and the European Cocoa Association, the industry bodies, to discuss the situation, according to three people with knowledge of the conversations. In a joint statement, the Federation of Cocoa Commerce and the European Cocoa Association said the trade bodies were “in the process of responding in order to seek further clarification” about the export ban.“The cocoa trade and industry are working closely together to address the challenges that this situation places before us and indeed the whole cocoa supply chain from farmer to consumer,” said the statement from the trade bodies.Barry Callebaut, one of the world’s three top cocoa buyers, said it had “exported most of the necessary beans” it needed for its own processing needs. “We also have sufficient stocks,” spokesman Raphael Wermuth told the FT. He did not answer questions on whether the company has stopped shipments.Cargill, the world’s largest cocoa trader, told the Financial Times it had “temporarily suspended” cocoa bean purchases in Ivory Coast. “We are working with others in the industry and with the authorities to clarify and resolve the situation as quickly as possible,” the company said on a brief statement.The decision to press for a cocoa blockade, comes as the European Union has tightened its own sanctions regime on Ivory Coast. Regional efforts to resolve the post election impasse in Ivory Coast continue to founder, however, leaving the country teetering on the verge of a new civil war.
270;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-01-23T17:11:56Z;Ouattara bans Ivory Coast cocoa exports;Move to starve Gbagbo of crucial funds is likely to drive up prices;"Traders are bracing for a jump in the price of cocoa on Monday, after the internationally recognised president-elect of Ivory Coast imposed a one month export ban in an attempt to oust Laurent Gbagbo, who the international community said lost elections though he remains president.Cocoa is the main source of income for the government of Ivory Coast and any stoppage in exports would cut the funding Mr Gbagbo relies on to pay loyal civil servants and the military. Diplomats believe he needs about $150m a month.Any reduction in supply is likely to push the price of the commodity used in chocolate towards a 33-year high because Ivory Coast accounts for about 40 per cent of global cocoa exports. The cocoa market closed on Friday at a 6-month high of £2,114 per tonne and traders fear prices could jump as high as 10 per cent on opening on Monday.Alassane Ouattara, acknowledged by the UN as the victor in the recent disputed presidential election, sent a letter to leading cocoa exporters on Sunday ordering them to stop overseas shipments from Monday 24 until February 23.“I am informing you to stop immediately all the exports of cocoa and coffee,” the letter, signed by Jeannot Ahoussou Kouadio, an ally of Mr Ouattara, says. “All operators which contravene this instructions would be exposed to national and international sanctions,” the letter, dated January 22, adds.“Therefore, the registry of cocoa and coffee exports … is suspended,” the letter says.

Regional efforts to resolve the post election impasse in Ivory Coast continue to founder, however, leaving the country teetering on the verge of a new civil war.West African states have warned they will use “legitimate force” to oust Laurent Gbagbo, who maintains control of the country’s army, if he continues to refuse to honour the UN-certified results of last November’s polls, which gave victory to Mr Ouattara.However there is little appetite for a military intervention within the region and the threat of one has looked increasingly empty as signs of cracks emerge in Africa’s hitherto united position.Cocoa traders have taken the letter seriously and warned that exports could stop on Monday. “This is very serious; we have few options,” said the head of a leading trading house.In a joint statement to the Financial Times, the Federation of Cocoa Commerce and the European Cocoa Association said the trade bodies were “in the process of responding in order to seek further clarification” about the export ban.“The cocoa trade and industry are working closely together to address the challenges that this situation places before us and indeed the whole cocoa supply chain from farmer to consumer,” it said.The world’s largest cocoa traders, including Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Barry Callebaut, Olam and Armajaro, were planning an emergency conference call on Sunday evening with the Federation of Cocoa Commerce, the industry body, to discuss the situation, said one person with knowledge of the conversations.The FCC and the European Cocoa Association will co-ordinate the traders’ efforts on Monday. They were planning to send a letter to Mr Ouattara’s parallel government asking for some clarifications.The letter imposing the export embargo allows the traders to continue buying cocoa in the local market, but traders warned that, without exports, the domestic warehouses at the port cities of Abidjan and San Pedro will soon fill.They added that traders would be reluctant to buy in the local market without guarantees about exports. Mr Ouattara has formed a parallel government in a hotel in Abidjan under heavy protection from UN troops. The hotel is under a blockade by forces loyal to Mr Gbagbo.Analysts have warned of the risk of a new civil war, repeating the cycle of violence which has split the country north and south since a peace agreement in 2003.

271;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-01-20T19:03:39Z;Cargill is clue to value of Glencore;;"How much is Glencore worth? The question is being hotly debated ahead of the expected flotation of the trading house this year.Fellow trader Cargill’s sale of a stake in fertiliser producer Mosaic is offering a rare insight into the question, even if not a definitive answer to it.The 146-year-old Cargill is still controlled by about 80 members of the Cargill and MacMillan families and has never publicly disclosed its valuation.But the details of its complex deal to spin off its 64 per cent stake in Mosaic have allowed outsiders to calculate the value of the trading house for the first time.In the Cargill-Mosaic operation, two charities founded by the late Margaret A Cargill will swap their combined 17.5 per cent stake in Cargill for 110m shares in Mosaic.At Tuesday’s closing prices in New York, the new stake held by the two charities in Mosaic was worth $9.36bn, putting Cargill’s total valuation at nearly $53.5bn.Cargill’s worth is a largely academic question, as the company has vowed to remain private.But it could serve as a rough yardstick to measure Glencore’s value.The two trading groups have many structural differences, so bankers have warned that any estimates are purely a back-of-the-envelope approximation rather than a proper value analysis of the company.But they acknowledge that the Minneapolis-based agricultural trader is one of Glencore’s closest peers.Glencore says in a bondholder prospectus that it believes “there is no other physical commodity sourcing and marketing company as widely diversified and as globally active” as itself.Nonetheless, it cites Cargill as one of a limited number of peers.It notes, however, that Cargill has a “narrower commodity portfolio” and is “not as widely diversified”.Glencore undoubtedly has more valuable industrial activities, such as large investments in mining, including a coveted 34 per cent stake in Xstrata, the London-based miner.Even so, Cargill provides a relatively good proxy for Glencore. Other possible proxies, such as the few trading houses which have listed their business, are much smaller.As such, the valuations of Singapore-listed Noble Group, which is often mentioned as a smaller replica of Glencore and is worth $11bn, or Archer Daniels Midland, the New York-listed agricultural trader worth $21.7bn, are of little use as yardsticks.The only publicly available valuation to date of Glencore came in December 2009, when it sold a convertible bond, which put the trading house’s worth at $35bn. However, the bond was priced in July 2009 at the peak of the financial crisis, although it was not formally sold until December of that year.Bankers and Glencore executives believe the true value of the trading company is much higher, perhaps above $60bn.Cargill’s fresh data indicate that Glencore’s executives, led by South African Ivan Glasenberg, could achieve a valuation for the trader in line with their expectations.A Cargill valuation of $53.5bn equals a multiple, based on its 12-month trailing earnings excluding Mosaic, of about 18 times.The multiple is in line with some trading house price-to-earnings multiples of between 14 and 23.The same multiple of 18 times applied to Glencore’s expected annual profit in 2010 of about $3.5bn points to a valuation above $60bn.This is within reach of what bankers say Mr Glasenberg expects to achieve in the company’s flotation, expected to take place in April or May.If the Glencore valuation is confirmed, investors in the trader’s convertible bond could see their initial $2.2bn investment nearly doubling in less than a year and a half.Investors include First Reserve, a US-based private equity group; GIC, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund; BlackRock and Fidelity of the US; and Zijin Mining Group of China.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York"
272;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-01-12T18:57:24Z;Food supply woes fatten Cargill earnings;;Cargill benefited from supply disruptions in the global food chain and rising prices to report a tripling in profits in the second quarter of its fiscal year.The world’s largest agricultural commodities trader said net income in the three months to November 30 rose to $1.49bn, up from $489m in the same period a year earlier.First-half earnings more than doubled to $2.37bn, up from $1.01bn in the six months to the end of November 2010.The windfall highlights the big margins in the sector led by Cargill, which rose to prominence in the 2007-08 food crisis, when agricultural commodities prices hit all-time highs.Chris Johnson, credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s in New York, said that droughts in some of the key grain-producing regions and the ensuing trade dislocations were behind the strong results.“To the extent that you’re able to provide grains in parts of the world where they cost more you can get a larger profit margin,” he said.The surge in profits during the first six months of its fiscal year puts Cargill on track to beat its record year in 2008, when it earned $3.95bn.Cargill said that its origination and processing unit, which buys crops such as wheat, corn and soyabean from farmers, processes them and ships them to customers worldwide, was the main profit driver.It said it “developed an early and accurate read” on the weather events earlier in 2010, such as a drought in Russia and Ukraine, “and subsequent shifts in trade flows and supply-and-demand dynamics”.The US Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday that wheat exports in 2010-11 would reach the highest levels since 1991-92 after crop failures in Russia prompted importers, such as Egypt, to seek more food supplies from the US.Cargill’s anticipation of lower crop yields last summer in eastern Europe contrasts with rival Archer Daniels Midland, the second largest trader of agricultural commodities, which reported a drop in profits last quarter and admitted the problems in Russia “came a little quicker” than it had expected.Still, analysts expect that privately-held Cargill and its main competitors, including ADM, Bunge and France’s Louis Dreyfus, would be the main beneficiaries from the grain and oilseeds shortage.The four trading houses, known in the industry as “ABCD” based on the first letter of each name, dominate global flows of agricultural commodities.Cargill said The Mosaic Company, the fertiliser producer in which it has a majority stake, had rebounded strongly after struggling during the financial crisis.Excluding Mosaic earnings, which reports separately, Cargill reported profits of $832m in the second quarter, nearly double last year’s $420m.Revenues in the second quarter rose 16 per cent to $31.1bn, lifting first-half revenues to $58.9bn.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
273;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2011-01-04T20:56:14Z;Cost of UK wheat rises to record high;;The cost of a loaf of bread is set to rise this month, fuelling domestic inflationary pressures, after UK wheat prices hit an all-time high.Industry executives and traders have quietly told wholesale consumers, such as bakers and pasta and biscuit producers, to expect price increases over the next two to three weeks, following a round of hikes in October and November.The warning came as the cost of UK wheat hit a nominal record high in the London market on Tuesday at £203.30 per tonne, up 90 per cent over the past year and above the previous peak of £197.50 a tonne set in September 2007.Wheat prices have risen after a drought triggered a crop failure in the Black Sea region of Russia and Ukraine. Production was also lower than expected elsewhere.The global shortage, coupled with a weak pound, has boosted UK wheat sales overseas, undercutting domestic supplies, traders said.The UK, which usually exports most of its surplus to Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and North Africa, has sold wheat as far away as Thailand and Vietnam this season.Domestic demand is also higher because of increased biofuel production, traders said.Archer Daniel Midlands Company, the US-based commodities trader and the UK’s second-biggest flour miller, said in a report to UK customers that there was a “significant global shortfall” of high-quality wheat, used to bake bread.Traders said the UK had already sold 1.2m-1.3m tonnes of wheat overseas, its entire surplus.Food costs have risen 5.5 per cent over the past 12 months, outpacing the overall inflation rate of 3.3 per cent.
274;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-12-28T21:00:24Z;Bunge rides on volatility of food markets;;Alberto Weisser does not want people thinking his company profits from misfortune.When the worst drought in a century struck the Black Sea region last summer, destroying much of the wheat crop, Russia declared an export ban that sent importers searching for supplies.Bunge, the global agribusiness Mr Weisser heads, met supply needs with grain from the Americas. The company’s profit margins also widened, and its quarterly report says a Bunge unit “benefited from the crop shortages related to the drought in eastern Europe”. Since August, the New York-listed company’s shares have gained almost 30 per cent – more than twice the pace of the S&P 500.But Mr Weisser is clearly not at ease with the idea.“I hate to say that we benefit,” he says in an interview at the company’s White Plains, New York, headquarters.“What we have done is a very deliberate strategy to build a global network of systems to be one of the companies who can provide food when it’s necessary.”The importance of companies like Bunge to global food security is set to increase. The company, founded in Amsterdam in 1818, is one of the world’s leading international suppliers of basic foodstuffs.As incomes of emerging-market households grow, so grows their appetite for proteins, such as meat and milk. This means greater demand for foreign sources of animal feeds – corn, soya beans and wheat.China now relies on imports to meet 80 per cent of its soya bean demand, and this year became a significant importer of corn for the first time in 15 years. India is set to become a net importer of soya bean meal to satisfy a booming poultry industry, according to Rabobank.Bunge, which last year moved 140m tonnes of commodities, ranks with Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus as one of the companies able to connect areas of food surplus and deficit.Crises put these companies to the test. After Russia banned exports, Bunge lost money in the Black Sea, but speedily bought corn in Brazil and the US. “These are moments where you have to move very, very fast,” Mr Weisser says.Profits grew in what is historically a high-volume, low-margin business. Grain prices shot up, making reluctant farmers more relaxed in negotiations with Bunge’s buyers.Meanwhile, major importers, such as those in North Africa, needed the grain. In the quarter ending September 30, Bunge’s operating profit margin widened to 2.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent in the same quarter of 2009.“Margins expand at these moments because markets get nervous,” Mr Weisser says. “It plays to our strength. Because of our global network these dislocations give us opportunities.”Predictions of dwindling corn stocks in the US, the largest exporter, mean jittery markets could continue for some time. Other crops, including grain, oilseed and cotton, will be affected as farmers allocate land based on financial returns. Bad weather, such as a recent dry spell in Argentina, the second-largest corn exporter, could again set off a scramble for supplies.Volatility is a double-edged sword for agribusinesses. The Russian export ban wrong-footed ADM in the latest quarter. Bunge was stung after the fertiliser market collapsed in 2008. It has since sold its Brazilian fertiliser business to Vale, the miner, for net proceeds of $3.5bn.“More dynamic markets make good positioning more profitable and poor positioning for large agribusiness companies more painful,” says David Nelson, strategist at Rabobank.Bunge used some cash from the Vale sale to buy back debt, buttressing its balance sheet. But rampaging grain markets temporarily swallowed up more as the group needed an extra $1.6bn in working capital in the third quarter to buy inventory and maintain price hedges on futures markets.Bunge and other legacy traders also face competition in Asia, where rivals, such as Noble, Olam and Wilmar, are expanding rapidly.The US group has, however, been extending its own global footprint, purchasing Brazilian sugarcane mills and agreeing to buy a sugar mill operator in Australia this year.In the US, a Bunge joint venture is building a grain export terminal on the Pacific coast, far from the nation’s breadbasket, to better connect with Asian markets.“People got a little bit nervous about us using all this money to do crazy acquisitions. That’s not the way we think,” Mr Weisser says.

It is the clearest indication of how rural America is profiting from rising agricultural commodities prices and surging demand in Asia.The revised forecast, published on Tuesday, beats the previous record of $115bn set two years ago during the 2007-08 food crisis and represents a 16.6 per cent increase from last year, the US Department of Agriculture said.The USDA added in a separate report that the country’s net farm income, a measure of profitability, will rise to $81bn, up nearly a third from last year, and the best performance in more than three decades.“The mid-1970s was the last comparable period when U.S. farming enjoyed multiple years of sustained levels of high output and income,” it said.The jump in exports and farm income bodes well for the US agribusiness sector, from tractor manufacturer Deere Co to traders Cargill, Archer Daniel Midlands and Bunge. The US is the world’s top exporter of food commodities, accounting for half the world’s corn, a third of the world’s soyabeans and a up to a fifth of the world’s wheat.Agriculture is one of the few bright spots in the US economy as the Midwest benefits from rising prices for crops such as wheat and corn. But higher prices are worrying importing nations such as China, which has threatened with prices controls to damp inflationary pressures.Tom Vilsack, secretary of agriculture, said the export surge demonstrated that demand for US agricultural commodities was “stronger than ever”. In a statement, he said: “Sales are surging in China, south-east Asia, North America and the Middle East.” Demand for US food production has risen after a string of low crops in Canada and Europe and export restrictions in top producers Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The agriculture department said rising exports will boost the US trade surplus to a record $41bn, up 38 per cent from last year and above the previous record of $36bn in 2008.Mr Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa, said that each $1bn in agricultural exports was supporting around 8,000 jobs in rural America. “Agricultural exports alone in fiscal 2011 are expected to support more than 1 million US jobs,” he said.Unemployment in North Dakota, the US state more heavily reliant on agriculture, is at 3.7 per cent, compared with the country’s national average of nearly 10 per cent. The US exported around $60bn worth of agricultural commodities on average each year from 1995 to 2006.Since then, the value of overseas sales has jumped on the back of higher prices and demand, boosting farm income in the country’s Midwest. But the surge in export earnings could energise critics of farm subsidies, including tax credits to corn-made ethanol, in Congress.Washington is set to pay the country’s farmers $12.4bn in 2010 in subsidies and benefits, down 19 per cent from the 5-year average of 2005-09. Farm subsidies were as high as $24bn in 2005.The US Department of Agriculture said exports of grains, including wheat and corn, will earn the biggest slice of the country’s overseas sales at $35.4bn, followed by oilseeds – a record $23.3bn. The US is the world’s largest cotton exporter and farmers will sell fibre worth a record $8bn after prices hit their highest in 140 years. Canada is the US largest agricultural buyer, followed by China, which is closing the gap.
276;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-11-29T16:12:44Z;Trading houses: Agriculture booms while oil traders suffer;;"To an outsider, the commodities market has just had a great year: higher prices for most raw materials, relatively low volatility and falling inventories.But these very factors have harmed the banks that deal in commodities.The setback is the most serious the sector – one of Wall Street and the City of London’s profit engines – has endured for years.Bankers believe the sector will make just $7bn-$8bn in gross revenues this year, about half the $15bn generated in 2009 and the worst performance since the collapse of Enron in late 2001. Profits will be even lower, as costs have surged.However, the pain will not be spread evenly. The trio that dominates commodities trading will escape relatively unscathed: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital will see profits fall, but they will continue to lead the sector. The rest – including the rapidly expanding JPMorgan – will suffer most, say bankers.Elsewhere, the outlook is mixed. While oil traders have suffered, metals, bulk minerals and agricultural traders have done well; oil traders such as Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura, Mercuria and Gunvor have had a lacklustre year, mostly because of a lack of volatility.BP’s decision to shake up its trading division, the world’s largest oil trader, to counter a drop in profitability and focus on emerging markets is the clearest indication of this.The move, announced in October in an internal e-mail to staff from Paul Reed, head of the division, will trigger job losses. He blamed the tougher operating environment and cited low price volatility because of spare capacity within Opec and the refining industry, and a global glut in gas.“Our size and scale have been a source of competitive advantage, but with it has come some impact on our nimbleness and responsiveness.”The year has been more successful for metals traders. Glencore and Trafigura, for example, have compensated for the poor performance of their oil divisions with strong results in base metals such as copper and nickel, and bulk minerals, including coal and iron ore.Agricultural traders, however, enjoyed the best conditions. Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Louis Dreyfus have been the main beneficiaries from the grain shortage, after a severe drought devastated crops in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, according to industry executives.But others, including the grain division of Glencore, Gavilon, Wilmar, Noble Group and Olam International, have also reaped the benefits of volatile crop prices and trade flows disruptions.David Driscoll, food industry analyst at Citigroup, says that volatile markets are positive for trading operations, “which typically produce above-average results in these situations”. But volatility can also wrong-foot traders – as happened to ADM, whose profits were down 30 per cent in the three months from July to September, at $345m. “The ban on exports in Russia came a little quicker than we expected,” says John Rice, ADM vice-chairman.The outlook for 2011 remains difficult for the banks, but traders – particularly in metals and agriculture – are set for another boom year.But the most important event for next year will not be the profitability of the commodities business, but Glencore’s potential transformation from a private to a public company.In December 2009, the company, issued about $2.3bn in convertible bonds to strategic investors in the US, Singapore and China, valuing it at $35bn. Now, Glencore is mulling its next step, which will probably be an initial public offering in mid-2011 in London.Bankers believe that the company will seek a valuation of $50bn-$60bn. The flotation may also shed light in the inner workings of the opaque world of trading commodities."
277;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-11-29T16:12:44Z;Regulation: Oversight set to become more onerous;;Commodities are poised for the most significant regulatory shake-up in decades.The Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed last July vastly expand the powers of the main US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The law gives the commission authority to police over-the-counter commodities for the first time. While commodity derivatives are a fraction of the broader $583,000bn OTC markets, they are important for energy, utility, transportation and consumer-goods companies hedging exposure to prices.For the CFTC, “it’s the biggest change since the agency was created in 1975”, says Paul Architzel, a lawyer with Alston & Bird and former chief counsel with the CFTC market oversight division. “They are bringing a whole new market under regulation.”In December the commission is expected to propose rules defining swap dealers and so-called “major swap participants” in OTC markets, subjecting them to new capital and collateral requirements.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, estimates that some 200 will be registered as swap dealers and a handful as major participants.The definitions are stoking high anxiety. The Commodity Markets Council, a lobbying group – whose members include Archer Daniels Midland and Louis Dreyfus, the agricultural traders, Kraft, the food maker, and MF Global, the brokers – wants companies that trade only exchange-cleared swaps to be exempt from the swap dealer definition.A coalition of energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell argues its members should fall outside the definition because they are “end users” of swaps.A second initiative set to be unveiled in December is position limits, or caps on traders’ commodity holdings as a way to contain speculation.The limits for energy, metals and agricultural commodities would cover both futures and OTC markets. European officials are beginning to echo the US. France’s finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has called position limits “indispensable”.But the shape of the rules is uncertain. Mr Gensler has suggested that hard limits could be delayed until there are better data on the size of markets and traders’ positions.The CFTC has additionally proposed rules to expand its powers to curb fraud and manipulation, and is discussing rules to ban disruptive trading. In the fiscal year that ended in September its enforcement division opened a record 419 investigations. Since then the division has named David Meister, a former criminal prosecutor, as director.Allison Lurton, former CFTC senior counsel who now works for Covington & Burling, the law firm, says: “It would be wise to think there’s a crackdown coming. How successful it will be when the new jurisdiction space is so vast is unknown.”While the Dodd-Frank reforms focus on derivatives, regulators are also paying closer attention to the largely unregulated physical commodities.In November the International Energy Agency hosted a closed-door workshop involving regulators from the US and UK, commodities exchanges, and oil companies and traders to discuss an overhaul after the International Organization of Securities Commissions, an umbrella body, warned about the lack of information in physical markets.
278;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-11-28T16:00:30Z;Marubeni to take on big five crop traders;Marubeni ships more crops on the back of strong demand in emerging Asia;Marubeni, Japan’s biggest grain trader, aims to take on the world’s largest agricultural commodity traders by shipping more crops on the back of strong demand for food in emerging Asia.Marubeni, presently the sixth-largest grain trader by volume in the world, expects to ship 25m tonnes to customers by 2012 or 2013, up from an expected 20m tonnes this year, chief executive Teruo Asada told the Financial Times.The company has nearly doubled its grain shipments in the past five years.Japanese trading companies, or sogo shosha, have traditionally focused on importing oil and other commodities to their resource-poor home market. But with Japan’s population shrinking and its economy long past its high-growth phase, Marubeni and competitors Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo are now turning abroad.After focusing on oil, metals and minerals for decades, the Japanese trading houses have identified agricultural commodities as a source of growth as concerns about food security spread in Asia on the back of the food shortages in 2007-8.To break into the top five traders would require Marubeni to take market share from the so-called “ABCD” groups – ADM, Bunge and Cargill of the US and France’s Louis Dreyfus – and Swiss-based Glencore.Given booming demand in China and other emerging markets, however, those companies are also likely to expand their businesses as long as supplies can keep pace. Marubeni will also face competition from Asia-focused traders, including Singapore-based Wilmar and Olam International and Noble Group of Hong Kong.Still, Mr Asada said Marubeni was better positioned than its US and European rivals to take advantage of new opportunities in Asia, especially China.“The grain majors are simply supplying corn, soy and other grains to China. But we are using our grain to get into related businesses like milling and animal feed processing. That’s the sort of thing that only a general trading company can do.”Of the 20m tonnes of crops such as wheat, maize and soya beans that Marubeni expects to trade this year, it plans to sell just 6m tonnes in Japan. China is already its biggest market, at 9m tonnes, and the growth it is forecasting over the next three years will come entirely from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, according to Mr Asada.The house has gained ground against rivals by securing a deal with China Grain Corporation, a state-owned firm in charge of managing the Chinese government’s food reserves.Outside the grain business, Marubeni last month agreed to buy four deepwater oil and gasfields in the Gulf of Mexico for $650m from BP. The UK oil group has been cutting its holdings in the Gulf in the wake of the Macondo oil spill in April.In contrast to the doomed Macondo prospect – 10 per cent of which is owned by another Japanese trading group, Mitsui – Mr Asada said the four concessions bought by Marubeni were “pure production concessions”, where no trial drilling was planned. “It’s a totally different kind of project, with totally different risks.”The Macondo spill, he said, had delivered a “lesson” to Japanese trading companies about the risks involved in deep-sea exploration. “That wasn’t what we call development, it was prospecting. So one issue is whether a trading company should have been involved at all, even as a minority investor.”

281;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-11-09T20:40:19Z;Wall Street bets on commodities trader;;"George Soros and other Wall Street investors are backing a US commodity merchant that is clawing its way into the ranks of the industry’s top trading houses.The investors – not usually associated with the mundane work of moving and storing corn, fertiliser and crude oil – are betting a more crowded, richer planet will rely more on international trade to meet localised food and energy needs.Gavilon, as the merchant is known, is this month expected to complete the purchase of grain handler DeBruce in a deal that will raise its grain storage capacity to 300m bushels, surpassing the US operations of Bunge, a New York-listed rival, and third only to Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill.The expansion comes amid forecasts of a tightening balance of supply and demand. The US Department of Agriculture on Tuesday said global wheat and corn stocks were forecast to “drop significantly” everywhere but China, “wiping out nearly all the stocks build-up of the past several years”. World oil consumption is again on the upswing after two years of decline.“It’s just a huge opportunity,” Greg Heckman, chief executive, told the Financial Times in a rare interview. “If you look at the thesis among our investors, what they saw in Gavilon was a commodity management platform that is positioned to help the global producers and consumers solve these challenges.”Ospraie, a New York commodity fund manager; General Atlantic, a private-equity firm; and Soros Fund Management acquired the former trading unit of ConAgra Foods for $2.8bn. They completed the deal in June 2008 as commodity indices were breaking records and renamed the company Gavilon, derived from the Spanish for hawk.Gavilon trades a wide range of commodities, including corn, soyabeans, wheat, potash, crude oil, natural gas and ethanol.Like some of its investors, Gavilon is also a proprietary trader. Mr Heckman said such trading was a “smaller part” of the business that helped customers manage risks and let Gavilon “capitalise on some of our proprietary information”. Commodity trading houses have drawn increased attention from policymakers and investors following the price spikes and supply uncertainties of the 2007-08 global food crisis. Their importance is set to grow. In China, food inflation concerns could make the country more reliant on the global food market, the USDA reported.“We like businesses that have global aspirations and are growing due to very strong macro trends. Gavilon checks the box in both areas,” said Adrianna Ma, a General Atlantic managing director who sits on the board.Gavilon, based in Omaha, Nebraska, the heart of the world’s surplus grain supply, has so far focused on its home market, building the infrastructure to trade corn, soyabeans and wheat.It is also expanding rapidly in energy, building what amounts to nearly 10 per cent of the crude storage capacity at a key Oklahoma pipeline hub.“There’s going to continue to be volume growth and volatility,” Mr Heckman said. “Producers and processors of these commodities need help from someone that has a large network like Gavilon to efficiently and effectively connect the areas of supply and demand.”The global side of the equation is in the early stages, however. The company has since 2008 established offices in eight cities including Houston, Lima, Moscow, Perth and Johannesburg as it aims for a global commodity network.The US, Canada, Latin America, Russia and Australia are the main sources of agricultural commodities trade, while demand growth is centred in the emerging countries of Asia, the Middle East and north Africa.John Rogers, of Moody’s Investors Service, said: “They need to become an international player in order to maintain relevance.”The company’s ambitions have also hit snags. This year a plan to buy the global trading operations of AWB, the former Australian Wheat Board, and create a joint venture with AWB in Australia fell apart. Agrium, the Canadian fertiliser company, is now on track to purchase AWB.Gavilon’s size could be a disadvantage in markets where scale and geographical versatility are crucial. The company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the year to June were about $200m, according to a person familiar with results. By contrast, net profit of Cargill, the largest agricultural commodities trader, was $2.6bn in the year to May 31."
282;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Tea Party grabs a seat at the Washington table;;The Tea Party grabbed the limelight and a seat at the table in Washington DC on Tuesday night, when some of the movement’s favoured candidates triumphed in midterm elections amid broader Republican gains.Rand Paul, one of the movement’s most prominent supporters, declared a “Tea Party tidal wave” as he won the open Senate seat for Kentucky. In another striking result, Marco Rubio of Florida triumphed with more than 50 per cent of the vote in his Senate race, easily seeing off Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor.According to an Associated Press exit poll, about four out of 10 voters said they backed the movement, which calls for the drastic reductions for the powers of the US federal government and has been championed by Sarah Palin, former Republican vice presidential nominee.But other candidates fared less well than the trend – including Christine O’Donnell, who lost the Senate race for Delaware amid Democratic claims she was too offbeat and rightwing.Harry Reid triumphed over Sharron Angle in Nevada’s Senate race in one of the closest campaigns of the season.Analysts suggested that while the enthusiasm generated by Tea Party supporters had helped the Republicans win control of the House of Representatives, it may have limited their gains in the Senate.The movement’s political clout is also yet to be decided, with mixed signals over whether there will be a separate Tea Party bloc in Congress.Dick Armey, the Tea Party activist and chairman of FreedomWorks, which backed candidates such as Mr Rubio, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the grassroots conservative movement would have a profound impact not only on the presidential contest in 2012, but in the election that followed.While Mr Armey insisted that the party would unify around its new leadership, including soon-to-be-named speaker, John Boehner, he warned that Republican lawmakers who strayed from the core tenants of the party – “liberty” and fiscal discipline – would face the wrath of Tea Party activists in the next round of elections.“[If] you start spending money like a drunken sailor, or you get careless with our liberty, or you think a new government bail-out is a good idea, understand: we will find your opponent in your next primary and we will work for that opponent,” he said. “Now you take the measure of what you think we can do. If you are not afraid of us, then go be reckless all you want.”At FreedomWorks headquarters in Washington, the mood was ebullient on Election Night. Mostly young activists gathered around kegs of beer, cupcakes and pretzels covered in red, white and blue sprinkles, cheered as results came streaming in over Fox News.Mr Boehner’s staff also told CNN that the presumptive speaker, a more traditional Republican, had reassured a Tea Party group that “I will never let you down”.Mr Paul said he favoured setting up a Tea Party caucus in the Senate, which would be likely to push for big cuts in spending. But Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, another conservative Republican figure who has very active in the Tea Party movement, argued that it was more likely that the existing conservative caucus would be expanded.“One mistake we’re making in this election is to suggest …it’s all about the official Tea Party movement,” he argued, saying that many conservative voters “don’t consider themselves part of the Tea Party movement”.At stake is whether the Tea Party becomes a powerful force on Capitol Hill in its own right, perhaps in conflict with established conservatives, or instead plays a more supporting role.But Mr Armey played down any suggestion of internecine conflict between conservatives in the Tea Party movement and more traditional Republicans.“The majority of the majority sets the agenda,” he said. “Republicans are by nature very gentle, forgiving and accepting people so while these differences take place, you won’t see brutally intemperate treatment of one another like you saw with Democrats.”Corporate America has much to celebrate and – perhaps – some cause to fear with the rise of some Tea Party candidates. Mr Armey and other prominent Tea Party activists are staunch supporters of free enterprise and low taxes. But Mr Armey is also a tough critic of corporate subsidies, especially for the agricultural industry.He singled out Archer Daniels Midland, the giant agriculture conglomerate, which he said needed to learn to compete instead of accepting “government handouts …If you are Archer Daniels Midland, you ought to be big enough to stand on your own hoof. If you can’t, then get out of business.”
283;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM fails to exploit wheat ban;;Archer Daniels Midland’s profit fell by nearly a third in the latest quarter after it was wrong-footed by the Russian wheat crisis last summer.The Illinois-based agribusiness company said Russia’s shutdown of grain shipments after the worst drought in a century tripped up its trading operations.Russia announced the export ban in early August, then extended it to mid-2011. “The intense heat and drought situation and the ban on exports in Russia just came a little quicker than what we expected,” said John Rice, ADM vice-chairman.ADM reported net profit of $345m, or 54 cents per share, in the three months from July to September, down 30 per cent year-on-year from $496m, or 77 cents per share. Sales, heavily influenced by commodity prices, rose 13 per cent to $16.8bn.ADM’s results contrasted with rivals Bunge and Cargill, which last month said tighter grain conditions and associated price swings improved profits.The US Department of Agriculture sees domestic corn stocks dropping to 900m bushels, the lowest in 14 years. These conditions typically benefit traders with the resources to tap supply.Citigroup, which called the results “quite a negative surprise”, said ADM “failed to capitalise on the excellent opportunities that presented themselves this quarter due to global disruptions in wheat supplies, an area ADM typically excels at”.ADM fell 6.8 per cent to $31.13 a share in late New York trade.The disappointing results underscore the risks of grain trading, a high-volume business with razor-thin profit margins. At the unit which buys, stores, transports and resells wheat, corn, soyabeans and other foodstuffs, operating profit fell 25 per cent to $132m in the quarter.ADM’s cocoa business, which include plants with 3,000 tonnes in daily processing capacity and shipping nodes in Brazil, Indonesia and the Ivory Coast, also saw poorer results as ADM struggled with a “roller-coaster” of price volatility, said Steven Mills, senior executive vice-president. ADM’s 23 per cent stake in Gruma, the Mexican tortilla maker, also weighed on profits.The results were partly offset by operations at its corn mills, which turn the US’s largest crop into products from sweeteners to ethanol. Operating profit here rose 81 per cent to $341m.ADM is the second-largest refiner of corn ethanol, the motor fuel additive that US environmental regulators last month said could be blended more liberally into petrol tanks.A 45-cent per gallon tax credit for ethanol blenders expires at the end of the year. Pat Woertz, chief executive, said the company is working to “educate members of Congress” about the importance of the subsidy.
284;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Bunge profits swollen by grain price volatility;;Bunge, one of the world’s largest agricultural traders, has said the shortfalls fuelling grain price rises will persist into next year as global food demand continues to expand.A precarious balance of food supply and demand propelled quarterly profits at the New York company. Excluding one-off charges, profits rose 40 per cent year on year to $2.26 per share in the quarter ended September 30, beating estimates.Anchoring results was the agribusiness division, which buys, sells, transports and stores grains and oilseeds. The unit benefited as drought devastated grain crops near the Black Sea, and buyers turned to global traders. Import demand for corn and soyabeans grew, notably in China.Alberto Weisser, chief executive, echoed many analysts in saying the slim cushion between supply and demand, and associated price volatility, was likely to continue.“We feel that this trend will go significantly into next year,” he said. “There will be tightness in the supply, probably in the whole of next year.”Bunge, along with Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Louis Dreyfus, is among a handful of grain traders with the international reach to capitalise on localised crop deficits. Bunge is among the top three grain exporters in the Black Sea region, but also has millions of bushels of grain storage capacity in the US, Brazil and elsewhere.“We expect very good margins and volumes in our grain business as we see products moving from the western hemisphere, particularly into Europe due to the crop issues there,” said Drew Burke, interim chief financial officer.The agribusiness unit moved 28.5m tonnes in the quarter, up 3 per cent.Increasing anxiety about supplies has sent grain prices surging. Corn has risen 41 per cent, soyabeans 19 per cent and wheat 33 per cent in 2010. “We are expecting price volatility to stay,” Mr Weisser said.Bunge’s operating profit margin expanded to 2.9 per cent from 1.8 in the same quarter of 2009. This month Cargill cited price when it reported a 68 per cent rise in quarterly profit.Rising prices increased demands on working capital as the company paid farmers more and posted more collateral to meet margin calls in the futures market, resulting in negative operating cash flow.Including the charges, net profit fell 9 per cent to $212m, or $1.36 per share, from $232m in the same period last year. Bunged close down 4.5 per cent to $58.95 in New York.
285;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-10-12T22:08:32Z;Cargill reaps bumper harvest from grain price;Profits soar at world’s largest agricultural commodities trader;Big spikes in grain prices have led to soaring profits at Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader.The Minnesota-based company’s net profit rose 68 per cent to $883m in the first quarter ended August 31, from $525m a year earlier. Cargill’s trading and processing segment, the historic heart of the 145-year-old company, was the fastest-growing contributor to earnings.The gains came as food demand rebounded after the global financial slowdown and fears of a shortfall sent grain prices toward the highest levels since the world food crisis of 2007-2008. During the quarter, wheat jumped 43 per cent, sugar rose 39 per cent, corn moved up 20 per cent and cotton gained 11 per cent.“Our results were led by the food ingredients and the commodity trading and processing segments, both of which experienced resurgence in volatility across agricultural commodity markets,” Greg Page, chief executive, said in a statement.Privately-held Cargill and its main competitors, including Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland, New York-based Bunge and France’s Louis Dreyfus, dominate global trading of agricultural commodities. The four trading houses, known because of their initials as the industry’s “ABCD”, are set to profit from crop shortages, executives say.Fertiliser and seed companies, including DuPont and Monsanto, and manufacturers of farm equipment, such as Deere, would also profit. Cargill also owns a 64 per cent stake in Mosaic, the fertiliser company whose earnings in the same quarter nearly tripled from a year ago to $297.7m.Cargill said changes in trade flows created opportunities for the group that sources and trades grains, oilseeds and other commodities between continents, without specifying which flows changed. In the reporting quarter, the worst heatwave and drought in more than a century devastated grain crops in Russia, leading to export restrictions on grains. India extended a ban on cotton exports, temporarily locking up Cargill’s inventories there, but generating demand for US cotton.The heightened volatility “put Cargill’s global breadth, trading and risk management skills more acutely into play as we worked with customers to help them manage their price risk and raw material needs”, said Mr Page.Choppy energy markets cut earnings in the company’s risk management and financial segment.Excluding its Mosaic stake, Cargill earned $693m in the quarter, 51 per cent up on a year ago. Revenue rose 6 per cent to $27.8bn.
286;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-10-11T21:09:09Z;US stocks unchanged amid low volumes;;US stocks were little changed, with gains in telecommunications companies held back by industrial and financial groups.Dividend-paying telecoms continued to see gains as, by midday, Verizon added 0.6 per cent, AT&T was 0.3 per cent higher and Frontier Communications added 2.5 per cent. The sector is the best-performing over the past six months, up 12 per cent.“It seems very 1950s-ish today, but with all the instability in the economy, and low rates, people are looking once again for some yield and some stability,” said Kenneth Polcari, a New York Stock Exchange trader and managing director at ICAP.The New York Times Company surged 7.1 per cent to $8.59 a share. The newspaper group is expected to post rebounding advertising sales in its third quarter earnings.Traders said that the group’s sharp move the result of its price crossing 50-day moving average, triggering large buy orders on the stock.Natural gas group Chesapeake rose 1.1 per cent to $23.30 after Cnooc, the Chinese energy producer, agreed to buy a one-third stake in Chesapeake’s Eagle Ford gas shale for $1.1bn. It would be the largest purchase of a US energy asset by a Chinese company.By close, the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,165.04, as was the Nasdaq Composite index at 2,402.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held firm at 11,008.59.Volumes were low, however, as other US markets and many trading floors were closed for the Columbus day holiday.JPMorgan Chase added 1.1 per cent to $39.73 ahead of its earnings announcement on Wednesday.“We expect bank stocks can outperform in the near term as we see our banks either meeting or exceeding Q3 estimates,” said analysts at Citigroup, calling JPMorgan “a potential positive catalyst for the group” with strong core investment banking revenues.Intel, which reports earnings on Tuesday, added 0.2 per cent to $19.56 a share, as analysts expect it to top its previous quarter’s revenues. Google, reporting on Thursday, added 0.5 per cent to $538.84 a share. It is expected to top second quarter earnings.“The S&P 500 continues to outgrow the US economy, led by foreign exposure,” said David Bianco, chief equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.A rise in the dollar after hit industrial groups, who benefit from a weaker greenback that makes their products attractive to emerging markets.Du Pont fell 1.2 per cent to $46.09 and 3M fell 1.1 per cent to $88.25. GE dropped 0.9 per cent to $16.96.Airgas rose after it said that it will appeal a court ruling allowing insurgent board members, who are trying to engineer a $5.5bn takeover by its industrial gas rival Air Products, to bring forward its 2011 annual meeting to January.Shares added 2.8 per cent to $69.78 as expectations of the merger rose.Another surge in corn and grain prices lifted Monsanto, which sells seeds, adding 0.7 per cent to $51.23 a share. The shares have risen nearly 10 per cent over the past five sessions as shortages and demand for hard assets by investors drive up feedstock prices.Archer Daniels Midland, however, which buys grains to process into other products, saw shares drop 0.8 per cent to $32.59. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also downgraded it from “buy” to “hold”.Clothing retailer JC Penney added 1.9 per cent to $33.12. Vornado, the commercial real estate investment group, revealed that it had bought a 9.9 per cent stake in the retailer. Last week, hedge fund Pershing Square said it had bought 17 per cent of the company.Shares of gambling groups Las Vegas Sands, up 3.5 per cent to $38.62, and Wynn Resorts, up 8.5 per cent to $101.78, rose on hopes for their expansions in the Macau resort.We have “expectations of a strong sequential growth story in Singapore and the positive long-term trajectory of Macau”, said analysts at Morgan Stanley.
287;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Food traders share global ambitions;;Agricultural commodities traders used to be content to intermediate between farmers and merchants, a business of large flows but razor thin margins. Today, they aim to reach from the farm to the fork, moving into more lucrative processing.The merger talks between Louis Dreyfus, a Paris-based, family-owned agricultural trading house founded in 1851, and its much younger rival Singapore-based Olam point to this transformation of the raw materials industry.Both want to re-invent themselves, building processing facilities and farming their own arable land. For that, they need much more long-term capital, which can be financed mostly through short-term credit facilities.“Both companies are in a transformative phase,” says an industry executive, who is not involved in the merger talks, but deals with both trading houses. “They want to move away from the high flow, low margin trading business and invest into new assets. They need money, so they need to explore new ways,” he adds.The shift comes as emerging markets – particularly Asia and the Middle East – demand more food and, crucially, a varied diet, richer in meat and dairy, and away from traditional staples such as rice and vegetables.Meanwhile, consumption in developed countries is growing more slowly, in line with population and general economic activity. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority found in a recent study that a 10 per cent increase in household spending triggered an 11.5 per cent jump in meat spending in China, but only a 1.1 per cent increase in the US.As such, agriculture and the big food trading houses have been drawing increased attention from policymakers following the price spikes and supply uncertainties of the 2007-08 global food crisis, the first in more than 30 years.Food security, long a topic merely for agriculture ministers, is hotly debated among leaders of the Group of Eight industrialised countries. The attention has increased recently, as the cost of crops from cotton to wheat spiked, triggering on Friday an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation.Amid such profound changes, the company that would result from a merger of Louis Dreyfus and Olam would dominate in several areas, particularly cotton – where it would be by far the largest trader and could face regulatory problems because of its size – rice, coffee, sugar and orange juice. It would be big in wheat and corn, and enjoy a top five position in oilseeds.Geographically, Louis Dreyfus is strongest in Latin America and Europe, while Olam’s strengths are in Africa and Asia. The combined group would have a significant presence in the key agricultural commodity origination regions of Latin America and Africa and in Asia, which is developing as the significant area of demand growth.“This would be a pure play agricultural commodity group that would have an unparalleled opportunity to emerge as a leading global player in the industry,” says a person with knowledge of the talks.A merger would give the combined group substantial businesses in 25 agricultural commodities, with upstream production in 11 when Louis Dreyfus’s citrus and sugar cane operations are added to Olam’s businesses in plantations, timber, dairy farming, rice, rubber and nuts. Bankers believe a combined group could be worth as much as $18bn, making Louis Dreyfus-Olam the third-largest agricultural trader, after Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland.The deal would be the largest in the agricultural commodities trading business since Cargill’s acquisition of the main business of Continental Grain Company in 1998 and the fire sale of Andre & Cie, the Swiss-based trader that collapsed in 2001.
288;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-09-24T18:23:37Z;Louis Dreyfus and Olam in merger talks;;Louis Dreyfus, the 159-year-old f amily-owned commodities trading house, has highlighted the shift in global food demand towards Asia by entering merger talks with Singapore-based rival Olam International to create the world’s third largest agricultural trader.Food consumption in Asia is booming as the emerging middle class of China, India and other regional nations demand a bigger and richer diet, shifting away from rice and other traditional staples into meat, dairy products and processed food.News of the talks surfaced as the Louis-Dreyfus family comes under increasing pressure from the management of the trading house to find a way to raise fresh capital to fund its ambitions to expand the company.Both Olam and Louis Dreyfus need funds to reshape their businesses amid the commodity price boom to diversify their roles from pure intermediaries into direct producers and processors.Louis Dreyfus is considering a change of ownership and exploring options, including an initial public offering or the sale of a stake to long-term investors.But people familiar with the talks said Louis Dreyfus Commodities’ senior management would prefer a full merger with Olam. What remains unclear is whether the family, particularly Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who owns a controlling stake of more than 50 per cent, would support the move.“While there have been talks on a merger it is not clear whether the family would be willing to complete the transaction,” said one person close to the talks. “The family will have to decide whether they are willing to give up private ownership.”Olam said the two companies were discussing“a possible business collaboration which may take the form of, among others, a merger.”The combination would create a company with an estimated market value of $15bn-$18bn (€11bn-€13.4bn) and it would be the biggest trader in commodities including cotton, rice, coffee, and a formidable presence in cocoa, wheat, corn and oilseeds. If the merger went ahead, it would create the third largest trader after Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland.Olam, which has a market capitalisation of about $5bn, said the discussions were “still preliminary” and warned that the talks could collapse without a deal. Its shares jumped more than 6 per cent to S$3.15, their highest in three years. Rival executives value Louis Dreyfus Commodities at $8bn-$11bn.The merger talks come as crop prices rise worldwide, triggering fears of a repetition of the 2007-08 global food crisis, which saw record prices for agricultural commodities and food riots in emerging countries.The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation held an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss rising prices.
289;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-09-24T15:27:59Z;Company profile: Singapore’s Olam;;Olam International has grown in just over 20 years from a tiny startup exporting cashews from Nigeria to one of the world’s biggest agricultural commodity traders.Set up in 1989 by Sunny Verghese, then working for the privately-owned Indian conglomerate Kewalram Chanrai, the group has expanded into more than 60 countries, with a turnover last year of S$8.6bn and net profit of S$272m.Olam – the name means “transcending boundaries” in Hebrew – still trades in cashews, its original commodity where it has grown to be the world’s largest trader – and nowadays it is involved in almonds, spices, sesame, cocoa, coffee, rice, cotton, teak, palm oil and rubber. In total, it operates in 60 countries delivering 20 agricultural commodities to about 10,500 customers worldwide.The company forms part of an emerging group of rapidly growing commodities traders headquartered in Asia and Africa. Its regional rivals are Singapore-based Wilmar, Asia’s largest agribusiness group, and Hong Kong-based Noble Group, which trades agricultural commodities, oil base metals and minerals.The trio of Olam, Wilmar and Noble is challenging the leadership in agriculture of Louis Dreyfus, Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland, New York-based Bunge and Minneapolis-based Cargill. The four, known because of their initials as the industry’s “ABCD”, dominate global flows of agricultural raw materials.Olam remains associated with Kewalram Chanrai, the largest shareholder with 23 per cent, followed by management with 17 per cent. Temasek, the Singapore state investment agency, owns another 14 per cent plus convertible bonds worth a further 1.5 per cent following an equity injection last year of S$437.5m.The company remains under the leadership of the softly-spoken Mr Verghese, one of a number of prominent Indian business people in Singapore. His hands-on management style has propelled the group to a market capitalisation of S$5.96bn.Rival executives say that Mr Verghese has focused not only on building the group in emerging countries. He has also recruited a new cadre of traders from developing countries like Vietnam or India, further cementing the trading house’s penetration in Asia and Africa.The group’s core business is as a global supply chain manager of agricultural commodities, from farmyard to the factory gate. Many products are collected from small farmers in remote areas by seasoned company staffers who spend years in a particular region.The company claims this gives it a competitive advantage over rivals that source their products from a handful of collection points, as does its policy of processing commodities as close as possible to their source, helping to cut shipping costs. The company has expanded aggressively into upstream activities – plantations, farming, forest concessions and dairy production – and downstream businesses such as processing, manufacturing and distributing packaged food.
290;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-09-23T19:28:45Z;Louis Dreyfus considers options for reinvention;;When Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, the 18-year-old son of a farmer from Alsace, started in 1851 buying wheat from local farmers and selling it in a market town, he could not have dreamt how his grain business would grow over the next 150 years.Today, Louis Dreyfus Commodities, still controlled by descendants of Léopold, is one of the world’s largest agricultural commodities trading houses, rivalling competitors such as Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland, New York-based Bunge and Minneapolis-based Cargill. The four, known because of their initials as the industry’s “ABCD”, dominate global flows of agricultural raw materials.The French family-owned group is considering a radical change of ownership, exploring options, including an initial public offering or the sale of a stake to long-term investors. The talks are at a very early stage and the family members may decide against a sale, however.The company made $34bn in revenues last year, about double its sales in 2006. Rival executives, using a rule of thumb of the ratio of revenues to profits and to valuation, believe that Louis Dreyfus Commodities could be worth about $10bn-$11bn, more than the $8bn market capitalisation of Bunge.The review comes as Louis Dreyfus Commodities is trying to reinvent itself, moving beyond its old role as a pure trader, where sales are large but profits razor-thin, to invest in more profitable, but capital-intensive, production assets. In the clearest sign of this move, which mirrors the route followed by other traders, it bought last year a 60 per cent stake in Santelisa Vale, one of Brazil’s largest sugar and ethanol producers, for $460m.The deal made the French group, already a significant sugar trader, the world’s second largest sugar cane processor and renewable energy group in the world.“They [Louis Dreyfus] rely more on trading and less on assets than other trading houses,” says an executive from a rival commodities trader, referring to the need of the French family owned group to raise capital to invest more in assets.The company, led since 2005 by Serge Schoen, says it is looking to invest in production assets to “support the growth in demand for agricultural products”. It also says it is seeking to “acquire logistics assets as a strategic tool for sales”. Its priority is to consolidate in the Americas, but it also wants to “materialise” its Asian ambition and “seize growth opportunities in the Middle East and Africa”.At the moment, the company’s fixed assets are worth about $5.5bn.The expansion, Louis Dreyfus Commodities says, is based on “three pillars” of growth: building its “fixed asset base”, expanding its market share, and acting as a “consolidator” of the industry, sometimes attracting “third-party capital” to buy assets. However, Louis Dreyfus Commodities also believes its trading business will continue to expand. Over time, it says that “trade in agricultural products will increase, as the imbalance between regions of supply and regions of demand is expected to widen”.In the past, the company has been able to fund its expansion through loans and its free cash flow, such as during the rapid expansion of the 1970s-80s, when it moved into cotton, sugar, citrus and coffee under the leadership of Gérard Louis-Dreyfus. But the new push comes as asset valuations are much higher and rival executives believe that the company would be unable to grow as much as its management’s ambitions without fresh capital.Hence the need to explore alternatives.The final decision would depend on the fractious relationship between Jacques Veyrat, the chairman of the umbrella group, and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who controls, together with her three children, the majority of the group in a trust established for 99 years. Some observers believe the family could choose to scale down the expansion plans to continue as a privately-held business. In a rare press interview in May, Ms Louis-Dreyfus said her main ambition was to ensure the company remained in family hands.Additional reporting by Scheherazade Daneshkhu
291;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-09-17T17:43:42Z;Corn refiners left with bitter taste over sugar;;The customer, yet again, has proven to be right. This week’s petition by the Corn Refiners Association’s to change the name of its pride and joy – high fructose corn syrup – to “corn sugar” represents a capitulation by one of the most powerful lobbies in the US to the realities of the marketplace.In the past decade consumers in the US have come to associate high fructose corn syrup with an epidemic of obesity in the country, despite scientific evidence showing no meaningful difference between Hfcs, as it is known, and refined sugar.For the past two years, the refiners’ association – led by Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and other large refiners – has spent millions of dollars running ads attempting to persuade consumers that Hfcs is as harmless as sugar.But those efforts did little to blunt the negative perception of their signature product. According to Harry Balzer, a consultant with NPD Research, some 40 per cent of US adults expressed concern about the presence of high fructose corn syrup in the food supply in 2004. By 2008, that number had grown to 56 per cent. “There’s a lot of people who are aware and concerned,” says Mr Balzer.Since 2008, the number of US adults expressing concern about Hfcs has dropped to 54 per cent, he says, but that still represents more than half the adult population and might reflect the fact that people are doing something about the perceived problem by choosing to buy a growing number of foods that boast they contain no Hfcs.The number of branded food products that now contain sugar instead of Hfcs has grown in recent years. They include ketchup from Hunt’s and Heinz, Ocean Spray cranberry sauces and juices, limited editions of Pepsi Cola and Mountain Dew, Wheat Thins crackers, Capri Sun fruit juice, Gatorade, Heritage Dr Pepper and Snapple.The petition filed by the refiners’ association with the US Food and Drug Association to allow the name change to “corn sugar” – a process that could take up to two years – is no panacea, say marketing consultants.“These companies are trying to reposition products and brands and mask negative images and connotation,” says Peter Morrissey, who runs a public relations firm in Boston. “In most cases they are not making health or nutritional improvements.“Essentially, these are the same products with the same drawbacks – just with new names. Rather than addressing the negative issue they try to fool the customer, in my opinion not a good idea or good business ethics.”
292;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-08-17T17:49:57Z;Agricultural traders positioned to reap gains;;As US farmers reap the benefits from failing crops around the world, the traders that handle the country’s grain exports will cash in too.The windfall highlights the profitability of a multibillion sector led by Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader, which rose to prominence during the 2007-2008 food crisis, when agricultural commodities prices hit all-time highs.“The US is the world’s island of wheat supply,” says Dan Basse, president of AgResource, a Chicago-based consultancy, who forecast that traders would ship overseas about 5bn bushels of corn, soyabeans and wheat on the year to June 2011, up more than 15 per cent from 4.3bn bushels in the 2009-2010 season.“The increase in exports bodes very well for US grain traders,” he says, echoing a view widely held in the industry.Privately held Cargill and its main competitors, including Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland, New York-based Bunge and France’s Louis Dreyfus, would be the main beneficiaries from the grain shortage after a severe drought devastated crops in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, according to consultants and industry executives.The four trading houses, known because of their initials as the industry’s “ABCD”, dominate global flows of agricultural commodities. But others, including Gavilon, the commodities trader, which counts among its shareholders Soros Fund Management, and Mitsubishi, the Japanese trading house with a large presence in US farming, would also benefit, consultants say.David Driscoll, a food industry analyst at Citigroup in New York, says that volatile commodity markets are positive for trading operations, “which typically produce above average results in these situations”. For example, during the 2007-08 food crisis, ADM’s agricultural services – the company’s trading operation – made profits of $500m-$400m each quarter, higher than the $178m it made the last quarter.Shares in ADM have surged 22 per cent since early June, when the Russia crisis started to brew. Bunge has been held, however, by bad results over the past few quarters and analysts’ doubts about the company’s strategy.The main driver of the surge in profitability next year would not be the rise in prices – traders usually hedge their positions, although they can also profit from big directional movements in prices – but rather the collapse of normal trade routes for grains.For example, Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, usually buys most of its wheat from Russia and Europe. But now it is hoarding supplies from the US, and Cairo is even considering buying from Argentina. Egypt yesterday said it bought for the first time since September wheat from the US, placing an order through Cargill for 50,000 tonnes of the cereal.As importers seek supplies from the US, the country’s export outlook, and the potential business for the traders, has improved significantly. The US Department of Agriculture forecast US farmers would sell overseas in 2010-11 the second highest amount of corn, wheat and soyabean in three decades. Only during the 2007-08 food crisis did farmers ship more grains and oilseeds overseas.Christina McGlone, agribusiness analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, says that with the breakdown of normal trading relationships after Russia’s grain export ban, “global trading and merchandising businesses will prosper as more market players rely on their expertise to deliver product efficiently from different trading partners”.The traders’ expertise is already in demand, executives say. David MacLennan, chief financial officer at Cargill, says the company was fielding increased calls from customers asking for Cargill’s insight on supply and demand for agricultural commodities after the Russia crisis triggered a 50 per cent rally in wheat prices.“People are looking for information,” he told the Financial Times. “This is one of the most significant price movements in agricultural markets we have seen in a while.”He added, echoing other executives, that the traders would use their expertise to provide customers with solutions on new supply routes. But he warned that the dislocation in trade and prices opened both opportunities and risk for the traders.Besides, industry executives and consultants caution that some of the profits from shipping more US crops would be offset by losses at the Black Sea operations after Russia imposed a ban on overseas sales. Bunge and Cargill, in particular, have invested heavily in the Black Sea region, building elevators and export terminals. As the old agriculture adage says, one farmer’s loss is another’s gain.
293;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-08-12T18:57:24Z;US farmers to benefit from failing wheat crops;Forecast for global wheat output by 2.3 per cent to 645.7m tonnes;US farmers will reap the benefits from failing crops round the world, the US Department of Agriculture said on Thursday as it forecast the country’s second-largest wheat exports in 15 years, worth billions of dollars.The USDA cut sharply its forecast for global wheat production following Russia’s worst drought in more than a century and lower output in the European Union, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.But it predicted that US farmers would harvest a bumper wheat crop, leaving them well-placed to meet the needs of importing countries, which have been scrambling to secure new supplies after Moscow banned all grain exports last week.“There is no question this is an opportunity for us and we’re going to take advantage of it,” said Tom Vilsack, US agriculture secretary, on Wednesday.The US wheat belt extends from Texas and Kansas to Montana and North Dakota.US wheat futures jumped more than 5 per cent to $7.34½ a bushel, although they remained below the two-year peak of $8.41 hit last week in the aftermath of Russia’s decision to ban exports.The USDA cut its forecast for global wheat output by a hefty 2.3 per cent to 645.7m tonnes in its closely watched monthly report, but said the world was not facing a repetition of the 2007-08 food crisis. There was “no global shortage of food grains”, it said.The boom for US farmers is lifting the outlook for the country’s agribusiness companies. Shares in Archer Daniels Midland, the trading house, have rallied 15 per cent since mid-June. John Deere, the manufacturer of tractors and combines, is up 10 per cent, while Monsanto and DuPont, which sell seeds, have also risen.Falling wheat production outside the US would make the country’s crop “competitive in key Middle East and North Africa markets”, the USDA said.The region imports about a quarter of the world’s cereal, and countries such as Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat buyer, have already made large purchases of US wheat.The USDA raised its forecast for international wheat sales from the US by 20 per cent to 32.6m tonnes.Apart from a surge during the 2007-08 food crisis, that would be the highest level of US exports since 1995-6. At current prices, the value of those wheat exports could reach $8bn (€6.2bn).The world’s reliance on the US to supply its staple agricultural commodities could put pressure on the country’s export facilities.The country is set to produce bumper harvests for other crops, with farmers predicted to bring in the largest ever hauls of soyabeans and corn.At the same time, China will import record amounts of soyabeans this year, according to the USDA’s forecasts. It is also expected to import significant amounts of corn for the first time in more than a decade.Dan Basse, president of AgResource, a Chicago-based consultancy, said US export infrastructure would feel the strain: “It is going to be a struggle and at some point it will limit the ability of the US to supply the full demand.”
294;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-08-09T22:21:54Z;Bitter harvest for those who fail challenges;;With cocoa bean prices soaring, the world’s biggest maker of chocolate wants urgent action to boost quality and supply.Jürgen Steinemann, chief executive of Barry Callebaut, the Zurich-based company that supplies many of the world’s leading food and chocolate groups, says only drastic measures can tackle the long-term challenges facing the industry.“We need to increase volume and quality,” he tells the Financial Times, in an interview almost a year to the day after taking office and as some observers fear a squeeze on the cocoa market by financial speculators. Cocoa prices in London hit £2,732 a tonne last month, the highest level since 1977.Mr Steinemann, formerly a top executive at Nutreco, the Netherlands-based animal nutrition group, says there are two solutions: squeezing higher yields from existing sources, and developing new supplies.Neither will be easy, he acknowledges. More than one-third of the world’s cocoa comes from one country – Ivory Coast – where output and quality have been falling as older trees have not been replaced and growers have moved to other, less taxing or more profitable, crops.But with new sources limited, given the exacting climatic conditions required to grow cocoa and the time required for a tree to mature, “Ivory coast will remain the most important source for years to come”, he says.He sidesteps debate about corruption or maladministration by the Ivorian authorities, to focus on the practical measures his company is taking to encourage farmers – predominantly smallholders – to invest.Like other big participants, such as Nestlé or the ADM trading group, Barry Callebaut has been working locally to train farmers, improve local health and education, boost infrastructure and plant new trees.Refuting the view of some critics, who belittle such initiatives as insignificant compared with the scale of the problem, Mr Steinemann says: “Whatever you do is good, however small. Because if you do nothing, you’re dead.” But he makes no pretence at being a do-gooder: “We’re investing in our corporate social responsibility programmes to ensure farmers earn more money. But you can’t sustainably make improvements unless there’s some advantage in terms of profitability for us.”Consistency of supply is crucial for Barry Callebaut, which made almost 1m tonnes of chocolate in the first nine months of its 2009-10 financial year. That means a myriad of micro-measures to boost links with farmers and local co-operatives and cut out sometimes corrupt or short-termist middlemen.“A closer relationship with growers helps us secure raw material, in terms of volume and quality, and ensure sustainability and traceability,” Mr Steinemann adds. Importantly for Barry Callebaut, closer contacts also improve the group’s ability to read the market.In spite of the pressures on the sector, Mr Steinemann is confident his group can meet its ambitious targets to increase sales and earnings by 6-8 per cent a year, although world demand for chocolate is expected to rise by only 2-3 per cent, and has been stagnant at best for the past 18 months because of the downturn.That strategy turns on internal improvements and securing more outsourcing deals. Within the company, Mr Steinemann stresses operating efficiency as the priority. “You must be the lowest cost producer,” he says.Innovation and emerging markets are his other two hopes. Mr Steinemann says that Barry Callebaut already has a strong reputation for novel ideas. On new markets, he points to big investments in production in Russia, China and South America. The priority now, he says, is to “fill what we have”.Outsourcing contracts with big customers, such as Nestlé, have been the other contributor to outgrowing the market.But after a series of long term supply agreements in 2007, including, in certain cases, an undertaking to produce certain branded products, outsourcing seems to have dried up.“I am very relaxed. The arguments are just too powerful. The pipeline has not gone,” responds Mr Steinemann.He says Barry Callebaut has signed further, albeit smaller, contracts. However, the transactions have been kept confidential, as is sometimes stipulated by the food companies concerned, in order to retain the impression that a branded item is fully produced by them.He is equally unconcerned about industry consolidation threatening future outsourcing deals. Mr Steinemann says business has not been affected by the takeover of Cadbury by Kraft. “We have long run outsourcing deals with Cadbury and they are not affected. And we have a long-standing relationship with Kraft.”“My impression is that global food groups will always want to talk to partners that are also global. In the long term, that can only be positive for us.”
295;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-08-06T15:03:38Z;Commodities sell-off eases wheat prices;;Wheat prices took a pause on Friday from their surge after Russia imposed a ban on grain exports on Thursday, which triggered a panic in commodities markets and sent wheat prices to their highest level since the 2007-08 global food crisis.The rally opens the door to a sharp increase in the price of everyday staples such as bread and flour.The market was frenetic on Friday amid talk of contract defaults following the ban, and as food companies and importing nations scrambled to find alternative supplies. In early trading, wheat prices in Chicago surged as much as 6 per cent, but later prices went down 3 per cent amid a general sell-off in commodities.Vladimir Putin, Russian prime minister, on Thursday announced the ban on all the country’s grain exports, effective within 10 days, after a severe drought devastated crops and wildfires spread across the country.The move, which caught traders and food producers by surprise, pushed the price of wheat to its highest level in two years and evoked memories of the last time the Soviet Union suffered a catastrophic crop failure in 1972.“There is full-blown panic in the European grain market,” a senior trader said.On Thursday, European wheat prices rose more than 12 per cent to hit a peak of €236 a tonne on record trading volumes. US wheat futures jumped by their daily limit to $7.85 a bushel and are up more than 80 per cent since mid-June, the fastest rally in nearly 40 years.On Friday, US wheat futures traded 2.8 per cent down to $7.65 a bushel, after hitting in early trading a two-year high of $8.41 a bushel.“Bottom line – no sign of a top as yet,” said Richard Feltes at brokerage MF Global in Chicago. “We think wheat end users are still short and at risk for further price gains,” he added, echoing a view widely held among grain traders.Another trader said that prices could continue to move higher next week amid panic buying, but that from a supply and demand point of view, prices probably have already risen enough. “That does not mean the rally is going to stop,” he added.The rally is triggering fears that food price inflation could take off and that the world could even suffer a repeat of the 2008 food crisis should the big shortfall in wheat output persist. “Soaring grain prices have brought food inflation back to centre stage,” said Joachim Fels of Morgan Stanley in London.Prices of other crops including barley, corn and rapeseed also jumped sharply.Shares in some of the world’s largest food companies tumbled on fears they would struggle to pass on all the increased costs of buying wheat to millions of households already suffering the effects of the financial crisis. However, several companies have already said they plan immediate price rises on goods, such as bread and biscuits.Unilever, the British consumer goods group, dropped 5.2 per cent, while General Mills, one of the world’s largest food companies, was 2.5 per cent lower. Nestlé fell 2.1 per cent. But the shares of trading companies such as ADM and Bunge surged on the prospect of more businesses exporting wheat from the US.On Thursday, Mr Putin told a cabinet meeting: “I think it would be expedient to introduce a temporary ban on export grains and other agricultural goods.”“We cannot allow an increase in domestic prices and we need to maintain the number of cattle.”The ban would take effect from August 15 and last until December 31, a spokesman for Mr Putin said.The worst drought in more than a century in the Black Sea region has led to widespread alarm. Forecasts for the Russian grain crop have been falling daily, with the agriculture ministry’s most recent projection at 70m-75m tonnes, down from 85m tonnes a fortnight ago.Last year, the harvest was 100m tonnes.Traders at Glencore, the world’s largest commodity trading company, on Tuesday warned the crop could fall to about 65m tonnes.Cargill, the world’s biggest trader of agricultural commodities, criticised Moscow’s move. “Such trade barriers further distort wheat markets by making it harder for supplies to move from areas of surplus to areas of deficit, and by preventing price signals from reaching wheat farmers,” it said.Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the Grain Union lobby group, said that the swift imposition of the ban risked undermining Russia’s reputation as a reliable supplier.Mr Putin said the government would disburse Rbs35bn ($1.17bn) in subsidies to agricultural producers. He added that Russia would use its grain stores for distribution without auction to regions in need
296;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-08-05T21:03:15Z;Wall St indices drop after poor retail sales;;US equities slid today on the back of higher-than-expected jobless claims and lacklustre retail sales data.At noon, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent at 1,121.98, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to 10,639.56 and the Nasdaq was 0.6 per cent lower at 2,288.93.Initial jobless claims data showed an unexpected rise in the number of people claiming unemployment insurance for the first time. Claims climbed by 19,000 to 479,000 last week, the most since April. Economists had forecast claims would fall to 455,000.Chain stores reported mixed sales figures for July, with 61 per cent missing expectations, 7 per cent in line and 32 per cent beating forecasts. Teen stores suffered from shoppers reluctant to buy before August’s back-to-school discounting season. Wet Seal fell 1.5 per cent to $3.28 and Hot Topic was down 5.1 per cent to $4.99. Also disappointing were drugstore Walgreen, which fell 1.1 per cent to $28.20, and clothing retailer JC Penney, which slid 5.9 per cent to $22.54.But Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy’s beat expectations. Abercrombie and Fitch rose 2 per cent to $39.58 and Macy’s was up 1.3 per cent to $19.69.Also in retail, shares in Limited Brands were weaker by 0.5 per cent to $26.16 in spite of raising its forecasts for second-quarter earnings.Agricultural companies advanced after Russia announced an export ban on grain and grain products because the country is suffering its worst drought in half a century.Archer Daniels Midland rose 5.2 per cent to $30.09, Monsanto increased 4.3 per cent to $61.98 and CF Industries Holdings gained 3.9 per cent to $86.16.In earnings news, News Corporation, owner of the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and Fox News, rose 3.9 per cent to $14.39 after it followed Time Warner and CBS to post quarterly earnings buoyed by an increase in advertising revenue.Reporting after the bell on Wednesday, the media company said it had swung into profit of 33 cents a share compared with a loss of 8 cents a share for the same period the year before, when it took an impairment charge.Clearwire Corporation, the US broadband wireless company majority-owned by Sprint Nextel, fell 5.5 per cent to $6.77 after it announced a quarterly loss of 61 cents per share. Its losses deepened from 38 cents per share a year ago. Revenue of $122.5m missed analysts’ estimates of $131.93m.Regis Corporation, the world’s largest operator of hair salon chains including Vidal Sassoon and Supercuts, said that its board was looking at ways to enhance shareholder value which may include the sale of the company. Its shares jumped 14.2 per cent to $17.86.
297;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-08-03T14:05:07Z;ADM benefits in emerging markets;;Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based agricultural trading house, said it expected strong demand from emerging markets to continue as it reported a 15 per cent increase in annual profits.The rise in earnings takes place against a backdrop of large increases in prices of agricultural commodities, from wheat to cocoa, driven by poor crops and increasing demand as consumption of food commodities emerges unscathed from the global financial crisis.ADM said it was benefiting from “strong export demand” for crops such as corn in response to rising consumption in emerging countries, including China and India. The trader buys crops in the US and Latin America, processes it into products such as vegetable oil or sweeteners, before shipping them to China and elsewhere.The company – the second largest US agribusiness after Cargill – reported net earnings of $1.93bn in the year to June 30, up from $1.68bn the previous year.The improved results also reflected better margins for corn-based ethanol. The trading house invested heavily in corn-based bio-fuels, a sector which was affected last year by weak demand for gasoline and low oil prices, making the alternative fuel less attractive. The rise in oil prices this year has helped to boost demand for ethanol. Oil prices on Tuesday were at a three-month high, more than $82 a barrel.“The ADM team finished strong, capping a very good year with very good fourth-quarter performance,” said Patricia Woertz, chief executive.She added that the company was seeking to invest in new processing facilities, particularly crushing plants for oilseeds, to capitalise on rising emerging markets demand, either by organic growth or by acquisitions.The trader said fourth- quarter earnings jumped to $446m, or 69 cents per share, up from $58m, or 9 cents per share, in the same period of fiscal 2009. The quarterly performance was above analysts’ consensus forecast of 53 cents per share. ADM shares were up 17 cents at $28.49 in New York.The increase in ADM’s profitability contrasts with rival Bunge’s disappointing performance, which forced the trader to cut its earnings forecast for 2010.Bunge last week posted an unexpected operating loss in the second quarter. It cut its full-year earning forecast to between $3.25 and $3.50 per share, down from $5.30 to $5.80.ADM said net sales for the 2010 fiscal year fell to $61.7bn, down from $69.2bn in fiscal 2009. However, sales are a poor indicator of a trader’s performance as they move up and down roughly in line with the price of commodities.
298;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-07-12T19:35:12Z;US farmers cash in on Chinese demand;;The concrete silos of the first US grain export depot to be built in 25 years are rising 66 miles up river from the Pacific Ocean, two mountain ranges and more than 1,500 miles away from the nation’s midwestern breadbasket.The location is easily explained: traders who historically barged most of the US grain surplus to the Gulf of Mexico now want to be closer to Asia. “China is the major driver,” says Larry Clarke, chief executive of the joint venture of commodity traders Bunge and Itochu and South Korean shipowner STX Pan Ocean that is developing the $200m (€159m, £133m) terminal in Washington state.As US politicians lose sleep over the trade deficit with China and the dollar-renminbi exchange rate, American farmers are eyeing a record $14bn in exports there this year. The US had a $4bn trade surplus in agricultural products with China in the first four months of 2010, helping shave the total deficit to $71bn in the period. The relationship will be in focus on Tuesday when monthly trade balance data are released.Agricultural exports to Asia are reshaping the US logistics landscape. The new Port of Longview grain terminal will handle 8m tonnes a year. At nearby Port of Grays Harbor a midwestern soyabean co-operative is adding storage for 50,000 tonnes of grain.Down the coast, California has surpassed New Orleans as the top point of departure for US cotton shipments, “given the Asian orientation of exports”, according to a report prepared for the ICE Futures exchange. At the port of South Louisiana on the Gulf of Mexico, still North America’s leading grain export hub, China last year blew past Japan to become the top destination for outbound bulk tonnage.Ken O’Hollaren, executive director at the Port of Longview, says the grain project there will employ 50 permanent workers. “Clearly, the growth market they had in mind to accommodate was the China market,” he said.The US is the world’s largest exporter of soyabeans and cotton, commodities for which China is the world’s top importer. Exports “exploded” after China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organisation, says the US Department of Agriculture. Growing livestock and textile industries have stoked demand for animal feed and fibres. “It’s huge,” says Randy Mann, who cultivates corn, soyabeans and wheat on 2,500 acres (1,000 hectares) in Kentucky and chairs a trade and international affairs committee of the American Soyabean Association. “Probably a third of the price on the Chicago Board of Trade is related to the soyabean market in China. That’s the impact it can have.” Soyabean prices have doubled in a decade to $10 a bushel.US agricultural exports to China are a relative bright spot in the trade relationship, despite some tensions over farm products. US beef is banned in China over BSE fears dating from 2003, for example, and US chicken imports face high antidumping and antisubsidy duties. Dairy is also an area of concern, with the countries currently negotiating over a new certification requirement for US dairy imports.But there are few non-tariff barriers on products like soyabeans and cotton. China has approved genetically modified soyabeans from the US, for example, and does not cap imports.US politicians say China could do more to let in foreign agriculture. The US International Trade Commission is investigating complaints that imports are limited to a few products. “We face unjustified restrictions in the Chinese market,” says Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Senate finance committee. Barack Obama, US president, last week named Patricia Woertz, head of Archer Daniels Midland, an Illinois-based grain trading and processing company, to a council formed to invigorate US exports.The Chinese government has made self-sufficiency in agricultural production a national goal, and China typically produces enough wheat, rice and corn to meet domestic demand. This year, for the first time in 15 years, US corn was shipped to China after a poor domestic crop last season, though total import volumes are small.China’s agricultural production is constrained by shrinking arable land area, limited water supply, outdated technology and small plot sizes. The median Chinese farm plot is less than one acre, preventing economies of scale. China uses subsidies and price supports to farmers to remain nearly self-sufficient in wheat, the USDA says.“Past liberalisation of policies for formerly strategic crops, such as soyabeans and cotton, indicates that China is willing to forgo self-sufficiency when costs are high and the crop is not ‘too strategic,’” the USDA said in a recent report.Liberalisation has not moved fast enough for some. At a trade commission hearing last month, US potato farmers claimed that China showed a “willingness to use quarantine matters politically” as it keeps out American tubers.
299;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-07-05T19:43:59Z;Cocoa groups allege price distortion;;Soaring prices for cocoa have sparked allegations of manipulation in the London market from a group of European processors and traders who are threatening to turn to alternative venues for their hedging needs.In a letter sent to NYSE Liffe, the global derivatives business of NYSE Euronext, 16 cocoa companies and trade associations have complained that “a manipulation of the contract” was “bringing the London market into disrepute”.Cocoa prices have risen 150 per cent since the start of 2008 as demand has outstripped supply year-after-year on the back of disappointing crops in Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer.The July Liffe cocoa contract, which expires next week, jumped almost 5 per cent to a peak of £2,625 a tonne on Thursday, its highest in nearly 33 years.The letter, which was sent on Friday to NYSE Liffe as well as the Financial Services Authority, the UK financial regulator, pointed to the unusually large open interest in the July contract as evidence of manipulation of the market.Andreas Christiansen, president of the German Cocoa Trade Association, a signatory of the letter, said: “The functionality of the market as a hedging instrument for commercials is heavily under water.”None of the largest cocoa trading companies – such as Cargill and ADM of the US, Singapore’s Olam, Touton of France, as well as hedge fund Armajaro and Barry Callebaut, the world’s leading chocolate maker – signed the letter.Traders said that many of the signatories were cocoa processors who produce cocoa butter and powder and hedge their exposure by taking out short positions in the futures market.Since cocoa butter and powder are not deliverable against the contract, they are forced to “roll” their hedges each month by buying back their short positions. When later-dated contracts are cheaper than near-dated contracts – a situation known as “backwardation” – rolling the short positions incurs a loss. Liffe July cocoa is trading at a premium of £156 a tonne to the September contract.“The shorts are the ones complaining,” said one senior executive at a large cocoa trading house. “If they believe it is all just speculation, they can call the bluff and deliver at expiry physical cocoa and scare the speculators.”In the letter, the cocoa companies threatened to “reconsider seriously” their hedging policy and move to use the Intercontinental­Exchange cocoa contract in New York unless NYSE Liffe introduced measures such as position limits. “This type of action would never have been allowed on ICE, where they have position limits,” the letter said.However, traders pointed to recent rises in raw sugar and Arabica coffee on the ICE market as evidence that short squeezes could still occur when there were position limits in place.NYSE Liffe noted the letter’s concerns but said they could “potentially arise close to expiry in any commodity futures contract”.

Hong Kong has fallen 3 per cent.Shares worth $5.45bn, or nearly half of the Hong Kong offering, have already been allocated to 11 main investors, most notably the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Kuwait.Yesterday, Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest grain traders, said it was taking a cornerstone stake by investing $100m.ADM, based in Decatur, Illinois, owns animal feed plants in China. Announcing the collaboration agreement with Agricultural Bank, Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive, said: “China’s agricultural market is growing in both supply and demand and represents significant growth opportunities for ADM.”The IPO’s final price will be set on July 6 with the shares due to list in Hong Kong on July 16, a day after Shanghai.CICC, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Macquarie are handling the Hong Kong offering, along with Agricultural Bank’s securities unit. In Shanghai, the underwriters are CICC, Citic Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
301;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-06-10T21:40:45Z;Rise in ethanol production lifts corn prospects;US government tempers effects of potential bumper summer crop;Corn futures emerged from the doldrums on Thursday after the US government said a rise in ethanol production would draw down old grain in silos and storage bins, tempering the effects of a potential bumper crop this summer.US ethanol refiners had notched up record output this year, helping increase corn demand, the US Department of Agriculture said in a report. The agency lowered its estimate of this year’s corn stockpiles 8 per cent to 1.6bn bushels.The forecast illustrates how energy policy has become a wild card in global grain markets. US Congress has mandated blending more renewable fuels such as ethanol into petrol. US environmental regulators are reviewing whether to increase the cap on ethanol mixed in petrol.Big corn processors have invested heavily in ethanol. This week Archer Daniels Midland, which makes ethanol and other corn products, asked regulators to raise the ethanol blending cap to 12 per cent of fuel pumped into vehicles from the current 10 per cent level. “The US ethanol market has reached the point of saturation,” ADM said in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency. “Right now, the industry is producing more than the market can absorb.”In contrast, the USDA suggested that there was more ethanol demand ahead as the US summer driving season soaks up production, a view shared by some analysts. Hussein Allidina, commodity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: “If gasoline demand is increasing in absolute terms, the amount of corn that can be used …will also increase.”The USDA also tripled its forecast for corn imports by China this year, to 1m tonnes. Large purchases by China have been widely reported in recent weeks, so the estimate had not affected prices, analysts said.CBOT July corn rose 3 cents to $3.41¼ a bushel.The ethanol effect tempered a corn market that has softened on a rosy outlook for this summer’s crop. Mild weather enabled farmers to plant early in the season, suggesting a strong harvest. Front-month corn futures are down 17.7 per cent this year.The USDA also reduced its forecast for stockpiles of cotton, which has gained as textile mills replenish their supplies. ICE July cotton rose 1.41 cents to 82.72 cents a pound. Cotton has gained 8 per cent this week.Elsewhere in commodities markets, the price of robusta coffee spiked to its highest in seven-and-a-half months on a wave of buying sparked by technical factors. Purchases of coffee by funds to cover bearish positions had triggered a broader rally, traders and analysts said. “There’s a sense of panic around. There’s a little bit of fear,” one coffee trader said.Liffe July robusta jumped 6.7 per cent to $1,475 a tonne. Robusta is the lower-quality coffee bean used mostly for instant coffee.Kona Haque, agricultural commodities analyst at Macquarie in London, said she did not expect the rally to last given that the market was well supplied.Coffee exports from Vietnam, the largest robusta grower, were down 20.5 per cent in the first seven months of the 2009-10 season, but production for the whole season is expected to be just 2.7 per cent lower, according to a monthly report by the International Coffee Organisation.
302;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-05-18T21:19:03Z;Agribusiness: All you can eat;Cargill strengthens position in crucial global market;"For farmers within 75 miles or so of Eddyville, Iowa, Ray Jenkins is the face of Cargill. He tells them when the agribusiness giant is buying corn for the towering mill outside the town of 1,100 in the centre of the US corn belt, and how much it will pay.Lately, the veteran merchandiser has begun to divulge more information than before. Mr Jenkins discusses grain markets on a regional radio station. He e-mails farmers daily, advising them in a recent note that the largest Chinese imports of US corn in nearly a decade could put “a floor in the corn market for the very near future” and suggesting it might be a good time to sell to Cargill. “The ball is now in your court,” he wrote.Mr Jenkins’s outreach reflects a revolution at the world’s largest grain trader. A decade ago, after profits halved, the company set out to offer more than just bids and offers for the farmers and food companies it serves as middleman. Instead of counterparties, Cargill now calls them customers – people with whom, as one executive puts it, “we need to be more open, transparent and vulnerable”.In many senses, Cargill is one of the hidden companies of the global economy. As the world’s agribusiness leader, it sits at the nexus of one of the world’s biggest and most critical industries – a force of great importance to millions of farmers as well as to large food multinationals from Nestlé to Coca-Cola and Kraft, though it is much less well-known as a name. Its significance – as the equivalent of ExxonMobil for the agriculture markets – is set to increase further as food demand rises in China, India and in parts of the developing world, and the use of biofuels grows in the west.Agriculture and the big food trading houses have been drawing increased attention from policymakers following the price spikes and supply uncertainties of the 2007-08 global food crisis, the first in more than 30 years. Food security, long a topic merely for agriculture ministers, is now hotly debated among leaders of the Group of Eight industrialised countries.Amid all this profound change surrounding its business, Cargill has had to do more than just alter its language. It has spent several years expanding down the supply chain from its large-volume, thin-profit business of trading bulk agriculture commodities – instead transforming some of the raw materials into ingredients it could sell at a premium.In addition, the group is nowadays much more than a grain trader. An industrial side that mines salt, makes plastic from plants and includes a majority stake in Mosaic, the fertiliser company, provides a chunk of the profits. The company holds dozens of patents, including one recently granted for a process to prevent scrambled eggs from turning mushy.Cargill’s animal nutrition labs formulate feeds that colour hens’ eggs from white to tan, a spectrum its sales people pitch with the kind of cardstock fan to be found at paint stores. Its investment vehicles trade across asset classes on behalf of institutional investors and provide administration services to complex hedge funds, while the company advises farmers and large food companies on hedging against the risks inherent in crops and markets .Ray Goldberg, a professor at Harvard Business School, wrote in a case study that the transformation made Cargill “less subject to competition and, consequently, its margins and profits would be more stable and secure”. Still, the biggest slice of Cargill’s earnings comes from its global trading business – the network of ships, silos, warehouses and people who help move vast tonnages of wheat, corn, oilseeds, cotton, cocoa and sugar around the world.Indeed, in the teeth of the global recession, the past three years are shaping up to be the best in Cargill’s 145-year history. Helped by the new “farm to fork” approach, the group is set to earn almost $10bn in the 2008-10 period, up from $1.5bn in 1998-2000 when the shake-up, called “strategic intent 2010”, was launched.With nearly $117bn in revenues last year and 138,000 employees based in 67 countries, Cargill also ranks as America’s biggest privately owned company. Founded in 1865 with a single Iowa grain elevator, the group remains controlled by about 80 members of the Cargill and MacMillan families, the low-profile descendants of founder William Cargill.It is their interests that Gregory Page, chief executive, is conscious he needs to protect. To invest and grow, Cargill depends on keeping its earnings ahead of funding costs. “We went from being several points under the cost of capital returns to several points over,” Mr Page tells the Financial Times in a rare interview at the company headquarters in Wayzata, Minnesota.Yet the effort to add more value to the workaday business of trading commodities has not extinguished doubts that an industry concentrated in a few large hands harms farmers. These days, US antitrust authorities are holding workshops – including one just up the highway from Eddyville – looking into potentially anti-competitive market power among agricultural buyers and processors. And when food prices spiked in 2007-08, activists criticised the trading houses for profiteering from the crisis.Cargill’s response was to lift some of the veil of secrecy, showing how the company moves crops around and advises some of the world’s governments about when and how to buy or sell, and from or to whom. Without its input, came the message, crop surpluses might rot in Brazil and hunger could hit Egypt.The group’s main competitors include Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland, New York-based Bunge and France’s Louis Dreyfus. The four, known because of their initials as the industry’s “ABCD”, dominate global flows of agricultural raw materials. But other companies have entered the top league as food demand surges in emerging countries: among them are Wilmar and Olam International, both of Singapore, and Hong Kong-based Noble Group.Cargill boasts about the intelligence the trading operation gives it in anticipating markets. Through its involvement in ocean shipping and trading basic materials – which also include non-agricultural commodities from crude oil and natural gas to iron ore and coal – the company says it had an early peek at the looming economic slowdown. “The insights gathered from many activities and places enabled our trading teams to avoid being stung by plummeting commodity prices”, its 2009 annual report says.Trading is, however, a brutal business even for Cargill. As grain prices surged in 2008, with corn reaching a record above $7 a bushel, a combination of the credit squeeze and demands for extra money to cover its futures hedges forced Cargill temporarily to stop buying farmers’ grain for deferred delivery – an unprecedented move. Though it continued to conduct spot trades, the extra collateral that exchanges required in the forward market as prices went up would otherwise have run into hundreds of millions of dollars for a company of Cargill’s size.“It was a dark moment,” says Christopher Langholz, president of Cargill AgHorizons, the trading unit that dates back to the company’s first grain elevator in 1865. “We’ve learnt from that and we’re confident we won’t get in that situation again.”Over history, Cargill has weathered many extremes in global agricultural markets. The son of the founder nearly bankrupted the company in the early 20th century after investing in a Montana irrigation project and an unsuccessful railroad. Cargill ran into huge difficulties during the south-east Asian financial crisis of 1997, when commodity demand plunged. It also lost money trading bonds amid Russia’s debt default of 1998. Net income that year plunged 43 per cent to $468m, helping precipitate the drive to redefine its customer relationship.In the year to last May, net profit fell 16 per cent to $3.33bn. For the first nine months of fiscal 2010, which ends this month, earnings totalled $1.91bn, 37 per cent down on the same period of 2008-09. Mr Page takes the decline in his stride, saying: “The number of times I have been called by a family member to compare this year to last year is seldom.”Instead, Cargill’s eighth chief executive says conversations among management and with the families dwell on whether results will bottom out below the company’s cost of capital, a question that turns on the pace of global growth. “We are all dying to have the answer to that question, but it is a big issue for Cargill. If we are going to drop back into a period of 2.5 per cent global growth …then we are going to have to rethink where we grow and how we grow.”The company is not immobile while the answer arrives. Cargill has launched a new master plan, labelled “strategic intent 2015”, to further the process of change. For years, the trading house’s corporate culture emphasised the independence of business units; as a result, “it operated as a confederation of businesses”, according to Prof Goldberg.The confederation has worked to some extent: a diverse business helped to smooth profits. Last year, for example, the industrial businesses provided half the profits, compensating for a lacklustre outcome from risk management and financial services.But former and rival executives say the trading house leaves money on the table year after year as it struggles to work together in an integrated way. “You still have small fiefdoms within the company,” says a former executive. Moody’s, the credit rating agency, late last year described Cargill as being “challenged to obtain synergies from such a diverse portfolio of businesses”.Mr Page has acknowledged the problem and wants closer ways of working. As an example of the potential, he tells the story of a “bond trader, in our proprietary financial desk, [who] saw a security of a big customer of ours get into deep trouble. Rather than just say, ‘well, that is interesting’, the guy thought: ‘how do I matter to other people?’“So he got hold of the credit manager in one of the businesses he thought could be facing a significant credit risk as a result of something that he was seeing emerging in the trade around this company’s long-term bond. It proved to be true,” Mr Page adds. “The company ended up, four or five months later, bankrupt, but because of his heads-up we averted significant losses.”In that sense, “strategic intent 2015” is not the kind of revolution that the plan for 2010 created. The change this time is not about moving to new and more lucrative areas of the supply chain but rather, as Mr Page says, to “interconnect businesses”. As in the past, Cargill has started by changing its language. While previously it talked about internal collaboration, which had a voluntary aspect, today it speaks of connectivity.“What we think will differentiate us over time is this end-to-end awareness connectivity,” Mr Page says, admitting the change was a response to customers’ concerns: “While they were happy to see the direction we were going, there was still an impatience that Cargill did not act cohesively enough in service to their needs.” As part of its response, the company is hiring from its customers in an effort to understand their needs. Mr Page says that about 25 per cent of executives above a certain hierarchical position now come from outside, while in the 1990s the number hovered at about 15 per cent.The extraordinary recent profitability of the company – unseen since the golden years of the late 1970s – has put it in a good position with the family members, who benefit from increased pay-outs under a policy that, according to Moody’s, limits dividends to 20 per cent of the trailing two years’ earnings, while leaving the remainder free for investment.Back at Eddyville, the sense of a new time comes as Mr Jenkins text-messages farmers with updates on the size of the traffic jam in Cargill’s parking lot outside the corn mill, which can handle dozens of trucks a day. Farmers appreciate the attention but never forget they are dealing with a global powerhouse that has a vastly broader perspective than theirs.“He’s farmer-friendly,” says Mike Hornick, who grows corn in southern Iowa and delivers it to the mill. “But who pays his pay cheque?”"
303;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-05-05T17:57:54Z;US faces bumper corn season;Despite a headstart on planting, summer crops could yet be hit by bad weather;If tractors could speed, Iowa’s fields would be a raceway.Farmers there are close to finishing their sowing of corn when traditionally they would only be halfway through at this point in spring.“This year is the earliest I have ever planted corn,” says Mike Hornick, a lifelong Iowa farmer. “It was the earliest I ever finished. I’m real happy – there’s a big smile on my face.”The scene is similar across the country’s Corn Belt as warm, dry, weather has encouraged field work, raising forecasts for yields and harvests and lowering expectations for corn prices by the end of the year.US farmers have planted 68 per cent of their corn this season, equivalent to about 60m acres – a record pace.Last year, they had put less than a third of their seeds in the soil while the five-year average for this time of year is 40 per cent, according to the US Department of Agriculture.John Rice, executive vice-president at Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest corn processors and agricultural commodity traders, told analysts this week that “the outlook of the crop currently looks fantastic”.In Iowa, the biggest corn grower in the country, farmers have already planted nearly 85 per cent of their intended acreage.Don Roose, president of US Commodities in West Des Moines, Iowa, a brokerage, says: “This is huge. We are heading to a record crop.”The heightened expectations also reflect a structural change in the agribusiness industry. The period of high corn prices between 2004 and 2009 recapitalised US farmers. Many invested in equipment such as tractors guided by global positioning system receivers that help squeeze planting sessions into short time windows of nice weather.In the past, farmers had to work fields during daylight hours but GPS technology now lets them plough in the dark of night.Early planting could hasten pollination, averting heat stress on corn stalks as summer temperatures set in, analysts and agronomists say.As a consequence, the market is mulling over prospects that the 2010-11 crop yield could jump to 165-170 bushels per acre, topping last season’s record high of 164.9 bushels. Because more than half the world’s corn exports originate in the US, changes in its planting could have an impact on global markets.Talk of a record harvest has shifted the market’s attention to the new crop.On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn for December delivery was $3.83½ a bushel on Wednesday, down 13 per cent from the start of the year. The spot May corn contract traded at $3.56¾ a bushel.The USDA will on Tuesday publish its supply and consumption projections for the 2010-11 crop year that begins on September 1.If the estimates confirm the market chatter of a large corn crop, prices could drop further. But the auspicious start to the growing season could still quickly wilt in the face of poor weather during the critical summer growing period, leading to crop failure and higher prices.“I remain sceptical about the way the market approaches early-season prospects,” says Lewis Hagedorn, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in New York.Scott Irwin and Darrel Good, agricultural economists at the University of Illinois, say that excellent weather conditions could result in a record 172.5 bushel-per-acre yield, pushing new crop farm-gate prices down to $3.20 a bushel. But poor weather late this year could slash yields to just 134.5 bushels per acre, sending prices to $5.75 a bushel.“The general lack of concern about a weather-induced shortfall in US corn production suggests that market participants and policymakers may be ill-prepared to cope with such a shortfall should it occur,” they said in a recent research paper.Corn prices surged to an all-time high of $7.65 a bushel in June 2008 when flooding hit the US Midwest. But better weather afterwards saved the crop, triggering a bounty harvest that depressed prices.
304;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-05-04T13:22:51Z;Oilseeds boost ADM quarterly profits;;Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest grain traders and processors, reported a big boost in profits in the first three months of 2010 as it crushed more soyabeans.The Illinois company earned $421m in its third quarter ended March 31, or 65 cents per share. In the same quarter of 2009 the company earned $3m, breaking even on a per share basis. The per-share results lagged Wall Street expectations of 71 cents.The gain was centred in the oilseeds processing business, as a disappointing South American soyabean harvest prompted higher volumes, margins and utilisation rates at ADM’s North American operations. The segment’s operating profit increased $181m in the quarter to $405m.This contrasted with rival trader Bunge, which is more exposed to South America. The New York-based company last week said quarterly results were constrained by tight soyabean supplies in Brazil.Operating profit in ADM’s corn processing unit more than doubled on the year to $104m, helped by lower prices for the staple grain and better demand for ethanol and lysine, an animal feed additive.But accounting issues in a corn hedging programme hurt its sweetener and starch business, where operating profit fell $101m on year to $45m. Steven Mills, chief financial officer, said results would have been roughly in line with last year without the hedging factor.Patricia Woertz, ADM chief executive, said: “In this third quarter, the ADM team did a good job managing our large, flexible origination and processing network to meet global demands.”ADM shares fell $1.07, or 3.9 per cent, to $26.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.
305;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-02-04T20:06:34Z;Bunge blames fertiliser unit for fall in profits;;Bunge, one of the world’s largest traders of agricultural commodities, on Thursday said large losses at its fertiliser businesses had eaten away at the group’s full-year profits.The losses help to explain Bunge’s decision last month to sell its Brazilian fertiliser unit to mining group Vale for $3.8bn in cash. The trading house said it would focus on expanding its agricultural businesses in areas such as sugar.“In 2009, fertiliser generated significant losses, which stemmed from a difficult market characterised by high-cost inventory and a weak price environment,” said Alberto Weisser, Bunge chief executive. A shortage of soyabean production in Latin America due to a drought also affected profitability, he said.Bunge said its net profit for the year to December 31 dropped 66 per cent to $361m, or $2.22 per share, from $1.06bn in 2008 after a “challenging” year in fertilisers. The fertiliser unit lost $616m in 2009, compared with gains of $321m in 2008. In the final quarter of last year, Bunge said it suffered a net loss of $28m, or 21 cents per share, dragged down by its fertiliser business and weaker results in agribusiness. Analysts said results were far worse than those of Archer Daniels Midland, its US competitor.David Driscoll, of Citigroup in New York, said the fourth quarter figures looked “very bad”, putting a cap on “a year Bunge would probably want to forget.” The results underline how agricultural traders involved in fertiliser production, such as Bunge and Cargill, continue to struggle as the drop in agricultural commodities prices and tighter credit force farmers – particularly in emerging markets such as Brazil, Argentina or eastern Europe – to cut fertiliser consumption. The lacklustre demand and low prices have haunted Bunge’s profitability since late 2008. After selling its Brazilian fertiliser unit, Bunge retains a fertiliser business in Argentina and a production joint venture in Morocco. Cargill has so far stuck to its large investment in New York-listed fertiliser producer The Mosaic Company.Bunge’s annual sales fell to $41.9bn in the year, down 20 per cent from $52.7bn. Sales dropped 5 per cent in the fourth quarter to $10.4bn.The company sounded upbeat for this year. Jacqualyn Fouse, chief financial officer, said “improved global demand . . . should result in higher volumes.”Bunge provided full-year earning guidance of $5.75-$6.25 per share for 2010, significantly up from last year, but below profits of $7.73 per share in 2008.Vincent Andrews, of Morgan Stanley in New York, said the guidance “appears better than expectations.”Bunge shares initially fell more than 5 per cent, but later pared losses to trade down 3.95 per cent to $58.11 per share. Bunge is the world’s largest processor of oilseeds and among the world’s leading exporters of soyabean products.
306;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2010-02-02T23:25:51Z;ADM exceeds expectations;;Archer Daniels Midland Co, one of the world’s largest traders of agricultural commodities, said on Tuesday that its profits fell 2 per cent during the second quarter of its fiscal year, beating Wall Street’s forecast for a larger drop.ADM, as the company is known, said its profitability in the three months to December 31 dropped to $567m, or 88 cents per share, down 2 per cent from last year’s same period helped by strong soyabean and ethanol earnings.“I’m very pleased with our performance in this quarter,” said ADM chief executive Patricia Woertz as she beat analysts’ forecasts for earnings of 72 cents per share.The results were ahead of ADM’s larger competitor, the privately-owned Cargill, which suffered a larger drop in quarterly results due its fertilizers investments. Bunge, the other large US agricultural trader, reports results later this week.Sales during the second quarter of ADM’s fiscal year dropped to $15.9bn, down 5 per cent from $16.6bn in the same period of the previous year. Sales slid due to lower agricultural commodity prices, while volumes were higher.Ms Woertz said that demand was “improving in some key markets” and sounded upbeat on the US ethanol market, a key area for the US-based company. ADM said its corn-processing division earnings jumped 10-fold to $290m on the back mostly of “improved ethanol margins and higher sales volumes”.But highlighting the shaky foundations of the recovery, ADM executives noted that customers in certain areas, such as cocoa, remain cautious in forward contracts.The agribusiness company said that in the first six months of its fiscal year it earned $1.65bn, down 35 per cent from $2.52bn from last year’s first half. Sales in the first half of the year topped $30.8bn, down 18 per cent.Ms Woertz said on an investor conference call that ADM had the “opportunity of some debt reduction” but underlined her “main priority” was to grow the company, highlighting opportunities in sugar, Asia and Central America.Analysts praised the results, but some cautioned that a bumper soyabean crop in the US and Latin America, which account for more than 80 per cent of global production, will cut oilseeds processing margins in the second half of the year. ADM benefited last year from higher oilseed crushing margins as US farmers reaped a large harvest while a drought in Latin America savaged output there.Based in Decatur, Illinois, ADM converts corn, oilseeds, wheat and cocoa into products for food, animal feed and bioenergy. It employs 28,000 people and operates in about 60 countries.
307;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-12-23T18:35:52Z;Glencore taps rich seam of commodities;;Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, is a unique company.No other trading house, with perhaps the exception of the much smaller Singapore-based Noble Group, comes close to replicating its business model, which integrates the production and sourcing of raw materials with their marketing and trading.“They are a special mix: a natural resources company,” says a mining executive who deals with Glencore. “Neither just a trader nor a producer.”Standard & Poor’s, the credit ratings agency, says Glencore’s key strength is precisely its “significant upstream integration in mining and processing” and its “access to sourcing through important equity affiliates and own production”.Glencore considers itself almost as a logistics business moving commodities from one part of the world to another. The control of supplies gives the publicity-shy company market intelligence on production conditions, allowing it to anticipate price movements that others miss.The company owns 35 per cent of Anglo-Swiss Xstrata, which has large coal and nickel operations. It also has stakes in Russian oil producer Russneft, Century Aluminum of the US, Rusal, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, and multiple mines from Los Quenuales in Peru to Katanga in the Congo.It also owns the Moreno Group, one of Argentina’s key soyabean companies, and farms more than 300,000 hectares of leased or owned farmland from Australia to Paraguay. Glencore employs 2,000 staff for its trading activities worldwide, but a further 50,000 are employed directly or indirectly on its industrial activities.Glencore dwarfs all its competitors because of the breadth of its interests in every commodity and region, making it a critical actor in terms of the price and flow of raw materials across the world.Its competitors are mostly focused on single commodities markets – such as Vitol and Trafigura in energy or ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus in agriculture, or geographical locations – such as the Japanese trading houses, or sogo shosha, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Itochu and Marubeni concentrating on Asian trading.The company, based in Baar, near Zurich, was founded by Marc Rich in 1974 as Marc Rich + Co to focus on metals trading and slowly expanded into crude oil, coal, oil products such as gasoline and, in 1982, into agriculture.Following opportunistic acquisitions of production assets from 1988 onwards, the company evolved into a diversified natural resources group.Mr Rich, a contentious figure who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton after being indicted in a federal court for allegedly evading more than $48m in taxes, sold his share in the company to the trading house’s senior executives between 1993 and 1994. Mr Rich is no longer connected to the company, since renamed Glencore.Ivan Glasenberg, a South African who has worked for the trading house since 1984, has been Glencore’s chief executive since 2002.Glencore is famously known as a tough negotiator. “They are aggressive,” says the mining executive. Others describe the culture of Glencore as similar to that at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank. The executive adds that Glencore’s traders, nonetheless, “care a lot about the long-term relationship” with providers and customers.It is also know for being publicity-shy, but Glencore has this year lifted the veil of secrecy by revealing a few numbers in an effort to tackle rumours about its solvency. In March it reported cash and undrawn credit of $5bn and last month signed almost $7.5bn of loans, extending and refinancing credit facilities maturing in 2009 and 2011.Glencore lifted revenues last year from $142bn to $152bn, according to Standard & Poor’s. Underlying profits – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – fell from $5.5bn to $4.4bn during the year and the ratings agency believes that they could fall to a range between $2.7bn and $3.3bn in 2009-10 due to lower commodities prices and a drop in global trading of raw materials.
308;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-11-11T23:08:59Z;Food companies put sustainability on the menu;;Global food companies are coming up with their own solutions to avoid a repetition of last year’s food shortages and record-high prices, in many cases moving ahead of government initiatives.“Last year’s food crisis was a wake-up call,” says Bill Lesher, of Global Harvest Initiative in Washington, a group involving some of the world’s biggest farming companies, such as Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, John Deere and Monsanto. “Our members want to avoid a repetition.”Food companies were caught off guard in early 2008 when prices of staples such as wheat, milk and cocoa started to rise unexpectedly after almost 20 years of stability. Although the crisis has abated, agricultural commodities prices remain high and beyond companies’ comfort range, say executives.As a result companies including Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever are rethinking their strategies. The world’s largest traders of food commodities – Archer Daniel Midlands, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus – have also introduced initiatives.Some companies have begun to spend tens of millions of dollars a year investing in sustainable farming in developing countries to guarantee long-term supplies at low prices. They are building more processing plants and storage facilities to meet booming demand from Asia. More and more companies are also for the first time investing directly in farmland and irrigation projects.In a radical move, some agricultural trading houses have introduced a surcharge on commodities such as coffee and cocoa. They are then using the surcharge revenues to invest in farming operations to help secure long-term supplies.Other food companies and trading houses are taking much smaller steps, launching internal reviews of the long-term sustainability of their supply chains or holding public discussions on the future of food.Food executives agree, nonetheless, that business as usual is not an option.Geoff Lane, a partner in sustainability at PwC, the consultancy, says in the past big companies have been pretty fickle in terms of supply relationships as food was “a buyer’s market”. But today, he adds, “all the indicators are pointing in one direction: food scarcity”.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation will bring some of the world’s biggest food companies to Milan from Thursday for a private sector forum ahead of next Monday’s World Summit on Food Security.The gathering is the largest ever organised for the private sector by the FAO, signalling a new consensus among food officials on the need to get ideas from the private sector.For all the companies’ initiatives, they are in most cases still fighting in Europe and the US to preserve agricultural subsidies, in spite of the fact many analysts blame these subsidies for exacerbating the food crisis.The FAO estimates that the world will need until 2050 to boost agricultural investment by $83bn (€56bn, £51bn) a year – a 50 per cent increase on the past decade’s average – to feed a growing population. Most of the money will come from the private sector, from small farmers to big agribusinesses.Nestlé is emblematic of the food companies’ new actions. The Swiss-based company is investing more than $100m over the next decade to provide farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana, which together account for 60 per cent of the world’s cocoa output, with millions of disease-resistant plants to boost supply.Nestlé’s move to tackle the problem of demand outstripping supply in the cocoa industry comes after prices of the commodity shot up to a 30-year high earlier this year and the cocoa market endured its most persistent shortages since the late 1960s.Armajaro Trading, one of the world’s biggest cocoa suppliers, is to charge customers, including Lindt and Ferrero, an extra $30 per tonne for cocoa – equal to about 1 per cent of the price – to invest in cocoa farms and boost supplies.
309;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-11-09T22:07:16Z;Food self-sufficiency ‘is a nonsense’;;"The drive towards self-sufficiency in response to last year’s food crisis will fail, a top executive at Cargill has warned, adding that the idea that countries “can be self-sufficient in every single food is a nonsense”.The warning by the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities comes ahead of the UN World Summit on Food Security in Rome, the first since 2002. The summit was prompted by the surge in the price of staples such as rice and wheat, which last year hit record highs, sparking food riots in countries from Bangladesh to Haiti.Countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East have moved towards self-sufficiency in response to the crisis, either by boosting agricultural production at home through subsidies and import tariffs or acquiring overseas farmland.The so-called “farmland grabs” gained notoriety after an attempt by South Korea’s Daewoo Logistics to secure a huge chunk of farmland in Madagascar, which contributed to the collapse of the African country’s government.Paul Conway, senior vice-president at Cargill, said: “Promoting a free and open trading system whereby countries can produce what they are best able …and surpluses can be traded across international boundaries is the right way to go.“Not all countries can single-handedly be self-sufficient in all food commodities,” he added, also dismissing attempts to outsource agriculture production overseas.Mr Conway warned that host countries were likely to impose export bans in the event of a local or global food crisis. In a rare interview, he said food security had become a key global challenge. “It is a high, high political item,” said Mr Conway, who is in charge of Cargill’s food security initiatives.“Food security, which was not on the agenda of anyone but agriculture ministries only three years ago, is now very central to governments,” he said, noting that the interest was at its highest level since late 1970s or early 1980s.In the US, the food security agenda, usually left to the Department of Agriculture, has become one of secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s strategic projects.Archer Daniel Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus – the world’s top food trading houses – are at the centre of agricultural trade and their wide business and government
relationships allow them to see changes in food policy.“The whole world had got very relaxed about food security and, yes, probably unduly complacent,” Mr Conway said.He warned that rising populations and wealth in developing countries and governments’ targets for biofuel production were likely to continue to put upward pressure on food prices for years to come.Mr Conway said the world’s food security would be improved if countries reached a deal on the Doha trade round.The Food and Agriculture Organisation forecasts that global trade of food staples will surge to 300m tonnes by 2050, up from the current 135m tonnes."
310;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-11-03T23:25:21Z;ABF remains cautious as it eyes 400 job cuts;;Associated British Foods has warned that consumer confidence remains fragile, in spite of its better than expected profits and a surge in sales at its Primark discount fashion chain.The group also revealed that slightly fewer than 400 jobs were at risk in the UK, as it revamped its Twinings tea business, moving processing to Poland and China.George Weston, chief executive, said the group was cautious about prospects for the UK consumer.He said: “With taxes going up and government spending going down, and unemployment still going up, it seems the most likely thing is consumer spending remains subdued.”Mr Weston expected it to be a “long slog to recovery”, adding: “I can’t see there is going to be a great splurge at Christmas.”At Primark, which is expanding in Europe, like-for-like sales rose 7 per cent in the year to September 12, with overall sales up 20 per cent. Mr Weston said current trading continued to go well but the recent warm weather had affected demand for coats and sweaters. Primark’s operating profit margin fell from 12.1 per cent to 10.9 per cent because of an increase in overheads from a new distribution centre and the drop in sterling.Primark helped ABF lift sales from £8.24bn to £9.26bn. But group pre-tax profit fell from £527m to £495m, reflecting the closure of a factory as part of the merger of the North American edible oils business with Archer Daniels Midland, and higher financing costs.The group benefited, however, from a “real turning point” in its sugar business.Nevertheless, ABF, which employs 32,500 in the UK, is in consultations about closing a factory in Newcastle, employing 260 people, while another 130 jobs in Andover, Hampshire, are under threat. Twinings’ processing for export markets will move to a factory in China, which will be doubled in size, and to a new factory in Poland.Earnings per share were flat at 45.5p (45.2p), but excluding exceptional items, they rose 5 per cent to 57.7p, ahead of analysts’ expectations.The shares fell 12½p to 820½p.
311;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM profits fall 52% but beat expectations;;Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest grain processors, said on Tuesday it saw demand improving in key markets as it reported quarterly profits had more than halved since last year, although the results far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.The agribusiness has been hit by the fall in commodity prices, which have dragged down the prices for its processed products. However, it also benefited in the quarter from the lower cost of raw corn, enabling its corn-processing segment to post a 60 per cent growth in profit.The company – one of the US’s biggest ethanol producers and a champion of government subsidies to the industry – has also been hit by the collapse of the US ethanol sector.Archer Daniels Midland said it made net earnings of $496m or 77 cents per share in the three months to September 30, down from $1.04bn or $1.62 per share last year but ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of 57 cents per share. Net sales fell by 29 per cent to $14.92bn, as lower prices and foreign exchange translation ate into profits.The better-than-expected results reflected much improved margins in the company’s corn-processing unit, which makes sweeteners and starches. That part of the business, boosted by the fall in corn prices, tripled its operating profit – to $194m from $65m in the same period last year, more than offsetting a $59m drop in operating profits in ethanol processing.Although the company did not give an outlook, Patricia Woertz, chief executive, struck a bullish tone. “Looking ahead, we see demand improving in some key markets,” she said.The company’s shares were up 1.1 per cent at $30.85 in pre-market trading.
312;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-08-30T18:18:25Z;Commodity traders signal lift for prices;;The world’s largest commodity trading houses have turned upbeat on economic growth, signalling firmer raw materials prices in the second half of the year.The positive outlook from traders including Glencore, Cargill, Mitsubishi, Archer Daniels Midland and Noble Group comes after a tough first half for the sector, with most companies reporting a plunge in sales and profits. But executives were optimistic for the second half on the back of China’s stimulus package.“We are seeing demand pick up,” said Steve Marzo, chief financial officer at Noble Group, the Hong Kong-based diversified trader – echoing a view widely held in private by senior executives from rival commodities companies. The trading houses’ outlook is important because they are at the centre of trade and their wide business relationships allow them to anticipate economic cycles.Glencore, the world’s largest trader, said it saw “encouraging signs of increased levels of business activity”. Mitsui & Co, Japan’s second largest sogo shosha or general trading company, added that the global economy appeared to have “started to pull out” of the recession, while its larger rival Mitsubishi said the world was observing “the beneficial effects of economic stimulus measures”.Senior executives said China’s strong growth was filtering into neighbouring Asian countries and noted restocking in the US after companies there had run down inventories to pipeline levels. But they said demand was lacklustre in Europe. These views contrast with cautious comments earlier this year, and some executives admitted they were surprised by the speed of the rebound. “It feels as if the recovery is arriving three-six months ahead of schedule,” said one.Traders said they were bullish on metals and minerals such as copper, coking coal and iron ore, even though prices have already doubled since January. Their view on energy was neutral, with most seeing oil little changed at $70 a barrel, while for food commodities such as wheat and corn they saw firm demand.Low prices earlier this year have hit the trading houses hard. Glencore suffered a 57 per cent drop in net profits in the first half, while Cargill said its fiscal year earnings fell for the first time in eight years.
313;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-08-27T13:19:36Z;Glencore upbeat on economic growth;;"Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, posted an upbeat view on the economic growth led by China, saying on Thursday that it saw a rebound business activity – in spite of reporting that its profits more than halved in the first half of the year due of low commodities prices.“There are some encouraging signs of increased levels of business activity,” the Swiss-based privately owned company said in a statement. The commodities market usually pays attention to Glencore’s views on the economy and price direction because of its trading in raw materials from oil and copper to sugar and coal.Glencore’s upbeat comments follow positive statements about the global economy and commodities prices for the second half of the year from miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto and agriculture trading houses Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill.Noble Group, the Singapore-listed commodity house, said this month that the global economy has started to “regain some poise”.In spite of the upbeat comments for the second half of the year and into 2010, the first half of the year was, however, difficult for the natural resources sector.Glencore said its net profit, excluding exceptional items, fell to $1.12bn in the first half of the year, down 57 per cent from $2.63bn in the same period last year. Revenues fell to $45.24bn, down from $86.17bn. The drop was in line with the rest of the natural resources sector.“The first half of 2009 contrasted markedly with the same period last year as the global economy and financial system sought to regain some level of stability,” Glencore said. It added said that “progressive commodity price rises” meant that its net income rose more than 50 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of the year.Commodities prices have risen strongly since January, with oil trading above $70 a barrel, up from less than $35 a barrel earlier this year. Copper prices have more than doubled to $6,300 a tonne, while sugar prices have hit a 28-year high.The publicity-shy company owns 35 per cent of Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata, which has large coal and nickel operations. It also has stakes in Russian oil producer Russneft; Century Aluminum of the US; Rusal, the world’s largest producer of aluminium; and multiple mines from Los Quenuales in Peru to Katanga in the Congo.It also owns the Moreno Group, one of Argentina’s key soyabean companies, and farms more than 300,000 hectares of leased or owned farmland from Australia to Paraguay. Glencore employs 2,000 staff for its trading activities worldwide, but a further 50,000 are employed directly or indirectly on its industrial activities.Glencore said its net debt fell to $10.4bn, down from $11.5bn, adding that its short-term refinancing remained “modest” and that discussions with several banks to replace a $1.05bn loan secured against its stake in Xstrata and due to mature in December were “well advanced”.Available liquidity, representing cash and undrawn bank facilities, amounted to more than $3.7bn at the end of June, down from over $5bn at 31 December 2008. Glencore has a target to maintain its liquidity above $3bn. Rising commodities prices usually consume liquidity as the company needs more working capital for its operations."
314;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Cargill quarterly profits plunge by 69%;;Cargill, the US agribusiness conglomerate, reported on Tuesday that its fiscal full-year earnings fell for the first time in eight years and warned that it expects the effects of the global economic downturn to persist “for some time”.The results underline how the US agricultural sector is struggling as the drop in commodity prices has forced farmers around the world to cut demand for inputs such as fertiliser chemicals. Cargill is the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, handling everything from wheat and corn to sugar and cocoa.“The path to economic recovery may well be uneven,” said Greg Page, chairman and chief executive, although he added that he “remains optimistic”.Cargill’s outlook was more cautious than the one from rivals Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland. Bunge said that last month it was expecting a ”strong second half of the year” and forecasted firm crop prices. ADM said earlier this month that it saw ”signs of improving demand” in food and feed markets.Corn and wheat prices in Chicago, the world’s benchmark for agricultural commodities, dropped this week to their lowest levels since December on the back of expectations of a large harvest and relatively weak demand. Corn fell to $3.04 1/2 a bushel, down 60 per cent from last June’s record high of $7.65 a bushel.David MacLennan, chief financial officer, told the FT he did not expect agricultural commodity prices to recover soon. “It’s difficult to imagine that we’re going to see prices for northern hemisphere agricultural crops at the levels where they were last summer, because growing conditions have been so good,” he said.However, Mr McLennan said he was “cautiously optimistic” about demand in China, India and Brazil and noted that although the full-year results were down from last year, they were the second-best in the company’s history.Cargill made a net profit of $327m in its fiscal fourth quarter to the end of May, down 69 per cent from $1.05bn in the same period last year. For the full fiscal year, Cargill’s profits were $3.33bn, down 16 per cent from $3.95bn in the prior year. Revenues for the full year fell 3 per cent to $116.6bn.“The [fiscal] year was a tale of two halves,” said Mr Page. “Cargill posted record results through November. In the second half, earnings slowed considerably as the world economy contracted for the first time in six decades.”Cargill had been buoyed by strong sales at Mosaic, the fertiliser company in which it has a 64 per cent stake. Excluding the revenues from Mosaic, profits would have fallen at the company for the first nine months of the fiscal year.However, in recent months Mosaic has dragged its parent down. Last month, the fertiliser-maker reported that its profits in the quarter to the end of May dropped 83 per cent from last year, to $146.9m from $862.5m, as cash-strapped farmers cut back on their purchases of potash and phosphate.“The demand for fertiliser just hit the wall,” said Mr MacLennan. “There was a lot of destocking and farmers were waiting to see what direction crop prices were going to take.”Although as a private company, Cargill does not give a breakdown of its earnings, it pinpointed the poor performance of its industrial segment – which includes Mosaic – in the quarter, saying the unit’s earnings “were down significantly” from last year. The company said its risk-management and financial segment also incurred a loss in the quarter.Cargill’s agriculture services, food ingredients and applications divisions were up from last year, while it said its origination and processing segment “posted solid profits, though down from last year’s very strong fourth-quarter performance”.The company benefited from the rally in commodities prices that started in 2002, particularly in the past two years, when food prices spiked.
315;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-08-04T21:07:08Z;Wall St extends gains on upbeat economic data;;US stocks extended their recent run of gains on Tuesday as encouraging housing data offset concerns that the market’s rally may run out of steam.After brief selling pressure during the afternoon, stocks rallied back in late trade and the S&P 500 closed at a fresh high for the year. That kept the broad benchmark above the 1,000 threshold, which it finally rose above on Monday for the first time since last November.The S&P closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,005.65, near its intra-day high of 1,007.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to close at 9,320.19, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.1 per cent to 2,011.31.“A pullback would be healthy, there have been lots of positives to take from the earnings we have seen,” said Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management.Meanwhile, growing momentum by the Securities and Exchange Commission to ban the use of flash trading orders on exchanges sparked volatility in the shares of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.Shares in NYSE Euronext surged nearly 4 per cent in early afternoon trade, before easing to stand 2.4 per cent higher at $27.40. Nasdaq OMX, which, unlike NYSE Euronext, allows flash orders, fell 0.3 per cent to $21.39 having plumbed an earlier low of $20.78.Financial stocks fell in early trade, knocked in part by data showing that personal income fell more sharply than analysts expected in June.But figures showing that pending home sales jumped much more than predicted during the month saw them rise into positive territory by midday.John Canally, economist for LPL Financial, said the fifth straight month of rises for pending home sales was very encouraging.“After housing starts and moderating prices, the pending home sales figures are the latest sign that the housing market has stabilised.”Citigroup rose 2.2 per cent to $3.25 while Wells Fargo was up 2.9 per cent at $26.55 and Bank of Americapicked up 2.1 per cent to $15.64.Homebuilders saw mixed fortunes as the data lifted some of the sector’s biggest companies following early losses on the back of some disappointing quarterly results.Pulte Homes fell to a heavier loss than expected, with falling land values and weak sales continuing to take their toll. Its shares dropped 0.7 per cent to $11.68.The negative outlook briefly weighed on Centex, which Pulte has agreed to buy, and after early losses, its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $11.33 as the company made a quarterly profit.Rival DR Horton also suffered as a result of record foreclosures and rising unemployment. Its results were worse than expected.But its shares picked up following early falls and it gained 4.9 per cent to close at $12.32.“People are selling the homebuilders after their recent run-up but I would pay more attention to these economic data,” said Mr Canally.The utilities sector was the heaviest faller on the S&P, led lower by Allegheny Energy, which lost 4.9 per cent to $24.50 after the company reported slightly lower profit than expected.The results exacerbated pre-market falls that came on the back of an announcement on Monday evening that the company had filed a universal shelf register with the SEC, which would enable it to sell fresh stock.Meanwhile, Duke Energy announced second-quarter profit 21 per cent below their level at the same time last year – its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to $15.58.There was weakness in the agricultural sector as Archer Daniels Midland fell 5.2 per cent to $28.81 after it reported falling revenues and profit, with demand for its oilseed and other commodities remaining low. Monsanto lost 2.6 per cent to $84.02.Shares in PepsiCo rose 5.1 per cent to $59.06 after the company agreed the purchase of its two large bottling companies.Pepsi increased its offer to $36.50 a share for Pepsi Bottling and $28.50 a share for Pepsi-Americas. Pepsi Bottling rose 8.5 per cent to $36.49 and PepsiAmericas gained 9 per cent to close at $28.50.
316;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-08-04T14:13:22Z;ADM profits slide in fourth quarter;;Archer Daniels Midland on Tuesday reported an 83 per cent drop in fourth quarter income, as flagging demand for oilseeds, ethanol and agricultural services hit the world’s largest grain processor.Fourth-quarter net income fell to $64m from $372m the previous year, while net sales and other operating income fell 24 per cent to $16.53bn. Earnings per share fell to $0.10, a level last seen in 2001, compared with the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of $0.44.Higher corn costs and a lower demand for ethanol, which can be blended with petrol as a fuel substitute, savaged the company’s corn-processing operating profit. Income fell from $262m at the end of the fourth quarter 2008 to a loss of $11m at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009. For the year, profits in the unit declined 80.1 per cent to $185m.The Illinois-based company said slacking demand for agricultural commodities hit its agricultural services unit. For the quarter, the division lost $17m, compared with a gain of $106m for the quarter a year ago. The unit’s annual profits fell 2.3 per cent.The company’s oilseed processing unit was also hit by falling demand, with quarterly profits falling 39.5 per cent to $227m. Profits for the year rose 23.1 per cent to $1.2bn.The company registered a financial operating loss for the year of $6m, compared with a gain of $429m for fiscal year 2009, as the company was hit by losses on managed fund investments, increased captive insurance loss provisions, and decreased interest income in its brokerage services business.But the company had a positive outlook. “As we look ahead, we see signs of improving demand in the various food feed and fuel markets we serve. We remain financially strong and well positioned to capture value as global markets recover,” said chief executive Patricia Woertz in a statement.ADM fell 3.75 per cent to 29.25 in midday trade in New York.
317;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-08-02T22:22:26Z;Japan thinks global to fix food shortage;;After focusing on oil, metals and minerals for decades, Japan’s huge trading houses are turning to agricultural commodities, with Tokyo enthusiastically supporting the shift amid concerns about local and global food security.The move by the sogo shosha, or general trading companies, comes as the Japanese government prepares to launch plans this month to finance investment in food production overseas . Japan is the world’s largest net importer of food, buying in more than $40bn (€28bn, £24bn).Japanese officials say the 2007-08 food crisis stemmed from decades of under-investment in agriculture, a view shared by the Group of Eight rich countries. Tokyo believes that expanding food production, through public-private partnership with its local trading houses and other companies, will help mitigate future risks.Among Japan’s five mammoth trading houses, Mitsui & Co, Itochu and Marubeni are expanding into food commodities such as soyabean, palm oil, wheat and corn. Mitsubishi and Sumitomo appear more cautious, industry observers say.“The Japanese trading houses are expanding more aggressively into agriculture, particularly investing in assets such as elevators and export terminals,” says Philippe de Lapérouse, at US-based agribusiness consultants HighQuest Partners in St Louis.The move could trigger friction with US agricultural commodities majors Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and France’s Louis Dreyfus. The four are known in the industry as the “ABCD” after their ­initials.Richard Feltes, head of commodities research at brokerage MF Global in Chicago, says the new entrants will have to prove their competitiveness by offering better prices and more efficient logistics in a tough market. “It can be done,” he says. “But they are facing huge competitors that have been trading agriculture commodities for generations.”The Japanese approach differs from that of countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, which want to secure resources to feed their own populations. Rather, Tokyo and the trading houses want to increase global supplies, by seeking opportunities abroad.Beyond their homeland, where demand for grains and oilseeds is relatively stable, industry observers say the Japanese trading houses seek to tap the voracious appetite for soyabean and grains in China and elsewhere in Asia, particularly in Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, or in Middle-East countries such as Saudi Arabia.Seeking access to the Chinese market, Itochu has allied with Cofco, China’s largest largest grain processor, while Marubeni last year formed a joint-venture with Sinograin, Beijing’s state-owned corporation for stockpiling grains and oilseeds.Mitsui, the second-largest Japanese trading house, is investing in overseas farmland, including the purchase two years ago of 100,000 hectares in Brazil, to secure its own source of agricultural commodities.Itochu, Japan’s fourth-largest trading company, aims to double the volume of grains and oilseeds it handles to 20m tonnes in 2011, from today’s 11m-12m tonnes after it completes an export terminal on the US Pacific coast.
318;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-07-22T16:26:22Z;Wilmar aims for $4bn in HK listing;;Wilmar International, the Singapore-based agribusiness, is looking to raise up to $4bn through a listing of its China-related operations in Hong Kong by the first half of 2010, according to people familiar with the situation.The company is seen as an Asian version of US-based ADM and Bunge in terms of its agricultural processing operations, with ADM holding a stake in the group. The company’s China business mainly consists of edible oil processing and consumer packaging.Wilmar told the Singapore Stock Exchange this month that it might float 20-30 per cent of the China business. Based on that amount, this would value the entire China unit at up to $14bn.News of Wilmar’s listing comes amid a pickup in new listings in Asia spurred on by a revival in investor confidence. Hong Kong has dominated Asia’s initial public offering market this year, with 16 companies raising a total of $2.6bn, according to data from Dealogic. China Zhongwang’s $1.27bn IPO was the largest in Hong Kong this year.This week Wynn Resorts, the gaming group controlled by Steve Wynn, said it hoped to float a minimum 25 per cent interest in its Macao operations in Hong Kong by the end of this year, potentially raising as much as $2bn. Last week, China Pacific, a Shanghai-listed insurer, revived plans for what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar listing in Hong Kong.However, all eyes are on mainland China after Beijing recently lifted a suspension on IPOs that was imposed last September. China State Construction Engineering Corp plans to raise as much as Rmb50.2bn ($7.3bn) in a Shanghai IPO this month.Kuok Khoon Hong, Wilmar’s chief executive, first raised the possibility in May of the listing of the China business, saying at the time that it could take place either in Hong Kong or Shanghai in an effort to “unlock shareholder value”.A listing by Wilmar would increase the company’s free float of 17 per cent – which is seen as low when the group has the second-highest market value on the Singapore Exchange – and could raise its weighting in the MSCI index.“A listing would give Wilmar the advantage of being regarded as a domestic company by Chinese market regulators,” said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam at RBS Securities in Singapore.He added: “If people see the Wilmar IPO as another green shoot, it is a pretty chunky one …A dual listing in China would raise Wilmar’s profile.”Wilmar has appointed Bank of China International, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for the listing. Wilmar would not comment, while BOC, Goldman and Morgan were unavailable for comment.
319;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-05-05T20:27:07Z;US stocks slip as investors bank profits;;"US stocks slipped on Tuesday as investors worried about the government’s stress tests on banks took profits following a stellar previous session that took the benchmark S&P 500 index into positive territory for the year.Rumours surrounding the results of the tests on banks’ balance sheets continued to dominate Wall Street, with reports suggesting that 10 of the 19 tested banks may need to boost their capital to weather a deeper recession.There was a mixed reaction to the rumours, with several banks giving up some of the gains made during Monday’s rally. Wells Fargo, which jumped more than 23 per cent during the previous session, fell 4 per cent to $23.27. JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon said “the banking system can handle an awful lot of loss and be okay”, fell 2.7 per cent to $34.82.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global said: “The market seemed a little bit rose-
coloured yesterday but investors have become more pessimistic again today.”But Bank of America and Citigroup, which some analysts say already have the prospect of further equity raising priced into their stock, both found gains. Bank of America rose 4.4 per cent to $10.84, while Citigroup climbed 3.4 per cent to $3.31.There was further support for financials from Principal Financial Group, the life assurer, which jumped 10.8 per cent to $18.75 after first-quarter sales boosted its profits, even though the company missed earnings estimates as the value of its investments fell.The S&P 500 lost 0.4 per cent to 903.80 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.5 per cent to 1,754.12 points. The Dow Jones was marginally stronger, down 0.2 per cent to 8,410.65 points.Colin Cieszynski, analyst at CMC Markets, said the moderate movements were actually a good sign. “This can be viewed as a sign of accumulation and provides a significant contrast to last autumn when each bounce was met with a wall of selling,” he wrote.Steel companies fell after AK Steel warned it would make a wider-than-expected second-quarter loss as struggling carmakers General Motors and Chrysler cut orders. AK Steel shed
8.1 per cent to $14.39, while US Steel dropped 2.1 per cent to $30.81.Energy companies were also heavy fallers as the oil price fell from a five-month high and Chesapeake Energy reported widening losses. The company was forced to write down the value of its oil and natural gas businesses amid falling prices. Chesapeake fell 10.6 per cent to $20.40, and the energy sector was the worst-performing on the S&P, losing 1.3 per cent.The losses came in spite of positive words on the economy from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Bernanke said he saw the housing market stabilising, but job losses continuing to rise.Investors also seemed little reassured by figures showing that non-manufacturing activity slowed its contraction during April.DR Horton disappointed the market after the homebuilder reported a wider loss than analysts had predicted. Revenue from homebuilding fell sharply, cancelling out a steep fall in writedowns. The company’s shares gave up 8.5 per cent to $12.35.However, consumer companies received a boost after Kraft Foods, which makes household brands such as Maxwell House coffee, reported better-than-expected profits as dairy costs fell. The company’s shares rose 4 per cent to $25.22.There was also good news on consumer activity from MGM Mirage, the casino operator that has been restructuring its debts recently in the face of a sharp fall in revenues.The company posted a surprise first-quarter profit after selling one of its casinos, and also said that occupancy rates at its hotels had begun to recover. Its shares jumped 35.6 per cent to $12.80.Avon Products took some of the shine off the sector after the cosmetics retailer earned less than analysts had forecast, with sales and revenues falling. The shares lost 8.5 per cent to $23.08.Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural processor, also missed analysts’ forecasts after suffering a 98 per cent drop in profits.Demand for the company’s oilseeds and agricultural services dropped and the stock fell 8.9 per cent to $23.84."
320;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Fall in oilseed demand hits ADM;;Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, on Tuesday reported weak quarterly results due to flagging demand for oilseeds and a contraction in its agricultural services business.The company, a leading ethanol producer, said its third-quarter net profit fell by 98 per cent to $8m, or 1 cent a share, disappointing analysts’ expectations. Excluding the effects of two one-time charges that accounted for a currency loss and a tax charge, ADM would have earned a net profit $237m, or 37 cents a share.ADM has been hit by a slumping appetite for ethanol due to lower petrol prices. US production capacity for ethanol has slowed due to weaker demand for the petrol substitute.Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts that ADM was eagerly awaiting plans by the US government to show more support for biofuels and was hopeful for higher ethanol “blend rates” with regular petrol. The current blend rate is 10 per cent and Ms Woertz said that even an increase to 12 per cent would “allow additional ethanol to flow to the markets”.US President Barack Obama’s administration announced a move to expand access to biofuels through a new raft of incentives and subsidies. The US government also said it would push the car industry to produce vehicles that can accommodate higher concentrations of ethanol.ADM’s sales were down by 21 per cent to $14.8bn in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting the company to produce net profit of 49 cents a share on revenues of $17.2bn.The Illinois-based company said its performance was hit by diminished demand in North America for oilseeds, which it crushes and processes.Higher corn costs stunted its corn processing business as sales slowed. ADM’s corn processing net profit plunged by 71.5 per cent.Meanwhile, ADM said that a glut of agricultural commodities mixed with a weaker appetite for them due to the economic downturn meant fewer merchandising and handling opportunities for its agricultural services. ADM’s agricultural services profits were off by 67 per cent compared with the same quarter last year.“ADM’s results have begun to come in line with the realities of the [agricultural] market, which are pointing towards softening trends,” David Driscoll, analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients.The results sent shares of ADM down by 8.87 per cent to $23.85 in midday trading on Tuesday.

Bank of America rose 2.5 per cent to $10.64 while Citigroup gained 4.8 per cent to $3.35.There was further support for financial stocks from Principal Financial Group, the life insurer, which jumped 13.8 per cent to $19.26 despite missing analysts’ expectations with its first quarter earnings after the company’s investments suffered in the market slump.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 905.8 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.7 per cent to 1,752.08 points. The Dow Jones was stronger, however, rising 0.2 per cent to 8,442.59 points.Some of the losses were erased as Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, started speaking to Congress about the state of the economy. Mr Bernanke was due to say he sees the housing market stabilising, but that job losses will continue to rise.Equities were also helped by figures showing that non-manufacturing activity slowed its contraction during April.McKesson, the pharmaceutical company, beat analysts; estimates with its earnings, but fell back before the bell after it lowered its earnings forecast the full year, which it said assumed the economy and financial markets would stay flat for most of the fiscal year until March 2010. Its shares lost 1.6 per cent to $39.75.DR Horton also disappointed the market after the homebuilder reported a loss of 34 cents per share, wider than analysts had predicted. Revenue from homebuilding fell sharply, cancelling out a steep fall in writedowns also. The company shares gave up 7.3 per cent to $12.51.But consumer companies received a boost after Kraft Foods, which makes household brands such as Oreo cookies and Maxwell House coffee, reported better profits than expected as dairy costs fell. The company did not raise its full year outlook, but the shares rose 5.8 per cent to $25.66.There was also good news on consumer activity from MGM Mirage, the casino operator which has been restructuring its debts recently in the face of a sharp fall in revenues. The company posted a surprise first quarter profit after selling one of its casinos, and also said occupancy rates at its hotels had begun to recover. Its shares jumped 17 per cent to $11.04.But Avon Products took some of the shine off the sector after the cosmetics retailer earned less than analysts had forecast, with sales and revenues falling. The company was also hurt by a strong dollar, and lost 3.5 per cent to $24.33.Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural processor, also missed analysts forecasts after suffering a 98 per cent drop in profits. The company suffered as demand for its oilseeds and agricultural services fell amid the deepening recession, as well as having to pay two one-off charges on equity investments. The company’s shares fell 6.2 per cent to $24.54.European stocks were up early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.9 per cent higher at 850.31 points.

322;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-04-22T01:52:04Z;Weak sterling and merger charges unsettle ABF;;Margins at discount fashion chain Primark are set to suffer later this year as its owner, Associated British Foods, grapples with the sharp decline in sterling.John Bason, finance director, said on Tuesday that one effect of the weaker pound would be a reduction in Primark’s margins in the “10s of basis points” range as ABF bought clothes from China and India pegged to the dollar.George Weston, chief executive, said it was too early to say whether Primark – which has ridden the wave of cash-strapped consumers trading down – would have to put its prices up, as some of the effect would be offset by cheaper costs elsewhere.Primark enjoyed like-for-like sales growth of 5 per cent in the half-year and Mr Weston said it had “entered the second half with a similar sort of momentum”. He was “comfortable” with Easter trading.The comments came as ABF reported a fall in pre-tax profit from £267m ($392m) to £178m in the 24 weeks to February 28, primarily due to a £60m charge in relation to the merger of its North American edible oils business with Archer Daniels Midland.Underlying profit fell by a better-than-expected 2 per cent to £275m, driven by Primark and an improvement in sugar.The grocery division fared less well, however, after ABF bought future supplies of corn oil at high prices.The grocery division was also hit by customers trading down from brands such as Twinings Tea. Sales of foods used by Indian and Chinese restaurants also fell as households cut back on take-aways.However, people are buying more curry sauces and home-baking products are up by double digits in the US.“This is entertaining your kids on the weekend without going to the theme park,” Mr Weston said.Net debt was £1.14bn, £352m higher than at the year end. The financial turmoil turned an £85m pension surplus into a £274m deficit.An interim dividend of 6.9p (6.75p) is payable from earnings per share of 17.6p (25.6p).●FT CommentWhile pressure in the sugar market is off, ABF faces headwinds in the form of higher buying costs at Primark and recessionary conditions in grocery. Credit Suisse is forecasting flat full-year pre-tax profit of £632m, and earnings per share of 55.15p. The shares, which rose 32p to 686p, trade on a forward price/earnings ratio of about 12, a premium to the food producers. While this is justified by the presence of Primark in the group, a higher mark-up would look excessive, given the challenges that remain.
323;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-04-07T20:55:53Z;Wall Street falls on earnings fears;;US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors waited cautiously for Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, to kick off the earnings season after the close of the market.Alcoa dropped 1.5 per cent to $7.79 as analysts predicted that the company would make a first-quarter loss of $0.56 per share, with falling global demand taking its toll on profits. Its shares slipped further after the market closed when it reported a net loss of $0.61 a share, or $497m, on revenue of $4.1bn.Worries over earnings also weighed on Caterpillar, the machinery maker, which dropped 5.9 per cent to $29.45 after Andrew Obin, a Bank of America analyst, said the company was likely to make a wider first quarter loss than expected.“Investors are taking a little bit of profit off the table ahead of earnings,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “The financials have managed to rally over 60 per cent in the last few weeks. But I do not think anyone knows what their earnings are going to be like, so some of that money is coming back out.”This followed a subdued session on Monday, during which volumes were low and the market adjusted to the views of Mike Mayo, one of the first analysts to turn bearish on the banking sector, that banks might suffer the worst loan losses since the Great Depression.Those fears were exacerbated on Tuesday after it was reported that the International Monetary Fund is set to forecast global losses on toxic assets of up to $4,000bn.Citi added to the gloom when its analysts cut the US equities market as a whole to “underweight”, saying valuations did not look “particularly attractive”.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 2.4 per cent down at 815.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3 per cent to 7,789.56 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8 per cent to 1,561.61.“The market overextended on the way up and we’re seeing it correct itself a bit now,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “Equities have a tendency to overshoot in both directions.”But Lincoln National provided a bright spot amid a falling financial sector after the life insurer said it was considering selling assets to build capital as it pays down $700m in debt. Its shares gained 8.2 per cent to $6.89.Health insurers also performed well after Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a government agency, said that it would increase its basline payments to those companies by 0.8 per cent, higher than originally proposed.Humana gained 6.1 per cent to $27.92, while UniteHealth picked up 6.9 per cent to $23.45 and Coventry Health lifted 3.5 per cent to $14.26.General Motors fell, giving up all of the gains made during the previous session, after Bloomberg reported that the company was speeding up preparations for bankruptcy. Its shares lost 11.9 per cent to $2.Ford fell 7.4 per cent, meanwhile, to $3.49 as investors took profits after its shares jumped 16 per cent during the previous session on the news that it had swapped $9.9bn worth of debt for cash and shares.Sun Microsystems, the previous session’s heaviest faller, continued to lose ground as analysts predicted the technology company would find it difficult to find another suitor after IBM withdrew its offer for the company over the weekend. Sun’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to $6.28.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Applied Materials shed 8.7 per cent to $10.55 after the computer chipmaker said a $1.9bn solar power contract had been cut to $250m.In oil, Exxon Mobil retreated 1.9 per cent to $68.71 after Barclays cut its 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates for the energy company, having lowered its estimates for natural gas prices.Archer-Daniels-Midland, the agricultural conglomerate, lost 10.6 per cent to $25.66 after Citi recommended selling the shares, saying the decline in its agricultural services business had been extremely fast.Utilities was the only sector briefly to find gains during the day, pulled upwards in part by PG&E, the Californian energy provider, which was upgraded by Credit Suisse. Analysts at the Swiss bank said the Californian regulatory environment would help the company maximise its earnings. PG&E shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.83.

A “substantial margin reduction” at ACH, its North American edible oils business, which includes the Mazola brand, and downtrading by consumers were blamed.ABF said adjusted operating profits for the half-year to February 28 would be slightly down on the £296m reported a year ago, but it still expected adjusted earnings for the full year to be little changed. The shares eased 2p to 643p.Primark achieved an increase of 5 per cent in like-for-like sales in the half year, a better performance than most of the UK high street. However, the costs of operating a new distribution centre would weigh on margins, the group cautioned. This is designed to cope with expansion of the chain, which is to open its first shops in Germany and Portugal shortly.ABF said its European and South African sugar businesses performed well in the half year, offsetting weakness in its Chinese sugar subsidiary. John Bason, finance director, said the EU-based businesses were improving faster than expected after the EU sugar regime changes, and the years of declining profits were “well and truly behind us now”.The grocery division is expected to take a £20m charge from the difficulties at ACH, although Mr Bason said margins should recover in the second half.The planned merger of ACH with the oils business of Archer Daniels Midland should benefit the group from having a half share of a bigger, more profitable business, Mr Bason said. But it would contribute the large part of an £80m exceptional charge.The group is finalising a $600m private placement with UK and US institutional lenders. Mr Bason said it currently relied on bank finance, but the new debt would diversify sources of finance and provide flexibility if the group wanted to make an acquisition, for example.It would lead to higher interest charges in the second half, but Mr Bason said he expected the fixed coupon “will turn out to be quite attractive in the medium term”.

Archer Daniels Midland was among the worst-performing in the sector, in spite of well-received results earlier in the week.Shares in the food processor shed 7.6 per cent to $25.54 after JPMorgan analysts downgraded their view of the stock to “neutral”.“We are becoming increasingly cautious on the forward outlook and, given the stock’s recent performance, believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines,” wrote the analysts.Consumer staples shed 2.6 per cent overall, while healthcare – another traditionally defensive sector – also underperformed.Consumer discretionary stocks also did badly. Walt Disney shed 7.9 per cent to $19 as analysts took a dim view of the group’s first-quarter results. The figures prompted Citigroup analysts to cut their price target to $18 and retain a “sell” rating. Retailers did badly, down 2.3 per cent overall, ahead of a glut of closely-watched sales figures due for release on Thursday.Still, economic data that, although glum, was not quite as bleak as feared helped support the market early in the session and the S&P 500 rallied as much as 1.6 per cent.The market advanced after data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US service sector once again shrank in January but at least at a slower pace than expected.Some private sector unemployment data that was also marginally better than
forecast provided some additional supportYet an afternoon sell-off left the benchmark index 0.8 per cent lower at 832.22 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.5 per cent at 7,956.66. Strength in the technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite Index stay in positive territory for much of the day but it, too, succumbed to close 0.1 per cent weaker at 1,515.05.Trading in the financial sector was particularly volatile amid uncertainty over the Obama administration’s plans to shore up embattled banks. Certain institutions did especially badly on persistent concerns over the threat of outright nationalisation.Bank of America hit a fresh low for the decade, down 11.3 per cent to $4.70. Among the regional banks to do poorly, Fifth Third and Huntington Bancshares lost 14 per cent to $1.54 and 20.4 per cent to $1.54, respectively.Developments in Washington remained at the forefront of investor concerns elsewhere as the Senate edged closer to passing the $900bn stimulus plan.Strength in the materials sector, up 1.5 per cent overall, provided support to the market while energy stocks also found positive territory following the latest weekly inventories data.Technology stocks also outperformed as investors snapped up cash-rich names. Intel and Microsoft climbed 2.1 per cent to $13.88, and 5.1 per cent to $18.63, respectively.Cisco added 1.4 per cent to $15.80 and a further 1.2 per cent after the market closed, when the network equipment maker disclosed results that topped forecasts.However, media stocks came under pressure after Time Warner forecast flat profits this year.

326;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-02-03T12:55:45Z;ADM quarterly profits jump 24%;;Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, reported on Tuesday that its second quarter earnings rose by 24 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations and bucking the recent trend of grim corporate results.Net income at ADM increased to $585m, or 91 cents a share, compared with $473m, or 73 cents, in the same period the previous year. The company reported second quarter revenue increased by 1 per cent to $16.7bn.“Our balance sheet is strong, and we are focused on managing our business in these challenging markets,” Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive, said in a statement.Analysts expected ADM to report second quarter earnings of 68 cents a share, down from $1.63 in the previous quarter. Revenue was predicted to fall to $16.97bn, down from $21.16bn.ADM, a leading ethanol producer, notched a strong performance in spite of weakness in the ethanol market. The company showed growth in its oilseed processing and agricultural services divisions. Corn processing profits, however, fell by 89 per cent in the quarter as demand for ethanol waned.The Illinois-based company has sought to diversify into other businesses and parts of the world. In January ADM signed a deal to buy Schokinag-Schokolade-Industrie Herrmann, a German chocolate maker, as it seeks to expand into the cocoa business. Last year ADM moved into Brazil’s sugar-based ethanol industry in an effort to diversify from corn-based production.Shares of ADM rose by 3.64 per cent to $28.50 in pre-market trading on Tuesday.
327;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-01-11T22:24:20Z;Rescue bid for builder;;A group of investors including HBOS and property specialists the Reuben brothers has made a takeover offer to McCarthy & Stone’s lenders.The builder of retirement homes needs to cut its debt and HBOS and the Reubens, two leading shareholders, have teamed up with distressed debt investor ADM Capital to offer about £60m of new funds in exchange for majority control.As part of the proposal, holders of senior debt would have to write off more than half of their debt claims, leaving the company with less than €300m (£267m) of cash-interest bearing debt after the restructuring, according to people close to the situation.The new funds would be used to provide those lenders with a cash exit if they wanted to reduce their exposure to the company.Junior creditors, who include HBOS, the Reuben Brothers and ADM, would write off debt in exchange for a share of the remaining equity in the company after a restructuring. The three investors would get more than 50 per cent of the builder for providing the new funds.HBOS and the Reubens are leading shareholders in McCarthy & Stone. Together with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish entrepreneur, they bought the company for £1.1bn in 2007. HBOS owns 20 per cent. .A group of senior lenders have already put together a rival debt restructuring plan, where they would become owners of the business in exchange for writing off some debt claims.McCarthy & Stone is one of many companies in the construction sector struggling with debt. Lenders have agreed a so-called “stand-still” arrangement until March to avoid a breach of covenants.McCarthy & Stone declined to comment on Sunday.Retirement home builders are among the worst affected by the construction downturn. Administrators were called in to three subsidiaries of Prestigious Retirement Villages after they ran out of cash in October.HBOS also owns 45 per cent of the housebuilder Crest Nicholson, alongside Sir Tom’s West Coast Capital. Lenders to Crest Nicholson are also negotiating a debt restructuring.
328;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2009-01-07T18:31:19Z;Monsanto boosted by South American demand;;Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, brushed off the gloom in the corporate world on Wednesday as it said first-quarter profits had more than doubled and lifted its earnings outlook for the full year on the back of continuing strong demand in South America.The company said its net income for the three months to the end of November – its fiscal first quarter – rose to $556m or $1 a share from $256m or 46 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding extraordinary items, Monsanto earned 98 cents a share, up from 45 cents in the previous year and well ahead of analysts’ expectations of about 59 cents.Monsanto, best known for its genetically-modified seeds, said the healthy results were prompting it to raise its outlook for the year to $4.40-$4.50 a share from $4.20-$4.40 a share. Shares in Monsanto jumped 16 per cent to $84.69 in early afternoon trading in New York on Wednesday.It attributed much of that to the strength of its South American business. Monsanto recently launched corn seed products in Brazil and Argentina.“While no business is recession-proof, agriculture tends more than most to retain its intrinsic value in difficult times,” said Hugh Grant, chairman and chief executive.“Fundamentally, our ability in tough times to grow market share, increase trait penetration and lift our financial commitments is the difference in being a technology company in an agricultural industry dominated by commodities and, unfortunately, by commodity mentalities.”Monsanto’s bullish outlook bucks a trend among global agribusinesses. In Brazil, big farm lenders such as Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland have cut back on loans.John Deere, the world’s biggest maker of tractors, has warned that demand for agricultural equipment could drop by a fifth this year in emerging economies as farmers find it increasingly difficult to access credit markets.In the US, analysts expect farmers’ net incomes to drop this year by up to 42 per cent, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has said that agricultural lenders are reporting tighter credit standards and that it expects reductions in the availability of funding.“The strong start to the Latin American season is a huge positive,” said Terry Crews, finance chief.“All signs point to the makings of a premium corn-seed business there. That said, we remain cautious from a credit perspective as we go into the second season in Brazil.”Monsanto also said it had moved to the final phase of developing the world’s first drought-tolerant corn seeds. It said field trials for drought-tolerant corn conducted last year in the US had exceeded target yields and added that it had submitted the product to the Food and Drug Administration in the US for regulatory clearance ahead of a planned market launch “early next decade”.
329;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-12-09T21:19:43Z;Brazil farmers lose debt battle;;Emerson Spigosso, a 34-year-old farmer in Mato Grosso state, central Brazil, has no idea how to pay his debts.“The bank came to take my combine harvesters away but they couldn’t find them,” he says. “So they executed my debt through the courts. There’s no way I can pay.”Like many local farmers, Mr Spigosso invested in land and machinery earlier this decade, as Brazil rose to prominence as a global supplier of soya and other foods.But drought, crop disease, a strengthening currency and awful infrastructure have eroded the advantages Mato Grosso’s farmers used to have over competitors in the US, Argentina and southern Brazil.Now the global credit crunch has brought their difficulties to a crisis. Banks are repossessing farm machinery. Credit for fertiliser and other inputs has dried up. Soya production in the state is likely to fall by 10 per cent this year, farmers say. Next year, it could fall by two-thirds.Until recently, Mato Grosso’s farmers had little to complain of. Between 1990 and 2004, the amount of cultivated land in the state more than quadrupled, from 1.9m to 8.6m hectares – an area bigger than Austria. Today, Mato Grosso produces 30 per cent of the soya in Brazil, or 8 per cent of total world output.But from the 2004-2005 season, things began to go wrong. Two successive harvests were hit by drought and disease. Brazil’s currency strengthened steadily against the US dollar, eroding farmers’ earnings.Such difficulties exposed others. Farmers in Mato Grosso are up to 2,000km from the ports of Santos and Paranaguá, and up to 1,500km from Porto Velho, an inland port on a tributary of the Amazon which itself is 1,900km from the Atlantic coast. Most crops are carried along atrocious roads on double-trailer trucks, a hugely inefficient system. According to Agroconsult, a farm consultancy, this season it will cost $106 a tonne to ship soya to port from Mato Grosso, compared with an average of $30 in the US.As difficulties have mounted, many farmers have got deep in debt. Subsidised finance for farm machinery, for example, is provided by the BNDES, Brazil’s national development bank, channelled through high street banks and others run by manufacturers such as John Deere and Case New Holland, who shoulder the risk of non-performance.Most loans are paid back over five years. When farmers ran into trouble in 2005, the government ruled instalments due that year could be paid in 2010. Then it said instalments due in 2006 could be paid in 2011. In 2007, it said farmers must pay 15 per cent of what they owed, and the rest in 2012. This year, it said farmers must pay 40 per cent, and the rest in 2013.In Mato Grosso last week, the FT spoke to 26 farmers, just one of whom had made his 40 per cent payment this year, by selling land. The government has provided R$500m ($203m, €156m, £137m) in credit to help pay loans on machinery, but most cannot use it because they have no collateral.Mr Spigosso’s situation is typical. He bought one combine harvester in 2001 for R$220,000 and another in 2003 for R$280,000. Because of accumulated interest, the debt on his two machines has grown to R$800,000, while the machines’ value has fallen to less than half that amount.Altogether, the government has provided R$13bn in extra farm finance this year but, like the loans for machinery, few farmers in Mato Grosso can use it. Ana Laura Menegatti of MB Agro, a farm consultancy in São Paulo, says that out of R$49bn made available to finance this year’s planting before the emergency funding, just R$18.5bn was actually lent to farmers nationwide. “Banks don’t like the risk and there is too much bureaucracy, so very little finance gets to the farmers,” she says.The situation has been aggravated this year because big trading companies such as Bunge, ADM and Cargill are lending much less to farmers than usual. Luis Carlos Guedes, head of agribusiness at Banco do Brasil, a government-controlled bank, says big traders supply about half the farm credit in Mato Grosso and have pulled back sharply because of the credit crunch.He says the government should break the cycle of endlessly delayed payments on subsidised credit, which costs about R$4bn a year, and spend the money instead on instruments to guarantee a minimum level of income to producers. This would give banks the security they need to lend.Edílson Guimarães, secretary for farm policy at the ministry of agriculture, says the proposal makes sense but that the government has shorter-term problems, such as the stock of outstanding debt, to deal with first.As one farmer in Mato Grosso put it, the Banco do Brasil proposal is “our dream solution”. But while funding remains unavailable, the farmers’ predicament can only get worse.
330;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-11-26T20:28:07Z;Deere lowers profit outlook amid credit crisis;;Demand for agricultural equipment could drop 20 per cent next year in emerging economies as farmers find it increasingly difficult to access credit markets, the world’s biggest maker of tractors and other farm machinery warned on Wednesday.John Deere’s warning comes as profits are expected to collapse in North American agriculture. Analysts expect that US farmers’ net incomes will drop by up to 42 per cent next year.The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said this month that agricultural lenders are reporting tighter credit standards and said it expected further reductions in the availability of funding. Global agriculture is also facing much tighter credit conditions. In Brazil, big lenders such as Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland have cut back on loans.That could prompt a repeat of this year’s food crisis as farmers reduce crop planting leading to a spike in crop prices next year, the United Nations has cautioned.“Under the current gloomy prospects for agricultural prices, high input costs and more difficult access to credit, farmers may cut their plantings, which might again result in a tightening of world food supplies,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation said in a recent report.Deere issued its gloomy outlook as it reported a fall in fourth-quarter profits to $345m, or 81 cents per share, down from $422m, or 94 cents per share, for the same period last year. Profits for the latest quarter came in well below analysts’ expectations of about 99 cents per share.The poor fourth quarter came at the end of a highly successful financial year for the company, in which its bottom line was boosted by strong crop prices and the increase in demand from emerging economies. Full-year profits came in at a record $2.1bn, up from $1.8bn last year.However, the dramatic fall in crop prices in recent months, coupled with the downturn in the global economy, are taking their toll on the company. Deere said it expected farm machinery sales to fall by 10 to 20 per cent in South America next year, a drop of 5 to 10 per cent in western Europe and more moderate declines in central and eastern Europe.The company lowered its profits forecast for next year, saying it expected net income of $1.9bn, below the $2.2bn expected by analysts.Deere shares rose 8.04 per cent to $35.76 on Wednesday.Deere has become increasingly dependent on markets such as Brazil and Russia: this financial year, for the first time more than 50 per cent of its agricultural sales came from outside North America. Its Brazilian subsidiary laid off 200 employees last month as Argentine customers cancelled purchases of more than 300 combine harvesters and agricultural sales in Brazil slowed.“Given the sudden, sharp downturn in global economic activity, and the ongoing turmoil in world financial markets, the outlook for the year ahead is highly uncertain,” said Robert Lane, chief executive.
331;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
332;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-11-25T22:36:52Z;Crop crunch;;"Between seed, fertiliser, land and farm equipment, it can cost millions to fund a modern farm. Yet farmers get paid only at harvest time. Many rely on loans secured against future crops to finance their day-to-day operations. Now, that credit may be drying up.In Brazil, the world’s second biggest producer of corn and soyabeans, agricultural processors such as Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland have cut back lending after high input prices and falling commodities prices led some farmers to miss loan payments. Such processors account for about 60 per cent of farm finance in Brazil’s remote central west.The extent of the squeeze is unclear. Farmers say lending by processors has all but stopped while the processors themselves say they are merely tightening at the margins. Whatever the case, the Brazilian government is worried. Amid reports that banks have begun to repossess harvesting machines, it has approved $5.4bn in extra funding for farmers. Last week, it warned that it may not be enough to fix the problem.Brazil’s location in the southern hemisphere means its planting season has coincided with the worst of the market meltdown but there are signs that farm credit is tightening in the north as well. In Russia, interest rates on farm loans rose in recent months. In the US, policymakers have begun to warn of softer credit next year as lenders raise loan standards and increase collateral requirements.What is a farmer to do? Many US farmers have the cash to get by without a big drop in production but farmers elsewhere may have to save money by using less fertiliser or letting less productive land lie fallow. That could hit production at a time when food stockpiles are already at low levels – all the more reason to fear a spike in food prices next year.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

The gains were comfortably the greatest of all presidential election days since 1984. In the years before then, markets had been closed on the day of the ballot.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, shed 11.2 per cent to 47.69 points.Upbeat corporate earnings, further easing of strain in money markets, and the prospect of more policy measures to help prevent a global recession also gave a boost.A diverse range of companies, such as MasterCard, Emerson Electric and Viacom reported better-than-expected quarterly figures. Shares in the three companies roose 18.3 per cent to $170.24, 10.1 per cent to $35.86 and 7.5 per cent to $22.65, respectively.Energy led the gains, up 6.4 per cent as oil settled above $70 a barrel. Materials, industrials and financials followed closely behind.Archer Daniels Midland leapt 15.3 per cent to $24.33 after the food processor comfortably beat forecasts that had been lowered after rival Bunge’s failure to meet expectations. The later rose 8.6 per cent to $45.31.Elsewhere, CIT Group and General Electric jumped 36.1 per cent to $6.15 and 7.6 per cent to $20.77 respectively, on reports the Treasury might buy stakes in a wide range of financial companies, not only banks and insurers, under its $700bn rescue package.In technology, Google and Yahoo edged up 5.9 per cent to $366.94 and 4.7 per cent to $13.35, respectively, on reports the companies scaled back their proposed web advertising deal to win over antitrust officials.VMware shed 3.9 per cent to $30.56 on news that Intel was in the process of halving its stake in business software maker. The chipmaker gained 4 per cent to $16.26.Dell rallied 5.6 per cent but fell back to stand 2.5 per cent higher at $12.93 after reports emerged that the computer group had instituted a hiring freeze and asked employees to consider taking up to five days of unpaid leave.On the downside, Dean Foods dropped 17.6 per cent to $18.25 after the food group’s results fell short of expectations. The figures failed to drag down either peer Kraft Foods or the wider consumer staples sector, which were higher by 4.1 per cent at $30.51 and
2.3 per cent, respectively.An interest rate cut in Australia sparked hopes of further policy measures around the world. Tueday’s rally, coupled with the muted trading of the previous session, comes after the wild volatility that characterised October.“You may be asking yourself what exactly has changed in the last few days to stage this dramatic turn of events. Good question,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.Analysts remained divided on whether the market would extend its rally.Quincy Krosby, strategist at The Hartford, wrote in a note: “Given the oversold condition in the market, it is quite clear that we can build on this rally toward the year-end.”"
334;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-08-17T22:18:57Z;Food and consumer groups get hedge smart;;Food and consumer goods companies are overhauling the way they buy and hedge commodities after being caught out by increases in the prices of raw materials that have squeezed industry margins and cut profits.Companies are turning to commodity trading houses for the first time to hire traders and are buying complex financial trading systems to help them cope with a new era of global inflation.Such decisions suggest executives have realised that volatile commodity markets are not a short-term phenomenon but a structural change driven by ­rising demand from emerging markets.Peter Evans, co-ordinator of the European consumer products practice at headhunter Russell Reynolds Associates, said companies were approaching trading houses such as Cargill, Bunge and ADM to find traders who understood volatile markets.“If they can buy commodities more intelligently than their competitors, that can be a competitive advantage,” he said, adding that the firm had been hired to fill a new role of global commodities procurement director at one of the biggest food groups.Prices of some commodities, such as corn and wheat, are now fluctuating as much in a single day as they did in a year in the early 1990s.Brice Russell, chief procurement officer for food group Mars, said companies were poaching people from each other as well as from commodity trading houses because it was hard to find experienced people.“A lot of managers have not been in an inflationary environment before …they have to figure out how to manage it,” he said.Michael Schwartz, chief marketing officer at Triple Point, a US-based company that designs trading software for oil companies, miners and Wall Street banks, said: “Consumer industry companies are showing interest in managing their commodities exposure now in a way very much similar to the energy and metals companies.”Rick Hughes, vice-president of global purchases at Procter & Gamble, which hedges all kinds of commodities, said: “We’ve gone longer and hedged a broader portion of our portfolio.”Unilever created a position of chief purchasing officer a few months ago. Kellogg’s, which has hedged 90 per cent of its raw material exposure this year, said it hedged earlier, and PepsiCo said it was also hedging more.

I think that the dissent was less than expected, the Fed did what it was supposed to and then oil came in and gave markets a boost.”The day began in positive fashion after some estimate-beating results from Procter & Gamble cheered investors.The consumer products group behind Head & Shoulders shampoo, said fourth-quarter profits had jumped 33 per cent to $3.02bn as it passed on rising input costs to customers and benefited from the weak dollar which boosted foreign revenues.

off news that services industries in the US shrank for a second straight month in July.The consumer discretionary sector was among the leading gainers, adding 4.5 per cent with retailers making particularly strong progress after some data showed strong year-on-year same store sales last week.Macy’s surged 8.9 per cent to $19.49 and Sears Holdings rose 10.6 per cent to $91.56.Industrials and consumer staples also made ground adding 3 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.FedEx added 6.8 per cent to $83.99 and General Electric rose 3.8 per cent to $29.25 while Wal-Mart Stores rose 3.3 per cent to $60.34 and Tyson Foods gained 7.8 per cent to $16.16.Oil is now down nearly 20 per cent from its high on July 3. As oil has pulled back, energy stocks have suffered. On Monday, the S&P 500 energy sector dropped into bear market territory after declining more than 20 per cent from its record highs in May.But energy and material stocks made ground on Tuesday in spite of falling commodity prices.Refiners Tesoro and Sunoco rose 5.3 per cent to $41.89 and 4.1 per cent to $15.53, respectively, helping the energy sector to a 1.1 per cent gain.In materials, a rebound in metals stocks pushed the sector up 1.3 per cent. US Steel rose 2.4 per cent to $143.17, Allegheny Technologies added 4.8 per cent to $45.89 and Titanium Metals gained 7 per cent to $10.68.All 10 leading industry groups closed in positive territory helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 2.9 per cent to 1,284.88 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.9 per cent to 11,615.77 The Nasdaq Composite added 2.8 per cent to 2,349.83.On Monday, equity markets declined for a third straight session as a broad slide in commodity prices helped some stocks but hurt the heavily weighted energy and materials sectors.About 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies have reported in this earning season
and, on average, profits have declined about 19 per cent.On Tuesday, investors were presented with a mixed set of earnings reports. In addition to results from P&G, DR Horton also reported earnings. The largest US homebuilder reported a fifth straight quarterly loss and the shares dipped 0.3 per cent to $11.19.Archer Daniels Midland, the grain processor, said fourth-quarter profit dipped 61 per cent missing analyst estimates. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $25.87.Tenet HealthCare also lost ground, losing 8.2 per cent to $5.72 after it reported a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss but the healthcare sector as a whole gained 2.6 per cent nonetheless.Financials regained some ground, adding 5.1 per cent as oil prices slipped back.Lehman Brothers surged 12.8 per cent to $20.24, Citigroup added 5.8 per cent to $19.92 while JP Morgan advanced 4.4 per cent to $41.89.AIG was among the leading gainers, adding 12 per cent to $29.89 after analysts at UBS recommended that investors buy shares in the insurer saying it was “well-positioned” to absorb losses from credit-related assets."
336;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-08-05T19:51:48Z;ADM in talks to tap ethanol in Brazil;;Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, on Tuesday signalled a wave of expansion in Brazil as it struck a relatively gloomy note on US corn-based ethanol production.ADM, a leading ethanol producer, has been a cheerleader for the industry in the US but its expansion into Brazil’s sugar-based ethanol industry suggests it wants to diversify from corn-based production.The US ethanol industry has been under financial pressure in recent months as the price of corn spiralled. Although corn prices have dropped sharply in the past month, the industry still faces difficulties.The subsidies paid to the industry have come under increasing scrutiny as ethanol production is widely seen as contributing to the rising cost of food.About one-third of this year’s US corn production is expected to be used to make the fuel. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, is among those who oppose the subsidies.Last month ADM united with other big pro-ethanol companies in the agribusiness sector such as Monsanto, Deere and DuPont to make its case through adverts and to boost lobbying in the US Congress.John Rice, executive vice-president, commercial and production, noted on Tuesday that, at the same time that corn prices had increased, the industry was also facing a different series of higher costs.“The cost to build plants these days – with stainless steel, labour costs and everything else – is going up,” he said. “[Ethanol producers] don’t see the margin out there right now and finding capital is also very tough.”The downbeat tone on US ethanol contrasted with ADM’s Brazilian plans, as it confirmed reports it was in talks to move into sugar-based ethanol production.“We have been interested and continue to stay interested in an investment in sugar and ethanol processing in Brazil and we have talked with several potential partners,” said Patricia Woertz, chief executive.Mr Rice said the company would invest well beyond the ethanol industry. “We’re looking at this as a whole range of new opportunities for ADM,” he said.Ms Woertz also dismissed Brazil’s threat to take legal action against the US in the World Trade Organisation over ethanol tariffs.ADM on Tuesday reported quarterly results below Wall Street’s expectations as it failed to translate the commodity price boom into profit growth. Profits fell to $372m or 58 cents per share, down from $955m or $1.47 cents per share a year earlier, although the 2007 figures were boosted by several one-off transactions.ADM shares were down 5.8 per cent at $25.82 shortly before the close in New York.
337;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-05-12T07:52:27Z;A noble calling;;This is a great time for those managing the commodities supply chain. Just ask Noble Group, the Singapore-listed commodities supplier. Its first quarter net profit almost quadrupled year on year to $167m.Noble’s business revolves around bringing goods – from iron ore to soyabeans – from surplus countries into those where demand is growing. Richer diets, industrialisation and increasing populations make this a growth business: Noble notes that if Asia Pacific’s per capita demand for sugar, for example, matches Thailand and Taiwan’s, consumption will increase by 170 per cent. Noble has also tweaked its revenue model during the past few years with a view to increasing the number of points in the chain at which it can skim off profit. The group has invested more than $1bn in upstream assets, including port terminals and mines, since 2005.Nonetheless, the business of decanting commodities from fields and mines and into the hands of end-users is essentially one of volume. Operating margins are puny. Noble’s was 1.3 per cent last year and averages only about 2 per cent. This is lower than peers ADM and Bunge of the US that are more geared towards agricultural commodities. A bad year, like a bad harvest, can wipe out everything. In 1998, the Asian financial crisis pushed Noble into the red – although subsequent diversification means the group is now less exposed. In the absence of higher commodity prices, scope for expanding margins is essentially limited to increasing capacity or improving efficiencies – for example, by loading ships faster.Nor is revenue growth a given, although Noble reckons export bans slapped on a range of foodstuffs will have little impact on its business, since it largely imports or distributes into affected countries. Noble has certainly rewarded investors handsomely, providing total returns almost treble those of the Singapore benchmark index in the past five years. Commodity bulls should hang on for the ride.Post and read comments on this Lex
338;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM optimistic on global food supplies;;The scarcity in global food supplies should ease this year as agricultural production improves, Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, said on Tuesday.“While sometimes you read about a panic associated with crops, I think the supply fundamental of world crops is improving,” said Patricia Woertz, chairman and chief executive.“South American farmers are gathering a good harvest, in Europe we’re seeing better crop conditions than we’ve seen in a few years, and globally wheat supplies look to be rising.“Here in the US, the Department of Agriculture predicts increased soya bean production in 2008. However, of course planting is just getting started, so we will wait and see.”Average food prices have risen 45 per cent in the past nine months, sparking riots and export bans.This week Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary-general, said the world faced the risk of widespread hunger, malnutrition and social unrest.Ms Woertz hit back at critics of biofuels who say businesses such as ADM – one the biggest US producers of corn-based ethanol – are helping drive up food prices.“I empathise with the consumers who are paying way more for fuel at the pump and more for food,” she said.“However, the food prices are driven, as we know, by record energy costs.”She said she found it “sad” that “these misguided attacks on biofuels are directed at the one alternative we actually have today to transportation fuels”.Biofuels were “actually increasing fuel supplies”.Ms Woertz criticised attempts to reduce ethanol subsidies in the farm bill.“Biofuels are a real solution to world problems. Retreat from biofuels is wrong, it’s foolish, it’s dangerous…It won’t fill anybody’s stomach and won’t fill any gas tanks.”Her remarks came as ADM reported quarterly profits well ahead of expectations, underlining how some agribusinesses are benefiting from the boom in global food prices.Earnings rose to $517m, or 80 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter to March 31 from $363m, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts had been expecting earnings per share of about 70 cents.
339;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-02-04T22:41:27Z;ADM shrugs off price controls;;Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, on Monday shrugged off a growing global trend to impose price controls to combat food inflation, saying such policies would merely act to push exporters to other markets.“The world’s supply and demand of grains is really going to be the deciding factor in all this,” said Dwight Grimestad, ADM’s vice-president for investor relations.“If some country is a net importer and it puts in a price control and world demand for meal, oil, poultry and everything else is up, I don’t know how they can have that going in to their own country.”Food prices are increasing sharply globally, driven by rising demand from emerging markets, higher oil prices and the growth of corn-based ethanol production. A report released on Monday by Merrill Lynch found food-price inflation running at 15 per cent in China and 5 per cent in the US, the highest for 17 years.China imposed price controls on pork and eggs last month, while other countries including Russia, Thailand, Mexico and Venezuela are taking similar measures.“The law of supply and demand is playing very well in the farming markets right now,” said Mr Grimestad.“Everybody’s looking at the greater demand we’re seeing globally for both meal and oil. Putting in price controls can have an effect, but if we can move our products to other places for more money, people are going to be doing that. China put on price controls, but we’re still seeing them buy soya beans and a lot of vegetable oil. They’re trying to build up their reserves.”ADM posted second-quarter earnings ahead of expectations, helped by strong demand for protein meal and seed oil, and improved results in its wheat and malt-processing operations.Earnings rose to $473m, or 73 cents per share, in the three months to December 31, up from $441m, or 67 cents per share, a year ago.
340;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-02-04T22:04:06Z;US stocks retreat as investors lock in profits;;US shares retreated on Monday when investors sought to lock in recent profits amid fears that a weak jobs market would lead to mounting losses in the consumer credit sector.Financial companies and homebuilders were particularly hard hit as traders bet that rising loan delinquencies and falling house prices would hit corporate earnings.Investors also looked to offload retail stocks after last week’s disappointing jobs report persuaded analysts that a recession was more likely.The S&P 500 closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,380.82, with the homebuilder sector down 6 per cent and the financial sector losing 2.5 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,382.85 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent to 12,635.16.Wachovia and Wells Fargo were among the biggest fallers after Merrill Lynch told investors to sell the banking stocks because of their vulnerability to a worsening housing market. The shares lost 8.3 per cent to $35.53 and 6.7 per cent to $31.39, respectively. Washington Mutual, the savings and loan company, slumped 12.2 per cent to $19.16.“Trying to put a valuation on some of these financials is just really difficult when they keep coming out with these horrible earnings numbers,” said Thomas Nyheim, vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust.Separately, UBS told investors to sell shares in credit card issuers American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services, citing expectations of rising credit losses in the consumer finance sector. UBS cut its price target on AmEx from $67 to $45, prompting the stock to fall 3.9 per cent to $47.66. Capital One fell 7.6 per cent to $52.65, and Discover lost 9 per cent to $16.34.Wall Street analysts fear that job losses could lead to rising delinquencies with problems spreading beyond the subprime mortgage market. As a result US banks are tightening lending amid a reduced tolerance for risk, a Federal Reserve loan officer survey showed on Monday.Economists received a shock on Friday after the US economy shed jobs for the first time in 4½ years but in spite of the downbeat report equities chalked up their best weekly performance in almost five years, with the S&P financial sector gaining 8.5 per cent for the week. Traders were left wondering, however, if the gain was a temporary fillip or the start of a meaningful move higher.Among the factors driving the rally were hopes for a rescue of bond insurers which have been threatened with credit downgrades. Ambac Financial and MBIA fell 13.7 per cent to $11.39 and 5.9 per cent to $15.39, respectively, on Monday after the Financial Times reported that any rescue was unlikely to involve private equity firms as they believed the risks were too great.Traders also took profits in the technology sector after last week’s bounce triggered by Microsoft’s $44.6bn bid for Yahoo. The potential mega-merger may come in for close scrutiny after Google said the takeover could open the way for Microsoft to extend its PC monopoly to the internet.The drama probably has more acts to unfold with Yahoo insiders seeing an alliance with Google as one of their best options for fighting off Microsoft. Yahoo rose 3.4 per cent to $29.33, but Microsoft slipped 0.9 per cent to $30.19.Shares in Google closed below $500 for the first time since August, falling 4 per cent to $495.43, after Goldman Sachs removed the online search giant from a conviction “buy” list.In earnings news, Archer Daniels Midland, 2.9 per cent weaker at $44.20, increased quarterly profits to $473m from $441m, but the agricultural producer’s results narrowly missed some analysts’ estimates.Humana, the health in-surer, increased fourth-quarter profits by 57 per cent to $243.2m, beating Wall Street estimates. But the stock fell 3.5 per cent to $78.98.With more than half of S&P 500 companies having reported for the fourth quarter, corporate earnings are on track for a 20.7 per cent fall in the last three months of 2007, according to Thomson Financial, with financials the source of most of the weakness. Technology and energy earnings continue to hold up, increasing an expected 26 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Profits are forecast to grow by less than 2 per cent in the first and second quarters, before rebounding strongly later in the year.Many analysts see US manufacturers coping well, as exports are helped by a weak dollar. Factory orders rose 2.3 per cent in December, roughly in line with expectations – the biggest increase since July. Last week, US durable goods orders rose more than expected and the ISM manufacturing index expanded.
341;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2008-01-14T22:07:21Z;Wall St rebounds on earnings hopes;;"US stocks rebounded on Monday after IBM surprised traders with better than expected results, boosting confidence at the start of big week for corporate earnings.Hopes for swingeing interest rate cuts, possibly before the Federal Reserve’s scheduled January policy meeting, also helped repair some of the new year losses.Energy companies and other commodity producers found buyers as crude prices rose and gold prices soared above $900. Retailers stayed under pressure after a profit warning at Sears compounded concerns about the health of the US consumer.The S&P 500 closed at 1,416.25 points, up 1.1 per cent; the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 2,478.30 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4 per cent to 12,778.15.IBM’s preliminary fourth-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent and revenues climbed 10 per cent, as overseas sales received a boost from the weak US dollar. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $102.93.IBM’s results spurred a broad-based rally with strong gains in the technology sector. Intel, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, rose 5 per cent to $23.08; Hewlett-Packardalso put on 5 per cent to $39.84.“In times of high uncertainty small pieces of information can have a disproportionate impact – markets tend to overreact both on the upside and the downside,” Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said.The tech sector has had particularly heavy selling in recent weeks, causing the Nasdaq to slide about 14 per cent from its October peak, amid worries that growth forecasts were too high.Echoing these concerns, Citi Investment Research lowered its view on the software and services sector on expectations of lower second-half demand. “It is not a big surprise that one of the industry’s key purchasers of software (the financial sector) is likely to be much more judicious with its dollars in the next year or so,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist.The fourth-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week with technology companies’ profits forecast by Thomson Financial to rise 22 per cent and energy and healthcare also expected to deliver good earnings growth.A 72 per cent slump in financial company profits is expected to drag average fourth-quarter earnings into the negative for a second successive quarter, averaging an 11.3 per cent decline for the S&P 500. Citi reports on Tuesday, with earnings from JPMorgan on Tuesday and Merrill Lynch on Thursday.Investors are preparing for more losses with Citi taking as much as $24bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and cutting up to 24,000 jobs, according to a CNBC report.Citi, up 1.8 per cent at $29.06, is seeking as much as $14bn from Chinese, Kuwaiti and public market investors to ease pressure on its balance sheet, while Merrill Lynch, 2.3 per cent higher at $55.97, is looking to raise about $4bn.Retailers faced continued pressure amid fears for the health of consumer spending. Department store operator Sears said fourth-quarter earnings came in far below Wall Street expectations due to higher mark-downs and falling same-store sales.Goldman Sachs advised investors to sell the shares, which fell 5 per cent to $91.38, and downgraded several retailers. Coach, the handbag chain, fell 4.2 per cent to $25.72 and Ralph Lauren, the fashion house, lost 4.3 per cent to $52.90 after Goldman cut its rating on the stocks from “buy” to “neutral”.Consumer companies slid last week after a cautious outlook at American Express and weaker earnings guidance at Tiffany, the jeweller, led to fears about wealthy consumers, previously considered more immune to a downturn.Agribusiness continued its buoyant form after Cargill said second-quarter earnings had jumped 44 per cent. Monsanto gained 5.5 per cent to $127.25 while Archer Daniels Midland put on 3.4 per cent to $45.14.General Mills, the cereal maker, rose 0.7 per cent to $56.54 after a JPMorgan analyst upgraded the shares.Transport stocks benefited from a brokerage upgrade after Bear Stearns raised the trucking sector from “market underweight” to “market weight”. Ryder System jumped 6.4 per cent to $46 and YRC Worldwide gained 7.1 per cent to $14.86.Healthcare stocks ended five days of gains. Schering-Plough reported disappointing results from a cholesterol drug study and shares fell 8 per cent to $25.52."
342;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM urges progress on fuel bill;;Archer Daniels Midland, the US’s biggest ethanol producer, warned on Tuesday that the future of the biofuels sector was under threat unless Congress and individual state governments acted to support the industry.The warning will concern the White House, which has placed ethanol at the heart of an energy strategy aimed at weaning the US off foreign oil imports.President George W. Bush has outlined a plan to cut gasoline use 20 per cent by 2017, envisaging a six-fold increase in demand for biofuel over the next decade.Patricia Woertz, ADM’s chief executive, said she was frustrated at the slow progress of an energy bill mired on Capitol Hill as the two houses of Congress attempt to reconcile their versions of the legislation. She warned that if the bill did not pass it would hamper the development of so-called second- and third-generation fuels such as cellulosic ethanol, derived from plant fibres rather than edible crops.“We’ll never get to second- and third-generation opportunities if we abandon corn-based ethanol,” she said.ADM added that state governments were also holding up the growth of the ethanol industry, saying states such as Florida, Georgia and North Carolina had been sluggish in promoting infrastructure and introducing ethanol in gasoline to replace methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate that has been found to cause toxic pollution. “We’re disappointed it hasn’t come faster,” said Ms Woertz.Her comments came as ADM said its income from corn-based biofuel dropped 48 per cent in the three months to the end of September compared to the same period last year, as ethanol prices fell. The price of ethanol has dropped more than 30 per cent in recent months due to oversupply.Several companies in the sector have abandoned constructing new plants and have slashed production. VeraSun, the third-biggest US ethanol producer, last month halted work on a 110m-gallon facility in Indiana, citing oversupply.ADM said last month it would switch production of corn toward high-fructose corn syrup or lysine production if ethanol became un­profitable. At the same time, ADM, the world’s biggest grain processor, has been hit by the boom in corn prices.The company’s revenues from corn-based bioproducts fell to $89m from $170m in the fiscal first quarter of last year, dragging down its corn division to a $36m decline from 2006.Overall, net earnings increased $38m to $441m, while earnings per share rose to 68 cents from 61 cents last year. That was ahead of analysts’ expectations.
343;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-10-04T19:04:13Z;Tate & Lyle worst performer in rising FTSE;;Tate & Lyle was under pressure again Thursday amid fears of increased competition from a US rival.Since Friday’s shock profits warning, which saw shares in the sugars and sweeteners company drop 28 per cent, Tate has rallied 12 per cent. However, its shares fell 3.6 per cent to 435p Thursday – the worst performance in a rising FTSE 100 – as analysts picked up on recent comments from Archer Daniels Midland.At a conference this week, ADM said it was planning to switch parts of its ethanol production to higher margin products such as high fructose corn syrup, which is used to make fizzy drinks.Numis Securities said it was more cautious on Tate’s ability to increase corn syrup margins at the next pricing round in January.In the wider market, leading shares closed higher in spite of the Bank of England’s decision to keep interest rates on hold at 5.75 per cent.The FTSE 100 ended 12.7 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 6,547.9, while the FTSE 250 firmed 10.3 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 11,370.5. Traders said most investors had decided to sit on their hands ahead of Friday’s US employment figures.Northern Rock was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, advancing 6.5 per cent to 161.7p following reports that Citigroup had offered to provide potential bidders with funding.Daily Mail & General Trust added 2.5 per cent to 649p after a push from Citigroup, which claimed there was a disconnect in UK newspaper stocks. “The evidence from recent trading statements suggests trading is still robust. Yet current share prices appear to suggest that the market is expecting a decline in advertising in 2008.”Elsewhere, SABMiller was marked 2.6 per cent higher at £14.16 on sector consolidation hopes. Reports on Thursday claimed InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, had approached Anheuser-Busch, the world’s second biggest, with an offer.Abbot Group was the top performer in the FTSE 250, rising 22 per cent to 335½p after the oilfield services company said it had received several takeover approaches. Private equity group 3i, up 3.3 per cent to £10.64, is one of the bidders and has offered 375p a share.That news gave a lift to the rest of the sector, with Expro International Group rising 5 per cent to £10.54 and Hunting gaining 4.4 per cent to 716p. Amec, which is rumoured to be interested in buying Wood Group, unchanged at 408¾p, rose 3.1 per cent to 790½p.SSL International, the maker of Durex condoms, advanced 6.2 per cent to 466p after Charlie Mills, Credit Suisse’s highly rated analyst, upgraded the stock to “outperform”.Mr Mills said SSL’s intention to relocate one-third of its condom production to India and Thailand should lift earnings by 7 per cent next year. He also said that SSL could fetch up to 710p a share in the event of a bid.Workspace, the London-focused commercial property group, rose 3.5 per cent to 357p on news that Trefick, the investment vehicle of stakebuilder Jack Petchey, had an interest of more than 21 per cent of the company via a derivative contract.Traders noted Mr Petchey was also a shareholder in Bizspace, another commercial property group that was taken private last summer.However, they cautioned that it was difficult to know for how long Mr Petchey had held his position. Traders noted that turnover in Workspace had not been high recently.Enodis added 1.1 per cent to 188p amid talk it was set to make an offer for the foodservice business of Aga, steady at 433p.St James’s Place, the wealth management company, added 4.2 per cent to 418p on the back of a Goldman Sachs upgrade to “buy”. The broker said third quarter new business figures, due on November 1, would confound the sceptics.Ferrexpo, the Ukrainian iron ore company, eased 2.4 per cent to 251p after Deutsche Bank started coverage with a 240p target price.Benfield, the reinsurance broker, lost 4.4 per cent to 290½p as recent takeover speculation faded. After the market closed on Wednesday Robert Bredahl, an executive director, declared the sale of stock worth nearly £800,000. Traders said the disposal suggested the company was not about to be sold and was not in takeover talks.
344;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-08-21T22:53:20Z;Cargill warns of risks from eco-fuel drive;;Cargill, the agribusiness group, has called for any new US renewable fuel mandates to have an “escape mechanism” to prevent soaring demand for crops from distorting food supplies.The US group has been the most outspoken industry advocate of the need for policymakers to intervene in the emerging food-versus-fuel debate at a time when heavily tax-incentivised investment in biofuels has pushed up global food prices.The US is reviewing its federal Renewable Fuel Standard, which calls for the production of 7.5bn gallons a year of alternative fuels by 2012. This is expected to be reached well ahead of target, and the Bush administration has called for a benchmark of 35bn gallons by 2017, about half of it from ethanol.Bill Veazey, Cargill’s chief financial officer, said there needs to be “some kind of waiver” in any state-backed mandate. “There needs to be escape mechanisms so that you don’t distort the food markets,” he told the Financial Times.The energy legislation being reviewed by Congress is expected to push for a standard well below the 35bn gallons pursued by the White House.Mr Veazey said biofuels represented only around 5 per cent of Cargill’s earnings as the group reported a 52 per cent rise in net profits for the year to May 31. Earnings climbed from $1.73bn to $2.34bn, excluding special charges, and revenues rose 17 per cent to $88.3bn.Rising food demand in emerging markets and the shift in agricultural production to South America and central Europe have helped agribusiness groups such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge boost earnings in recent years, helped in part by their emerging biofuels operations.Cargill said three of its five divisions delivered record results, and downplayed the importance of its asset management business, which has been the largest contributor to earnings in recent years.“What we have is a broader and more diversified earnings’ stream than last year,” said Mr Veazey, pointing to the restructuring of the financial services business into two standalone entities, which have secured third-party investors to reduce Cargill’s exposure.However, Cargill’s heavy investment programme – which it will continue to fund internally – and the potential volatility of financial services income have prompted ratings agencies to shift their outlooks for the group to negative in recent months.Cargill maintains the fund portfolios are well diversified, with revenue streams from energy and commodities, as well as the real-estate, distressed loans and junk bonds which have raised some concerns at the agencies.Mr Veazey declined to comment on the funds’ asset allocation strategy during the recent market turmoil, though said deleveraging and the repricing of risk could open more acquisition opportunities as rival bidders stepped back.
345;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-08-02T17:05:24Z;VeraSun takes hit from high corn prices;;US ethanol producer VeraSun said on Thursday that current corn prices were good for the industry and would stabilise at the present level.“We think levels around today are good levels going forward…we’re comfortable with corn prices,” said Don Endres, chairman and CEO.Mr Endres predicted a strong future for the ethanol production business, saying there were great untapped market opportunities in the substance as a blending ingredient for gasoline, and that stabilising corn prices would lead to an improvement in margins.Slipping ethanol costs and high corn costs, which have come down from a 10-year-high but remain formidable, have been squeezing margins for producers.VeraSun on Thursday reported a 23 per cent fall in its second-quarter net income compared with the same period in 2006, while beating analyst expectations.The company, second largest in US ethanol production, reported $15.1m in net profits, or 19 cents per share, down from $19.6m or 29 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts expected 14 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.In the quarter, corn costs averaged 67 per cent higher at $3.62 per bushel, compared with $2.17 in the same period last year. Corn accounted for 59.6 per cent of VeraSun’s costs, up from 47.7 per cent last year.Corn prices have been driven up in part by the surging demand for ethanol as an alternative fuel, leading to farmers increasing their production. Corn production is expected to reach record levels this year.Archer Daniels Midland, the leading ethanol producer in the US, said earlier this week that higher corn costs and lower ethanol sales led to a $45m dip in its corn business’s operating profit.Despite stalling ethanol prices, VeraSun, which floated last year, agreed last week to purchase three additional ethanol plants for $725m, increasing its annual production capacity by 330m gallons. The new plants are in addition to a 43.6 per cent increase in capacity in April.Ethanol is expected to divert up to 20 per cent of this year’s corn crop in the US. President George W. Bush has announced plans to increase the mandate for renewable fuel production from 7.5bn gallons by 2012 to 35bn gallons by 2017, half of which is said to be ethanol.
346;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-07-30T21:21:40Z;Wall St rebounds on bargain buying;;"Wall Street rebounded on Monday while the deteriorating state of the credit market kept the stocks of companies that had agreed to buy-outs on the defensive.After a choppy morning of trading, a renewed attempt to “buy at the bottom” succeeded by mid-afternoon.The S&P 500 index rose 1 per cent to close at 1,473.91 and had bounced from an earlier low of 1,454.32.Volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix, fell 13.7 per cent to a reading of 20.87. Vix remains 80.5 per cent higher this year.The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.8 per cent to 2,583.28 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 13,358.31.Small cap stocks also rebounded. The Russell 2000 index gained 0.8 per cent and pared its loss for the year to 0.4 per cent.The sharp rise in volatility and concerns over future deal activity has hit the small- and medium-sized company sector hard.Equity investors continued to monitor the credit market on Monday.A flood of pending new debt issues, in the region of $300bn, linked to this year’s record pace of mergers and buy-out deals, and worries about further losses from mortgage-related investments, cast a pall over sentiment for credit.Lehman Brothers said the $225bn of pending leveraged loan deals “is equivalent to the institutional loan market’s size just two years ago”.Premiums for credit derivative indices that track US and European investment-grade and high-yield bonds have more than doubled in cost since mid-June.After they pushed through new boundaries early on Monday, the indices pulled back, a boost for equities.The recent rise in volatility and in credit risk premiums has weighed on stock prices for many pending buy-out deals and also on the banks that could potentially be left holding bridge loans.Analysts at Goldman said: “It is impossible, even for a wizard like Harry Potter, to reconcile two facts: stocks cannot both melt down because the market fears financial institutions will have to fund and hold levered loan commitments, while at the same time shares of target companies sell off on the belief the same transactions will not close.”Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that 22 pending leveraged buy-out deals offered equity investors an annualised return of 36 per cent if they were completed.Some investors agreed that there were good opportunities in the market for so-called “merger arbitrage” but said risks were paramount.“[It is] a dicey area patrolled by experts and perhaps not a good strategy for retail investors,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “The fact that stocks [that have received buy-out offers] are trading at a
discount may be justified as the cost of capital is higher.”One example is TXU, the Texas utility, which is subject to a $32bn, or $69.25 a share, buy-out offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group. The stock closed at $65.90 on Monday. The financing for the TXU deal includes an $11bn bridge loan and the banks behind the buy-out include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers.The S&P Investment bank index rebounded by 1.4 per cent and that cut its loss for the year to 9 per cent.Among other pending buyout deals, First Data was at $32.13 on Monday, below KKR’s $29bn buy-out of $34 a share.Penn National, the racetrack and casino operator that Fortress Group has offered to buy out for $67 a share, traded at $57.80.Hilton Hotels closed at $44.53, below the $47.50-a- share buy-out offer from Blackstone.In other deal news, Dow Jonesfell 5.6 per cent to $51.56, below the $60-a-share offer made by News Corp.A vote to approve the $5bn bid was expected by the Bancroft family after the closing bell on Monday.Earnings season continued and Verizon, the second largest U.S. phone company reported a 4.5 per cent rise in second quarter profit. The Dow stock fell 1.2 per cent to $41.51. Humana, the health insurer, said second-quarter profit more than doubled to $216.8m. The stock rallied 0.4 per cent to $65.08.Archer Daniels Midland rose 0.4 per cent to $34.17. The grain processor’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit more than doubled.Wrigley posted a 20 per cent rise in quarterly results. The stock closed flat at $57.12. Virgin Media rose 4.1 per cent to $25.72 on talk that John Malone’s Liberty Global is weighing a $23bn bid for the UK cable operator. Rural Cellular surged 34.4 per cent to $42.76 after Verizon Wireless agreed to buy the regional network for $2.67bn in cash and debt.Economic data was sparse on Monday, but the rest of the week is replete with reports capped by the July employment report and a manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Friday. Economists expect a gain of 135,000 jobs last month after 132,000 were created in June. The unemployment rate is seen steady at 4.5 per cent for the fourth consecutive month.At the close of trading in New York last week, the S&P 500 index was down 4.9 per cent for the week at 1,458.95 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.7 per cent lower at 2,562.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.2 per cent lower at 13,265.47."
347;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-07-06T20:36:20Z;Deals and data spark solid week for Wall Street;;Wall Street this week made a solid start to the third quarter. Technology stocks starred amid growing confidence the US economy is gathering momentum.Robust economic data this week was capped by news that 132,000 new jobs were created last month. While bond yields rose this week, sectors of the equity market that reflect better economic prospects, such as materials, technology and industrials, all rallied.“Stocks are in the process of adjusting to higher yields that reflect a growing economy,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “The recent internal leadership of the market has been basic materials, industrials and technology. These sectors would not be leading if investors thought higher interest rates will bite the economy.”Higher bond yields and fears of a possible credit crunch failed to sap deal activity or overall sentiment for equities this week.”The stock market has held in extremely well given the recent volatility in the subprime mortgage market,” said Alan Gerstein, portfolio manager at BlueMountain Capital Management. However, he cautioned: ”Stocks will have a hard time rallying further if credit spreads do not come back in.”Among the major benchmarks, the Nasdaq Composite continued to lead and has now risen 10.4 per cent so far in 2007, beating its return of 9.5 per cent during 2006. At the close of trading on Friday, the Nasdaq was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,666.51, a gain of 2.4 per cent this week.“Tech bottomed in late May and the sector’s rally has coincided with a pick up in capital spending,” said Mr Paulsen.A number of tech titans either hit all-time or 52-week peaks this week. For the week, Apple gained 8.4 per cent to $132.30, Research In Motion, rose 7.7 per cent to $215.35, Intel was up 4 per cent at $24.68 and Google rallied 3.5 per cent to $539.40.The S&P 500 index rose 0.3 per cent to 1,530.44 on Friday, a gain of 1.8 per cent this week. Energy was the best performing sector this week as oil prices reached 10-month highs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.3 per cent higher at 13,611.68, a gain of 1.5 per cent since Monday.As this week’s deals and data fade, the most likely drivers of stocks will be second quarter earnings results that start arriving next week.S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise 4.1 per cent for the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Financial. Of note, earnings estimates for energy companies in the second quarter have swung from a fall of 9 per cent to a rise of 2 per cent since April according to Thomson.Equity volatility cooled this week, with the Chicago Board Options Exhange Vix index down 9.3 per cent.As the buyout wave continued to roll this week, call option activity flared across a range of stocks.“Unsubstantiated takeover rumours being reported by multiple sources continue to drive trading in the options market,” said analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group.A rise in call options – which give an investor the right to buy a share in the future – can indicate higher demand for stocks, boosting their price.Examples of strong near term call option buying this week were Verasun Energy, up 5.7 per cent at $15.31, Archer Daniels Midland, up 6.2 per cent at $35.14, and Quest Diagnostics, higher by 8.5 per cent at $56.06.Another actively traded stock in the options market this week was Hilton Hotels. Option volumes soared on Tuesday, prior to Blackstone announcing a $26bn buyout of the company. While Hilton jumped 26 per cent on Thursday as investors digested the news, the stock had already risen 10 per cent this week. For the week, Hilton rallied 36.6 per cent to close at $45.71.Among deals this week, Huntsman surged 15.2 per cent to $28 as a private equity firm bid $6bn for the chemicals company, competing with a $5.6bn bid last week from Basell Holdings, a Dutch chemicals maker.The Carlyle Group made a $6.3bn bid to take Manor Care private. The nursing home operator fell 1.6 per cent to $64.27 this week, as the $67-a-share buy-out price disappointed some investors.Kraft made a $7.2bn bid for the global biscuit business of France’s Danone. Kraft lost 2.9 per cent to $34.24 this week.On Friday, Advanced Medical Optics, the medical supplier, made a $4.23bn offer to buy Bausch & Lomb for $75 a share. The offer for the the contact lens maker is above the $3.67bn or $65 a share offer made in May by Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm. Bausch has already agreed to accept the private equity offer, but its board said it would engage in further discussions on the new proposal from AMO.AMO fell 0.1 per cent to $35.85, while Bausch was a fraction firmer at $72 on Friday.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOT Holdings revised the terms of their merger agreement on Friday, ahead of a shareholder vote on the deal on Monday. CME rose 3.4 per cent to $574.80, and the CBOT jumped 8.7 per cent to $224.The Hilton buyout by Blackstone sparked gains in other hotel stocks, led by a 11 per cent gain to $74.46 in Starwood, and a 9 per cent rise to $47.11 in Marriott.Another deal saw Dobson Communications jump 12.2 per cent to $12.46 this week after AT&T agreed to buy the regional wireless provider for $2.8bn. AT&T fell 2 per cent to $40.66.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group, filed for an initial public offering of $1.25bn of shares this week. Its bigger rival Blackstone gained 7.6 per cent to $31.50, rising above its recent listing price of $31 a share.Charles Schwab rose 7.5 per cent to $22.06 this week on news of a $2.3bn stock buy-back and payment of a $1.2bn special dividend.The 132,000 new jobs created during June was a touch better than a forecast 125,000. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.5 per cent. Average hourly earnings rose $0.06, or 0.3 per cent, a 3.9 per cent gain for the past year.Meanwhile, payrolls for prior months were revised upwards, suggesting the job market has underlying strength. Data for May was adjusted to a gain of 190,000 from a prior 157,000 read, while April was revised up to 122,000 from an original rise of 80,000 jobs.“The labour market remains strong, stable and tight,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “With the labour market near inflationary tightness and the effect of Federal Reserve tightening now past, the Fed’s vigilant stance appears entirely appropriate.”The tone of the report was also seen striking a chord with investors in risky markets.“The mix of solid data, without being so strong as to encourage immediate prospects of Fed tightening, will continue to play risk appetite positive, and friendly enough for the high yielders,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
348;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-05-01T20:37:59Z;Wall St higher amid range of earnings;;Wall Street shrugged aside a weak start and closed higher on Tuesday as investors digested a range of earnings and contrasting economic data while an unsolicited bid for Dow Jones shook up the newspaper sector.Stocks began the new month in a cautious mood amid a rise in manufacturing activity and further woes in the housing market.By late afternoon, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,486.30 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,531.53. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 13,136.14, a new record close.The major talking point among investors was Dow Jones, which soared to its highest level in four years after News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, launched a hostile $60-a-share bid for the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Late on Tuesday, the Bancroft family, who control Dow Jones via a dual shareholder structure, rejected the proposal.Dow Jones gained 54.7 per cent to close at $56.20, down from a high of $57.88 earlier in the day. On Monday, volume in call options, mainly priced at $45 a share, soared by almost seven times.While News Corp slid 4.2 per cent to $22.99, shares in the New York Times jumped 5 per cent to $24.58, the Washington Post rose 2.9 per cent to $765.30 and Gannett rose 2 per cent to $58.17. Shares in Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times rose 5.6 per cent to $18.01, the highest level in five years.As the first-quarter earnings season continued on Tuesday, analysts said better- than-expected results aug­ured well for the overall market. Recent weakness in the dollar was also playing a crucial part in boosting the appeal of internationally focused companies.“There have been some stellar results from Wall Street but also strong results from companies with foreign operations” [boosted by] “strong growth in the global economy . . . lower tax rates and a weaker dollar,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The US market looks to be enjoying respectable earnings growth, sustained by robust global growth and the prospect of falling interest rates, caused by soft onshore growth.”While the weaker dollar has helped boost large-cap stocks, analysts said currency bears were watching for any shift in the attitude of foreign investors. While the S&P is up 4.8 per cent this year in dollar terms, the rise is only 1.55 per cent for euro-based investors.“There is a danger that we reach a tipping point with foreign investors if the dollar continues to decline,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “If the dollar goes significantly lower, it could become precarious for stocks.”In earnings news on Tuesday, Liz Claiborne reported a 65 per cent plunge in first-quarter net profit and said that 2007 earnings would fall well below analysts’ expectations. The clothing retailer fell 17.3 per cent to $37.Procter & Gamble reported a 13.6 per cent rise in quarterly profit and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $62.96, after a rise of 2.25 per cent on Monday.Archer Daniels Midland said its fiscal third-quarter earnings increased 4 per cent and shares in the largest US ethanol producer fell 5.4 per cent to $36.60 as results missed analysts’ expectations.Avon Products came calling with a near-tripling in fiscal third-quarter earnings from the same period last year. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $40.93.Another company reporting a near-threefold rise in first-quarter profit was Qwest Communications, whose results were boosted by lower costs and higher take-up of bundled services – such as telephone, television, high-speed internet and wireless services – by customers. Shares in Qwest rose by 2.6 per cent to $9.11.Shares in Centex rose 3.8 per cent to $46.46 after the homebuilder said fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 49 per cent, owing to a drop in home sales in what the company called one of the most difficult markets in 25 years.Masco said its first-quarter earnings fell 30 per cent as the slump in housing soured demand for home improvements.Shares jumped 9.5 per cent to $29.80 as the results were better than forecast.Marathon Oil reported a decline in first-quarter earnings to $717m from a year-ago profit of $784m, but the result was above expect­ations. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $101.27, down from a high of $103.02 earlier in the day.
349;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM warns of higher petrol prices in US;;US consumers can expect higher petrol prices in the run-up to the key summer driving season, adding to the inflationary pressures from rising food costs, according to Archer Daniels Midland, the agribusiness group.Pat Woertz, chairman and chief executive, said she expected ethanol prices to be pulled higher in the coming quarter by its close correlation with unleaded gasoline costs, reflecting tight petrol supplies exacerbated by a high level of refinery maintenance.The remarks by Ms Woertz, who formerly headed Chevron’s marketing and refining business, carry added weight as ADM continues its transformation from the world’s largest grains processor into a major energy group through its leadership in ethanol and biodiesel production.Regular gasoline rose to $2.97 a gallon last week, according to government data, and is already well over $3 a gallon on the west coast and other pockets including Washington DC.Ethanol is now blended into around 5 per cent of US gasoline production, and expanding demand has been a key driver of profit growth at ADM, which is investing $2bn to boost its global biofuels footprint. The company is also the largest producer of oilseed-derived biodiesel in Europe, and also produces the fuel from palm oil in Asia and plans to make ethanol from sugar in Brazil.The prospect of higher US ethanol prices will counter the impact of higher corn costs, which dented ADM earnings in its fiscal third quarter to the end of March and have rippled through the US food industry..While US farmers are scheduled to boost corn planting by 15 per cent to 90.5m acres in 2006/2007, inclement weather and a shortage of high-yielding seeds has raised concerns that the crop could fall short of expectations.The US agriculture department on Monday revealed that corn planting remained behind last year’s levels and the recent historical average. Analysts are focused on its forecast for global crop production due on May 11.Ms Woertz has sought to defuse the intensifying debate over the use of corn for food and fuel by describing the harvest as complementary and pointing to technological advances which will boost yields per acre.Ethanol demand is forecast to consume around a quarter of the US corn crop this year, with production rising to 8.6bn gallons this year. This is above the current level mandated by the current federal mandate, though a number of bills in Congress aim to boost this level. ADM has expressed confidence that annual demand can reach 14bn gallons, equivalent to a 10 per cent blend with gasoline. And Ms Woertz said auto makers were working on modifications which would allow “traditional” cars to run on a larger blend, territory which has hitherto been limited to so-called “flex-fuel” vehicles.ADM’s net profits rose from $347.8m to $362.9m in the March quarter on a 25 per cent jump in sales to $11.4bn.
350;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-04-30T12:49:30Z;Tyson Foods raises guidance;;Tyson, the world’s largest meat producer, on Monday raised its full-year earnings’ guidance after shaking off the effects of avian flu on its chicken business and higher corn costs across its operations.The US group opened a crucial reporting week for the US agribusiness sector, with conflicting views over the future path of corn and wheat prices and their impact on food and animal feed costs.Tyson has led warnings that the diversion of US corn to produce ethanol risked creating a ripple effect of higher food prices around the world. While corn prices have fallen from a peak of more than $4.50 a bushel in February, they remain well above historical levels as US farmers continue the crucial spring planting. Archer Daniels Midland, the largest US ethanol producer, reports earnings on Tuesday.Tyson did not provide fresh guidance on its outlook for corn costs – currently $4 a bushel – though it will be questioned by analysts later on Monday.However, it raised earnings guidance for its fiscal year to September 30 from $0.50-$0.80 a share to $0.65-$0.90 as a recovery in its core beef and chicken operations helped a return to profit in its second quarter.Tyson and rivals such as Pilgrims Pride – the largest US chicken producer – have cut capacity to curb the domestic glut sparked by an avian flu-inspired drop in exports last year. Prices have firmed this year, ahead of the crucial barbecue season, and Tyson has also boosted its higher-value prepared-meal business.Dick Bond, Tyson’s chief executive, has also cut more than $200m in annual operating expenses from the Arkansas-based group, shedding some commoditised units in a bid to boost margins. Exports of beef, its largest unit by sales, have also increased after Japan lifted a ban on imports from the US imposed after BSE was reported in the US herd.Food producers have expressed concern about the impact of ethanol-driven corn prices for months, but calls for a food-versus-fuel debate have grown louder in the wake of the White House plan for a five-fold rise in renewable fuel production over the next decade.Mr Bond has been among the most outspoken of food industry executives about the potential side-effects of booming ethanol production, which is set to double over the next two years, pushing corn prices to 10-year highs in recent months.Tyson announced plans last month to produce renewable diesel from animal fats in partnership with ConocoPhillips. Mr Bond said the joint venture was a ”win-win”, because it diversified renewable fuel sources away from corn towards animal fats.
351;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-03-30T20:59:11Z;Wall St lower as housing gloom persists;;A series of small shocks about the housing market and economy knocked Wall Street off its stride this week but investors regained some of their poise to leave stocks only moderately lower.The steepest decline came as Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, damped hopes that the central bank had adopted a softer policy stance by reiterating his concerns about inflation and saying the Fed had not abandoned its bias towards raising interest rates.Sharp falls in stocks were also caused by fresh signs of slowing demand for housing, federal probes into mortgage lending by Beazer Homes, and oil price rises spurred by increased tension between Iran and the UK.Rumours of US preparations for a conflict with Iran sparked another sharp sell-off in shares on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1 per cent from its earlier highs.However, after each slip the market showed a degree of resilience. “This pattern of recovering from shocks may speak to the fact that this market wants to go up,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “[Interest] rates are just too low and liquidity is too high to take this thing down.”Sentiment was boosted by an unexpected upward revision of economic growth in the final quarter last year and lower than expected jobless claims last week. In addition, consumer spending and income rose at almost double the forecast rate.The US government’s imposition of duties on paper imports from China also unnerved investors on Friday. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,420.85, putting it 1.1 per cent down on the week and 0.2 per cent higher on the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent stronger on Friday at 12,354.35, down 1 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent lower on the week at 2,421.64.The steel sector made big advances after US Steel’s bid to buy Lone Star Technologies prompted speculation about further consolidation.In a sign of investor appetite for steelmaking deals, shares in US Steel rose 3 per cent on the week to $99.17 on the back of this week’s $2.1bn cash offer for Lone Star. Lone Star soared 35.6 per cent to $66.03.There was also interest in other steel groups that could be takeover targets. IPSCO jumped 13.7 per cent to $131.40 while Reliance Steel rose 4.3 per cent to $48.40.Dell was on the defensive on Friday as the group revealed that it had found evidence of as yet unspecified misconduct after an investigation into its accounting practices.The company said it was delaying the release of its annual report until the investigation was completed.The market reaction was negative but contained, with Dell shares down 0.8 per cent to $23.21 on Friday. Credit Suisse encouraged investors to buy on weakness “with the understanding that the time horizon for recovery has been extended”.Homebuilders set new lows for the year this week as weak sales of newly built homes and a profits warning from Lennar aggravated fears about a prolonged housing market slump.Lennar, which said the typical pick-up in spring sales had “yet to materialise”, fell 7.4 per cent to 42.21. KB Home slid 8.9 per cent to $42.67.Meanwhile, Beazer Homes plunged 12.5 per cent to $29.03 after it said it was co-operating with FBI inquiries into its mortgage lending. No allegations of wrong-doing have yet been made.Energy groups were lifted by rising oil prices this week, with Chevron up 0.4 per cent at $74.12.Archer Daniels Midland, surrendered early gains to stand 0.2 per cent down at $36.70 on Friday after the US government forecast a steep rise in corn planting.Shares in papermakers surged on Friday after the imposition of duties on Chinese imports. International Paper gained 1.4 per cent to $36.40.Altria rose 2.7 per cent to $87.81 over the week on speculation that the tobacco and food company might spin off its Philip Morris cigarette division.In deal news, the battle to buy Tribune intensified as California billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad sweetened their offer in an effort to trump Chicago property magnate Sam Zell’s bid.Mr Burkle and Mr Broad offered $34 a share, a bid that tops Mr Zell’s $33 offer. Tribune shares rose 1.8 per cent to $32.11 on Friday.
352;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-03-05T23:31:23Z;Fuel or food, a debate set to rumble on;;"When Cargill’s chief executive designate was asked last week at an agriculture conference what he tells customers when they complain about higher food and feed prices because of ethanol demand, Gregory Page replied: “I just blame Pat.”The 1,800 people in the audience laughed, but there was a hint of truth in his remark. Mr Page, who takes over the Cargill helm in June, was referring to Patricia Woertz, president and chief executive officer at Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill’s main rival, and a key proponent of the boom in US ethanol output.ADM recruited Ms Woertz from Chevron-Texaco where she headed the energy group’s downstream business. Ms Woertz has steered ADM’s efforts to expand the global footprint of an energy unit, which accounts for more than a third of earnings. ADM has spent $2.5bn on its biofuels business.In contrast, Cargill, the world’s largest agribusinesses, has taken a more cautious approach to biofuels than ADM.Mr Page insists Cargill’s preference remains for food over fuel. Last summer, when ethanol prices reached record highs of more than $5 a gallon, creating significant profits for producers, Cargill switched its production facilities – capable of producing both ethanol as well as food and drink products – to making high fructose corn syrup for soft drink producers.Mr Page, who has been with Cargill for 33 years, said the decision was more about reputation and commitment to the food industry. “We had a hot summer, people were thirsty and soft drink sales were going through the roof. We wanted to help customers meet that demand. Can you imagine if we didn’t [make the syrup] and if some places were to run out of soft drinks because we were making ethanol? I don’t think it would have done us any favours,” says Mr Page.The food versus fuel issue will be debated by Congress this week.Cargill cautioned the agricultural sector from becoming too focused on biofuels – a phenomenon with big support from President George W. Bush as part of his strategy for energy independence – as it will have unintended consequences on food prices.Moreover, Mr Page was sceptical about the president’s goal of producing 35bn gallons of ethanol and other alternative fuels by 2017, up from 7.5bn in 2012.Mr Page, who started as a trainee with Cargill in 1974, said reaching the White House’s goal was dependent on cellulose ethanol technologies, which were far from becoming commercial.“We have to be careful not to place too much weight on cellulosic technology,” Mr Page told the US Department of Agriculture annual outlook conference last week.Despite Cargill’s scepticism about long-term prospects for biofuels, Cargill is a considerable player in the ethanol business. It has invested almost $1bn on ethanol plants in the US, Europe and Brazil.“We make a lot of ethanol, but we are primarily focused on food,” says Mr Page, who has been Cargill’s chief operating officer since 2000 and a close associate of Warren Staley, the company’s outgoing chief executive, who reaches the mandatory retirement age this year.Nevertheless, the emergence of biofuels and the impact of climate change have had a big impact on the way Cargill does business. Last October, the group updated its long-term strategic review; the current one, known as Strategic Intent, carries through until 2010.Mr Page said Cargill’s five core business units, agricultural services, food ingredients, industrial, processing and risk management will no longer be run separately. Under Mr Staley, Cargill moved from being a trader and seller of commodities to a processor of products and services to the farming, food and industrial sectors.“We are getting rid of the silos. We have to think across the business instead of each business focused on its own area,” said Mr Page."
353;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2007-02-01T22:05:08Z;Wall Street rallies buoyed by strong data;;Wall Street rallied further into record territory on Thursday, buoyed by data this week that has broadly shown a stronger-than-expected economy and moderating inflation.Equities face a test on Friday when the monthly jobs report is released.The renewed highs in stocks on Thursday extended a rally that began last year, prompting some investors to worry that a correction could be looming.“We have had a good run since September and sentiment is somewhat neutral. Even the bulls think the market has room for only modest gains,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.He said: “There is a lot to like, the economy is far better than people expected and if the Federal Reserve can’t ease because real growth is higher, you have to own stocks.” At the close, the S&P 500 index was up 0.5 per cent at 1,445.94, its highest level since 2000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,673.68, a record close.It touched an all-time high of 12,682.57 as transport, cyclical and financial stocks rallied.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.9 per cent to 807.44, above its record close from Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent at 2,468.38. Analysts warned that the technology-laden benchmark could lag behind the broader market unless Google provided leadership for the sector.“It’s unlikely the Nasdaq will enter a strong rally” unless Google can rise above the $513 level, said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader.Shares in the internet search group fell 3.9 per cent to $481.75, in spite of better than expected earnings late on Wednesday. Analysts at Citigroup said: “Almost all of the upside [at Google] was due to a lower tax rate and higher interest income.”Also in the news was Dell after it said Michael Dell, chairman, had returned to the role of chief executive.

354;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Palm oil boom;;Palm oil is enjoying a prolonged sweet spot, with cash prices up by almost 50 per cent over the past 12 months. Wealthier Chinese and Indians are sloshing more into their cooking, while the growing environmentalist bandwagon suggests more demand for biofuels. Meanwhile, there are constraints on supply. Malaysia and Indonesia account for about 80 per cent of production. The former is basically out of spare land while development in the latter may suffer from poor infrastructure.Palm oil producers have been busily consolidating, the better to tap greater economies of scale and more synergies throughout the production chain, from tree to wok. The biggest private sector deal in 2006 was designed to marry Wilmar International’s assets with the formidable distribution of Malaysia’s Kuok Group. Archer Daniels Midland of the US will take a minority stake in the combined group. Last year also saw the announcement of a three-way, state-backed Malaysian deal. Reports yesterday that this might be under threat sent ripples far beyond Malaysia’s plantations.Investors need not lose too much sleep. Even if the deal falls apart, another producer will surely take up the baton. The economics of the business remain attractive, with production costs of about $150-$200 a tonne roughly one-third of the spot price. It takes three years to grow palms for tapping and economies of scale are crucial, keeping a lid on new entrants. Sure, the biofuel story may be a little over-spun – palm oil is unsuited for many European engines and, as palm oil prices rise and petroleum prices reverse, the case to go green becomes less compelling. But demand remains strong. Last year, according to Credit Suisse, US imports of Malaysian palm oil rose 19 per cent thanks to new labelling laws on unhealthier trans fats. Chinese demand rose 17 per cent. Palm oil producers remain a healthy addition to portfolios.
355;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
356;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-12-14T18:24:03Z;Wilmar in $4.3bn palm-oil merger;;Singapore-based Wilmar International on Thursday announced a US$4.3bn merger plan that would create Asia’s largest agribusiness group and give Archer Daniels Midland an enhanced role in the fast-growing global palm-oil business.The proposed deal is part of a land grab for palm-oil assets in Malaysia and Indonesia, the largest producers of a commodity where demand has soared from its use in producing biodiesel and use as a foodstuff, particularly in China and India.“This merger is all about China, which is emerging as the world’s biggest consumer of edible oils,” said Kuok Khoon Hong, Wilmar’s chairman. “We will become the leading merchandiser and processor of edible oils and oil seeds in China [and] the dominant processor of agricultural products.”Wilmar plans to create the world’s largest producer and refiner of palm oil through a series of share and asset swaps which would create a group with annual sales of US$12bn and a market value of US$7bn.The transaction would also enhance the transformation of ADM – which would hold 16.2 per cent of the enlarged group – from a traditional agribusiness group into the leading global player in alternative energy. The US company has invested heavily in domestic corn-based ethanol plants and oil-seed derived biodiesel in Europe.ADM, which already holds a small stake in Wilmar’s parent, will inject existing refining assets in China and into the business in return for a 16.4 per cent holding. Wilmar, which has transformed over the past 15 years from a small plantation owner into an integrated agribusiness group focused on palm and lauric oil.Wilmar plans to pay up to S$4.1bn (US$2.6bn) for the palm oil assets of the Malaysia-based Kuok Group, providing additional acreage to feed its refining mills. Kuok companies also have a large consumer presence in China, and its market-leading Arawana brand is the official cooking oil of the Beijing Olympics.The proposed deal reflects the close family ties of many Asian businesses. Robert Kuok, the Malaysian billionaire, is injecting his Kuala Lumpur-listed palm oil operations into the Wilmar business controlled by his once-estranged nephew, Kuok Khoon Hong. Wilmar would control 48.5 per cent of the new Singapore-listed Wilmar International, with Robert Kuok’s group holding 31 per cent. Kuok Khoon Hong said he approached his uncle three weeks ago with an offer to combine the assets and secure the synergies.Both companies have extensive plantations in Indonesia, which is emerging as the largest palm oil producer and exporter because of land shortages in Malaysia.Cargill last month announced plans to invest in plantations in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea in partnership with Singapore’s state-owned Temasek Holdings, and three of Malaysia’s state-controlled plantation companies – Sime Darby, Kumpulan Guthrie and Golden Hope – recently agreed to an US$8.6bn merger two weeks ago.The surge in palm oil demand prompted the Chicago Board of Trade to develop a new futures contracts on the product for Jade, a new regional commodities exchange launched in partnership with Singapore’s SGX Group.
357;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-11-09T22:11:25Z;ADM seeks equal footing over renewable power;;Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness and bio-energy group, said renewable energy resources should be placed on an equal footing with fossil fuels and not attract special treatment from governments and regulators.Pat Woertz, the former Chevron executive appointed as chief executive in May, plans to expand the company’s energy footprint from the US and Europe by building sugar-cane assets in Brazil and growing its fledgling palm-oil operation in southeast Asia to produce ethanol and biodiesel.There has been little political opposition to foreign investment in renewable energy resources in Brazil and Indonesia, which is set to overtake Malaysia as the world’s largest palm-oil producer, in contrast to the “resource nationalism” over fossil fuels which has emerged in Latin America, Russia and parts of Asia.However, the issue is particularly sensitive for ADM because of its global expansion plans, and the fierce lobbying by Ms Woertz’s former employer during its contested battle last year with China’s state-controlled CNOOC energy group for control of Unocal, the California-based oil and gas group.US opposition to the CNOOC deal was partly on national security grounds.“I don’t think oil and gas should be treated in a special way,” Ms Woertz told the Financial Times at a media briefing following its annual analysts’ meeting in Chicago this week.She said agricultural resources should also be open to the development of a free trade system.Ms Woertz was Chevron’s executive vice-president for downstream operations during its successful battle for Unocal, which it acquired for $17.3bn after a fierce lobbying campaign.Opposition from a vocal portion of Congress, together with lukewarm support from Beijing and financial markets’ doubts over CNOOC’s ability to finance its $18bn bid, eventually forced the Chinese company to withdraw from the Unocal race.ADM hired Ms Woertz, who made no public comments during the Unocal battle, to expand an energy business which is already the largest supplier of ethanol in the US and of biodiesel in Europe.She has also committed to maintaining ADM’s “premier” position in agricultural processing, which remains the largest part of its business despite the surge in profits from rising ethanol demand in the US over the past year.More than half of ADM’s planned capital expenditure over the next few years will be aimed at growing the biofuel business, though Ms Woertz said it had yet to decide what form its expansion in Brazil would take, or where the end users would be. The country is the largest producer of sugar-based ethanol, viewed as more economic and energy-efficient than the corn-based variety used in the US.Additional reporting by Shawn Donnan in Hong Kong

363;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;ADM issues bullish outlook for ethanol;;Archer Daniels Midland on Tuesday predicted that US ethanol demand could rise to 15bn gallons by 2012, well above existing industry estimates and double the level set by new energy legislation.The US agribusiness group accounts for a quarter of domestic ethanol production and is adding capacity to meet demand for use as a gasoline additive to replace MTBE, a compound known to contaminate water tables.Demand is expected to reach 4.8bn gallons this year, and new capacity is expected to surpass the 7.5bn-gallon target set by last year’s energy bill in 2008, four years ahead of target.However, producers and users remain divided over the sustainable level of demand once MTBE is completely phased out, and ADM’s forecast is the most bullish to date.“It looks like it has room to grow to 14bn or 15bn gallons [a year],” said Pat Woertz, the company’s new president chief executive as she unveiled a doubling of fourth-quarter profits, boosted in part by rising ethanol prices.Ms Woertz, who joined the group in May from Chevron, said demand would hinge in part on legislative efforts to require usage of ethanol and other alternative fuels such as biodiesel. “But I think there’s room to move [production up], even without a mandate.”ADM derives the bulk of its earnings from processing commodities such as oilseed, cocoa and wheat, but the expansion of its alternative fuels business has lifted earnings – and its share price – in recent months. The company plans to lift its production of ethanol from corn to about 1.5bn gallons over the next two years.While ADM shares have climbed 77 per cent this year, largely on the back of the buzz surrounding ethanol, many analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of current margins if supply bottlenecks ease and crude oil-prices drop. However, current ethanol plants are said to be profitable with crude prices of around $40 a barrel, helped by 51-cent a gallon state subsidy.“There’s an opportunity to grow the market, to grow volumes,” said Ms Woertz on a call with analysts. While ethanol prices have continued to rise – most deals are on six-month forward contracts – she said “the nature of the discussions have changed”, with a greater focus on the reliability of supply and infrastructure.Ms Woertz was also bullish about the outlook for oil seed-derived biodiesel, notably in Europe where government mandates for increased use are expected to boost demand. However, she remained more cautious about its application in the US – where demand is fraction of that in Europe amid a myriad of federal and state efforts to mandate increased use.Higher prices for oil seed products – its largest segment – starches, sweeteners and ethanol lifted net profits in the quarter to June 30 from $195.5m to $410.3m, with full-year profits up 26 per cent at $1.31bn.
364;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-07-25T18:29:04Z;Alternative energy;;The last few months have not been easy for tree-huggers. Shares in US alternative energy stocks have fallen by a quarter since early May, with even sharper declines in the rest of the world.That may seem odd. The box-office success of Al Gore’s documentary on climate change, opinion poll results and frantic lobbying by the oil industry all suggest that Americans are starting to pay attention to global warming. Meanwhile, rising oil prices and geopolitical risks have prompted even President George W. Bush to talk up other energy sources.The trouble is that, with much of the potential payoff in the distant future, valuations of alternative energy stocks are heavily exposed to mood swings in broader markets. During turbulence, that lends an edge to companies running other businesses too, such as Archer Daniels Midland, the leading US ethanol producer. But unless oil prices stay at current levels, fuels such as bio-diesel will continue to require US government support to be viable.Another strategy championed by several smaller US companies is to focus on finding new, cleaner ways to extract energy from traditional sources. Converting coal into a gas for use in power plants has lately re-emerged as a favourite. It is potentially competitive with oil and gas at crude prices well below current levels. It would also benefit from the US’s large coal reserves and allow carbon emissions to be captured more easily. But storing these emissions underground still looks challenging, while the economics will depend heavily on government subsidies.Even with a clearer regulatory outlook, establishing a thriving business takes a while – witness Europe’s experience with wind farms and solar energy. As with any new technology, many of the original champions are likely to flounder. Awarding them the high multiples common in much of the alternative energy sector requires great faith in the political process. US lawmakers certainly have not earned that yet.
365;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-07-24T19:54:18Z;Renewable energy is no corn-fed fad;;Trucks and trains carrying 100,000 bushels of corn a day shunt into VeraSun’s 417-acre ethanol plant in a cornfield near Aurora, South Dakota. VeraSun buys the corn from local farmers in America’s Midwest. It is milled, mashed, fermented with yeast, and distilled to make ethanol, a type of alcohol. Then the ethanol is shipped out by train, mixed with gasoline, and sold to motorists at filling stations as a green fuel for cars.Don Endres, a 45-year-old former internet entre­preneur, founded the Aurora plant in 2003. He has added more plants in nearby Iowa. Now VeraSun contributes 1/20 of America’s total ethanol production. In June it attracted $420m from investors in an initial public offering on the New York stock exchange, which valued Endres’ start-up at about $1.75bn. The company’s shares rose by a third on the first day of trading.Endres and VeraSun are not the only ones benefiting from the current boom in renewable energies. As oil prices climb above $70 a barrel, governments, consumers and investors have been forced to seek an alternative to burning fossil fuels, such as ethanol and other biofuels, solar power and wind power.Sceptics believe the boom is unsustainable. They think the bubble will pop, or badly deflate, when world oil prices drop. But others believe renewable energies have gathered a momentum that cannot be stopped. “It is not about alternative technologies any more, but mainstream technologies,” says Ron Pernick of Clean Edge, a US-based research group, one of many that now follow this market. Mr Pernick believes the total global clean energy market could grow from $40bn currently to $167bn by 2015.New companies are springing up to meet this anticipated demand and investors are taking them seriously. About $1bn of US-based venture capital flowed into ethanol and the other new energy technologies in 2005, according to Clean Edge and Nth Power, a venture capital group.Investors include some well-known names. Last November Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment fund bought an $84m share in Pacific Ethanol, a California producer. Vinod Khosler, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, has set up a fund that invests in renew­able energy.Even Richard Branson says he wants Virgin to consider producing ethanol somewhere in the US. Robert Wilder, whose WilderHill Clean Energy Index is one of several indices tracking the growth of the US market, says the alternative energy fund he runs had $187m under management at the start of 2006 and by June had $650m. “There are strong net inflows of about $20m a week to the fund that tracks our index,” he says.The index rose dramat­ically to a peak in May this year but has sold off since then. It is still up by about 46 per cent since its launch in August 2004 and is up about 8.5 per cent over the last 12 months. The recent decline, Mr Wilder says, is in line with the general fall in stock markets and is to be expected in a young, volatile sector. “The gloom of late is serious yet vague and seems to extend to all areas of higher risk. Clean energy stocks are just the sort of smaller, riskier pure plays that get hit especially hard in these conditions,” he says.Solar power was probably the hottest sector last year. Clean Edge estimates that $150m of venture capital went into US-based comp­anies in 2005, double 2004’s level. One of the biggest new companies, Suntech Power, a Chinese manufacturer of solar cells based in a factory in a high-tech zone west of Shanghai, had sales of $226m in 2005 and, in December, listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.Zhengrong Shi, a 43-year-old Chinese former academic who founded the company in 2001, expects revenues in 2006 of $450m.Suntech’s biggest markets are Germany and Japan but the US is increasingly important. At the moment the solar industry is being held back by a chronic shortage of silicon, which goes into the cells, and prices have risen 50 per cent compared with two years ago but Mr Shi expects prices to drop drastically when silicon supply accelerates, boosting retail demand even further.“Solar power is where the mobile phone industry was about 10 years ago,” says Mr Shi. The global sales market for solar power, currently $13bn-$15bn, could be worth more than $50bn by 2010, he estimates.Wind energy also prospered in 2005 when more than 11,500 megawatts of wind power were installed around the world, 40 per cent more than in 2004, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. European manufacturers dominate the wind industry but other companies such as GE have pushed aggressively into this sector. Clean Edge says the global wind market, worth about $11.8bn in 2005, could grow to $48.5bn in another 10 years.But ethanol is the sector of the moment. It is added to gasoline in cars because it contains high levels of oxygen helping the fuel burn more cleanly and producing less carbon monoxide and other pollutants from the exhaust. As it is mixed in increasingly greater proportions in the fuel, it displaces more and more gasoline. Its use has grown steadily in the US as refiners and more than 20 states, including California and New York, have cut back or banned another longer standing gasoline additive, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), which was found to contaminate ground water. In April Pres­ident George W. Bush said the “best way and the fastest way” to reduce America’s dependence on oil was “to expand the use of ethanol”.There are more than 95 ethanol production plants in the US and more are being constructed, producing almost 4.3bn gallons of ethanol every year, according to the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council. Ethanol’s supporters hope the US goes the way of Brazil, the world’s biggest user of ethanol for cars. Clean Edge predicts the US biofuels market could grow from $15.7bn to $52.5bn by 2015. In Brazil, ethanol is distilled from sugar cane. In the US, corn is most commonly used, which is why many big producers are in the Midwest.Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s biggest grain processors and number one US supplier of ethanol, said earlier this year it would add more plants, including some in Iowa and Nebraska, to raise annual production by 50 per cent. Its share price has rocketed this year.The big US car manufacturers expect American motorists to begin shifting to ethanol in growing numbers. They are increasing production of flexible-fuel vehicles, cars that can use E85 or regular petrol, a blend of 85 per cent ethanol and 15 per cent gasoline. Chrysler, for one, says it will produce 500,000 of this type of car a year by 2008, about a quarter of its US annual production. Others such as GM, Ford and Toyota are putting flex-fuel vehicles on the road.The trouble is, say the sceptics, this has all happened before and ended badly. After previous oil shocks, in the 1970s and 1980s, companies made expensive investments in alternative energy that proved largely redundant when the oil price fell again and fossil fuels were once more economical. Leonardo Maugeri, oil strategist at ENI, the Italian oil group, says his company, like most oil companies, uses a long-term planning price for oil of $30-$35 a barrel, partly because, he says, there are plentiful reserves of oil yet to be discovered in the world. “The only countries that have been fully explored are the US and Canada,” he says. “The US and Canada hold only 3 per cent of proven oil reserves. There are countries such as Iraq that are quite virgin.”If the oil price halves, then many new young alternative energy companies might be vulnerable, although their cheerleaders insist green energy’s current upward cycle is very different from any previous one. “There is no going back,” says Suntech’s Mr Shi. Global warming, for example, is perceived as a more real threat, as underlined by the popularity of Al Gore’s recent film about environmental damage caused by pollution.Technological breakthroughs have brought production costs down. Even if more oil is drilled, the geopolitics of getting it to the west may prove tricky. Then there is the added uncertainty created by the growth of energy-thirsty economies such as India and China.Companies today, says Nancy Floyd, managing director of Nth Power, a venture capital business, want to isolate themselves from these global energy uncertainties. That usually means turning to alternative sources they can control themselves. What is driving this now, says Ms Floyd, is “the need for reliability. Companies that want power, want on-site generation”.But perhaps the biggest reason why this cycle may really be different is stricter, greener government regulation. Many governments are embracing policies supporting renewable energy. The 2005 US Energy Policy Act, passed last summer, requires an increase in annual renewable energy production to 7.5bn gallons by 2012, almost double the 2005 output of 4bn gallons.According to Clean Edge, nearly 20 US states have renewable energy standards that require power suppliers to provide a certain percentage – often up to 25 per cent – of electricity from clean energy. In Europe, farmers get subsidies worth €45 per hectare for growing energy crops, and the European Union has set a target that biofuels should make up 5.75 per cent of transport fuel consumption by 2010.The European Commission is considering legally obliging oil companies to mix plant-derived fuel into gasoline they sell to consumers. Europe has tended to have tougher green legislation than the US. As a result, the biggest markets for renew­able energies are in Europe, although the US is catching up. This has often determined where the new companies have chosen to list their shares – many have preferred to list on London’s junior stock market, AIM, for example.But even if the new companies can survive a drop in the oil price and prosper, critics say renewable energy will never have the scale to meet the world’s growing energy needs. The 4bn gallons of ethanol produced annually in America represents just 1 per cent of US fuel consumption. Brazil’s ethanol industry, says Nicholas Parker of Cleantech Venture Network, has relied on big subsidies and “went through two booms and busts and has taken 30 years to get where it is”.In the US, there are no extensive supply networks for ethanol: E85 is available at about 700 of the US’s 165,000 filling stations.“There are 230m light vehicles in the US and only 1.5m-5m can burn ethanol,” says Peter Tertzakian, chief energy economist at Arc Financial Corporation. If every car in America were converted to flex-use, says ENI’s Mr Maugeri, virtually all the US’s soil would have to be turned over to corn production to fuel them. It may not even be that green. Think of all the nitrogen and fertilizer it takes to grow the corn. Wind and solar power are held back by the expense of steel and silicon.One alternative, says Tertzakian, is to look across America’s northern border to the Canadian tar sands in Alberta.Oil from the tar sands – thick, gooey, and mixed with sand and rock – is notoriously expensive to extract and incurs high environmental costs. On average, it takes the equivalent of about 0.7 barrels of oil energy to extract 1 barrel of light oil from the oil sands. But it too has become more profitable now world prices are higher. Technological advances, such as injecting steam deep into the ground to soften up the oil before drilling or more automated machines to excavate it at ground level, have helped.In theory, there could be as much oil in Alberta as in all of Saudi Arabia. Last year C$10bn in new investments poured into the tar sands as companies rushed to get at it, according to Tertzakian. Production is rising – currently 1m barrels a day, it could get as high as 3m a day in 10 years, says Tertzakian. “That is 3-4 per cent of world supply,” he says. “That is not trivial.”
366;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-07-03T18:53:57Z;Wall Street higher ahead of holiday;;US stocks ended higher on Monday in light trading as markets closed early ahead of the Fourth of July holiday.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent, or 9.99 points, at 1,280.19, while the Nasdaq Composite was also up 0.8 per cent, or 18.34 points, at 2,190.43. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent, or 77.80 points, to 11,228.02.“There’s virtually no players here,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, commenting on the thin volume.Ford dropped 3.2 per cent to $6.71 after June sales in the US fell 7 per cent compared with the same period last year, led by a steep fall in truck sales.Shares in General Motors initially climbed 2 per cent on continuing hopes of a partnership with Nissan and Renault, but were dragged lower by the close, losing 1.3 per cent to $29.41. After the bell, GM said its US sales last month fell 25.9 per cent compared with June 2005.Michaels Stores climbed 2.4 per cent to $42.21. The home decoration and seasonal merchandise retailer agreed to a buyout offer worth more than $6bn from private equity groups Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group.Manufacturing in the US expanded in June, but at a slower pace than economists had predicted. The Institute for Supply Management’s index showed a decline in activity from May’s reading, reinforcing a picture of slowing US growth. “This supports the idea that the Fed can maybe quit [raising interest rates],” said Mr Paulsen.Technology stocks were in demand, with Hewlett Packard gaining 2.6 per cent to $32.51 after it agreed to use a patented technology that would allow laptops to connect with multiple peripheral devices. Computer Sciences Corporation rose 4.3 per cent to $50.63, recovering some of its drop on Friday.Financial stocks made strong advances on news that Charles Prince, the chairman of Citigroup rejected the idea of breaking up the bank, sending shares up 1.5 per cent to $48.97. Merrill Lynch added 2.3 per cent to $71.16.Wal-Mart dropped 1.3 per cent to $47.57 after the world’s largest retailer said on Saturday that June sales would be at the lower end of forecasts. Archer Daniels Midland had its best day in eight weeks, climbing 4.2 per cent to $43.03.Crude pushed higher, lifting related stocks ahead of an expected surge in demand for petrol over the Fourth of July holiday. Anadarko Petroleum added 2.2 per cent to $48.75, and ConocoPhillips rose 2 per cent to $66.82.Mining stocks gained. Alcoa rose 2.3 per cent to $33.09 after brokerages suggested the aluminium maker could be a takeover target. Freeport McMoran rose 5.6 per cent to $58.53 and Newmont Mining added 4.9 per cent to $55.52.
367;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Wind changes in favour of biofuels;;Investors are betting that American cattle will find something else to eat, as the money surging into new ethanol production shifts resources from feedstock to energy.Industry experts estimate that each new 100m gallon-a-year ethanol plant consumes enough corn to feed 500,000 cattle, generating a spirited debate among US agricultural leaders about the relative priority of food versus fuel.Undeterred, investors are backing the construction of more than 30 new plants in the US which would produce an additional 2.6bn gallons a year and lift output to 7.3bn gallons by mid-2007.Biofuels, which include ethanol and bio-diesel, have displaced wind farms as the biggest focus area of renewable energy investment by private equity, according to New Energy Finance, a UK-based consultancy.While recent investor focus has been on the performance of ethanol-related equity issues, New Energy estimates that the global value of investments in biofuels sponsored by private equity reached $957m in the first five months of this year, up from a negligible amount in the same period a year ago. Wind energy, last year’s big thing, attracted just $24m, compared with $932m previously.“Biofuels are the flavour of the month. Ethanol is now bigger than wind,” says Michael Liebreich, chief executive of New Energy Finance.Private equity investment in biofuels ignores the investments made by companies such as Archer Daniels Midland – the largest US ethanol producer – and Cargill, the agribusiness group which has said it plans to remain focused on its animal feed business.Investors eager to capitalise on the growing interest in alternatives to fossil fuels previously focused on wind because it was the most mature renewable energy technology.But more efficient ways of producing ethanol have combined with the rising oil price and problems with the supply of wind turbines to make biofuels more attractive.Mr Liebreich said the relative prices of ethanol and fossil fuels were the key to the surge in ethanol investment. “Our research shows that ethanol makers in the US can break even at an oil price of $55 a barrel without subsidies. With subsidies, they can make money when oil is at about $40 a barrel, though the precise figures vary from state to state.”Pat Woertz, ADM’s new chief executive, told analysts last week that the company did not need $70 oil to justify a capital expenditure programme which will see it add more than 2bn gallons of ethanol a year to its existing capacity.Mr Liebreich warned that ethanol companies remained “a commodities gamble”, and were vulnerable to a fall in the oil price or to large movements in the ethanol price. The wholesale price of corn-derived ethanol has more than doubled over the past year to top $3, driven by its use as a petrol additive to replace MTBE – a compound known to contaminate water tables – following new environmental rules introduced this month which removed insurance protection for MTBE producers.While supply and demand is evenly matched at present, some producers forecast there could be a shortage towards the end of the year, depending on the percentage of ethanol that refiners blend with petrol. However, the amount of new capacity coming on stream has led many analysts to forecast that there could be a glut as early as 2008 unless greater efforts are made to improve the infrastructure to transport ethanol from its core producing area in the US Midwest to the areas of greatest demand on the coasts.The mounting competition between the use of ethanol for food and fuel could drive up the price of food, pitting wealthy western car drivers against hungry consumers in developing countries.The US, the world’s largest exporter of corn, will convert as much or more of the grain into ethanol next year than it will sell abroad, according to estimates by the US Department of Agriculture.
368;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-06-19T21:02:39Z;US ethanol producers plan to tap investors;;US ethanol producers plan to tap equity investors for at least an additional $700m over the next month despite uncertainty over demand for its use as a fuel additive for US cars.Two initial public offerings are planned in the wake of the successful IPO last week of VeraSun, the second-largest US ethanol producer after Archer Daniels Midland. VeraSun’s stock climbed 30 per cent on its first day.Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings is expected to be next, in a Nasdaq float valuing it at $1.6bn, followed by Hawkeye Holdings with a $350m deal.Ethanol has attracted the attention of prominent business figures. Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman, last year invested $84m in Pacific Ethanol, which builds ethanol plants.But future demand is unclear, with bottlenecks in the transportation and refining of ethanol for mixing with gasoline. “The current profitability of ethanol plants is not sustainable based on new production coming on line,” said Fabrizio Zichichi at commodities trader Noble Group.
369;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-06-14T23:23:23Z;Ethanol producer VeraSun soars on debut;;Shares in VeraSun Energy Corporation, the second-largest US ethanol producer, soared by as much as 30 per cent on their first day of trading in New York after an initial public offering raised $419.8m for the company and its shareholders.The powerful market debut, the first by an ethanol producer this year, demonstrated the exceptional demand for ethanol as an alternative fuel amid spiralling oil and gas prices.Shares in ADM, the largest US ethanol producer and widely seen as the best benchmark for the sector, have risen more than 85 per cent in the past year. Buoyed by VeraSun’s strong debut, ADM shares had risen to $38.77 by the close on Wednesday.As oil prices have risen, many investors are betting that petrol distributors will look for oil alternatives and additives such as ethanol.Ethanol emits fewer pollutants than petrol and as a result would also stand to benefit from any clampdown on fuel emissions by environmental regulators.Shares in VeraSun opened for trading nearly 22 per cent above the offer price at $28. The stock closed at $30 in New York.The company and stockholders had sold 18.25m shares at $23 each through the IPO, according to the company, exceeding the $21 to $22 range forecast in an earlier regulatory filing.Other companies with ethanol-related businesses benefited from VeraSun’s powerful market debut.Shares of Pacific Ethanol, a California-based ethanol producer and distributor, had risen 7.9 per cent to $21.75 by the close.Ethanol producers with diversified operations rose more modestly than pure-play ethanol producers.MGP Ingredients, which makes ethanol plus a variety of other ingredients and distillery products, rose about 2 per cent.The Chicago Board of Trade recently launched an ethanol futures contract giving investors another means of trading on movements in ethanol prices.There are 101 US ethanol plants with capacity to produce almost 4.8bn gallons annually, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, a lobbying group based in Washington.
370;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-29T16:34:07Z;Wall Street pauses to take stock;;Wall Street reached Monday’s Memorial Day holiday – a traditional point for taking stock of the year – with the main indices just in positive territory. However, the market was still trying to assess the effects of the sharp correction in May, of which leading technology stocks appear to have been the biggest casualties.For the year to date, the S&P 500 index, the most widely used index of large companies, has risen 2.1 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 5.3 per cent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite 0.2 per cent.All suffered declines during May. The Nasdaq at one point had gained 7.5 per cent since the start of the year, while the Dow had climbed 8.6 per cent to stand within 80 points of its all-time high of 11,750.28, set in 2000.Oil companies have contributed most to the rise in the S&P when examined in terms of index points – which takes into account the size of their market capitalisation. ExxonMobil, now the world’s largest company, on its own accounted for 3.7 points of the S&P’s 25.7 point rise, more than twice the contribution of all but two of the index’s other constituents.Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, accounted for 2.2 index points, the second biggest factor in the S&P’s rise.The strongest performing S&P sector was agricultural materials, up 73.2 per cent. That was thanks to speculative interest in ethanol, for which demand is increasing due to the high price of crude oil. Archer Daniels Midland, the biggest ethanol producer, was up 69.7 per cent, second only to Allegheny Technologies, which gained 83.9 per cent.Allegheny comes from the steel sector, the second-strongest performer for the year with a rise of 63.2 per cent on booming demand from emerging economies and acquisition activity. Like agricultural products, steel producers’ share prices have more than doubled over the last 12 months.The greatest brake on the S&P, and on the Nasdaq, came from the unpopularity of the largest technology stocks, which are still suffering falls years after the end of the internet bubble.Intel, the chip maker (down 27.3 per cent), Microsoft, the dominant software provider (down 9.7 per cent), and Dell, the world’s largest computer manufacturer (down 18 per cent), were all among the five worst performers in the S&P in terms of index points. Apple Computer, a star of 2005, gave up 11 per cent.Badly performing sectors in the S&P have also included tyres and rubber, which fell 24.9 per cent thanks to the continuing difficulties of the auto sector, and homebuilders, which gave up 22.7 per cent on concerns that the housing “bubble” would burst.Internet retailers were down 20.6 per cent, undermined by a poor performance from Ebay (down 21.8 per cent), while managed health – where there are growing worries about the prospects for long-term profitability – fell 20.3 per cent.
371;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-18T20:50:06Z;Wall Street lower after last minute sell-off;;US stocks closed lower on Thursday as a last minute sell-off erased gains made by bargain-hunters earlier in the session. Retail and technology posted the biggest gains, with investors eyeing Limited Brands and Amazon along with market debutant Burger King.“I’m a little surprised that we’re not seeing a bigger snap-back in the stock market today [Thursday],” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, who pointed to falling bond yields and the release of economic data that should have buoyed the market by easing fears of interest rate rises.“We got a reassuring [jobless] claims number saying job growth was weak. For stocks the big fear was this continued rise in rates. It [now] seems to have gotten a little better.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, or 8.51 points, at 1,261.81, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7 per cent, or 15.48 points, to 2,180.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled, also 0.7 per cent, or 77.32 points, to 11,128.29.Retail was the best performing sector, with the S&P Retail Index rising 1.4 per cent thanks to strong earnings reports.Sears Holdings was the star, reaching its highest level since July last year, after the retailer unveiled unexpectedly strong earnings. Shares gained 12.97 per cent to $155.85.Limited Brands added 5.5 per cent to $26.68, after it reported a better-than-expected 19 per cent increase in first-quarter profit. The news prompted Morgan Stanley to raise its rating on Limited from “equal weight” to “overweight”.Technology stocks also made advances. Amazon added 3.2 per cent to $32.61 after competitor Barnes & Noble reported a 0.3 per cent fall in same-store sales.Hewlett-Packard rose 1 per cent to $32.48, continuing the previous day’s gains after broker Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock from “under weight” to “equal weight”. HP’s rival Dell also nudged higher, rising 1.4 per cent to $23.95, ahead of the release of its quarterly earnings.Falling bond yields helped push homebuilders higher. Pulte was up 1.8 per cent at $33.00, while DR Horton rose 1.9 per cent to $27.50.UnitedHealthcare slumped 3.4 per cent to $45.30 after it received a subpoena requesting documents relating to stock-option grants and a lawsuit was filed against the company accusing it of violating anti-trust laws.Archer Daniels Midland fell 5.7 per cent to $39.80 after losing an appeal against a $44m penalty that a European Court had imposed on it for operating a price-fixing cartel.Sprint rose 3.4 per cent to $22.92 after spinning off its fixed-line service Embarq to Sprint shareholders.Burger King made a strong stock market debut. More than 15m shares in the fast-food chain changed hands. Burger King gained 2.9 per cent to $17.50.
372;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-18T16:19:38Z;Prosecution of US cartel upheld;;"The European Court of Justice has thrown out an appeal by Archer Daniels Midland, a big US agribusiness, that it had been unfairly treated.The decision is a blow for companies facing separate fines in the US and Europe for international cartel activity and hoping to use the ?double jeopardy? defence that a person or entity cannot be tried twice for the same offence.Several other companies, such as those in the carbon and graphite products cartel, are lodging similar appeals.Archer had been fined $70m by the US authorities, and then a further ?43.9m by the European Commission for its part in a global lysine cartel in the 1990s.The company, which also saw three executives fined and jailed in the US for their role in the price-fixing scandal, claimed the European fine was excessive. ADM maintained double jeopardy had been breached because the commission did not take into account fines already paid to the North American authorities.The US company also argued the European fine had breached the principle of proportionality. It claimed the fine represented 115 per cent of European market turnover in lysine, an amino acid used in animal feed, during the final year of the infringement and so was disproportionate. The ECJ, however, said there had been no error of law and upheld earlier findings.The court also pointed out that ""Community law contains no general principle that the penalty be proportionate to the undertaking's size on the product market in respect of which the infringement was committed""."
373;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-15T22:00:20Z;Wall Street weakened by energy and mining stocks;;US stocks finished mixed on Monday after trading lower for much of the day, as the market remained skittish about inflation prior to the release of important economic data this week. A retreat in crude oil and commodity prices dragged energy and mining stocks lowerA retreat in crude oil and commodity prices dragged energy and mining stocks lower, while the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors bounced back. Stocks in focus included Target, Abbott Laboratories and Qualcomm.“The sell-off in commodities is a welcome relief,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “Commodities have been going up up up, and now it looks like normal profit-taking.“There’s some follow-through after the blood-letting of last week. But some of the background is improving. Bonds are up, and the dominant trend for the market remains up, but we have to recognise that economic growth is slowing down, which is healthy.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent, or 3.26 points, at 1,294.50, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent, or 5.26 points, at 2,238.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 47.78 points, at 11,428.77.Target was one of the day’s biggest fallers. The discount retailer reported a 12 per cent increase in quarterly earnings on Monday, which came in below the expectations of analysts. Target fell 4.2 per cent to $50.02, its lowest level since May last year.The pull-back in commodities and oil prices took its toll on producers.Phelps Dodge tumbled 6.5 per cent to $89.25 and oil services company BJ Services shed 5.4 per cent to $35.86, its lowest level in a month.Archer Daniels Midland, the largest producer of ethanol in the US, was also hit by the fall in oil prices, losing 2 per cent to $43.24.Pharmaceuticals were the best performers, with the sector up 1.1 per cent after AstraZeneca announced that it would acquire UK biotech company Cambridge Antibody Technology. Abbott Laboratories was up 2.1 per cent to $42.30 and Merck gained 1.2 per cent to $34.69.NYSE fell 4.9 per cent to $68.90 amid ongoing speculation that officials are in Europe this week to consider a deal with a European exchange. Names in the frame include Euronext and the London Stock Exchange.Qualcomm fell 0.7 per cent to $48.63 following a ruling by the US Supreme Court that will potentially make it harder for patent owners to gain redress for infringements. Qualcomm derives about 60 per cent of its profits from royalty payments for technology it created.Pulte, the largest builder of homes in the US, fell 2.9 per cent to $33.44, and Lennar dropped 1.4 per cent to $49.81, after a survey indicated that confidence amongst homebuilders was at an 11-year low. The S&P 500 Homebuilding index is now at its lowest level since January 2005.
374;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-12T21:40:53Z;Wall Street unsettled by Fed language;;Wall Street was spooked this week by a combination of rising commodity prices and comments from the Federal Reserve that heightened fears about interest rates and inflation.Stocks in focus included Wachovia and Dell, while Archer Daniels Midland and General Motors provided some relief from the gloom.Markets were sluggish in the run-up to the meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open markets committee on Wednesday.The 25 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate to 5 per cent, the 16th in succession, was widely expected but the markets were unsettled by the language used by Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman.Traders initially did not know which way to turn after Mr Bernanke made no reference to a “pause” in monetary tightening, but instead said further rate increases “may yet be needed”.Having slept on it however, investors decided to take fright. This triggered a Thursday sell-off that was the largest loss on Wall Street since January.“That’s quite a typical reaction,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “If you look back at all 16 meetings, the real reaction came the day after, and that’s what we got on Thursday, and we’re seeing some follow-through today [Friday].”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent or 14.68 points for the day, or 2.6 per cent for the week, at 1,291.24.The Nasdaq Composite was also mauled, shedding 1.3 per cent or 28.92 points for the day at 2,243.78 – a loss of 4.2 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from a six-year high to lose 1 per cent, or 119.74 points, on Friday to 11,380.99, a fall of 1.7 per cent for the week.The Russell 2000 Index of small companies fared even worse, losing 5 per cent for the week.Wachovia disappointed investors after it announced it would buy Californian lender Golden West for $25.5bn, a price many investors felt was too high at a time when the lending industry was slowing. Wachovia fell 7.9 per cent to $54.67 for the week, and Golden West rose 5.2 per cent to an all-time high of $74.14.It was a particularly grim week for technology stocks, as bad news hit two titans of the sector, Dell and Cisco, which both made gloomy predictions for future business. The S&P Technology Hardware and Equipment Index dropped back to its February level, down 4.7 per cent for the week.On Tuesday, Dell said that its quarterly profits would fall short of its own forecasts, because of price cuts aimed at increasing market share and revenue. Dell, which had gained 2.7 per cent on Monday, finished the week down 6.5 per cent at $24.02, its lowest level since February 2003.Cisco followed suit the next day, reporting a rise in quarterly profit above analyst expectations. However, the networking equipment manufacturer fell 6.5 per cent to $20.34 after its fourth- quarter revenue forecast disappointed investors. Google which had returned above the $400 level, was also caught in the melee and finished the week down 5.5 per cent at $373.75.Chipmakers also suffered. The separation by Intel of its flash-memory unit – widely seen as a prelude to spinning off the business – allowed it to avoid the worst of the carnage on the Nasdaq. The stock fell just 1.2 per cent over the week. Other chip manufacturers and makers of flash memory were less lucky. Micron fell 7.3 per cent to $15.81, and Advanced Micro Devices slumped 8 per cent to $31.66.“It’s not a good market for tech,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at Cybertrader. “For two years we’ve had a market dominated by energy. There are very few times when energy does well and tech does well.”With commodity prices pushing higher, one of the biggest gainers was Archer Daniels Midland, the largest US producer of ethanol. The stock jumped 8.4 per cent to $44.10, leaving it up 25 per cent since late April and 87 per cent since January.Autos provided another bright spot. Delphi went to court with its unions to try to renegotiate labour contracts. As optimism grew that it would avoid a strike, shares rose 35.8 per cent to $1.31.General Motors, Delphi’s principal customer, also benefited, rising 12.6 per cent to $26.09, amid upgrades by Deutsche Bank and Keybanc Capital Partners.
375;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-11T17:50:05Z;The problem of paying the price twice;;Double jeopardy may conjure up images of murderers, avenging lawyers and lofty arg­uments over human rights.But it has be­come the fo­cus of a more prosaic, yet financially significant, battle by companies caught up in international cartel investigations. Their complaint is that they are paying multimillion-dollar penalties twice because of fines im­posed separately by authorities in Europe and North America for the same offence. This issue will come to a head next Thursday when Europe’s top court is due to rule on a legal challenge to the fining principles brought by Archer Daniels Midland, the big US agribusiness group, which became mired in a global cartel case, centred on the lysine and citric acid markets, in the 1990s.Similar cases are in the pipeline – and, with the focus on anti-trust issues intensifying and potential penalties in cartel cases now running to tens of millions of dollars, lawyers say many corporate clients share the underlying concerns. “The issue has been around for a decade, but the fines have now become so very substantial,” says one City of London litigation partner. The companies’ side of the story is exemplified by SGL Carbon, a medium-sized German engineering group, one of a clutch of companies in­volved in a worldwide cartel controlling the graphite electrodes market, which came to light in the late 1990s.The price-fixing conspiracy was first pursued by the US Department of Justice and resulted in a number of int­ernational companies agreeing to plead guilty and pay fines. SGL Carbon was subject to a US$135m penalty, then a C$12.5m (US$11m) fine from Canadian authorities.A few years later the European Commission completed its own inquiry and imposed a second set of fines. This time, SGL Carbon’s penalty was €80.2m (US$103m), cut to €69.1m on appeal. Even so, the total penalty imposed amounted to about one-fifth of annual sales, which last year came to €1.07bn. It easily topped the Commission’s requirement that its own fines should not amount to more than 10 per cent of the offender’s sales.SGL began its own legal challenge, which is also awaiting a final ruling from the European Court of Justice. “The company strongly believes that there has been double jeopardy, which is not permitted by law,” it complained, after learning of the Commission’s fines.Part of the problem, prosecuted companies complain, is the broadbrush way the penalties are either calculated or negotiated, and the fact that these are not necessarily directly related to the scale of the regional market distortion that occurred.For example, the Commission fixes a basic fine, bearing in mind the size and impact on the market, but ad­justs this for aggravating or mitigating factors. In the US, plea agreements tend to be a matter of negotiation.Another argument is that the system tends to penalise European and US companies more heavily than Asian counterparts caught up in cartel activity, simply be­cause their businesses are concentrated in markets where fines are levied.Moreover, it be may investors who bear the brunt. “Monetary fines are an indirect deterrent – you end up punishing the shareholders rather than the individuals concerned [in the cartel ac­tivity],” says Jon Lawrence, partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, a London-based law firm. Companies’ pleas, however, have tended to fall on deaf ears – so far. In general, the response from judges and officials at the European court has been that the procedures and penalties im­posed by the Commission and the North American authorities pursue different ends: the first, undistorted competition in the EU and the latter, the integrity of the North American market.Also, a preliminary opinion in the ADM case pointed out that the “double jeopardy” principle may have its limitations. While this is an established legal standard designed to prevent double prosecutions in the same country, “it cannot be considered that there is any principle of public international law that prevents the authorities or courts of different states from trying and convicting a person on the basis of the same facts”, suggested Antonio Tizzano, then advocate-general.So while corporate lawyers ex­press sympathy with companies even when they have put their hands up to price-fixing, they are reluctant to predict change. “It feels unfair to the companies,” says Oliver Bretz, partner at Clifford Chance, the law firm based in the City of London. “But, politically, everyone wants to be seen protecting their own territory.”
376;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;ADM set to boost ethanol production;;Archer Daniels Midland on Wednesday announced plans to boost its ethanol production amid continuing controversy over future demand for the alternative fuel in the US.The agribusiness group derives the bulk of its earnings from processing commodities such as oilseed, cocoa and wheat, but is now the largest US producer of ethanol and is expanding its biodiesel business.ADM said it would build a new 275m-gallon-a-year plant in Iowa to convert ethanol from locally-grown corn, and recently-announced expansions will boost its annual production by 50 per cent to about 1.5bn gallons over the next two years.The investment comes amid concerns that US producers would be unable to keep up with demand for ethanol, which is being phased in as a gasoline additive to replace MTBE, a compound known to contaminate water tables.Sam Bodman, US energy secretary, last week suggested that the US could discard its tariff on imports – notably from Brazil – to meet demand. The remarks sparked outrage from the farm lobby, which is benefiting from millions of dollars in subsidies to boost production as part of the new US efforts to lift alternative-fuel production.Mike Johanns, US agriculture secretary, this week sought to defuse the controversy by insisting that domestic producers were able to meet expected demand. “There are no current plans in terms of that tariff,” he said after a speech in Chicago, though he admitted it was a point of discussion.Mr Johanns was introduced by Pat Woertz, a senior executive at Chevron who was last month lured from the oil and gas group to become ADM’s president and chief executive. “Renewable fuels are just exploding. The economics [of ethanol] are there regardless of your public policy position in various countries,” Ms Woertz told the FT following her appointment.ADM’s share price slumped more than 8 per cent following Mr Bodman’s remarks, but has recovered and on Wednesday reached a 52-week high of $45.95. The stock has gained more than 85 per cent so far this year.However, some analysts remain concerned that investors have priced in too much of a premium for future ethanol production as margins are expected to fall when supply bottlenecks linked to the phasing out of MTBE are resolved.
377;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-09T20:41:57Z;Wall Street flat as investors await Fed decision;;US stocks were flat on Tuesday as investors kept their powder dry ahead of Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee.Analyst upgrades on Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and General Motors were offset by falls in the tech sector after a surprise profit warning from Dell.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat, up 0.48 points at 1,325.14, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.3 per cent or 6.74 points at 2,338.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent, or 55.23 points, at 11,639.77.“The market’s less flat than it was [on Monday], and I don’t think we should expect more than that,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies and Co.“Historically, we don’t get much action before a Fed decision.”After the close of trade on Monday computer maker Dell said that its quarterly profits would fall short of its own forecasts, due to price cuts aimed at increasing market share and revenue. Dell, which had gained 2.9 per cent on Monday, tumbled 4.7 per cent to $25.20. Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse reduced their price targets for the stock.The car sector was the day’s best performer on the S&P 500, as General Motors bounced 9.6 per cent higher to $25.80 after a revision to its first-quarter results, which now exclude a charge related to retiree healthcare.The revision meant GM swung from loss to profit for the first quarter. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from “sell” to “hold”. Ford also did well, adding 2.9 per cent to $7.17.Mortgage providers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae gained after ratings upgrades from Bank of America. Freddie Mac was raised from “neutral” to “buy”, helping the shares rise 1.2 per cent to $62.97.News of fresh accounting irregularities at Fannie Mae was overshadowed by BoA’s upgrade from “sell” to “neutral”. The stock rose 2.8 per cent to $51.52.Mining stocks were in focus as gold hit another 25-year high above $700 a troy ounce, while the dollar hit an 8-month low against the yen. Newmont, based in Denver, rose 4 per cent to $57.93, and Barrick added 2.7 per cent to $34.87.McDonald’s reported a 6 per cent rise in same store sales in April, ahead of analysts’ expectations, sending shares in the fast-food chain up 1.2 per cent to $35.83.Archer Daniels Midland gained 4.6 per cent to $45.22. The company, which is the largest producer of ethanol in the US, has seen its shares gain 13 per cent since Thursday and 50 per cent since February on the back of new regulations mandating the use of ethanol as a fuel additive, which came into force last week.The healthcare sector was one of the worst performers on the S&P 500, with United Healthcare falling 2.8 per cent to $43.80, and Cigna down 4.6 per cent to $88.73. Cigna has lost a third of its value since March.
378;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-02T20:55:50Z;Wall Street gains with Dow at six year high;;Wall Street gained on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a six-year high on the back of energy stocks and strong earnings reports.Markets had been pushed lower in frenetic trading on Monday after CNBC reported that Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, believed the market had misinterpreted his congressional testimony as being dovish.“I think [the CNBC report] really did surprise people,” said Fritz Meyer, senior investment officer at AIM Investments. “The market really wants a pause [in rate increases].”But Wall Street recovered on Tuesday, buoyed by energy companies benefiting from the rise in crude oil prices, and robust earnings reports from Archer Daniels Midland, St Paul Travelers, and Texas Utilities.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 8.02 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 1,313.21, the Nasdaq composite was up 5.05 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,309.84 and the Dow was 73.16 points, or 0.6 per cent, higher at 11,416.45.Energy stocks pushed higher amid continued supply worries from Iran. Market unease was exacerbated by the decision of Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, to nationalise the country’s foreign-run gas fields.Nymex crude for June delivery closed at $74.61, its third successive day of increases. In that time crude has risen more than 5 per cent.Exxon Mobil gained 2 per cent at $64.67, while ChevronTexaco added 2.7 per cent to $62.80.Two silver mining stocks with significant Bolivian operations suffered severe falls after recent run-ups. Coeur dAlene fell 8.3 per cent, on the second-heaviest volume on the NYSE, while Amex-quoted Apex Silver Mines dropped 15.7 per cent.Archer Daniels Midland, the ethanol maker and processor of agricultural commodities, also benefited from high oil prices. It reported stronger than expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter to March 31. Its shares rose 10.3 per cent to $41.90 in exceptionally heavy trading.Other ethanol makers have gained after the adoption this week of new fuel additive standards for cars that increasingly favour ethanol. Pacific Ethanol gained 8.7 per cent to $36.94.Insurer St Paul Travelers turned in better than expected earnings thanks to a mild winter. It unveiled a plan for a $2bn share buy-back, sending its price 5.1 per cent higher to $45.60.Insurer Safeco rose after it reported earnings 23 per cent above analyst forecasts. Shares jumped 4.7 per cent to $54.10.The utilities sector posted one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500, with the S&P Utilities Index up 1.4 per cent on Tuesday.Texas Utilities surged 15 per cent to $57.50 after it reported a 37 per cent rise in first-quarter net income and said it would build coal-powered stations outside Texas.
379;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-05-01T20:57:18Z;US stocks hit after Bernanke testimony claim;;Wall Street trading came to a dramatic conclusion on Monday, following a report that Ben Bernanke believed his testimony last week had been misinterpreted by the markets.Stocks were knocked back from earlier gains that had been made on the back of strong consumer spending and personal income data. The CNBC television network reported that Mr Bernanke had told a reporter he had not intended to signal a “doveish” policy on interest rates, and merely wished to show that he was “flexible”.The main indices all dipped sharply on the news, to close the day in the red.At the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent, or 5.42 points, down at 1,305.19, while the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent, or 17.784 points, to 2,304.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent, or 23.85 points, lower at 11,343.29.Wal-Mart reported a 6.8 per cent preliminary gain in same-store sales for April compared with last year. The figures, a significant improvement on March, helped the world’s largest retailer – out of favour with the market for a while – to gain 2.0 per cent to $45.93.Archer Daniels Midland was another strong gainer, adding 4.6 per cent to $38.This was largely due to bullish expectations for ethanol, of which Archer Daniels is the leading producer. On Friday it appointed former Chevron executive Patricia Woertz as its new CEO.“The message being sent here is that in the eyes of the board, the future of this company is in energy,” said Len Teitelbaum of Merrill Lynch.Investors believe Archer Daniels is poised to benefit from the increasing amounts of ethanol that are being added to gasoline. ADM has gained more than 50 per cent since January.Chevron reported a 48 per cent increase in first-quarter net income to $4bn, which was boosted by its acquisition of Unocal. It was up 0.3 per cent to $61.17, in line with strong results for the rest of the sector.Steel stocks also gained on Monday after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Nucor from “neutral” to “buy”. The S&P steel index has more than doubled since October of last year. Nucor, which is the largest of the “mini-mill” operators in the US, gained 5.6 per cent to $114.87, bringing with it US Steel, up 4.7 per cent to $71.75.Brokerage houses and investment banks were among the worst performers on Wall Street, beaten even more after the comments of reporter Maria Bartiromo on CNBC. The S&P investment banking index has fallen by 4.2 per cent in the past two days. Merrill Lynch finished the day down 3.3 per cent at $73.71 while Lehman Brothers shed 5.1 per cent to $71.75.“It’s nothing more than rotation,” said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum. “I think people on Wall Street can no longer walk and chew gum at the same time.”
380;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
381;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-04-28T16:31:12Z;Chevron profits jump on strong crude prices;;"Chevron, the second biggest US oil company, on Friday followed its rivals ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips in announcing strong financial results.As Congress discusses everything from taxpayer rebates to imposing taxes on oil company profits to quell anger over the rising prices at the pump, Chevron reported a 48 per cent increase in net income to $4bn for the first quarter.US petrol prices have risen to above $3 a gallon, tracking the rise in oil prices to over $70 a barrel.Chevron's better-than-expected earnings of $1.80 a share, up 41 per cent from last year, were given a boost by the company’s nearly 10 per cent increase in oil-equivalent production from a year ago because of its acquisition of Unocal. That acquisition also helped boost Chevron’s revenue, which rose 32 per cent to $54bn over the year-earlier period.“The outperformance was spread through the divisions,” said Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse First Boston.In an election year, politicians are eager to be seen addressing the rise in petrol prices and have made oil companies the focus of their ire. The companies note that they have spent many years and billions of dollars to bring the product to market and, just as they suffered through the lean years, they should be rewarded when prices are high.Former Chevron executive to head Archer Daniels Midland

382;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2006-02-26T16:30:07Z;February 26: Brazil’s Dutch disease;;"Brazil’s Dutch diseaseIs Brazil coming down with Dutch disease? The prognosis is uncertain (though the evidence leaves this analyst in little doubt). The disease (which first struck the suddenly-oil-rich Netherlands in the 1970s) manifests itself when a country’s earnings from one set of exports are so great they drive its currency skyward, destroying competitiveness in the rest of the economy. Brazil certainly seems to offer the right environment for an outbreak. The real traded as high as R$2.11 to the dollar last week, from R$2.60 a year ago. Brazil’s export boom, which produced a trade surplus of $45bn last year, has been driven by demand for soya beans, iron ore and other commodities resulting from strong global growth led by China.But how healthy is the rest of the economy? So far, trade figures offer no easy diagnosis. Exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods are actually slightly greater than they were a year ago. While they may indicate slower growth, the figures do not yet suggest any serious side-effects from the stronger currency.But it is becoming hard to ignore some suspiciously Dutch-looking blotches across the export sector. One shoe maker has switched production from Brazil to China for export to the United States. A bus maker has cancelled expansion plans at home and diverted its investments overseas. Perhaps most worrying is the news from two of the world’s biggest commodities companies, Bunge and ADM. Bunge has cancelled plans to invest $1bn in Brazil and shut down nine soya processing plants. ADM has closed two plants and reduced its processing capacity by a third. While Bunge’s exports of processed soya products will fall this year, its overall exports, increasingly dominated by unprocessed soya beans, will continue to rise. Time to call the doctor.Peru riskOllanta Humala maybe a radical populist who plans significantly to increase state control over the Peruvian economy but he will not have a chance to put his ideas into practice. That seems to be the consensus in financial markets, with investors taking comfort from the revival in the opinion polls of Lourdes Flores, the right-wing candidate. Maybe they are right. But it is well worth taking a closer look. For one thing, in the recent past opinion polls have proved to be notoriously bad guides to electoral behaviour in Peru. You need only look to 1990 when the right-wing candidate and world famous author Mario Vargas Llosa was widely expected to win the contest only a couple of months before it took place. Or to 1995 when Javier Pérez de Cuéllar was tipped to take the presidency. (Both men were defeated by former President Alberto Fujimori). Take into account too the fact that Apoyo, a polling organisation responsible for one recent survey predicting a win by Ms Flores, failed to forecast Evo Morales’ triumph in Bolivia a couple of months ago. Apoyo predicted a very close race. Mr Morales won by a landslide. And then there is the very large number of “don’t knows” and “undecideds” being registered in recent polls. It all makes up for a very uncertain outlook. Anyone betting on a victory by Ms Flores needs to think very carefully about the downside.Mexican beerExpect healthy 2005 results on Monday from Femsa and Modelo, Mexico’s leading beer makers, on the back of an expanding domestic market and strong export growth. Both companies have become formidable exporters and now account for about half of all beer imported by the world’s two biggest markets: the US and China.UBS Investment Research believes Femsa, which produces brands such as Tecate, Dos Equis and Sol, will be the pick of the two. Estimates suggest it will report a 4 per cent rise in domestic volumes and an impressive 10.5 per cent increase in export volumes. UBS also believes Femsa Cerveza could surprise the market with higher-than-expected expansion in margins: 250 basis points on EBIT, bringing margins to 19.5 per cent; and 170 points on EBITDA.Costa Rica’s murky outlookOnly a miracle could now stop Oscar Arias, Costa Rica’s Nobel peace-prize-winning former president from returning to power after an absence of almost two decades.Following a long and tense manual recount of the votes cast during this month’s elections, the country’s electoral authorities are expected to announce victory for Mr Arias by the second week of March. But in the Arias camp any jubilation about the victory will be tempered by the scale of the challenge facing the incoming government.One reason is that Costa Rica needs reform, and it needs it quickly. Long the most advanced country in the region in terms of social indicators, and a vital pillar of democracy in Central America during the civil wars of the 1980s, Costa Rica is stagnating. Poverty levels have been stuck at around 20 per cent for at least a decade, and the absence of reforms have left the country with inefficient markets in telecommunications and insurance, both of which are provided exclusively by the state.At the same time, failure to modernise the country’s tax structure has left the government with a pitiful tax take equivalent to just 13 per cent of gross domestic product. Deadlock in the country’s legislative assembly over the last few years has made it impossible to raise taxation, forcing the government to tackle its structural deficit by cutting spending in sensitive areas such as infrastructure and welfare. Second, Costa Rica entered into Cafta, the free-trade agreement between Central America and the US in 2004. But it has failed to ratify the agreement at the legislative level – all the other signatories have already approved the accord, and El Salvador on Friday said it would meet all Cafta’s requisites by next week.Many trade experts and economists say that if Costa Rica does not push Cafta through it will find itself left behind. If he is designated president, Mr Arias must solve the deadlock quickly. On tax reform, there is some reason for optimism. The legislative assembly recently passed a the first debate in a proposed fiscal reform that would increase government revenue by two percentage points of GDP – not enough to resolve the problems, but a start nonetheless. Further efforts to boost tax take could find support from Ottón Solís, the leftwing leader of the Citizens’ Action Party (PAC), Mr Arias’ closest rival in the elections.Approving Cafta will be much tougher. Mr Arias must achieve a qualified majority in the legislative assembly – or roughly two-thirds of the votes in the 57-member chamber. To do that he will almost certainly have to turn to Mr Solís, whose party is expected to end up with as many as 18 seats. On the campaign trail, however, Mr Solís firmly rejected Cafta in its present form, and insisted he would try to renegotiate certain clauses if elected president – an endeavour most academics consider either impossible, impractical or both.The result, once again, could be stalemate in the legislative assembly and a slow – and tragic – loss of competitiveness for Costa RicaNotes on Brazil by Jonathan Wheatley, on Peru by Richard Lapper and on Mexico Costa Rica by Adam Thomson - richard.lapper@ft.com, jonathan.wheatley@ft.com, adamthomson.ftmexico@prodigy.net.mx"
383;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Expansion strategy pays off at Cargill;;"Efforts by Cargill to expand beyond its commodity trading business into higher margin areas such as health, nutrition and supply chain management paid off again on Tuesday with an 18 per cent rise in the group’s fourth-quarter earnings.The largest privately-held company in the US has, since 1999, been expanding into such new businesses through internal growth and acquisition.At the same time, Cargill – like rivals Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge – has been growing its grain and oilseed origination capacity in South America to take advantage of soaring demand for proteins such as soyabeans from China.Cargill a year ago said it wanted to invest $2bn in acquisitions and building new businesses. However, Bob Lumpkins, chief financial officer, on Tuesday said the company’s investments in the past 12 months had been “a little below what we had hoped to do”.That was partly because private equity bidders had boosted prices of some assets beyond levels considered reasonable by Cargill. “Some of it is about competition from private equity buyers that have tended to put prices at levels that in our judgement were too high. The private equity folks have been very aggressive,” Mr Lumpkins told the FT.Cargill boosted its presence in emerging markets in the fiscal year after buying Seara, a leading poultry and pork business in Brazil, and becoming the sole owner of Finexcor, an Argentine beef processor and exporter.In Canada, it bought Caravelle Foods, a supplier of frozen beef patties to the country’s quick-service restaurant industry. In food ingredients, Cargill bought cocoa processing facilities in England and Germany, and a chocolate plant in Germany that the company said would expand services to confectioners and other food makers in Europe and eastward.Cargill said net profit in the fourth quarter rose to $230m, from $195m a year earlier. Excluding a non-cash net gain of $578m, Cargill’s full-year profit rose 15 per cent to $1.5bn on revenue up 13 per cent at $71bn.Cashflow from operations increased 7 per cent to $3.2bn. Among contributors to Cargill’s earnings were its animal nutrition, beef, egg product, pork and poultry businesses worldwide. a global supply chain management network, which includes grain, oilseeds and other commodities and ocean shipping services; a US and Latin American-based salt business – which manufactures products for food and road de-icing - and units which offer grain marketing products that help farmers manage their price risk.Warren Staley, Cargill chairman and chief executive, said: “Today’s results are a tangible sign of the progress achieved in our company’s strategy to become a recognised leader in creating food and agricultural solutions that help customers succeed.”"
384;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2005-07-11T03:10:50Z;Bunge makes first purchase in China;;Bunge, one of the world’s three largest grain and oilseed processors, on Monday said it had made its first purchase of a soyabean crushing and refining plant in China.The move underscores the interest of western commodity processing companies in providing grain and oilseed processing capacity to China as the country’s appetite for protein-based commodities grows.Bunge’s rival Archer Daniels Midland already has 10 oilseed processing facilities in China, while Cargill is also active in the country.China is importing record amounts of soyabeans from Brazil and Argentina as it seeks to fulfil soaring demand for livestock feed. Soyabean meal is protein-rich and is primarily used to feed pigs and poultry in China amid growing demand for meat in Chinese diets.Western companies like ADM, Bunge and Cargill are helping South American farmers build soyabean producing capacity to provide sufficient supplies to China-based processing facilities operated by such companies, often in joint venture with Chinese companies.Bunge said it had agreed to buy a controlling interest in an “integrated soybean crushing and refining plant” in the port city of Rizhao, Shandong province, from Sanwei Group.Bunge said it would supply the plant from its soyabean “origination network” in North and South America.The purchase would be a first step in expanding the company’s capacity in China, according to Christopher White, Bunge regional general manager for Asia. “Bunge’s strategic intent is to expand its integrated business into China as we build our execution competencies and as good opportunities arise,” he said.The plant will link Bunge with customers in the expanding soyabean meal and oil markets in the Shandong region. Sanwei would retain a minority interest in a newly created joint venture company.Driven by rapid commercialization of its meat and feed industries, China’s consumption of soybean meal has risen by an average annual rate of 11 per cent since 1998, Bunge said.The US Department of Agriculture estimates China will consume around 22m tonnes this year, which represents roughly 16 per cent of global consumption.Shandong province is one of the largest and fastest-growing meat producing regions in China. It also has one of the highest levels of per capita vegetable oil consumption in China.
385;ADM;Archer Daniels Midland;2005-02-23T21:28:00Z;Wall St higher as inflation concerns ease;;Wall Street regained ground on Wednesday in the wake of Tuesday’s stormy session, as investors welcomed data showing that consumer prices rose less than expected in January.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 10,673.79, and the S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,190.80. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,031.25.The rally came as welcome relief to shell-shocked investors, who were left reeling on Tuesday after a sharp fall in the dollar and a spike in oil prices led the Dow and the S&P 500 to their biggest single-day fall in months.Concerns about mounting inflation and the sustain-ability of the US trade deficit have cast a shadow on trading in recent weeks. But investors received a respite on Wednesday after official US data showed that consumer prices rose less than expected in January.François Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Steans, said in a research report that rising prices could be a sign of a return to a pattern of higher inflation after years of lower price increases.“While we believe it is still early to say whether we have reached a secular turning point, we feel compelled to point out that a return of inflation cannot be assumed to be favourable for equities,” he said.Technology stocks were the focus of early attention in an otherwise quiet day for corporate news.Semiconductors led decliners on the S&P 500. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip company, shed 1.9 per cent to $23.31. Its chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 2.4 per cent to $16.60.Texas Instruments, the pocket calculator and microchip maker, slipped 0.4 per cent to $25.47. Motorola , the mobile handset maker, fell 0.9 per cent to $15.42 after it restated fourth-quarter earnings.Healthcare stocks were also in the spotlight after Medco Health Solutions, the pharmacy benefits manager, announced a $2.2bn deal to buy Accredo Health, the drug store services provider. The news sent Accredo shares soaring almost 40 per cent to $42.11. Medco shares slipped 0.7 per cent to $43.14.Elsewhere, Lowe’s, the hardware chain, rose 0.6 per cent to $57.90 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings up 27 per cent.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods giant that last month announced a $57bn deal to buy Gillette, a rival, was one of the biggest gainers on the Dow. Shares in P&G rose 2.4 per cent to $53.49 following an analyst upgrade. Gillette shares rose 2 per cent to $50.75.Goodyear, the tyremaker, was one of the day’s biggest gainers. Its shares rose 6.7 per cent to $14 after it said it expected to make a profit in the fourth quarter.Shares in food processors were lower after Archer Daniels Midland said it would not raise corn syrup prices this year - a signal that food processors are likely to continue to struggle against stiff competition and a lack of pricing power this year. ADM shares, which were also hit by an analyst downgrade, dropped 7.3 per cent. Shares in ConAgra, a rival, fell 3.2 per cent to $26.62. Bunge, the second-biggest US food processor, rose 0.6 per cent to $51.16.
