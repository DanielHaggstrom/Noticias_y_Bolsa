That put the stock on track for a record closing high and a market capitalisation of about $39bn.It was seen as a less favourable development for rival payments services providers, with PayChex down 1.3 per cent and Automatic Data Processing down 0.2 per cent.
1;PAYX;Paychex Inc;2017-11-07T18:30:38Z;ADP/Ackman: from gadfly to sad guy;Pershing Square founder has lost his groove;"As an intensely competitive tennis player, Bill Ackman knows the United States Tennis Association’s handicap system. If there were such a ranking for activist investors, he would have just dropped down it by a rung or two. His fund, Pershing Square, lost decisively on Tuesday in its efforts to catapult three representatives on the board of ADP, a payroll processor worth $50bn.Pershing Square has been bloodied by billions of losses at Valeant Pharmaceuticals and struggled to make a return at the burrito chain Chipotle. ADP made a tricky target as its shares are up 142 per cent in the last five years. Public sniping with its chief executive did not endear the corporate gadfly to shareholders. Activists’ most potent tool is their credibility. Mr Ackman has lost much of his.His case at ADP was delicately crafted. Despite big shareholder gains during the tenure of CEO Carlos Rodriguez the company’s profit margins are weak compared with rival Paychex. The company is set to be surpassed by hotshot Silicon Valley outsourcers like Workday.Powerful proxy adviser, ISS said Mr Ackman had made the case that “some additional shareholder oversight at the board would be beneficial”. But it advocated its clients should put him on the board in a roundabout way; by withholding votes for certain directors on the company’s ballot rather than explicitly voting for Mr Ackman’s separate slate. US proxy voting is byzantine but Mr Ackman makes a reasonable case when he advocates for single “universal ballot” where shareholders can mix and match their votes across slates.Given the structural barriers Pershing Square was facing, irritating a respected CEO was dangerous even if his operational arguments were compelling. Mr Rodriguez at one point called Mr Ackman a “spoiled brat” and then referred to Mr Ackman’s defeat on Tuesday as an “ass-whooping”. Pershing Square likes to point out that its fund is up 500 per cent since its 2004 inception. But it was up nearly 800 per cent three years ago; big wins at the likes of Canadian Pacific Railway are now dusty trophies.Because of past activists wins and the awakening of big passive funds, companies have upgraded their governance. Fewer easy targets exist. Mr Ackman needs to target one playing off his own diminished handicap to get his groove back."

It will vote against nomination committee chairmen at any company in the S&P 500 index that still has an all-male board from 2017 onwards.Clare Payn, head of corporate governance for North America at the UK fund house, said: “We feel there really should not be any all-male boards at this stage, as investors have been talking about this for so many years.”According to S&P Dow Jones, the index provider, four S&P 500 companies still have an all-male board: Coty, the beauty products manufacturer; Dentsply Sirona, the dental equipment company; PayChex, a provider of human resources services; and TransDigm Group, the manufacturer of parts for commercial and military aircraft.Another 177 companies in the S&P 1500 index, and 18 companies in the MSCI USA index of America’s 622 biggest businesses, have no female directors. Join us on April 19 for a conversation about women in the corporate worldLGIM’s stance goes further than most of its competitors. Several of the world’s largest fund companies, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity and Aberdeen, are pressing for greater gender diversity on boards, but have not committed to voting against directors at companies with all-male boardrooms.Helena Morrissey, a leading campaigner for gender equality in the workplace, urged other investors to harden their approach to the remaining companies lacking female directors.Ms Morrissey, who will become head of personal investing at LGIM next month after leaving Newton, the investment boutique, earlier this year, said she felt “exasperated” by the lack of progress on board diversity in the US.She said: “If a company doesn’t change [its board structure], then [investors] ultimately should vote against at least the chair of the nomination committee. It is bizarre that you would not [apply a tougher voting policy]. It is a failure.”A spokesperson for PayChex said a female director had recently resigned, and that a “search is actively under way for her successor”, while Coty said it planned to add a woman to its board before July. A spokesperson for Dentsply Sirona said: “We see [diversity] as a priority in future board member selection.” TransDigm did not respond to requests for comment.Investors are concerned about the lack of female directors in many of the world’s largest economies. Numerous academic studies have suggested companies with diverse boardrooms perform better, are less prone to scandal, and avoid groupthink.Women account for 20 per cent of directorships in the US, compared with 25 per cent in the UK and Australia, and more than 35 per cent in France and Norway, according to figures from MSCI, the data provider.Last week Hermes EOS, an influential adviser to large investors, urged Rio Tinto shareholders to vote against the re-election of the Anglo-Australian mining company’s chairman at its annual general meeting because of slow progress in improving the diversity of its board.LGIM decided to vote against all-male boards at Britain’s largest companies in 2015, and extended that policy to include FTSE 250 companies last year. Aviva Investors, the London-headquartered asset manager, also decided to vote against all-male boardrooms in the UK in 2014.Since these voting positions were adopted, a number of UK-listed companies, including Glencore, the mining company, Jimmy Choo, the luxury shoemaker, and JD Sports, the retailer, have appointed female board members.Abigail Herron, head of responsible investment at Aviva Investors, said the fund house plans to extend its UK voting policy to companies with all-male boards in North America, Europe and Japan.She said: “Having a voting policy against all-male boards is a very useful tool. It is such a powerful way to drive change.”Ms Payn added: “Of course it would be helpful if other [investors] took a tougher stance on all-male boards. I will not sit here and tell them how they should vote, but if we collectively came together, that would push companies even further.”ConvaTec, the UK provider of healthcare products that floated last October, is the only company in the FTSE 100 without a female board member.The number of companies in the FTSE 250 without a woman on their board has more than halved since 2015, to nine. The remaining companies with all-male boardrooms include Euromoney Institutional Investor, the financial publishing business; MetroBank, the challenger bank; and Centamin, the gold miner. "

We’re probably going to have a pretty decent earnings season, but earnings are going to be driven by cost reductions, rather than top-line growth.”Until there is an improvement in the labour market, corporate revenues will struggle to grow, he added.At the close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,078.75. The index has risen 4.7 per cent this month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 higher to 10,216.27 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,198.36.Alcoa fell 0.6 per cent to $10.87.

Shares in Apache were down 3.2 per cent to $85.07. ExxonMobil rose 0.3 per cent to $58.94 amid speculation that the company may be considering a bid for BP.Johnson & Johnson lost 0.6 per cent to $60.21 as the consumer products company said it would buy Micrus Endovascular for about $480m to expand its portfolio of medical devices that treat strokes. It represents a premium of about 5.5 per cent to Friday’s closing price of $22.19. The company expects the deal to be “slightly dilutive” to full-year earnings per share. Shares in Micrus were up 4.5 per cent to $23.19.Weyerhaeuser was the session’s best performer as the stock rallied 8.4 per cent to $38.86. The timberland and forest products company declared a special dividend worth a combined $5.6bn. The pay-out to shareholders is part of its plan to convert to a real estate investment trust.Financial services stocks were mixed ahead of a number of banks reporting their second-quarter earnings later in the week.Bank of America and Citigroup, both of which report second-quarter earnings on Friday, climbed 0.7 per cent higher to $15.21 and 1.7 per cent to $4.11 respectively. Playboy surged 40.9 per cent to $5.55 as Hugh Hefner, its founder, offered to buy all the shares he does not own to take it private, in a deal that values the company at around $185m.Mr Hefner has offered $5.50 a share in cash, a premium of about 40 per cent to its $3.94 closing price on Friday. He already owns about 69.5 per cent of the class A common stock and 27.7 per cent of its class B stock.Qualcomm advanced 3.5 per cent to $35.10 as Goldman Sachs added the phone chipmaker to its “conviction buy list”, citing accelerating smartphone sales growth.Rival chipmaker Texas Instruments improved 1.1 per cent to $24.75, while Fairchild Semiconductor added 1.8 per cent to $9.27.Marriott International, the hotel chain, was down 0.6 per cent to $30.97 as the stock was downgraded to “market perform” from “outperform” by Jeffrey Donnelly at Wells Fargo Securities.Shares in Paychex, a provider of payroll and human resources services, was down 2 per cent to $25.75 as Jonathan Judge, the company’s chief executive, resigned to pursue other interests.
4;PAYX;Paychex Inc;2009-03-26T20:41:02Z;Wall Street rallies despite falling financials;;"US stocks rallied strongly on Thursday to put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its biggest monthly gain since 1974.Strength in the cash-rich technology sector, meanwhile, meant the Nasdaq Composite index is now in positive territory for the year.The S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent to 832.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 7,924.56. The Nasdaq Composite index surged 3.8 per cent to 1,587, putting it 0.6 per cent up for 2009.Technology stocks continued their good performance for the year. Apple gained 3.2 per cent to $109.87 and Hewlett Packard rose 7.1 per cent to $33.20.Paychex, the payroll services company, was the biggest gainer on the index, up 9.6 per cent to $25.88 after it reported better results than expected.This came despite weakness in the banking sector after Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said there would be “new rules of the game” for financial regulation.Confidence in the sector was already fragile after Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Bank of America’s debt and investors took the opportunity to take profits after a month’s strong gains.Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $7.58, Citigroup dropped 4.8 per cent to $2.81 and Wells Fargo lost 2.9 per cent to $15.95.“Any time there is any dose of uncertainty addedto the landscape, investors are going to take profits,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at
The Hartford.The market also continued to adjust to Mr Geithner’s plan to clear the banks of their toxic assets, with some analysts warning it might be bad for banks’ shareholders in the long run.“It might save the banks, but that doesn’t mean it will save their shareholders,” he said. “They might be left with something that’s not particularly profitable,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The banking falls were exacerbated by figures showing that the US economy continues to deteriorate, with the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits hitting record highs.Gross domestic product, meanwhile, fell 6.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the last three months of 2008, although this was better than analysts expected.But banks failed to drag down the market as better- than-expected company results and rising commodity prices counteracted negative economic data.Shares also rallied strongly in the afternoon after a successful auction of seven-year Treasury notes raised hopes the government would be able to fund its stimulus plans.Strong commodities helped industrial companies perform better than any other sector. As metals prices rose, mining companies saw the benefit. Newmont Mining gained 2.3 per cent to $46.90 and Freeport McMoRan picked up 5.9 per cent to $43.05. Caterpillar, which makes mining machinery, rose 6.5 per cent to $30.78.Consumer companies also performed well after positive results showed consumer spending had not collapsed as badly as feared.In the food and drinks sector, Conagra and Dr Pepper Snapple exceeded expectations.Conagra, the frozen food maker, rose 9.2 per cent to $16.99 after it said it expected its consumer foods business, which accounts for the majority of its sales, to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.Dr Pepper Snapple gained 15.2 per cent to $17.87, having made 39 cents in earnings per share excluding certain items.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, provided further evidence that consumer spending remained more resilient than estimated as it reported better revenues and earnings than expected.The company forecast that it would beat analysts’ predictions for its 2010 profits. It was one of the highest risers in the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $37.67.The figures helped lift other consumer companies including Wal-Mart, which rose 2.1 per cent to $52.76.General Motors surged after reports said the company had agreed plans
with 6,000 of its staff who belong to the United Auto Workers union to take buy-out offers. This was more than analysts had expected, and GM’s stock rose 14.1 per cent to $3.41."
5;PAYX;Paychex Inc;2005-06-28T20:28:56Z;Wall Street boosted by data and lower crude;;Positive data on consumer confidence and a retreat in crude oil futures helped Wall Street stocks higher as a high-profile lawsuit put the semiconductor sector under the spotlight.Profit-taking ended the run that sent Nymex crude oil contracts above $60 on Monday. The benchmark WTI contract fell more than $1 on Tuesday as John Snow, the Treasury secretary, acknowledged that high fuel prices were hurting the world’s largest economy.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent up at 10,405.63, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.9 per cent at 1,201.57. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2 per cent at 2,069.89.An index of consumer confidence reached a three-year high. Steve Wieting, the US economist at Citigroup, said the data pointed to continued strength in consumer spending despite rising fuel prices, adding that labour market conditions also appeared to be improving.Economists fear that high crude will mean higher costs, but they are more worried about the impact it could have on consumer spending if it forces Americans to fill up their cars using money they would have otherwise spent in shops. The consumer sector accounts for about two-thirds of activity.Marc Pado, US market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, told clients that some technical market indicators pointed to oversold conditions and concluded that “with oil below $60, stocks are worth a nibble”.In a predictable market reaction to the declining oil price, airline stocks saw broad gains and some were among the top performers on the New York Stock Exchange. The Amex sector index rose 6.3 per cent as Delta Air Lines put on 12.8 per cent to $3.97. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, was 9.3 per cent higher at $12.3, while AirTran Holdings, the parent of a low-cost carrier, added 6.1 per cent to $9.47.Some energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the laggards on the NYSE as decreased oil prices appeared to be seen as a threat to their profits. Amerada Hess declined 3.8 per cent to $106.26 while Marathon Oil lost 2.9 per cent to $53.96.Advanced Micro Devices rose 6.3 per cent to $17.70 after the chipmaker said it had filed a lawsuit against its large arch-rival Intel, whose shares inched up 1.8 per cent to $26.33. The suit alleges that Intel forced clients to use its chips at the expense of AMD’s.IBM shares rose 1.9 per cent to $75.30 amid a broad rally for Dow stocks and despite news that regulators were looking into the disclosure of disappointing figures in the spring.Sun Microsystems put on 1.4 per cent to $3.74 on news it had agreed to buy SeeBeyond Technologies, a software company, for $387m. Shares in SeeBeyond jumped 30.8 per cent to $4.29.Meanwhile, shares in Apollo Group, an education company, gave up 1.4 per cent to $79.13 after the company reported a 40 per cent increase in profits, but gave a cautious earnings forecast.Also reporting earnings was Paychex, whose shares rose 10 per cent to $33.01 after the payroll processor said new clients and higher prices helped it increase profits in the last quarter.
