Together they control 46 per cent of the non-hospital independent laboratory market, which boasts $25bn in annual revenues. The rest of the market is accounted for by small independent labs and niche providers.Enter Theranos, a Silicon Valley business that has promised to revolutionise the market for in-vitro diagnostics. Founded in 2003 by Elizabeth Holmes, then aged 19, the company said it would consign needle-brandishing nurses to history while cutting the price of tests and reducing the amount of time it takes to receive results from a few days to a few hours.The Palo Alto-based privately held company has also led a push to allow patients to bypass their doctors and order their own diagnostics from a menu of more than 260 tests at Theranos outlets and Walgreens, a pharmacy chain. Arizona recently changed the law to permit this kind of direct-to-consumer testing.Ms Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford University to set up Theranos, has said she was inspired in part by her fear of needles. Hence the company’s decision to build its own laboratories around two pieces of proprietary technology.The first, a so-called nanotainer, is a finger-prick vial into which a patient deposits just a few drops of blood. The second is a laboratory machine, known as an Edison, that can purportedly return accurate results from the nanotainers, which collect much less blood than nurses and doctors typically take from veins.The arrival of Theranos has had little noticeable impact on the volume of testing conducted by the dominant test providers.Investors have, nonetheless, taken the potential of Theranos seriously, bestowing it with a $9bn valuation at its most recent fundraising — almost the same as Quest’s $9.7bn market capitalisation and not too far from LabCorp’s $12.3bn.However, since the autumn, Theranos has been battling claims that its technology is overhyped and its business model is flawed. In October, the Financial Times reported that the company had struggled with the accuracy of its tests and staffing issues at one of its labs. A Wall Street Journal investigation uncovered problems with its finger-prick vials.After consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration, the US regulator, Theranos scaled back the use of nanotainers to just one of its 262 tests in October. The rest of the diagnostics are performed using commercially available equipment commonly found in traditional labs.It has since emerged that the company was criticised by the FDA in September after an inspection found it was using devices to collect blood without the necessary approvals. Inspectors also identified issues with the way the company handled customer complaints and evaluated its suppliers.Theranos has said it addressed and corrected all of the FDA’s concerns immediately or within a week of the inspection. It is currently seeking regulatory approval to use the nanotainers for its other tests.Ms Holmes has come out fighting against her critics, some of whom she casts as part of an old-fashioned medical elite, scared of the change she promises. At a healthcare conference earlier this month, she said the negative headlines had done little to deter customers, and that in fact “we’ve seen our highest volume” to date.Some in the industry fear that the loss of its technological edge over larger rivals could make it hard for Theranos to compete. “Without adequate business scale, clinical lab services are an unappealing target market,” said analysts at Kalorama Information, a medical market research group, in a report earlier this month.Theranos’s problems echo those experienced by 23andMe, the direct-to-consumer genetic-testing company. In 2013, the FDA ordered the group to stop selling its $99 DNA tests, which the agency said constituted medical advice and, therefore, required regulatory approval.This forced 23andMe to recast its DNA kit as a product for hobbyists interested in their genealogy rather than a bona fide diagnostic. It has since sought to rebuild its relationship with the FDA and this year won approval for a test to identify a gene associated with a rare condition called Bloom syndrome — the first direct-to-consumer test of its kind backed by US regulators.Kalorama thinks Theranos should adjust strategy too, by moving into simpler “point of care” testing. Here diagnostics are carried out in a surgery, clinic or a pharmacy and the patient waits a few minutes for results. This cuts out the need for a laboratory altogether.The clash of Silicon Valley start-ups and in-vitro diagnostics looks set to continue. For the former, the most important thing is the pace of disruption, while the latter adopts a painstakingly slow, highly regulated approach, where new products take years to win approval and where standards of accuracy are understandably very high.“There is a cultural mismatch,” says one Theranos investor. “Both regulators and the companies need to work together to better understand each other.”
1;DGX;Quest Diagnostics Inc;2012-01-30T00:19:03Z;‘Bridging theory and practice’;Real-world learning is at the heart of the curriculum;"Kenneth Freeman made his reputation as a turnround expert, steering Quest Diagnostics from a problem-plagued start-up to a leading medical testing company. In a study published last year in Harvard Business Review, he was rated one of the best-performing chief executives in the world. Now, as dean of Boston University School of Management, he aims to bring that real-world sensibility to the school’s 99-year-old business programme.Prof Freeman, who started in August 2010, views his role as bridging “theory and practice”. He wants students to have “practical knowledge such as analysis, effective presentation skills, and also team-based skills. I want to create leaders who are also team players,” he says.Real-world, group-based learning is a centrepiece of the school’s curriculum overhaul. A pilot programme for real-time case studies begins this month, using telepresence videoconferencing. A chief executive or director of a government agency will present a management issue in their workplace. Students will be asked come up with recommendations, which they will put to management, sometimes just hours later.“Management gets the benefit of free consulting, and the students get the experience of analysing the issues of the day,” says Prof Freeman.The school already places special emphasis on team-based exercises, including a multidisciplinary project in which students invent a product and devise a business plan. Group projects also figure heavily in a large number of electives.“I’ve done a lot of small-team consulting projects with other students, where we get to know the company as well as each other,” says Katy Perkins, a second-year student. “I came here with a maths and economics background, so I felt confident in my analytical skills, but needed work on my people skills.”In September, the school, which has about 300 full-time MBA students, will introduce a required course on corporate accountability. The curriculum revamp also includes a heightened effort to infuse ethical considerations into all classes to help students absorb the lessons of the recent financial crisis, says James Post, a professor of management. “We are helping students develop their ethical muscles,” he says.At the moment, the school offers concentrations in traditional areas such as accounting, finance, marketing and operations. In addition, Boston offers dual degrees in information systems communications, law, medicine, engineering, public health, and arts and sciences.Starting this year, the school will implement a special focus on digital technology, energy and the environment, and health and life sciences – three growth sectors that Prof Post contends are vital to “effective global leadership”.These changes partly reflect pressure from recruiters and hiring managers, he says. “New graduates do not have the luxury of a long training programme with the company; they are expected to hit the ground running and add value from day one.”"

Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
3;DGX;Quest Diagnostics Inc;2011-03-18T20:51:04Z;Financials lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks climbed after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for banks to raise their dividends, while in the wider markets a turbulent week on Wall Street ended on a high note due to easing geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were among those to raise their dividend following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders.JPMorgan climbed 2.7 per cent to $45.74 while Wells Fargo added 1.5 per cent to $31.83. The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.
4;DGX;Quest Diagnostics Inc;2011-02-02T20:56:52Z;Drug groups lack confidence in science;;"An apparent slump in confidence in national science bases is spreading. On Tuesday, US drug company Pfizer announced the closure of its research centre in Sandwich, Kent. On Wednesday, UK pharma group GlaxoSmithKline said it had sold a stake worth $1.7bn (£1.1bn) in Quest Diagnostics, a testing business based in Madison, New Jersey.Americans, unlike Britons, resolutely declined to interpret disinvestment by a drugs company as a vote of no-confidence in their capacity to innovate. That was partly because no jobs will be lost at Quest. But the non-furore may also show that the financial pressures on drugs companies are better understood in the US than the UK. Pfizer and GSK have both been driven by the need to bolster balance sheets in the face of falling revenues from traditional blockbuster drug development.Viagra, which is coming off patent, is already widely available as an illegal generic, judging from an e-mail to Lombard from Hong Kong entitled: “You can be a Big Man to your Lady!!!” GSK, for its part, is expected to lose sales worth £1.6bn in 2011, as established drugs lose their market traction.Pfizer has promised shareholders $5bn in buy-backs. Investors hope that GSK will also announce repurchases, perhaps when it unveils 2010 results on Thursday. The business is constrained by legal costs estimated at $4bn in 2010 resulting from such errors as the off-piste marketing of the diabetes drug Avandia. The disposal of the 19 per cent stake in Quest will give GSK greater scope to return capital.The group, whose 2010 earnings per share are forecast to halve to about 55p, has not given up on research. It has reduced exposure to neuroscience and closed a laboratory in Verona (Povera Italia!). But it has high hopes for research into oncology and vaccines.GSK even plans to build a big new biopharmaceuticals facility somewhere in the UK. Perhaps this vote of confidence in British science will cancel out the vote of no-confidence supposedly registered by Pfizer. Or it may merely show that the government is right to offer science companies juicy tax breaks.Outward BondThe forthcoming retirement of Sir John Bond, chairman of Vodafone, means that a big beast of the corporate ecosystem is padding into the sunset. He will not be universally missed. The disastrous purchase of subprime lender Household took place on his watch at HSBC, which he chaired until 2006. And some investors in Vodafone saw him as too remote.Yet Sir John projected sufficient charisma to heal the rifts in a Vodafone board that had opened up under Lord MacLaurin. He saw off two challenges to his authority from unhappy shareholders and presided over the reversal of an unpopular acquisitions policy. Sir John’s reputation would have greater lustre had Vodafone resolved a dispute concerning US joint venture Verizon Wireless. But he levered in well-liked chief executive Vittorio Colao.Aloof? Maybe. But a FTSE 100 chairman must project some gravitas. Sir John’s record suggests he listened more to investors than he often let on.Rattled in SeattleBill and Melinda Gates are at breakfast.
Melinda: Remember that our foundation invested in JJB, the Brit sportswear chain?
Bill: Wasn’t that a charitable thing?
M: Theoretically no, though Somalia is run more professionally than JJB was. Anyway, seems like JD Sports wants to buy JJB.
B: Isn’t that owned by some loud, obnoxious guy?
M: Most Brit sportswear retailers are, or were, owned by loud, obnoxious guys. Mike Ashley part owns Sports Direct, which has a stake in JD.
B: It’s real confusing, Lindy.
M: The thing to remember, Bill, is that JD might buy JJB at a premium to the 5p a share that we’re paying to keep it limping on as an independent.
B: I thought JJB had a bright future positioned between JD’s value proposition and Sports Direct’s street fashion? They were planning to cross-sell sports equipment to football shirt buyers.
M: The typical JJB customer takes his shirts extra large. JJB could have cross-sold him doughnuts, mebbe.
B: So this takeover’s a good thing?
M: If it can get regulatory clearance.
B: Dammit! What’s the matter with those antitrust jerks? How come they bust a guy’s balls for just the littlest thing?
M: Calm down, Honey! You’re spraying Golden Grahams! Say the mantra your counsellor gave you if you’re getting flashbacks. We’ll try to forget JJB. Everyone else has.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com"
5;DGX;Quest Diagnostics Inc;2011-02-02T17:17:11Z;GSK sells remaining stake in Quest Diagnostics;;GlaxoSmithKline has raised $1.7bn (£1.1bn) after the pharmaceuticals group sold its remaining stake in Quest Diagnostics, the US life sciences company.GSK said it expected the sale of the 16.5 per cent stake in the company, which it bought into in 1999, to generate about $1.1bn after tax.“While we have been pleased with our investment in Quest Diagnostics, we have been considering the sale of our remaining position in the company for some time,” said Julian Heslop, GSK’s finance director.“We have decided that now is a good time to take advantage of favourable market conditions, thereby releasing funds from one of our non-core assets.“This divestment demonstrates our focus on generating attractive returns for our shareholders and our ability to monetise significant gains when appropriate,” Mr Heslop added.The divestment follows a move last year by GSK to reduce its stake from 19.6 per cent and is the fourth time the company has cut its position from its original 29 per cent holding, taken on after it sold its clinical laboratories business to Quest.The New Jersey-based group, which provides tests for cancers, cardiovascular diseases, thyroid disorders and infectious diseases, reported pre-tax profits of $1.2bn on sales of $7.5bn in the year to December 31 2009, the last available full-year figures.The news comes a day after Pfizer of the US, one of GSK’s largest rivals, dealt a blow to the British life sciences industry by announcing plans to close its UK research centre in Kent and cut up to 2,400 jobs.GSK will on Thursday report full-year earnings, which are expected to be down sharply on last year following a series of payments and writedowns related to litigation.The consensus of analysts’ forecasts predicts earnings per share of 55.2p, almost half the 121.9p in 2009.Shares in GSK, which have fallen 7.4 per cent since the start of the year, eased 10.5p to £11.36 on Wednesday. Shares in Quest Diagnostics rose 15 cents in New York to $57.15 in afternoon trading.

Glaxo has held shares in Quest since 1999, when Glaxo sold its clinical laboratories business to the New Jersey-based group. In 1999, Smithkline Beecham held a 29 per cent stake in the group.Quest’s laboratories provide test for cancers, cardiovascular diseases, thyroid disorders, and infectious diseases.Glaxo has reduced its holding in Quest twice before, in 2001 and 2004.Glaxo has been conserving cash since July, when it reduced its share buyback programme as part of an effort to build up cash reserves for potential deals.Glaxo said that the share sales were “part of a gradual reduction in the group’s holding and to take advantage of Quest’s recently expanded share repurchase programme”.Glaxo’s remaining stake in Quest of 30.8m shares is now worth $1.4bn.Shares in Quest Diagnostics have fallen 15 per cent this year.

An index of financial stocks gave up 1.7 per cent.The drive by financials to raise more capital looks set to continue this week.National City, Ohio’s biggest bank, on Monday confirmed that it would raise $7bn from a consortium led by Corsair Capital after it posted a first-quarter loss.The private equity group will buy shares at a significant discount to Friday’s closing price and the news, as well as a dividend cut, dragged the bank’s stock down 27.3 per cent to $6.06.Colonial BancGroup shares fell, dropping 10.2 per cent to $8.91, after it cut its dividend by half and revealed plans to sell 25m shares to raise capital.National City and Colonial BancGroup join financial institutions such as Citigroup and Wachovia that have been forced to shore up their balance sheets after subprime-related writedowns.The benchmark S&P 500 pared its losses in the late afternoon, but closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,388.17. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,408.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 0.2 per cent lower at 12,825.02.Amid the broad market sell-off, the energy and technology sectors continued their strong run of trading.Microsoft and Apple made ground ahead of results due later in the week. Apple shares climbed 4.3 per cent to $168.16 while Microsoft shares added 1.4 per cent to $30.42.Record high oil prices buoyed the energy sector. Hess was the leading gainer, adding 6.8 per cent to $112.41.Coal miners also found momentum after Arch Coal said first-quarter profit more than doubled. Arch shares added 6.5 per cent to $62.18. Its peers, Peabody and Consol Energy, climbed 3.4 per cent to $68.93 and 2.1 per cent to $88.10, respectively.Still, results from oil services companies Halliburton and Weatherford International left investors unimpressed.Halliburton said first-quarter net profit increased 5.8 per cent while Weatherford’s earnings fell but shares in both underperformed. Halliburton edged up 0.1 per cent to $47.46 while Weatherford shares fell 1.3 per cent to $84.41.Pharmaceuticals were in focus after two industry heavyweights reported first-quarter results. Eli Lilly said profit had more than doubled but it still missed analysts’ estimates because of a charge for dropping its inhaled insulin product. Lilly shares slipped 4.7 per cent to $49.60.Meanwhile, Merck said quarterly profit gained 94 per cent, boosted by a $2.2bn payment from AstraZeneca for a partnership on blood pressure drugs and a treatment for Crohn’s disease. Merck shares fell 0.3 per cent to $39.63.Quest Diagnostics was the leading gainer in the healthcare sector after it said net income jumped 32 per cent in the first quarter thanks to the acquisitions. Quest shares climbed 7.7 per cent to $49.12.Toymakers Hasbro and Mattel also reported first-quarter earnings on Monday.Hasbro said profits rose following strong sales of Transformers and Littlest Pet Shop products. Rival Mattel however, revealed its first loss in three years, blaming higher manufacturing costs in China and a slowdown in Barbie sales within the US.Mattel shares sagged 8.2 per cent to $19.99 while Hasbro gained 10 per cent to $34.68.This week, 155 S&P 500 companies and nine components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, including American Express, McDonald’s and ConocoPhillips, report results.
8;DGX;Quest Diagnostics Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing.
