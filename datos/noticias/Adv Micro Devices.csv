0;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-01-28T22:09:02Z;AMD shares fall after chipmaker offers muted sales forecast;Revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 50%;AMD’s important new line-up of PC and server chips is set to deliver less of a bounce to its revenue in the first quarter of this year than Wall Street had been expecting, according to a forecast from the US chipmaker late on Tuesday.The muted forecast trimmed 4 per cent from its share price in after-market trading, though AMD’s shares have risen fivefold in the past two years on hopes that its new products will bring significant market share gains against longtime nemesis Intel.AMD’s projection came less than a week after Intel had surprised investors with what it said would be a strong rebound in its own business early in 2020, easing some of the worries about potential market share losses to its smaller rival.AMD said it expected revenue of $1.75-$1.85bn in the first quarter. Though that points to 42 per cent growth at the midpoint of the range, it is still below the $1.86bn analysts had been expecting.The chipmaker last year launched its strongest line-up of new products in years, taking advantage of a manufacturing edge that TSMC, which makes its chips, has gained over Intel. Hopes that this would lead to market share gains against Intel in 2020 have stirred hopes that AMD will be able to shake off its also-ran status in the market for x86 chips, which is dominated by Intel.Figures for the fourth quarter of 2019 suggested that AMD was starting to see the uplift from its new products. Revenue in the period jumped 50 per cent to $2.13bn, just ahead of expectations. Pro forma earnings per share, at 32 cents, were up from 8 cents a year before and 1 cent ahead of forecasts.
1;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2019-08-08T18:28:46Z;AMD looks to build on chips advantage in Intel fight;Chipmaker has leapt ahead of rival in terms of raw computing performance, says CEO;AMD, the perennial also-ran of the chip world, has just taken the biggest step in an unlikely comeback. But with longtime nemesis Intel breathing down its neck, it has yet to prove that it can convert a notable, but temporary, technology advantage into a sustainable business edge.The scale of AMD’s rebound was confirmed late on Wednesday in San Francisco as a top engineer from Google took the stage alongside the company’s chief executive officer, Lisa Su, to say that the internet company was using AMD’s latest server chips in its massive cloud data centres.Microsoft, Amazon, Tencent and Baidu are already customers, giving AMD a strong foothold among the so-called “Super Seven” internet and cloud giants who make up a sizeable part of today’s computing market (Facebook and Alibaba have yet to bite).With the second generation of its Epyc server chips announced on Wednesday, AMD has just leapt ahead of Intel in measures of raw computing performance. Based on independent benchmarks, it claimed that for many computing tasks, its server chips delivered more than twice the performance of Intel’s for each dollar spent, and four times as much for high-performance computing.“You don’t have that often,” Ms Su says of the size of AMD’s pure technology lead. But, after spending most of its 50-year history in Intel’s shadow, she is not about to declare victory. “In the past we’ve had some unforced errors,” she says in an interview with the FT, with AMD frequently “missing a product cycle” to see its brief technology advantages seep away. In a market where customers look for computing platforms with staying power, that has been a crippling problem.“They have been here before,” warns Pat Moorhead, a chip analyst and former AMD executive. In 2006, a new AMD chip architecture codenamed Barcelona was lauded in the same way, fuelling similar talk of a sustained revival that didn’t play out.AMD’s latest recovery has been dramatic. Less than four years ago, its stock had fallen below $2 and it was forced to sell and lease back its headquarters to generate cash. Now, after a 9 per cent bounce early on Thursday, the shares are at more than $32, lifting its stock market value to nearly $35bn and raising hopes that the market for CPUs — the main engines for PCs and servers, long dominated by Intel — will in future be a more even, two-horse race.It took new management to put AMD back in contention. Ms Su, a former IBM executive who arrived at AMD in 2012, and Mark Papermaster, another IBMer who briefly headed Apple’s hardware engineering and is now chief technology officer, decided five years ago that the company needed to redesign its main products from the ground up.After years of failure they may have had little to lose, as Mr Moorhead suggests, but it was still a huge gamble.“We needed everything to be right,” says Ms Su. Not only did AMD’s new designs need to anticipate the changing needs of customers — something that would only become clear after five years in development — but its manufacturing partner, TSMC, would have to at least match Intel in the latest techniques, and the new chips would need to hit the market in an upswing. In the chip world, where long planning cycles breed an inherent caution, “that isn’t a way to run a company,” says Ms Su.As it turned out, not only did AMD’s stars fall into alignment, but it was aided by a historic slip-up at Intel. The world’s biggest chipmaker, judged by revenue, has always been able to count on being the first to move to each new process node — the successive “shrinks” that see more transistors packed into the same area — to maintain a performance edge against rivals.But Intel is now years behind target with its move to the latest process technology, where feature sizes on chips are only 10 nanometres, and its latest forecast now calls for its new server chips to be available in the second half of next year. AMD, which shed its manufacturing arm a decade ago, is the beneficiary of TSMC clearing the new manufacturing hurdle earlier (though, confusingly, its technology is known as seven nanometre), giving it a clear advantage.Raw computing power, however, is only part of the story. Intel has armies of engineers working with the biggest internet companies to develop “custom silicon, per customer, that is tuned for their workloads,” says Lisa Spelman, an executive in Intel’s data centre group.It can also optimise its products for the broad and diverse “enterprise” market of big companies and governments, where computing needs and applications vary widely. The cloud players represent a big and more homogenous market, but Ms Su concedes AMD has a long way to go to build out the marketing, sales and engineering to fully serve the market beyond: “We have to ramp that up, no doubt.”Intel also has an advantage when it comes to important computing workloads. In machine learning, for instance, an enhancement to its standard Xeon processors, along with software adapted for specific training tasks, has given it an edge. And by combining its in-house memory chips and processors, Intel has a clear advantage in the “in-memory” systems designed to process vast amounts of data in real time.Yet Wall Street is betting that the leap it has just announced with the latest Epyc chips will be enough to launch AMD on a more competitive path. Many analysts now believe it can claw back market share of 15 per cent by the end of next year. With the wind at its back, it could reach 25 per cent over the next three years, estimates Mr Moorhead. At that level, he says, it could afford to maintain the R&D and marketing spending needed to go toe-to-toe with Intel, changing the dynamics in the CPU market for good.Intel’s customers have long wanted a serious alternative supplier for one of the core components of the computing age. AMD may never be able to demonstrate such a clear performance lead again, but if it can sustain its current momentum, they might finally get one.
2;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2019-06-10T21:26:59Z;AMD hits 13-year high as next-gen Xbox sparks rally;‘Project Scarlett’ will run on an AMD processor, Microsoft announced;Shares in Advanced Micro Devices surged to a 13-year high on Monday after Microsoft announced its next-generation Xbox will run on chips made by the semiconductor group.Microsoft said on Sunday, ahead of the annual E3 gaming expo, it will use a custom-designed processor and graphics card from AMD in the next iteration of its gaming console, which is codenamed “Project Scarlett”. It was another win for AMD, which also beat out rivals such as Nvidia to make chips for Sony’s next PlayStation.AMD already makes the chip architectures for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. “Project Scarlett” is scheduled to launch during the 2020 holiday season.“While AMD’s positioning in Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox has been expected, we think this should still be considered a positive as it reinforces AMD’s positioning in the high-end processor and graphics market for game consoles (Microsoft’s Project Scarlett and Sony’s PS5 consoles),” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a note to clients.AMD climbed 2.5 per cent to $33.23, the stock’s highest closing value since May 2006. Shares are up 80 per cent year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500’s gain of 15.2 per cent and a 22.4 per cent rally for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Chipmakers fell sharply in May, before clawing back in recent sessions, as stalled talks between the US and China stoked concerns over the fallout from a trade war. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index touched a record high of 1,589.02 in April. It traded at 1,413.89 on Monday, up 2.5 per cent on the day.
3;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2019-02-05T08:07:04Z;Abu Dhabi sovereign fund cuts stake in US semiconductor group;Mubadala has invested in Advanced Micro Devices for more than a decade;Mubadala Investment Company has reduced its stake in US semiconductor group Advanced Micro Devices to 6.9 per cent from 10.2 per cent.The Abu Dhabi sovereign fund, which has been invested in AMD for 11 years, said it had sold 34.9m shares for more than $800m while also paying to convert 75m warrants into shares that would provide AMD with $448.5m.The transaction comes after Mubadala sold 22m shares in AMD worth more than $400m last year.Mubadala, which has a portfolio valued at $225bn that spans aerospace, energy and property, said the deal “remains in line with Mubadala’s overall investment strategy to monetise mature holdings to deliver attractive commercial returns”.The fund, set up with a mandate to diversify the Abu Dhabi economy alongside commercial returns, has been focusing on generating cash for its government owner in recent years as the emirate grapples with lower oil prices.
4;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2019-01-29T22:49:38Z;AMD delivers upbeat outlook in wake of chipmaker fears;Shares jump more than 8% despite quarterly sales miss;Advanced Micro Devices swung to a profit in the fourth quarter even as sales missed, but the semiconductor maker’s upbeat full-year revenue outlook was cheered by investors who had come to fear weak performance for chipmakers following warnings from Intel and Nvidia.The California-based company said revenues rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $1.42bn in the three months ended December 29, just shy of analysts’ expectations for $1.45bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.Sales were boosted by its computing and graphics segment, where sales rose 9 per cent driven by sales of its Ryzen processors for desktop PCs. AMD said it “delivered record graphics processing units (GPU) datacentre revenue in the quarter”.The company swung to a profit of $38m, or 4 cents a share, compared with a loss of $19m, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 8 cents a share were in line with forecasts.Last year, AMD benefited from security flaws at rival Intel and earlier this week, the chipmaker delivered a revenue warning, noting its data centre chips business had taken a hit due to a slowdown in China and a pause in capital spending by cloud computing companies. Meanwhile, Nvidia unexpectedly slashed its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by half a billion dollars, partly blaming a slowdown in sales to gamers in China.AMD’s results and outlook by contrast cheered investors. Shares climbed more than 8 per cent in after-hours trade. AMD shares are up 4 per cent year-to-date following a near 80 per cent increase last year. Shares in Nvidia rose 2 per cent, and Intel was fractionally higher following AMD’s earnings report.For the full year, AMD forecast high single-digit percentage growth, that compared with analysts’ expectations for $6.88bn which would represent a 6 per cent increase.“Despite near-term graphics headwinds, 2019 is shaping up to be another exciting year driven by the launch of our broadest and most competitive product portfolio ever,” Lisa Su, chief executive, said.In the current quarter, the company forecast revenue of about $1.25bn, plus or minus $50m — which represents a 24 per cent year-on-year drop. That compared with analyst estimates for $1.47bn. AMD expects the decline to be driven by “lower graphics sales due to excess channel inventory, the absence of blockchain-related GPU revenue and lower memory sales”.
5;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2018-12-31T22:28:43Z;What were the best and worst performing US stocks of 2018?;The biggest movers include Goldman Sachs, Merck and AMD;Investors have brought down the curtain on a volatile and ultimately negative year for US equities, and it is time to hand out gleaming trophies to the star performers — and wooden spoons to the laggards.In a dangerous year — when Facebook could drop more than $120bn of market value in a single day, the largest one-day dollar loss of any listed company in US history — there were also big gains to be had, too.“We had these meltdowns, but there were still things that were working,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “If you were properly positioned, it was possible to beat the market this year.”The drugmaker Merck put in the best performance by a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as healthcare stocks emerged as the winning sector of the market in 2018. Investors attributed some of the gains for healthcare to a rotation out of high-flying technology stocks in general and out of the behemoths known as Faangs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet), in particular.“When tech investors started to look in the mirror and say this is as good as it gets,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, “they wanted something more defensive with growth characteristics, and capital rotated from tech into healthcare.”A significant push to rein in drug prices did not emerge and the group also benefited from the prospect of less regulation, Mr Underhill said.Merck and Pfizer, which both boast strong pipelines of new drugs and stand to grow with an ageing population, took the top spots on the Dow with gains of 36 per cent and 21 per cent each, respectively.When technology companies stumbled this year, it was not just the notorious Faang trade. Semiconductor stocks were volatile, buffeted especially hard in the second half of the year when the US and China escalated their trade war tariffs, and as investors worried about demand for chips whose application run the gamut from iPhones to self-driving cars.That makes it all the more notable that Advanced Micro Devices ended the year atop the S&P 500 with a gain of almost 80 per cent. Its closing price of $18.46 was barely half its high of $34.14 in September, but enough to win the Wall Street race in 2018.“They continue to have defensible market share and defensible margin,” Mr Underhill said. “The fundamentals defy gravity in a year of exceptional volatility and uncertainty in tech.”With its latest chip designs, AMD also received an edge on rival Intel (up 1.7 per cent in 2018) which has been late in making the switch to 10 nanometre technology.Cannabis investing moved mainstream in 2018 with retail investors and brand-name companies embracing the trend. The Canadian producer Tilray stands out as the first company in the sector to go public in the US with its July listing on Nasdaq and its subsequent rise of more than 300 per cent made it the best-performing US initial public offering of the year — but mind the volatility. Tilray listed at $17, rose as high as $300 in September and ended 2018 at around $70.But what of the worst performers?Goldman Sachs was the Dog of the Dow for 2018 after its shares lost over a third of their value. There are two explanations. First, almost all banks had performed abysmally. The S&P 500 banks index lost 15 per cent for the year, against more than 6 per cent for the wider index. Bank shares perform poorly late in an economic cycle and, rightly or wrongly, the market is saying that is where we are. The year began with hope that the yield curve — the difference between short and long-term rates, a key determinant of banks’ profit margins — would steepen at last. But the 10-year Treasury, though its yield briefly pushed above 3 per cent, tumbled down again at the end of the year. Goldman had its own problems, too, in the 1MDB scandal. After Goldman helped the Malaysian state investment fund issue two bonds in 2012 and 2013, much of the $6.5bn were skimmed off for the benefit of corrupt officials. Two former Goldman bankers have been indicted in the US and Malaysia in connection with the case, which raises the spectre not only of potential fines but of lasting damage to Goldman’s brand.54%one-year decline in shares of InvescoThe Dog of the Dow title would have gone to General Electric, an iconic name almost synonymous with US capitalism, except that the curators of the index kicked GE out midyear. The industrial conglomerate’s shares dropped 57 per cent in 2018 as it faced a reckoning over difficulties in its core power business and historic liabilities from its finance arm. Its chief executive John Flannery abruptly departed, the company revealed an investigation by the Department of Justice and, most painful to its army of retail shareholders, it slashed the dividend to a penny.“The peak of the conglomerate cycle was the 1970s,” Mr Colas said. “We are finally seeing the real end of it. The closest thing you have to a conglomerate now is Amazon with the cloud, shopping and home automation [but] it is tied together with a core technology. You don’t have that with the old-school conglomerate model where basically management was the edge.”Also on the slide in 2018 were asset management stocks, due to fee pressures from cheap passive funds and volatile financial markets. The S&P 500 asset manager sub-index has lost more than a quarter of its value this year.Few have suffered a walloping as severe as Invesco, down 54 per cent. The Atlanta-based company this autumn swooped for rival OppenheimerFunds, paying $5.7bn in a deal that lifted Invesco’s overall assets under management to $1.2tn, on the view that size and scale will be imperative to tackle the industry’s challenges in the coming years. Investors took fright at the cost and questioned the cost savings estimates, sending Invesco’s shares tumbling 55 per cent in 2018.“Headwinds for traditional asset managers heading into 2019 have intensified given the weakness in both asset returns and demand,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in its outlook report on the investment industry.With more volatility on the cards, the asset management industry once again argues that next year will be a stockpicker’s market. But who will find the trophy stocks of the coming year, and can they avoid next year’s Dogs of the Dow? We will see.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco
6;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2018-09-06T21:32:30Z;Tech stock sell-off accelerates as chipmakers fall;Micron drops nearly 10% after analyst warns of oversupply of Nand flash memory chips;Tech stocks helped drive Wall Street’s third straight day of declines on Thursday as chipmakers sold off on growth concerns.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9 per cent to 7,922.73, approaching its 50-day moving average of 7,817.29 — a key momentum level. The technology benchmark’s 1.2 per cent drop the pervious day was its biggest one-day drop since mid-August.The Philadelphia semiconductor index lost 2.7 per cent as Micron Technology fell 9.9 per cent to $44.65 and KLA-Tencor was off 9.7 per cent, while Applied Materials declined 5.3 per cent and Advanced Micro Devices lost 2.4 per centBaird lowered its price target on Micron from $100 to $75 and warned of oversupply for Nand flash memory chips. Investors also cited trade tensions with China as a worry for semiconductor companies.The tech weakness came a day after top executives from Facebook and Twitter were grilled by senators in a Washington hearing, and Jeff Sessions, US attorney-general, asked state attorneys-general to join him for talks on whether social media platforms “may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas”.Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, saw profit-taking after recent gains. During August, the tech sector of the S&P 500 led the benchmark’s gain with 6.7 per cent rise. Earlier this week, Amazon joined Apple as the second company with a market value topping $1tn.“Adding fuel [to the profit-taking] is US lawmakers grilling tech executives on Capitol Hill over ethics and security issues,” he said.Facebook fell 2.8 per cent per cent and Twitter was down 5.9 per centThe S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent, as Apple and Amazon lost 1.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent, benefiting from its heavier weighting towards defensive healthcare and consumer stocks.Market volatility rose, with the Vix climbing above 15 on Thursday for the first time in intraday trade since mid-August.Tech was the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500, with a 0.8 per cent drop. Energy fell 1.9 per cent. Telecommunications, utilities and real estate were among the segments in the black.Government bonds rallied as stocks declined. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury was down 2 basis points at 2.88 per cent.The DXY index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of global peers, was down 0.2 per cent at 95.002.
7;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2018-08-27T19:12:48Z;AMD surges to head of S&P 500 on reported buyside interest;;Advanced* Micro Devices shares jumped to the highest in a year on Monday and led gains on the S&P 500 with analysts pointing to buyside interest in the chipmaker.AMD climbed more than 12 per cent to a 52-week high of $27.30 and was on pace for its largest one-day gain in a month before giving back some of its gains. The stock was trading up around 6 per cent at around $25 at pixel time.The move comes as a result of a sort of “planetary alignment” as its top competitor, Intel, faces a rough road ahead, according to analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities. “There are indicators that Intel may be having problems that look more structural,” Mosesmann said. “Shifts in the near term may favour AMD.”Additionally, Mr Mosesmann says the buyside is looking closely at AMD, which may indicate that some institutional investors are eyeing large positions in the company.“This is the first time in 10 years I’ve seen significant deep dives by the buyside on AMD,” Mr Mosesmann says.AMD has benefited from the Meltdown and Spectre security flaws that sent Intel into a tailspin earlier this year. While those incidents have faded from the headlines, the trouble for Intel has not subsided as new bugs have popped up, Cowen said in a research note last week.“We are very surprised investors have largely ignored the newest Intel-specific bugs. Our industry conversations are starkly different. We believe fixes to these new L1 Cache vulnerabilities could degrade certain public cloud workload performance by 0-30% and mandate the push for CPU vendor diversification,” the note stated.For AMD that should mean “meaningful market share in both server and enterprise PC markets,” Cowen said, noting that even though AMD was affected by Spectre and Meltdown, it has not been affected by the new bugs that struck Intel.AMD’s share price has more than doubled year-to-date, starting the year at $10.98.*This post has been updated since initial publication to correct the company name.
8;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Strong earnings help tech sector end losing streak;;Tech stocks look set to end their lengthy losing streak in style on Thursday after strong corporate earnings underpinned gains for some of the sector’s biggest names.The S&P 500 information technology sector was up 2.2 per cent at halftime in New York, on track for its best day since April 10 and one of its best this year. The gains follow a six-day losing streak to the close on April 25 — the longest since last April — that saw the sector drop 5.3 per cent.The top performer today was Advanced Micro Devices, up 11.7 per cent, in the wake of the chipmaker’s forecast-busting first-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday, and the prospect of even stronger revenue growth in the current quarter.That was a big turnround for AMD, which fell during the main session on Wednesday alongside other chipmakers following a media report the US Department of Justice is investigating whether China’s Huawei Technologies has violated sanctions related to Iran. The drop for semiconductor companies proved a big drag on the sector yesterday.The next best was Facebook, a sector heavyweight, up 9.5 per cent. The social network yesterday reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations.Visa and PayPal were also among the top performers in the sector, up 5.2 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively, after the two payments companies also delivered solid quarterly results yesterday.Among other popular tech stocks, Apple was up 0.4 per cent, Netflix added 3.3 per cent and Alphabet gained 2 per cent. Intel, Amazon and Microsoft, which all report after closing bell today, were up 2 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent higher.
9;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Samsung shares higher after choppy session for chipmakers;;Shares in Samsung Electronics rose as much as 3.2 per cent in Seoul after the company posted a 52 per cent increase in net profit for the first three months of the year. The earnings result was driven by a strong performance from the South Korean conglomerate’s chip making division, which came despite concerns of a weaker outlook for semiconductors amid slowing demand for Apple’s iPhone. The company’s mobile business beat expectations, with stronger-than-expected sales of its flagship smartphone. While Samsung cautioned that overall earnings growth this quarter could be constrained by a decline in profitability for its mobile business – echoing some of the recent warnings from other chipmakers – it was still upbeat on its outlook for the second half of the year.The share price climb followed a choppy session for the broader chip market overnight. Chipmakers fell across the board in the US after a report said the US was investigating whether China’s Huawei Technologies, one of the world’s largest smartphone makers, had violated sanctions related to Iran. But hours later shares in Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 10 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported its first quarter profit above expectations and forecast stronger revenue growth in the current quarter.
11;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2018-04-25T21:21:40Z;AMD shares leap after tipping stronger revenue growth;;Advanced Micro Devices shares leapt in after-hours trade as the semiconductor maker swung to a better-than-expected profit in the first three months of the year and forecast even stronger revenue growth in the current quarter.Driving that was a near doubling in revenues for the company’s computing and graphics segment, which saw strong demand and increased average prices for its high-performance chips.Revenues rose 40 per cent year-on-year to $1.65bn, sailing past analysts’ estimate of $1.57bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. It also bested its forecast in January for 32 per cent growth to $1.55bn, plus or minus $50m.That filtered through to a net profit of $81m in the three months ended March 31, up from a loss of $73m a year ago and well above the median forecast of $71.3m.Diluted earnings came in at 8 cents a shares, from a loss of 4 cents a year ago and market expectations for 7 cents a share.Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive, said it was an “outstanding” first quarter. “PC, gaming and datacentre adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate. We are excited about our long-term road maps and focused on delivering sustained revenue growth and profitability,” she said in the company’s earnings statement.AMD expects earnings to rise 50 per cent in the current quarter to $1.725bn, plus or minus $50m, with a gross margin of 37 per cent, a 1 percentage point improvement from the first quarter.Shares jumped 9.7 per cent in after-hours trade. Shares finished the regular trading session 3.8 per cent lower amid a broad sell-off for chipmakers on Wednesday, leaving them down 5.5 per cent year-to-date.
12;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Chipmakers slide on Huawei DoJ investigation report;;The chips are down for semiconductor makers on Wednesday after a media report said the US Department of Justice is investigating whether China’s Huawei Technologies has violated sanctions related to Iran.The report from the Wall Street Journal sent shares in Nvidia 3 per cent lower, while Advanced Micro Devices shed 3.4 per cent. Xilinx and Qualcomm were both down about 0.5 per cent apiece.The wider Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.7 per cent, marking its fifth straight day of decline. The index has dropped more than 9 per cent over the past week.Huawei is one of the world’s largest smartphone makers alongside Apple and Samsung, and the company sources some of its components from US chipmakers.The Chinese group declined to comment directly on whether it was under investigation. It said in a statement: “Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including the applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.”The report of the probe comes just a week after the US hit Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE with a denial of export privileges over violation of US export laws to North Korea and Iran. A denial of export privileges would, among other things, prohibit ZTE from sourcing US components, on which it is highly dependent for its phones and other products.
13;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T16:55:47+0000;Wilbur Ross: China trade retaliation ‘should not be shock to anyone’;‘Even shooting wars end with negotiations’, US commerce secretary says;US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has said the world recognises that China’s behaviour on trade is “out of control” but that the escalating trade tension between the US and China was “not World War III”.The trade spat could still end in an agreement, he said, noting that “even shooting wars end with negotiations”.The comments from Mr Ross, appearing Wednesday morning on CNBC, come in the wake of China’s decision earlier in the day to impose retailiatory tariffs on about $50bn of annual imports from the US.The response “should not surprise anyone”, he said, adding that he was “a little surprised Wall Street was so surprised by it.”The action by China, in response to the Trump administration’s decision in March to impose punitive tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, has sent a shudder through markets, with S&P 500 futures pointing 1.5 per cent lower, and those for the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average — which is more heavily weighted towards affected industrial stocks — down 2 per cent.Mr Ross said America’s decision to impose the tariffs on steel and aluminium was about ensuring the nation’s current industrial state, while a more recent plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on 1,333 Chinese products was a response for what the Trump administration said had been decades of state-backed intellectual property theft by Beijing.“We must protect our intellectual property because that is our future,” Mr Ross said.The commerce secretary played down the tension between the two countries and the impact this could have on the earnings of US companies, saying the tariffs imposed by both parties represented a “fraction of 1 per cent of the economies”. News of the tariffs had been well telegraphed, he added.Nonetheless, shares in Boeing, whose US-produced products will be hit with tariffs under Beijing’s target list, was down more than 5 per cent in pre-market trade on Wednesday. Among other big industrials affected by the tariffs, Caterpillar was down 4 per cent, 3M was down 2.2 per cent, while a number of US semiconductor companies including Intel, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices were down more than 3 per cent.Earlier, Donald Trump tweeted: “We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the US Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!”
14;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD predicts sales growth but warns of possible ‘costly’ security fixes;;Advanced Micro Devices saw quarterly revenue grow more than a third year-on-year, but it cautioned investors that efforts to stop and fix security vulnerabilities can be “costly” and may not always be totally successful.The US chipmaker included the cautionary note in its latest quarterly earnings report for the three months ending December 31, which showed revenue growing 34 per cent year-on-year to $1.48bn, ahead of analysts’ expectations for $1.4bn in sales. The beat was attributed by the company in part to strong sales of its Radeon graphics cards and Ryzen processors.AMD also clocked net income of $61m, reversing the $51m net loss from a year ago and edging out analysts’ predictions of $53m in income. Diluted earnings per share came in at 6 cents, beating out forecasts for 5 cents a share.“2017 marked a key inflection point for AMD as we re-shaped our product portfolio, delivered 25 per cent annual revenue growth, expanded gross margin and achieved full-year profitability,” said AMD president and chief executive Lisa Su. “We are even more excited about 2018 as we launch our next wave of high-performance products and continue to position AMD as one of the premier long-term growth companies in the technology industry.”For the current quarter, AMD is looking for revenue growth of about 32 per cent year-over-year, about $1.55bn plus or minus $50m*.As part of its cautionary statements in the earnings, AMD addressed risks that could arise from recent security vulnerabilities. AMD and other rival chipmakers have recently been affected by vulnerabilities dubbed Meltdown and Spectre.The company cautioned in its earnings statement that it is could face claims related to those vulnerabilities.“AMD’s efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities can be costly and may be partially effective or not successful at all. For instance, AMD’s mitigation efforts, including the deployment of software or firmware updates to address security vulnerabilities, could result in unintended consequences such as adverse performance system operation issues and reboots. AMD may also depend on third parties, such as customers, vendors and end users to deploy AMD’s mitigations or create their own, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. AMD’s relationships with its customers could be adversely affected as some of its customers may stop purchasing AMD products, reduce or delay future purchases of AMD products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by AMD’s customers could adversely affect its revenue.”AMD shares dropped 9.3 per cent over the course of 2017 following a meteoric 295.12 per cent gain in 2016. The company has started 2018 on the front foot with a 25 per cent year-to-date advance.After Tuesday’s earnings release, shares rose as much as 4.4 per cent in after-hours trading before dropping as much as 6 per cent. At pixel time they were up again, about 0.5 per cent.*This post has been amended to correct the revenue guidance figures.
15;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD: insecure;Chipmaker should finally make inroads in markets from which it had all but vanished;"A massive security hole in the world’s computers is discovered. A shiver goes through Intel. Its shares fall 7 per cent, but rival AMD sees its stock price rise.Does this divergence make sense? Intel says it will suffer no material financial impact from last week’s revelations of security flaws in chips. Since Intel’s chief executive sold half his shares in the company two months ago while in possession of the confidential information, that calculation had better be correct.If so, there should be no advantage to AMD. The California-based, world number two chipmaker has not offered much of a challenge to Intel in a decade. Intel insists that the security issue is an industry one, fixable mainly (but not entirely) with software patches. Yet AMD has stated that it is not vulnerable to any of the problems identified by security researchers, insisting there is a “near zero” possibility of its products being hacked.Being less affected by security problems, whether by accident or design, comes at a good time for AMD. It has its first significant new server chips in the market in several years.Even without a fillip from the security scare, AMD should finally make inroads in markets from which it had all but vanished. Mercury Research notes that in 2006, AMD’s server market share peaked at 26 per cent. In the third quarter of last year, it was just 0.6 per cent. It aims to reach mid single-digit share by the end of the year and ultimately get back to a quarter of the server market.It remains outgunned by Intel and, in the increasingly popular graphics processing units, by Nvidia. Intel spends $13bn a year on research and development; AMD spends less than a tenth of that.AMD’s shares underperformed a soaring chip sector in 2017, but had risen more than 700 per cent between January 2016 and February last year. A 20 per cent rise in revenues in 2017 does not cover $2.8bn of sequential losses over the previous five years. AMD has lots of catching up to do, before its recent share rally is safe.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

16;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD slips after Microsoft stops ‘Meltdown’ patches for PCs with its chips;;AMD shares came under pressure in pre-market trading in New York after Microsoft said it had temporarily halted patches for the security bugs known as Meltdown and Spectre for PCs that use some of its processors.Microsoft had received reports from customers with PCs that use some of AMD’s chips that recent updates to Windows were placing them in an “unbootable state”, the software company said in a posting on its website dated January 9.The updates are part of a plan to protect PCs from the Meltdown and Spectre flaws in processor design that affect chips made by AMD, Intel and Arm Holdings. The revelation last week about the issues has prompted a mad-dash by IT departments to apply software fixes made available by companies like Microsoft.Microsoft said it investigated the customer reports that the updates were causing system issues, and “determined that some AMD chipsets do not conform to the documentation previously provided to Microsoft to develop the Windows operating system mitigations to protect against the chipset vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown.”The Washington-based company said that it is working with AMD to come up with a solution. AMD said in a statement:“AMD is aware of an issue with some older generation processors following installation of a Microsoft security update that was published over the weekend. AMD and Microsoft have been working on an update to resolve the issue and expect it to begin rolling out again for those impacted shortly.Tuesday’s news sent AMD sliding 2.7 per cent in pre-market trading on the Nasdaq stock market. Its shares have rallied since the Meltdown news broke on January 3 amid expectations from some analysts that it would not be as deeply exposed as Intel, its chief rival in making processors for computers.Read more:Experts say software patches may remedy Meltdown flawMeltdown and Spectre: what we know so farImage source: Bloomberg
17;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Companies in push to fix computer flaws;Intel hit with class-action lawsuits amid fears that tech updates will slow IT systems;Companies are rushing to update computer systems to patch security flaws revealed this week that affect chips used in almost every device — despite fears that the fixes will slow down their performance.Intel on Friday was hit with several class-action lawsuits from disgruntled consumers worried about slower computer performance. The chipmaker aims to issue updates for 90 per cent of the chips made in the past five years by the end of next week.The software updates that try to overcome flaws in the chips — made by Intel, AMD and Arm — are complicated and time-consuming to apply. Once patched, experts had estimated the systems could run between 5 and 30 per cent more slowly. Intel said Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google had all seen no meaningful impact on performance since updating their systems.However, unlike the big cloud companies, most IT customers do not have “the skilled PhDs” to make sure their systems do not suffer from patching, said Joseph Unsworth, an analyst at research firm Gartner.Many companies will be discouraged from updating their systems due to warnings that they will perform worse, he added.A US government-sponsored cyber security team backtracked on its original recommendation on Thursday to replace all hardware, saying the guidance had been “too blunt” and “impractical in the short term”. The Cert team at Carnegie Mellon University said one of the reasons it had changed its advice was due to a conversation with Intel.Gavin Millard, technical director at Tenable, a cyber security company, said IT operation teams around the world would be “under significant pressure” to patch, or update, every system. Apple said it had already released patches to defend its Mac systems against the flaw known as Meltdown, adding that the Apple watch was not affected.While an operating system update helps protect against Meltdown, several software updates may be required to mitigate the risks presented by the second vulnerability, named Spectre, in order to address the different ways hackers could exploit it. For example, an update to a browser could help foil hackers using Spectre to jump from a malicious advert in one window to harvest an online banking password in another tab. Karl Sigler, manager of threat intelligence at Trustwave, a cyber security company, said IT departments would be in “overdrive” for the “foreseeable future”. Updates to firmware, software which runs closest to the computer hardware, can be the most challenging to install.“Adding insult to injury, most firmware updates need to be installed directly on the system requiring a person being physically in front of the machine. Whether you send every user a USB stick with instructions for installation (and lots of prayer) or you send an IT person to every terminal, you can see how burdensome and complex the process can become,” Mr Sigler said. There is no evidence that the Meltdown and Spectre flaws have actually been exploited by hackers, but it is not clear that it would be possible to tell if they had.Art Manion, the vulnerability analysis technical manager at Cert, said he expected a new range of improved hardware to avoid these kind of attacks in coming years. Shares in Intel, which have fallen 4 per cent since the flaws were first reported, ticked up 0.3 per cent in late trade in New York, while shares in AMD were down 2.0 per cent. Intel has been hit by four class-action lawsuits in the US since the flaws became public this week, with consumers in California, Oregon and Indiana claiming the chipmaker should compensate them for the alleged slowdown in performance. A lawsuit from Richard Ries and Zachary Finer, consumers in California, alleged that Intel “took shortcuts” that created the vulnerability and mis-sold its product as “some of the fastest available on the market”. The plaintiffs also drew attention to the Intel chief executive’s automatic stock-selling plan, which started after the company knew about the flaws. “Rather than inform consumers about the major security flaw, Intel’s chief executive officer Brian Krzanich opted to sell millions of dollars of Intel stock — all that he could part with under the corporate bylaws — after he learnt of the Meltdown security flaw,” the complaint said. Intel said the share sale was unrelated and in line with corporate guidelines. 
18;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Experts say software patches may remedy Meltdown flaw;Cyber security team that had suggested replacing hardware shifts its recommendation;A US government-sponsored cyber security team has stepped back from its drastic warning about the impact of a computer security problem that affects nearly all computers and smartphones.The group at Carnegie Mellon University, which is backed by the Department of Homeland Security, advised computer users to apply software patches, or repairs, as a solution to the problem. It said these would “mitigate” the risk of attacks, though it did not say whether it believed they would fully resolve the issue.The cyber security group, known as CERT, had earlier warned companies that the only way to fully protect themselves was to replace their computer systems.That unusual warning had appeared to present companies with a choice of embarking on an expensive IT overhaul or risking an attack, once hackers learnt how to take advantage of two vulnerabilities made possible by the flaw, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre. CERT had advised computer users to replace the main processors in their computer systems, saying: “Fully removing the vulnerability requires replacing vulnerable CPU hardware.” By Thursday afternoon, however, the group had changed its position.The reversal highlights the extent to which cyber security experts are struggling to come to terms with the extent of the problem and possible remedies, even though it was uncovered by a Google researcher last year and reported to some big tech companies six months ago.The predicament, revealed this week, stems from serious flaws that have been discovered in chips made by Intel, AMD and Arm, and used in almost all computers, servers and smartphones. The flaws make it possible for a hacker to steal data from a computer’s core memory or from other programs running on the system. It results from a common chip design, making it more deeply embedded in IT systems than the usual software bugs that led to security failures.Some problems can be mitigated by operating system updates, which are being rushed out by tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple. However, tech companies are still working on finding all the fixes needed to defend against the vulnerabilities.Apple said on Thursday that it had already released mitigations in iOS 11.2 and macOS 10.13.2 to defend against Meltdown and that the Apple watch is not affected by Meltdown. The technology group said it plans to release mitigations in web browser Safari in a defence against Spectre.“All Mac systems and iOS devices are affected, but there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time,” Apple said on a support page. “Since exploiting many of these issues requires a malicious app to be loaded on your Mac or iOS device, we recommend downloading software only from trusted sources such as the App Store.”Intel said on Thursday that by the end of next week it expected to have issued software updates covering 90 per cent of chips it has introduced in the past five years, and executives said they were confident that these would “fully mitigate” the problem without the need to replace any hardware.But the vulnerability stretches back to chips produced over the past two decades, and the chipmaker said it would work with others in the industry to work out what more needed to be done.Additional reporting by Alice Woodhouse
19;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Meltdown and Spectre: what we know so far;Chip design vulnerability could have serious implications for computer users;Cyber security researchers have discovered chip design flaws that could enable access to sensitive information such as passwords on computers, servers and smartphones.Technology companies are now rushing to release patches to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited by hackers — but even if all the updates are made, many computers will remain exposed to one of the flaws. Google researchers discovered vulnerabilities in semiconductors in June and reported them to chipmakers Intel and AMD, as well as Arm Holdings, the chip design company.The flaws are fundamental to the architecture of chips. As Amazon Web Services pointed out in a statement on the public disclosure of the vulnerabilities, they have existed for more than 20 years. The flaw relates to a move the industry made a decade ago to speed up a computer’s processor by enabling it to access information before it was needed. Providing that pre-emptive access allowed computers to predict what a programme required before it was requested to do so. Fixing the flaw will slow down computer processes.Chipmakers Intel and AMD, as well as Arm Holdings, whose chip designs are used in most smartphones as well as servers and other computing devices, all said their products had been affected.The researchers worked with Intel and other security experts who reported similar problems for months and were holding off publicly announcing the flaw until they had software updates — known as patches — ready. A co-ordinated response by the companies was due to be released next week but a report published on The Register, a technology news website, forced a number of them, such as Microsoft, to release patches more quickly.The Meltdown and Spectre flaws could have serious implications for users, allowing hackers to access passwords or the encryption keys held in a device’s memory. Meltdown makes it possible for a program running on a computer to break into an operating system’s central memory, tapping into data it is not meant to be able to access. This can be addressed using the software updates being rushed out. But Spectre makes it possible for a program running on a chip to access data in a separate program, without any need to call on the operating system. It will be harder to fix and the first stage will probably be working on a way to detect if a hacker is using this flaw, even if a company cannot yet prevent them from doing so. The Meltdown and Spectre flaws are serious.The challenge — as was the case with the massive WannaCry attack last year that affected thousands of organisations worldwide — is enabling all potentially vulnerable users to upgrade their systems in a timely manner. Apple iPhone users will know that the company takes a fairly aggressive stance in demanding that users upgrade their systems with regular updates but the same cannot be said of laptop users or older smartphone models. Some connected devices, such as Internet of Things products, are much harder to update. Although the flaws have existed for years and have been known about for months, there are no signs yet that they have been exploited. But hackers tend to jump on new vulnerabilities once they are announced, trying to exploit them before networks are updated. The greatest risks are for users of shared computers such as hosted environments that run several different virtual machines on the same hardware. According to Sophos, the UK cyber security company, the flaws could potentially allow an untrustworthy user to snoop on other users who are logged in at the same time. However, this would probably be a random, not a targeted attack. The immediate danger is that the software patches applied to fix the vulnerability will slow down a laptop, server or smartphone. There have already been reports online that suggest a degradation in performance of more than 20 per cent once fixes have been applied. Intel has said that the level of slowdown could be as high as 30 per cent for the most active programs. Paul Ducklin, a security expert at Sophos, says users need to accept a slower performance to close the flaw. “In eight words, ‘Get ready to take one for the team’,” he says. A bigger potential problem is for companies that use cloud-based services. IT departments may have to apply dozens of patches over the coming weeks or redesign their systems. More significant would be skyrocketing bills from cloud providers if a customer’s usage rises substantially to apply the fixes. A number of patches have already been applied as companies moved to get ahead of the issue before it became public. There should be a steady stream of further patches issued by technology companies in the coming weeks and users are recommended to take action as soon as they are prompted. 
20;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2018-01-04T02:18:15Z;Intel: cashed in his chips;Chief executive’s share selling went too far, even without looming security issue;"As cyber security issues go, a design flaw that could allow hackers to access virtually every server and PC on the planet sold in the last decade is serious. It also sits uneasily with the sale of a large block of shares by the boss of the world’s largest chipmaker.On Wednesday, Intel issued a statement in response to “inaccurate media reports” saying that it and other chipmakers were working to provide software and firmware updates to reduce vulnerability. The company told investors on Wednesday that there should be no material financial impact from the security scare. Its share price initially fell as much as 7 per cent before ending down 3 per cent.In retrospect, it does not look great that chief executive Brian Krzanich sold half his Intel shares for $14m at the end of November. The transaction was executed under an automatic trading plan. These allow executives to issue instructions in advance, to avoid any suggestion that they are selling on the back of non-public information. But the plan was set up at the end of October, according to a regulatory filing — four months after Intel was informed of the weakness by security researchers from Google.There is no suggestion the two events are related, and the automatic trading plan ended up selling the stock at a slightly lower level than the post-scare share price. But the long-term impact on Intel remains unknown. While the company (and the Google researchers) stress this as an industry-wide issue, calling out by name other chipmakers such as AMD and Arm Holdings, it is not clear that their products are affected to the same extent. AMD says there is “near zero risk” to its products and its shares rose 5 per cent on Wednesday.Even without storms on the horizon, it is an open debate whether chief executives should sell large amounts of shares they are awarded while they are still in post. Of course, there is concentration risk in holding; the circumstances in which your stock price tanks are also those that might lead to you being fired.But skin in the game matters. Citigroup under Sandy Weill imposed a “blood oath” on the management team to hold the entire lot. Mr Krzanich has sold down to 250,000 shares, the bare minimum required by Intel’s own policies. It is not exactly a ringing endorsement.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below."
21;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Tech groups race to fix chip design flaw;Security hole threatens to expose sensitive data of computer users to hackers;Technology companies are racing to plug an industry-wide security hole that stems from a common flaw in chip designs and could expose almost all computer users to the theft of at least some sensitive data.The problem, described as unprecedented by experts, affects one of the most fundamental architectural elements of all computing systems, making it far more pervasive than the software flaws that are the usual source of computer security failures.Intel, whose chip designs are at the heart of all PCs and many servers, and Arm Holdings, whose designs are used in almost all smartphones, said they were working to fix the problem.“It’s not really one vendor’s problem. It’s a general design approach,” said Steve Smith, head of Intel’s data centre engineering group.US chipmaker AMD also said late on Wednesday that it was affected.“If Intel, AMD and Arm are impacted, we’re basically talking about anything that runs in a computing system anywhere in the world that is less than 10 years old,” said Beau Woods, a cyber safety innovation fellow at the Atlantic Council.The flaw could make it possible for hackers to see highly sensitive information such as passwords and a computer’s encryption keys, which could be used to access encrypted communications, Intel said.A combination of software and hardware changes will be needed to fix the problem, requiring an unusual, industry-wide effort involving many different software, chip and computer hardware makers, according to industry participants.Microsoft rushed out a patch to the Windows operating system on Wednesday to fix one vulnerability stemming from the chip design flaw. That vulnerability, known as Meltdown, makes it possible for a program running on a computer to break into an operating system’s central memory, tapping into data it is not meant to have access.The Microsoft fix, along with statements by the main chip companies, were released nearly a week ahead of a co-ordinated industry-wide action, after news of the chip problem was first reported by tech news site The Register.However, while the Meltdown vulnerability can be fixed with a software update, the chip flaw also opens other lines of attack and security experts said it would require changes to the firmware shipped in hardware systems to fully protect all computer systems.Meltdown would create a “major panic” encouraging people to update systems in the short term, said Paul Kocher, a security researcher, who was among the first to highlight the severity of the problem.But there would be a “very long struggle” to contain damage that could be done by another of the flaws, known as Spectre, he said. That vulnerability makes it possible for a program running on a chip to access data in a separate program, without any need to call on the operating system.Shares in Intel fell by about 3.5 per cent on Wednesday after the chip design problem surfaced.Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, sold $14m worth of stock last year, or nearly half his stake in the chipmaker, months after the flaw was first disclosed. The sale left him with the minimum holding required by the company. An Intel spokesperson said the sale was “unrelated” and had been made as part of an automated sale programme in which executives give up some control over the timing of sales.The chip problem was first discovered by a security researcher at Google in June last year, according to both Intel and the search company. In a blog post, Google said it had “collaborated with hardware and software manufacturers across the industry to help protect their users and the broader web”, while also working to protect its own systems.The biggest risk was to customers of cloud service providers, Mr Woods said. “If Bob’s Discount Warehouse is hosted on a certain provider, I could buy an account and maybe get access to Bob’s Discount Warehouse,” he said.Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud company, said on Wednesday it was close to completing an update on all its systems, though its customers would also have to patch their own operating systems to be secure.The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities stem from a basic design change that was made to many computer chips a decade ago to make them run faster. This allowed applications running on a computer to access data contained in the machine’s operating system memory before they actually needed it.The change enabled programs to anticipate some of the work they might be required to do — a process known as “speculative execution” — but has now been found to provide a route for malicious programs to see sensitive data held on the machine.Fixing the problem will mean blocking this pre-emptive access to data and could lead to a significant slowdown in some computer programs. Intel said the actual impact would depend on the design of software programs, and that the worst affected — those that need to make frequent calls on the operating system — could be slowed by as much as 30 per cent.The overall impact to performance was likely to be “in the single digits”, said Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst and former AMD executive, though it would take months before fixes could be rolled out and programs fully tested.
22;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2018-01-03T15:44:39Z;AMD shares pop on report of Intel processor bug;;What’s bad for Intel is good for Advanced Micro Devices.AMD shares jumped on Wednesday on a report that rival Intel has a design flaw in some of its processor chips.AMD shares rose more than 6 per cent to $11.66, while Intel shares fell 2.5 per cent to $45.63Online technology publication The Register said late on Tuesday that a design flaw in Intel’s processor chips has left computers’ so-called kernel memory — that typically is earmarked for tasks like protecting passwords, login keys, etc. — vulnerable.The report also said that processors made in the last decade appear to be impacted by the flaw. It also stated that patches will be required for Apple’s OS X operating systems as well as for Microsoft and Windows.Intel could not immediately be reached for comment.“To resolve the issue [reported by The Register], developers must separate the kernel’s memory from user processes,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel.“The kernel controls the processor to follow out commands from a running program and moving the kernel to a separate address increases the latency of the system.”While Mr Cassidy said it wasn’t clear if this is an old problem or new, he did mention in his note that the concerns are “overblown”.By contrast, Hans Mosesmann , an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said the sitution is “fluid” Intel does have “non-trivial issues” to contend with including “potential indemnification to harm or costs customers may have incurred”, customers possibly seeing an easier transition to engage with rival AMD and a reputational hit.Intel shares were up 27 per cent last year, while AMD shares had declined 9 per cent in 2017.
23;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2017-11-09T19:45:49Z;Semiconductors poised for worst day since June;;Semiconductors were in investors’ line of fire on Thursday, with the sector poised for its worst day in nearly five months and the sell-off dragging the broader technology sector lower.The S&P semiconductor and semiconductor equipment index fell 2.8 per cent — leaving it on track for its biggest one-day decline since June 9. The decline weighed on the wider technology sector, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.8 per cent for the day.Advanced Micro Devices led the decline among chipmakers, falling 5 per cent to $11.15. The slide came after Intel confirmed late on Wednesday that it had poached Raja Koduri, head of AMD’s fast growing graphic chips unit Radeon Technologies — to head up its newly formed core and visual computing group. Interestingly, Mr Koduri’s jump also comes after Intel recently teamed up with AMD to build chips in a move that was perceived as taking on rival Nvidia.Mr Koduri announced his departure from AMD on Tuesday, raising questions about the growth prospects at Radeon and sparking chatter that the move could boost Intel’s competitiveness in the graphic chips business at the expense of Nvidia and AMD.However, Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities disagrees. He notes that while Mr Koduri is a “rock star” in the world of graphics processing chips and his departure from AMD is a “strategic loss” for the company, it may not provide enough of a boost for Intel, which is in its”third or fourth serious effort in graphics”.“The Intel move in our view is a no-win situation for him as it is way too late in the game for him to change things and innovate,” said Mr Mosesmann.Still that did not prevent shares in semiconductors from lurching lower. Nvidia, which is slated to report results after the bell, saw its shares down 3.4 per cent to $202.02, Xilinx slid 3.5 per cent to $71.04, KLA-Tencor declined 4.3 per cent to $102.47 while Analog Devices shed 3.9 per cent to $88.45.Despite Thursday’s decline, the S&P 500 semiconductor and equipment index is up 38 per cent so far this year helping technology lead the broader benchmark index with a 36 per cent year-to-date gain.

We expect this to meaningfully decelerate next year,” Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in the report.The investment bank downgraded its AMD price target from $11 to $8 per share.AMD shares fell another 8 per cent on Monday in New York, taking the decline since the start of October to 14.6 per cent.The broader US stock market also ended the day lower after a flurry of political developments including the announcement of the first charges to stem from Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as a report that lawmakers are weighing a plan that would phase in corporate tax cuts.The major indices clawed back some of their losses in the final minutes of trading, however, after the New York Times became the latest outlet to report that US President Donald Trump is leaning towards nominating centrist Fed governor Jerome Powell to chair the central bank.The S&P 500 ended 0.3 per cent lower at 2,572.83, with the telecom sector leading the laggards after reports that Sprint and T-Mobile talks about a possible merger may be on the rocks. The index was also held back by a 6 per cent loss for pharmaceutical company Merck after a regulatory setback in Europe for its Keytruda cancer drug.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.36 per cent to 23,348.7, while the Nasdaq Composite ended nearly flat at 6,698.9.

Each of the 11 major sectors on the S&P 500 and 84 per cent of stocks on the index were in the red.Meanwhile, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 23,335.83 after Boeing, the heaviest weighted component on the benchmark index, slid 2.3 per cent to $259.90 having posted disappointing results. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 6,527.90.Chipotle was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 after it posted disappointing quarterly results, raising concerns about a recovery at the burrito chain. AT&T weighed on telecoms after the company said its quarterly sales fell more than forecast and Advanced Micro Devices also took a hit after saying it expects revenues to fall in the current quarter.However the results weren’t all dire. Payments company Visa and defence group Northrop Grumman both advanced after their results topped expectations.Investors appeared to ignored upbeat durable goods data in the US and sales of newly built homes, which rose by the most since 1992 amid an increase in sales in the South that was battered by a string of hurricanes. They also await updates on who President Donald Trump may nominate to succeed Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair.Wednesday’s sell-off left the S&P 500 at risk of snapping a second consecutive “perfect week” of record closing highs. The move came amid a pick up in volatility with the Vix volatility index, Wall Street’s fear gauge which measures the short-term volatility implied by S&P 500 option prices, rose 14 per cent (1.67 points) to 12.74 and was up 27 per cent on the week.Elsewhere in markets, US Treasuries pared back their losses. The yield on the 10-year, which had fallen to a 7-month low was up 2 basis points to 2.439 per cent. Yields move inversely to price. Meanwhile, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, slid 0.1 per cent to 93.67.

Revenue for the three months ending September 30 came in at $1.64bn, better than the $1.51bn that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected. Net income was $71m, or 7 cents a share, versus a $406m loss, or 50 cents a share, during the same period last year.Adjusted for special items, earnings per share came in at 10 cents, versus the 8 cents analysts had expected.
27;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2017-10-16T09:59:08Z;Big Tech vs Big Pharma: the battle over US patent protection;Critics fear Silicon Valley lobbying has weakened the defence of intellectual property and sapped innovation;Sherry Knowles has a very personal interest in defending intellectual property — she believes it saved her life. Ms Knowles, herself a patent lawyer, fears that the treatment that helped her combat breast cancer, a medicine known as Adriamycin, would not have been produced if the tighter patent regulations introduced over the past decade had been in place when she fell ill.As a former chief patent counsel at GlaxoSmithKline, Ms Knowles, who runs her own life sciences legal consulting firm, has a vested interest in defending IP laws. She knows that major pharmaceutical groups like GSK can only monetise new drugs based on their ability to patent innovations.But pointing to Supreme Court rulings that have made innovations in drugs difficult to patent, and to changes in the patent adjudication system, she says it has become tougher for some groups to protect their interests.“If companies can’t defend their intellectual property, they won’t invest,” says Ms Knowles. “It’s that simple.”Few will have too much sympathy for Big Pharma. The industry has long been in the line of fire over drug pricing and its monopolistic power. But the large drug companies are only one voice among many that have begun to complain about how shifts in the US patent system over the past decade have weakened the ability of companies to protect their innovations.Start-up biotech firms are complaining, as are a number of semiconductor and electronics firms, clean-tech companies, data analysis groups, universities and innovators working on the “internet of things” — not to mention the venture capitalists that invest in them.Indeed, the only ones that seem not to be complaining about the current system are a handful of the biggest Silicon Valley companies — including Google, Apple, Intel and Cisco. While they all have their own patents to protect, their business models, which involve products that include hundreds or even thousands of bits of IP, tend to do better when there are fewer patents to deal with.But small and mid-sized software and hardware suppliers as well as life sciences companies have very different business models — ones that live or die on the ability to protect a handful of patents, and thus monetise their years of investment.For many of these companies, the shifts in the system that began a decade ago have gone too far.Thanks to a series of court rulings since the mid-2000s, such as eBay v MercExchange in 2007, Mayo Collaborative Services v Prometheus Laboratories in 2012 and Alice Corp v CLS Bank in 2014, and the subsequent passing of the American Invents Act under President Barack Obama in 2011, patents in the US have become harder to secure — and harder to defend.There are numerous metrics that reflect this, but one simple measure is that the US has moved from first to 10th place globally in terms of patent protection, according to a yearly study by the US Chamber of Commerce, based on research by the Israeli data analysis group Pugatch Consilium. While the study shows the US is still strong on other aspects of IP creation, the patent system itself is now tied with Hungary in terms of the strength of patent rights.53%Increase in probability of securing venture capital if a start-up can hold and defend its patent, according to an NBER reportPerhaps as a result, many companies complain of “efficient infringement” on the part of larger rivals, which simply copy or take the IP they want, then settle with aggrieved parties out of court for less than the full value of the IP.Few companies except those who have been in open litigation will go on the record with their travails, for fear of being blackballed within the tech community. Among those that do, there are numerous stories of patent fights that border on the absurd: consider Zond, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of plasma generators whose IP has been challenged nearly 400 times, unsuccessfully, by companies including Intel, Gillette, AMD and Fujitsu.Why did the US patent system, which was written into the constitution as a key right and had successfully fostered American IP development since its last tweak in 1952, undergo such a radical shift? In a word: trolls — which is the industry nickname for companies that issue a flurry of spurious patent filings. Or perhaps more accurately, the patent troll narrative.When the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s, many companies were left with nothing of value except their patents, which were then bought up by financial companies or larger tech entities that tried to milk some cash from them.At the same time, the software suppliers that served the burgeoning commercial internet and smartphone markets began to broaden. The majority of those companies had legitimate technologies and ideas to protect. But some “patent trolls” were playing a game of legal arbitrage, filing as many patents as possible to get larger companies to settle with them for the use of their technology.US innovation has always been dogged by patent trolls. But by the time that Mr Obama took office in 2009, the patent troll narrative had reached a new fever pitch. It was a storyline supported by many Big Tech companies which individually and via lobbying bodies pushed for the American Invents Act.The law established a non-court adjudication body, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The idea was to save time and money with the non-court “inter-parties” process, and indeed, patent claims went from taking three years and an average cost of $2m to settle, to being done with $200,000 in 18 months.Yet the largest tech groups, particularly Google (which declined to comment for this story) lobbied hard for even more anti-patent legislation in 2013. Companies which supported additional legislation say it would have cut out legal distortions around issues like the venue in which patent cases are heard, thereby cutting litigation costs.“It was shocking to see calls from some in the tech industry for a second round of drastic patent legislation immediately after all we did in the AIA, and before the AIA had even gone into effect,” says David Kappos, former head of the US Patent and Trademark Office, now with lawyers Cravath, Swaine & Moore, who says the argument about patent trolls “increasingly rang false”.Mr Kappos represents Qualcomm, one of the critics of the current system, but both he and the legal firm also represent clients on the other side of the argument.“Ultimately, the real agenda sunk in,” he says. “This second round of drastic cutbacks to the patent system was a commercial ploy designed not to stop abuse but to cut supply chain costs by devaluing others’ innovation.”The push for new legislation was ultimately held up in Congress. Meanwhile, Michelle Lee, Google’s former head of IP, replaced Mr Kappos as head of the USPTO. In 2013, the White House put out an alarming report on the prevalence of patent trolls and their destructive effects, blaming them for two-thirds of patent suits.20%Proportion of suits bought by ‘patent trolls’, according to non-partisan Governmental Accounting Office. The Obama administration had put the number at two-thirdsYet subsequent research done by the non-partisan Governmental Accounting Office put that number at one-fifth, and other data showed that the number of patent defendants had been roughly flat before and after the AIA. (Ms Lee, who resigned from the patent office in June, could not be reached for comment.)“The historical trend in litigation rates relative to patents granted clearly does not support claims that litigation in the past decades has ‘exploded’ above the long-term norm,” wrote Bowdoin College professor Zorina Khan, in a 2013 paper “Trolls and Other Patent Inventions”.What’s more, she argued, a number of legislative changes seemed to address “the ephemeral demands of the most strident interest groups at a single point in time” and are “inconsistent with the fundamentals of the US intellectual property system”.Indeed, some would argue that the system of adjudication for patents introduced under the Obama administration has become a “powerful shield” for those accused of patent infringement. Most of the verdicts go against the patent holder, leading former chief judge Randall Rader, who led the court in charge of patent appeals, to label it the “death squad” for IP.Another retired federal district court judge, Paul Michel, has become a vocal opponent of the system, arguing that excessive invalidations and the way in which the adjudication board has pre-empted court rulings are sapping both the strength of the patent system, and American innovation itself.“The cumulative [anti-patent] effect of the Supreme Court rulings and the AIA was, together, stronger than it should have been,” he says, in part because of what he and others say was lobbying on the part of large tech firms. “Patent values are plummeting, and licensing and capital investments in many technologies are sinking. The AIA has done more harm than good.”There are those who say there’s not much to fix in the system. Mark Chandler, the general counsel of Cisco, recently had two patents overturned in the PTAB system, but still believes it is the best way to determine patent worthiness.“The patent right is designed to promote progress through the reward of a legal monopoly. The system is effective as long as patents represent a true, implementable technology, and patents which never should have been granted can be efficiently eliminated from the system. If the system cannot achieve this, it puts a deadweight burden on the economy by blocking innovation by others and unnecessarily driving up prices to consumers.” Companies such as Intel would say much the same thing.The key is deciding which patents should be granted — and opinions between Big Tech and many other innovators differ wildly.“You need a patent system that induces the right behaviour, which means one in which incumbents have to pay for innovations, not copy or steal them,” says venture capitalist Gary Lauder, a Silicon Valley-based investor who has poured more than half a billion dollars in funding into nearly 100 companies and 60 venture capital funds in the past 28 years, and has become an advocate for a stronger patent system.“We need to protect the larger start-up ecosystem, which is where the majority of jobs are created,” he says. “It’s an issue that’s really crucial for our economy. Today the incumbents are copying the innovators. Next both will be copied and displaced by cheap foreign knock-offs.”There is little doubt that strong IP protection is linked to stronger economic growth. A recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that holding a patent (and being able to defend it) increases the probability of securing venture capital funding by 53 per cent, start-up job growth by 36 per cent and start-up sales by 51 per cent. Another paper, “Patents and the Wealth of Nations” by Stanford academic Stephen Haber, found that countries that protect patents enjoy stronger economic growth. His research also shows that the patent troll narrative, and the idea that litigious patent holders can “hold up” innovation for bigger groups, is inconsistent with the data.As both sides debate the data, the next battle in the patent wars is getting under way. Lawmakers like Democratic Senator Chris Coons are now pushing for new rules that would strengthen patent laws, amid worries that the US is beginning to lose important innovations to Europe and China, which despite its own reputation for theft of foreign IP has been strengthening patent protection.There are separate debates over whether software and biotech’s different business models might require two patent systems. Next year, the Supreme Court may hear a case, Oil States vs Greene’s Energy, that will challenge the entire constitutionality of the current patent system. Either way, innovators and investors will go where they can for the best IP protection. The patent wars will play a large role in what part of the world that will be — and where the next life-saving drug will be developed.There is an abundance of data that both advocates and critics of the current patent system spin in all sorts of ways to make their case.In 2013, then president Barack Obama issued a report saying that patent lawsuits were rising, and two-thirds of all patent suits were brought by trolls. But that report was itself influenced by the Big Tech narrative on patent trolls — Google was the number one corporate visitor to the White House in the second term of the Obama administration.The White House report didn’t account for the fact that the America Invents Act itself artificially jacked up the number of cases by changing rules to disallow plaintiffs from suing multiple defendants in a single suit, thus necessitating that the number of suits equal the number of defendants.A couple of months later, the non-partisan Government Accounting Office issued a report saying that patent trolls were responsible for only one-fifth of the lawsuit problem.If you look at the issue using data from Lex Machina that charts lawsuits based on individual defendants — the best way to compare figures before and after the AIA — you realise that the number of patent lawsuits was just about steady before and after the troll narrative took hold. The brief spike at the end of 2011 was related to a filing deadline before the AIA kicked in.The conclusion?

Year-to-date, its shares are down about 30 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.The buyback programme won praise from Drexel Hamilton analyst Robert Christensen, who also pointed to its “strong balance sheet”, relatively high margins and $6bn in cash.He said in a note that the buybacks were a “positive signal that (Anadarko) remains focused on creating value not just through the drill bit and reserve and production growth or M&A at any price”.Mr Christensen — who reiterated his “buy” recommendation and target share price of $100 — said the move also underscored that other top-tier exploration and production companies have alternatives for their capital rather than pursuing a “one-sided strategy” of “merely drilling for growth’s sake”, particularly if commodity prices fall.“[A] two-sided strategy to use cash and return it to shareholders when possible is better,” he added.Despite Anadarko’s advance, major US stock indices were trading lower by lunchtime in New York. The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 2,504.77 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1 per cent to 22,393.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent to 6,433.97.Blue Apron shares rallied as much as 9 per cent to $5.68 before trimming those gains to trade about 1.5 per cent higher to $5.30.Shares in the meal kit delivery service were boosted after Albertsons said on Wednesday afternoon that it would buy Plated, which launched in 2012, raising speculation that Blue Apron could be the next meal kit targeted for a takeover.Albertsons operates stores under numerous brand names including Safeway, Vons and its eponymous brand.Nvidia shares stumbled 4 per cent to $178.27 following reports that electric automaker Tesla was working with rival Advanced Micro Devices to develop an autonomous driving technology chip.AMD shares, which had jumped earlier in the session, were trading roughly flat at $13.76.Shares in Eldorado Gold rose nearly 3 per cent to $2.27 after the miner said it had entered into “constructive dialogue” with the Greek government and postponed its decision to freeze its investment in Greece.The company had previously threatened to suspend operations after quarrelling over delayed approvals for mine developments.

But despite the earnings beat, Citi analysts on Wednesday reiterated their sell rating on the stock, raising its target price from just $4 to $5.“The company continues to lose share and money in its core PC processor/graphics segment,” wrote Christopher Danely.Computing and graphics, the segment that includes the new processors, achieved a slight profit for the first time in three years during the quarter. However, the bank said it believes it is unlikely AMD will sustain a significant share of the market needed to be profitable.Shares in AMD are up 36 per cent year to date, but the gains have been volatile. Shares have moved about 10 per cent or more seven times since January, compared with nine times for the whole of 2016.Citi said it does not expect the company’s efforts in ARM servers, a key type of hardware, to gain traction, due to “intense competition and disadvantages relative to its competitors”.Despite recent success in its gaming business, Citi also said it also does not believe the gains are sufficient to offset declines in it core microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs).ADM’s newer GPUs sold out midway through the second quarter, but Citi also noted this was likely a temporary rush from the crypto-currency mining market.“[The] mining related GPU gold rush is over for now,” Mr Danely wrote. The miners are also expected to resell their graphics cards on the secondary market, he said, “causing a headwind” for future sales.

After the recent launch of its new Ryzen processors for desktop PCs and Vega graphics processors, which are popular with videogamers as well as cryptocurrency miners, AMD saw its second-quarter revenues rise by 19 per cent to $1.22bn, better than the $1.16bn expected by analysts.After adjusting for the proceeds of a facilities sale last year, AMD returned to profit, with net income of $19m; however, on a GAAP basis it posted a $16m loss. Adjusted earnings of 2 cents per share of were ahead of forecasts.AMD said that it expects third-quarter revenues to gain by around 15 per cent year on year, as it upgraded its forecast for sales for the year as a whole. “AMD now expects annual revenue to increase by a mid to high-teens percentage, compared to prior guidance of low double digit percentage revenue growth,” it said.“Given our first half 2017 performance, and our visibility into the third quarter, we are happy to report we are progressing ahead of our annual revenue guidance and we look forward to a strong year overall,” said Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive.Computing and Graphics, the segment that includes Ryzen and Vega, saw a 51 per cent jump in revenue year-over-year, while sales at its enterprise division, which includes servers and games consoles, fell by 5 per cent.The launch of the latest Ryzen and Vega processors marked key milestones in AMD’s renewed competition against its main rivals Intel and Nvidia. Ms Su said that the Computing and Graphics division “reported operating profitability for the first time in three years” thanks to the launches.While AMD’s stock fell sharply after its last quarterly earnings came in short of market expectations, its shares have nonetheless outperformed Intel’s so far this year, up by 24 per cent at the market close on Tuesday, compared with Intel down by 4 per cent over the same period. Nvidia remains one of the strongest performers among tech stocks, gaining by 54 per cent since the beginning of 2017."

But revenues were down 11 per cent sequentially, which the company attributed to seasonality in its computing and graphics segment and its enterprise unit.AMD’s quarterly loss narrowed to $73m, or 8 cents a share, in the three months ended April 1, compared with a loss of $108m, or 14 cents a share, in the year-ago period.That was wider than Wall Street forecasts of a loss of 7 cents. Adjusting for one-time items, a loss of 4 cents a share was in line with estimates.Shares had surged 295 per cent last year as the company returned to annual revenue growth.Bullish sentiment was partly fuelled by hopes that new chief executive Lisa Su could help drive a turnround at the company and in anticipation of the “eight-core” Zen processor that is part of its new Ryzen product line.Moreover, analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that its outlook for revenues to rise about 17 per cent sequentially in the current quarter failed to show the “upside the bulls were anticipating”.“AMD stock remains a ‘show me’ story as the market has, in our view, pre-traded the expected improvement in market share, gross margins and ultimately earnings per share,” said Toshiya Hari, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Adding to the bearish sentiment on the stock on Tuesday was a downgrade by analysts at Macquarie, who lowered the stock to “underperform” from “neutral” and cut their price target to $10 from $14, noting that Intel will have its own new products in the PC and server markets.“Any share gains by AMD will likely be met with aggressive pricing actions by Intel, which could severely limit AMD’s margin expansion hopes,” said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at Macquarie.Elsewhere, shares in Coach gained 11.4 per cent to $43.15 after the handbag maker said lower inventory in mid-tier department stores translated into more full-priced sales at its own stores.Same-store sales for North America — Coach’s biggest market — were up 3 per cent during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on April 1.The rise marks the fourth straight quarter of like-for-like sales gains for the company and tops the 1.4 per cent increase the market was expecting. However, revenues fell 3.7 per cent to $995.2m, a larger than expected decline.The gain underscored Coach’s efforts to lessen its dependence on department stores for its sales and regain more pricing control over its products.The advance in Coach shares came as big US equity bourses were fluctuating between losses and gains.By close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,391.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 20,949.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 6,095.37.

Sales were driven by strong demand for its new Ryzen CPU’s as well as graphics processors.However, revenues were down 11 per cent sequentially which the company attributed to seasonality in its computing and graphics segment and its enterprise unit.AMD noted that its quarterly loss narrowed to $73m or 8 cents a share in the three months ended April 1, compared with a loss of $108m or 14 cents a share in the year ago period.

The bullish sentiment was also partly fuelled by hopes that new chief executive Lisa Su could help drive a turnround at the company and in anticipation of the “eight-core” Zen processor that is part of its new Ryzen product line.Looking ahead the company said it expects revenues to rise about 17 per cent sequentially in the current quarter and a low double digit percentage growth for the year.AMD shares are up 20 per cent so far this year.
34;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
35;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2017-02-22T14:08:34Z;AMD takes fight to Intel with next-generation chips;Chipmaker hopes to ‘disrupt PC market’ and undercut arch-rival with Zen processor;Chipmaker AMD is launching its first serious challenge to Intel in the powering of desktop PCs for almost a decade, with a new generation of processors it claims offers better performance at a much lower price.Shares in AMD have skyrocketed from $2 a year ago to $14, partly in anticipation of the “eight-core” Zen processor, which has been in development for four years as part of its new Ryzen product line.At a press event in San Francisco, Lisa Su, AMD chief executive, said the Silicon Valley company hoped to “disrupt the PC market” by bringing “innovation and choice to as many people as possible”, after years of overwhelming dominance by its arch-rival.Ms Su is betting that the low-cost, high-volume strategy behind Ryzen — along with launches coming later this year of graphics, server and notebook chips — will help AMD reverse five years of losses, after returning to annual revenue growth last year.“We will grow again in terms of revenue [in 2017] and that will drive the profitability that we talked about,” she said in an interview. AMD said last month it expected to post profits on a non-generally accepted accounting principles basis, after adjusting for certain items, this year.Amid declining global PC sales, “we absolutely believe that we can gain share” from Intel with the new central processing unit, Ms Su said. Intel has been steadily increasing its share of the CPU market over the past decade to more than 80 per cent last year, analysts estimate.Patrick Moorhead, tech analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy, said that benchmark tests suggest AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X CPU, costing $499, could offer “twice the performance at half the price” as Intel’s equivalent Core i7 6800K, which currently costs $1,050.“They are trying to drive some serious volume with a combination of price and performance,” Mr Moorhead said. “Intel hasn’t been challenged in this space for five to 10 years.”AMD’s aggressive pricing could prompt a response from Intel, he said, either in lowering its prices or speeding up the launch of new products.“AMD has changed the fundamental architecture of their chips to make up for a major deficit they’ve had for the last decade,” Mr Moorhead said. “The last architecture change Intel had was in 2006 with the Core architecture — that’s how big of a deal this is.”Ms Su said the PC market had “gone through a transformation” since AMD last made significant changes to its CPU architecture. “A few years ago, it was all about tablets and mobile. Today it’s all about performance,” she said. “We also believe we can bring new performance users into the market . . . There are hundreds of millions of PC users out there, but many of them have not been upgraded for a long time.”AMD’s initial focus for Ryzen is on gamers, a traditional strength for the company given its processors’ position inside the latest games consoles — the Sony PS4 Pro and Microsoft’s Xbox One S. Ms Su also hopes its relative affordability will entice “prosumer” customers, for instance creative people who do a lot of video and photo editing. Ryzen can provide a capable platform for virtual and augmented reality headsets, an early but fast-developing market, she said.Customers will be able to pre-order the Ryzen chips on Wednesday through retailers including Amazon in the US and China’s Tmall, with the hardware shipping on March 2.

Analysts had forecast a loss of 4 cents a share. Adjusted for one-time items, a loss of a penny was in line with expectations.Revenue climbed nearly 16 per cent to $1.1bn, above estimates, driven by higher graphics processing unit (GPU) sales. The average sell price of GPU’s climbed, driven by higher prices for desktop and professional graphics, the company said.For the current quarter, the company said it expects revenues to slide 11 per cent sequentially, plus of minus three per cent, indicating a range of $951.2m to $1.02bn, compared with Bloomberg estimates of $962m.AMD’s shares jumped 295 per cent last year buoyed by investor hopes of a turnaround under chief executive Lisa Su and as a wave of deal activity helped lift sentiment on semiconductors. “We met our strategic objectives in 2016, successfully executing our product roadmaps, regaining share in key markets, strengthening our financial foundation, and delivering annual revenue growth,” Dr Su, said.AMD shares, which have slid more than 8 per cent so far this year, climbed more than 4 per cent in extended trading to $10.80.

On an adjusted basis, AMD reported earnings of 3 cents per share compared to a loss of 17 cents per share a year earlier, beating market expectations.Revenue was up 23 per cent to $1.3bn and also beat market expectations of $1.21bn, due to higher sales of chips for gaming consoles. The Silicon Valley company has been trying to revive profits after years of losses, due to shrinking demand for personal computers.Analysts’ attention had turned to AMD after Intel gave a gloomy outlook for the fourth quarter despite beating estimates in the third. For the fourth quarter, AMD said it expects sales in the range of $1.03 to $1.11bn — the lower end of those forecasts missed analysts estimates for $1.06bn.The slide in shares came along with reports that said Qualcomm was nearing a deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors, another chipmaker.As of Thursday’s close, AMD shares had more than doubled from the end of December.

The trade body, whose members spend $700bn annually, issued the warning in a guidance document to help brands protect their digital ad budgets from criminals.As advertisers have shifted spending online, fraudsters have found ways to fake the online behaviour of a human being to give the impression they have visited a website and seen or clicked on an ad. Advertisers pay for these ‘views’ even though they are not seen by the real people they are intended to reach.Stephan Loerke, chief executive of the WFA, said there has been “a degree of complacency” among advertisers in recent years as they poured money into digital campaigns.“Ad fraud is endemic and it has to stop,” he said. “If brand owners don’t take action, we can’t expect others to do so on our behalf.” Read moreFadell leaves Nest Tony Fadell, the most prominent Alphabet executive beyond its core Google search business, has been replaced as head of the Nest “smart home” division after signs that it has failed to live up to early hopes.

39;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Is it a sport if you’re sitting in a chair?;I share views of the sceptics down the pub about games conducted from something as comfy as a chair;"When Euro 2016 begins on Friday and the British teams are inevitably knocked out early, a familiar groan will be heard across the UK: why, many Brits will complain, are we still only reliably good at sports conducted sitting down, like motor racing, cycling and equestrianism.The same will be said in August at the Olympics, when British rowers will probably do well, while the UK’s triumphant 2012 performance in standing-up sports isn’t likely to be repeated.Like many fans of what I regard as truly physical sports, I share the views of the sceptics down the pub about games conducted essentially from a comfy chair.I was recently talking to some folk from the chipmaker AMD at a conference when the subject of professional video gaming — surely the sitting-est of sitting pursuits — came up. I was aware that professional gaming has an estimated 300m global audience, but knew nothing about these “esports”.AMD, it turns out, sponsors a stable of teams under the name Fnatic, and its world-beating League of Legends team in particular is widely acknowledged as the Real Madrid of gaming. The team’s five members live with their manager, coach and statistician in a “gaming house”, which sounded bizarre, remarkable and depressing all in one.To me, along with perhaps most people over 40, the notion of computer gaming being a sport, let alone a professional one, flies in the face of pretty much everything. Surely you might as well sleep or eat Krispy Kreme doughnuts for a living?To counter my bemusement, AMD offered a visit to the gaming house. I was dimly aware that this was an honour akin to being allowed to hang out with Ronaldo, Bale and co, except it was a bit lost on me, as I haven’t played a computer game since Caterpillar on my kids’ Atari. But soon, I was at the League of Legends house in Berlin, which is the global esports hub.I imagined the house resembling the student flat in The Young Ones. But it was a bright seven-bedroom penthouse off the chic Kurfürstendamm more in the style of a Big Brother house.It was early on a weekend morning, so the hum of powerful PCs was more notable than the hum of human activity. A couple of sleepy team members — one Dutch and one Korean (Koreans are the Brazilians of gaming) — were working out gently at their screens playing each other at some low-stress game.What was hard to compute for me was that these guys, who looked like anyone’s 20-ish son eating breakfast cereal at their computer, were almost as famous as footballers, with fans in the tens of millions and earnings in six, if not quite seven, figures.Crowds of 30,000 can gather for big games, and 40m have been known simultaneously to stream tournaments online where prize money reaches hundreds of thousands of pounds. No wonder, then, that Fnatic’s Dutchman, Fabian Diepstraten, had just appeared in Vogue’s Netherlands edition — with a full-page photo — in a feature on his nation’s rising personalities.“When we go to KFC or McDonald’s down the street here, we do get stopped for photos by 13 to 24-year-olds. It can be quite difficult,” said Finlay Stewart, the team manager. “Our address is kept secret, but they still find us. And yes, there are groupies, although we have a house rule that only real girlfriends can come into the house.”Brits are not famed as players, so Mr Stewart, 24, is the only one in the house, although Fnatic is a 45-employee UK business, based in Shoreditch. From Chelsea, he joined Fnatic straight out of Exeter University. Gaming doesn’t seem a bad way to cut your business teeth; Fnatic is considered the first big brand in esports, and has a growing apparel and computer hardware catalogue.I learnt a lot about epsorts on my visit, but did I leave persuaded it’s a sport?Well, I quite like that seven-stone weaklings can excel at it, although they can also do well at chess — or amateur radio, which, weirdly, is considered a sport in the old communist countries.The game may be a bit too warlike for my taste, but then again chess can be quite aggressive too. In fact, any sport lacking aggression is a bit limp really.And I admire that being a brilliant strategist is as important as wondrous hand-eye co-ordination, so I think I’ll say perhaps to esports — although I may not be streaming games just yet."
40;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US junk bonds cracking after debt binge;Total returns from speculative grade debt on course for negative year;After the debt binge comes the bill, and that is the grim message for investors looking at the present performance of the US corporate bond market.As the third quarter draws to a close, slowing global economic activity threatens the earnings power of many US companies, which have amassed $7.8tn in debt. Years of easy monetary policy that kept borrowing costs low, a wave of mergers and acquisitions and the spectre of shareholder activism have all contributed to an erosion of balance sheet quality.Most vulnerable are junk-rated companies, which account for $2.5tn of the recent US corporate debt binge, with bonds worth roughly $1.5tn set to mature over the next five years, according to S&P. Refinancing that amount may prove a hurdle for corporate executives and chief financial officers if earnings come under more pressure.Michael Contopoulos, a strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: “Finally investors are starting to wake up. They are starting to trade on earnings and they’re starting to trade on downgrades.”For the first time since the financial crisis, total returns from speculative grade US debt — generally riskier bonds issued by companies rated BB+ or lower by Standard & Poor’s or Ba1 by Moody’s — are set to decline. The Barclays US high yield index is down 2.3 per cent for 2015.As borrowing costs rise and defaults have accelerated, investors have withdrawn more than $14bn from junk bond funds since the middle of April. The yield on the BofA Merrill Lynch high yield index has climbed to 7.98 per cent from 6.52 per cent a year ago.“We are in the late stages of the credit cycle,” said Edwin Tai, a distressed debt portfolio manager at Newfleet Asset Management. “Cycles last five to seven years and we’re in the seventh year. It’s when the US economy slows that you have defaults across the board.”Already in 2015, more US companies have defaulted than at any time since 2009, according to S&P. The list of 47 filings includes RadioShack, Patriot Coal and Quiksilver, the surfwear retailer.S&P analysts expect the default rate to nearly double to 2.9 per cent by June 2016 from June 2014, warning that “the current crop of US speculative-grade issuers appears weak to us and particularly susceptible to any sudden or unanticipated shocks”.Lists of the companies that occupy the lowest rating rungs compiled by both Moody’s and S&P have swelled and include well-known groups such as Sears, Getty Images, Advanced Micro Devices, California Pizza Kitchen, Caesars Entertainment and Goodrich Petroleum.What began as weakness in the coal sector 18 months ago has swept across the energy sector following sharply falling oil prices, say strategists with BofA Merrill Lynch. But that fragility has also spread across the retail, food, semiconductor and telecoms industries.Investors are demanding a greater premium from junk-rated companies seeking to secure funding.Last week Altice, the French cable giant, was forced to lower the size of a bond offering to finance its takeover of Cablevision.Weakening equity and bond prices reflect falling profits at US junk-rated companies, which face the dual challenges of sliding commodity prices and slowing international growth.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation tumbled 39.3 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier — the greatest decline since at least the turn of this century, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said: “It is not just the dollar, it is not just oil any more, it is beginning to be worries about the state of the US economy.”Excluding the energy sector, ebitda has slipped by nearly a tenth at companies in the BofA Merrill Lynch high-yield index, which encompasses roughly 60 per cent of the US junk bond market.The slide in earnings has also elevated leverage to its highest level in almost 15 years. The debt burden of high-yield companies climbed to 4.82 times trailing 12-month earnings at the end of the second quarter, according to BofA Merrill Lynch.Mr Contopoulos characterised the rise in leverage as “unsustainable”, as companies increasingly earmarked debt offerings for shareholder returns — including buybacks and dividends — and mergers and acquisitions.DoubleLine Capital, the bond fund manager, has lowered its allocation in its core fixed income fund away from junk bonds, portfolio manager Kapil Singh notes.“The US economy feels like it is continuing to muddle along,” Mr Singh said. “It’s clear to see over the past year . . . that growth is slowing in sales and ebitda.”
41;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2015-09-09T10:27:02Z;Interest rate rise: turning point looms for US debt binge;Flip side of cheap financing exposed as energy companies expected to default in greater numbers;With a $4tn mountain of debt maturing over the next five years, corporate America’s reliance on cheap cash is about to be tested.The prospect of steadily increasing interest rates in the coming years as the Federal Reserve gradually tightens policy, means US companies that tapped global markets for inexpensive finance over the past four years will soon face a different environment.US corporate treasurers have rushed to lock in cheap borrowing costs in advance of the expected rate rise, refinancing more than $1tn each year between 2012 and 2014, according to Standard & Poor’s.Tighter borrowing conditions will mark a turning point in the recent debt binge. Companies have had easy access to cash to write cheques for multibillion-dollar takeovers, to fund buybacks and dividend strategies — all welcomed by investors as share prices rallied off 2009 lows.But as rates turn higher, investors may see the flip side of cheap financing. Analysts warn companies will begin defaulting in greater numbers, particularly in the energy sector, which has found itself in the line of fire as commodity prices languish.In the first half of 2015, the pace of capital raisings accelerated, with bond issuance from blue-chip companies — those rated “investment grade” by one of the leading credit agencies — such as Apple, Comcast, Exxon and Boeing — jumping nearly 50 per cent from a year earlier. Bond issuance by non-investment grade companies, often called “junk”, is up 21 per cent in the first six months of the year from the same point in 2014.But this hearty bond borrowing binge could be challenged this year. Traders are betting that the Fed will lift interest rates in December, while many economists and analysts are leaning towards a hike as early as this month. “It has become clear we are close to the point when the Fed starts to raise rates,” says Hans Mikkelsen, a strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The most powerful central bank in the world is considering whether to raise its record-low interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Even before the US Federal Reserve makes a move, the effects are reverberating throughout the global economy. Our project explores how.Go to hub pageThat prospect worries some analysts. The increase in corporate debt — often spurred by cheap financing to fund acquisitions or shareholder-friendly measures such as stock buybacks and dividend increases — has led to a deterioration in the health of US companies. The debt burden of US high grade companies has now climbed to 2.62 times trailing 12-month earnings — the highest level since 2002, according to BofA.Even when excluding sectors rattled by the fall in commodity prices, and adjusting for climbing cash levels, leverage has touched the highest point since 2008 when the financial crisis roiled markets.Moody’s and S&P warn that defaults are likely to increase in the coming years as interest rates rise, a concern echoed by bond funds such as Pimco. Analysts with S&P expect defaults among junk-rated US companies to hit 2.9 per cent by June 2016, nearly twice the rate in 2013. Moody’s list of companies rated B3 with a negative outlook or lower — its lowest rating rungs in the “speculative” space — eclipsed 200 for the first time since 2010 in July“Credit quality has been deteriorating by and large over the last three years,” says Bill Wolfe, an analyst at Moody’s. “Speculative grade companies, they’ve taken advantage of very buoyant market conditions over the last few years. The number of weakly rated companies we rate is much greater than it used to be.”Given the oil price crash the list is naturally dominated by the energy companies — including Goodrich Petroleum, Midstates Petroleum Company, and SandRidge Energy. But they are joined by well-known US companies such as Weight Watchers, Toys R Us, Sears, and Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker.Investor focus has centred on energy and materials groups that have struggled with a drop in commodity prices and higher borrowing costs. “Sectors like drillers, metals [and] mining can continue to remain under pressure given weaker growth in emerging markets, particularly China,” says Mohit Mittal, a fund manager at Pimco.While most strategists and investors still take a relatively sanguine view on the overall corporate debt market — expecting the rise in defaults to remain well below the rate seen during the financial crisis — the ability for companies to issue new debt has been flagged as a concern.“There’s reason to believe that primary markets on the debt side become less robust once the Fed starts hiking rates, both in terms of the size of deals that can reasonably be priced in markets and also the kind of interest rates companies will have to pay on that debt,” Mr Mikkelsen says.But not all companies will be affected equally, with indebted energy companies likely to be the biggest victims. Eric Gross, a strategist with Barclays, points out that the concern for lowly rated energy companies is not if they pay 7 per cent or 9 per cent interest rates, but whether “they can get financing at all”.For the vast majority of solid investment grade companies, the ability to tap debt markets as rates rise has not come into question. Investors have instead wondered what the impact will be on buyback and dividend policies, as well as what obstacles mergers and acquisitions activity will face — important bulwarks for frothy US stock market valuations in recent years.Marc Zenner, a senior JPMorgan banker, says that higher rates should not be an issue for most companies, particularly if the US economy is improving and sales are healthy. “If rates rise because the economy is doing well and firms are bullish, you could see more buybacks because they’ll be generating more cash flow,” he predicts.Analysts say the pharmaceuticals and healthcare industry, which has been engaged in a wave of debt-fuelled dealmaking, could be one of the hardest hit sectors when rates rise.Fitch downgraded its outlook on the sector from stable to negative at the start of the year, though it did little to dampen investor appetite for chunky debt offerings.In March, Valeant raised $10bn to fund its purchase of Salix in one of the largest junk bond offerings on record, demonstrating significant investor demand.But Fitch warns that the relative ease with which companies can tap the debt markets has pushed up M&A valuations, and that the sector could be “exposed to rising rates, a more volatile business risk profile and elevated leverage, which could undermine credit quality”.Monica Erickson, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine, a bond fund management group, argues that increasing interest rates could spark more responsible behaviour from corporate treasurers who have grown comfortable with cheap and abundant funding.“It may be better off if rates are rising and companies behave a little better,” Ms Erickson said. “Maybe share buybacks and dividends will decrease, maybe M&A will decrease and perhaps we’ll see less debt issuance.”Additional reporting by David Crow.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplattThe way some people see it, higher interest rates will spell doom for the online marketplace lenders. The likes of Lending Club, Prosper and SoFi have grown rapidly in recent years, matching yield-hungry investors with borrowers unable, or unwilling, to obtain funds from traditional sources, writes Ben McLannahan.But once rates start to tick up, the argument goes, the marketplace lenders’ advantage will erode. Until now, they’ve had a clear run: offering net yields in the high single-digits, they’ve been an obvious choice for investors seeking income. But if rising rates make traditional assets more appealing, then institutional investors will start to shop around — especially if defaults begin to rise on the marketplace lenders’ relatively unseasoned portfolios. And if funding dries up, then the business dries up. At Lending Club, for example, 89 per cent of second-quarter income came from fees for originating and selling new loans.Rubbish, says Renaud Laplanche, chief executive of Lending Club, which owes most of its growth to consumers refinancing variable credit-card debt pegged to banks’ prime rates. If that prime rate rises, he says, then Lending Club’s rates will rise too. And it is silly to associate rising rates with higher defaults, he says. If anything, delinquencies should drop in a period of economic expansion.At SoFi, chief executive Mike Cagney accepts that if long-term bond yields rise to about 5 per cent, say, his core product — refinancing government-backed loans at 6 or 7 per cent — could be less appealing to investors. But such rates are a long way off. Until then, he says, there is plenty of scope to push into other products such as mortgages and personal loans. And more opportunities to develop partnerships like the one with Citizens, the Rhode Island-based bank, which has agreed to buy up to $700m of SoFi’s student loans.“They need assets like any other bank does,” he says. “They recognise we’re originating cheaper and faster than they can do on their own.”

I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday. Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia shed 1.9 per cent to $19.79.Additional reporting by Pan Yuk.

Revenues dropped 9 per cent to $10.25bn.Quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations of 89 cents a share and revenues of $10.4bn. Adjusting for one-time items, however, the company reported earnings of $1.06 a share, ahead of forecasts.“Costs fell in line with revenue due to rapid reductions in variable costs, improved execution and the acceleration of the company’s internal efficiency initiatives,” said Michael Lamotte, an analyst with Guggenheim.Schlumberger expects 2015 exploration and production spending to fall 15 per cent. The shares, which have declined 7 per cent in the past year, climbed 1 per cent to $92.86.Mattel shares gained nearly 6 per cent after it reported a drop in first-quarter net income and sales that on an adjusted basis were better than expected.The toymaker behind Barbie reported a loss of $58.2m, or 17 cents a share, on sales that declined 2 per cent to $922.7m. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast a loss of 9 cents a share, on sales of $900.5m. But, on an adjusted basis, the company, based in El Segundo, California, reported a loss of 8 cents a share, narrower than estimates for a 10 cent loss.American Express fell 4.4 per cent to $77.32, after it blamed the strong US dollar for a drop in first-quarter sales.The credit card issuer reported profits of $1.5bn, or $1.48 a share, on sales of $7.95bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.37 a share, on sales of $8.2bn.Amex said it had “felt the impact from ending our relationship with Costco Canada, which expired at year end”.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 10 per cent to $2.58 after it reported a wider first-quarter loss than expected against a challenging backdrop for personal computers.The chipmaker, based in Sunnyvale, California, reported a loss of $180m, or 23 cents a share, on sales that declined 26 per cent to $1.03bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for a loss of 9 cents a share, on sales of $1.05bn. Adjusting for one-time items, AMD reported a loss of 9 cents a share, wider than expectations for a 5 cent loss.Financials and consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest decliners on the blue-chip benchmark.The S&P 500 declined 1.1 per cent to 2,081.18, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent to 17,826.30 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 4,931.81.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
44;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;An unlikely tech hero: a modest 62-year-old who loves his garden;‘Wallingford inventor’ Norman Shaw merits his success, writes Jonathan Margolis;There is a law of technology, I find, that if something is going to be big, to become part of the global technology megafauna, it probably will not come from a start-up composed of older, British IT veterans.I often get approached by such outfits, anxious for coverage. Being no tech kid myself, I always hope I’ll be able to report on a winner.These older geezers always have impeccable IT credentials going back to the 1970s. Their product usually works. But compared with young, thrusting tech entrepreneurs they’re terrible at the fluffy stuff. The name, the design, the logo, the website, even the press release, are invariably awful. And accordingly, their products tend to fail or just bump along.There are bound to be exceptions to my law, but Norman Shaw, from Banbury way, was typecast when he came to see me three years ago bearing his excellent, though not wonderfully presented, computer security product, ExactTrak, best described by his local paper, the Oxford Mail, as “a Mission Impossible-style memory stick that self-destructs if stolen”.Unfortunately, the reporter characterised Norman, with his 35-year record in IT that included founding a successful Plc, as “a Wallingford inventor”, “inventor” being media code for “eccentric”. I suspect he would have added “pensioner” had 62-year-old Norman, with his shock of white hair, been older.I covered ExactTrak, and I gather that it now sells 3,000 to 5,000 £200-£250 units a year — creditable, but not keeping Silicon Valley awake at night. So when did Norman become an exception to my David-doesn’t-usually-slay-Goliath rule? Well, one Friday last month, actually.Norman called me on the Thursday. “I have news. We’re signing a contract tomorrow with AMD to embed ExactTrak in their new chips,” he said. I was on a bus and thought I had either misheard him, or one of us was losing the plot.“You mean AMD, as in the second biggest computer chipmaker in the world behind Intel?” I asked. ‘The very one,” he said.“This is remarkable, Norman. Isn’t it normally 26-year-olds with beards who pull off this sort of thing? You’re not exactly the Shoreditch hipster as I recall.”“Ha,” he said. “No, we’re not your young tech freaks. Apart from one, we’re all in our fifties and sixties. But we do love our technology.” He wasn’t even offended, as he should have been, by my line of questioning.Norman and his cronies’ ExactTrak remote destruct button being included in tens of millions of laptops would be extraordinary news. So after he signed the deal at his Leicester factory, I asked if I could come and find out more about him and his five-strong team, all of whom work from home.Norman and his teacher wife Brenda live in a Warwickshire bungalow. His study overlooks the site of the 1642 Battle of Edge Hill. Charles I’s cavalry used his paddock as a holding area. Before IT, Norman read chemistry at Oxford university, was a photographer and a milkman. He is very much the hobbies man now: ham radio, stained glass, gardening.“We already have plenty to keep us busy,” he said, pointing out his new project — raised flower beds — as we drove off to the pub for lunch. There he explained how the AMD deal will change everything. ExactTrak looks like expanding to 25 people, getting an office, travelling the world — with turnover increasing from £400,000 to a projected £20m over the next couple of years.Lunch was splendid. The AMD coup is amazing. Norman deserves an OBE. As does the technical brains behind the products, John Pragnell, ex-Ericsson and also in his sixties. Only in the pub car park did Norman mention that he had done a deal with a global defence contractor, also for a computer security product. Very hush-hush.Later, back in London, I spoke to Roy Taylor, AMD’s vice-president for alliances, in Austin, Texas. He confirmed that yes, ExactTrak is a little smaller than AMD’s usual partners — the likes of Microsoft and Google — but that he had been deeply impressed in England by Norman and his team’s commitment. “But aren’t they, well, a lot older than most of the guys you work with?” I asked.“It honestly doesn’t occur to us that way,” said Mr Taylor, “but I have to say of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of AMD partners, Norman is the only older gentleman I deal with. The only one.”@TheFutureCritic
45;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2014-12-29T13:09:28Z;Safeguard eyesight by taking care over use of LED light;Vitamins and special lenses can help protect our sight;Technology can be a mixed blessing. I recall how some of my colleagues in journalism enthused about giving up typewriters for truly portable computers in the 1980s, only to suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome a decade later.Similar unforeseen consequences may follow the adoption of light-emitting diode (LED) technology in everything from ordinary lightbulbs to computers, tablets and smartphones.Just one example of this is a study released this month showing use of tablets, ereaders and phones with LED screens at night can cause some people to have insomnia.More worrying in the long term, however, is the increasing evidence that LED light could cause some people exposed over a long period of time to suffer age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the western world. While still preliminary, the research is cause for concern.Here’s why. Previous studies have found that macular degeneration was associated with long-term exposure to bright sunshine. It is not the full spectrum of light that causes the problem, but the blue light component of daylight.According to Ron Adelman, a professor of ophthalmology at the Yale University School of Medicine, macular degeneration is more prevalent among people who live in the northern regions of the world.For those of us who spend most of our time indoors, this was less of a problem than for farmers and fishermen because incandescent light was not particularly strong in the blue light spectrum. But technology has changed that.It is now estimated that in European countries, incandescent lightbulbs will have been completely replaced by LED and fluorescent bulbs by 2016. According to Essilor, the French optical company, light from compact fluorescent bulbs contains 26 per cent blue light, while LED bulbs emit at least 35 per cent blue light.An important study from Spain found that LED light could cause death of ocular tissues in Petri dishes after several bouts of 12-hour exposure. Celia Sánchez-Ramos, the researcher at Universidad Complutense de Madrid who led the study, told me that computers, tablets and smartphones that have LED screens are probably worse for our eyes than LED lightbulbs because we look directly at them for extended periods.Dr Sánchez-Ramos acknowledges that it may take another 10-15 years for research to demonstrate conclusively that LED light causes macular degeneration in the same way that sunlight does.We are not likely to give up LED devices anytime soon. But there are a couple of measures we can take now that might help safeguard our eyes.Dr Adelman recommends taking a supplement that contains vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, lutein and zeaxanthin. People taking this formulation, which is available in many countries as premixed eye vitamins, were found to be 25 per cent less likely to develop advanced AMD than those who did not.The other step is to wear eyeglasses with lenses, such as Essilor’s Crizal Prevencia, which filter out the harmful blue rays emitted by LED sources.It is important not to block all blue light, however, because that could disrupt your body’s daily rhythms.fitexecutive@ft.com

Airlines reacted swiftly to the news, with US and European carriers rerouting traffic away from the country.“At this time, it is important we are very clear: safety is the top priority. No airline will risk the safety of their passengers, crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings,” Tony Tyler, chairman of the International Air Transport Association, said.The Bloomberg world airlines index climbed 0.7 per cent, following a 2 per cent decline on Thursday. The index was led by US airlines, which operate fewer routes over continental Europe than international peers including Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa.Delta shares rose 2 per cent to $37.18, American Airlines climbed 3 per cent to $42.92 and United Continental advanced 2 per cent to $44.25.AMD, the chipmaker that was once valued at $20bn, plunged on Friday after forecasting third quarter sales short of analyst expectations.The company said it expected revenues to rise 2 per cent from the preceding quarter, plus or minus 2 to 3 per cent. The view equates to net revenues between $1.43bn and $1.51bn.AMD has been at work repositioning itself away from its core desktop PC market, after years of declining demand from businesses and consumers.“While management has executed well to some key milestones, the structural headwinds continue to dominate the company’s fate,” John Pitzer, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said.Shares slumped 16 per cent to $3.83, reducing its market capitalisation below $3bn.Google shares climbed 4 per cent to $595.08 after the company said revenues, excluding sales handed on to partners, exceeded Wall Street forecasts.The company behind the namesake search engine generated revenues of $12.7bn in the three months to the end of June, topping forecasts of $12.3bn. Profits rose to $3.4bn in the quarter, up from $3.2bn a year earlier.Google is grappling with how to lift advertising rates as more consumers read ads on mobile devices, which historically command lower rates than desktop adverts.Although the average price for an ad slipped 6 per cent from a year earlier, that topped predictions of a 7 per cent decline. Total clicks on the ads it served rose 25 per cent last quarter, matching analyst forecasts.“We believe Google continues to gain share both in Search and Display, fuelled by its own sites, which is impressive considering its leading position in both segments,” Youssef Squali, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said.American manufacturer Honeywell lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast as demand increases across its businesses.As a result, the company expects earnings per share for the full-year to be between $5.45 and $5.55, compared to earlier guidance as low as $5.40 per share.Chief executive Dave Cote said positive trends were emerging for the manufacturer with “growing robust backlogs supported by favourable macro trends and strong win rates”.Shares of Honeywell rose 2 per cent to $96.82.VF Corp, the owner of The North Face and Timberland brands, was under pressure following weaker than expected earnings guidance.The company, which topped second quarter forecasts, said it expected to earn $3.06 per share for the full year, three cents below Wall Street consensus.Citi analysts noted store checks indicated the company was making progress diversifying its business away from brands focused on winter apparel, which would boost first-half results.VF shares fell 1 per cent on the news to $60.95.Overall, US equity markets rebounded after a jolt of volatility on Thursday tempered investor enthusiasm and sent Treasury yields sharply lower.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,978.22 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7 per cent to 17,100.18.

Profits of $513m, or $1.64 a share, topped Wall Street expectations by more than a dime.“We’re seeing the results of our investments in network capacity and technology enhance our ability to offer superior service to all of our customers,” chief executive Wick Moorman said.Shares in Apple rose 0.44 per cent to $551.51 after billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn took to Twitter on Wednesday to attack the company’s board for a “great disservice” in not increasing the company’s share buyback programme.Since starting to buy Apple shares in August, Mr Icahn, a veteran activist investor, has been urging chief executive Tim Cook to lift the size of the share buyback programme. Mr Icahn said his investment in the iPhone maker topped $3bn on Tuesday, after purchasing $500m worth of shares over the past two weeks.In December, Mr Icahn scaled back his demand that Apple return $150bn after finding little support among fellow shareholders, people familiar with the matter said.The Silicon Valley company has been under pressure to return more of its cash pile to investors since Apple shares began falling from a record high in September 2012.Entry-level handbag maker Coach continued to face pressure from rival Michael Kors, with shares falling almost 6 per cent to $49.41 after reporting a 6 per cent decline in overall sales in its fiscal second quarter, which includes the important holiday selling period.Same store sales in North America dropped 13.6 per cent in the three months to December 28, worse than the 6.8 per cent decline expected by Wall Street analysts.Chief executive Victor Luis blamed lower traffic in its stores for the declines. For the quarter, profits at Coach dropped to $297m, or $1.06 a share, from $353m, or $1.23, a year earlier.Investors sold off positions in US chipmaker AMD after the company forecast sales would slow at a steeper rate than analysts expected, after market close on Tuesday.AMD said it expected sales would fall 16 per cent, plus or minus 3 per cent, in the current quarter. Sales of the company’s chips used in PCs, once its largest business, declined 13 per cent from a year earlier to $722m, while overall sales rose 37 per cent to $1.59bn.“AMD quarterly calls never seem to be without controversy,” Citi analyst David Phipps said. “The [fourth quarter] results were ahead of expectations for sales and ebitda, but the sales guidance was below consensus by about 3 per cent.”The company has faced similar pressures as rival Intel, as consumer buying habits shift away from traditional laptops and PCs to tablets and smartphones.Shares in AMD ended 12.23 per cent lower at $3.66.International Business Machines fell 3.21 per cent to close at $182.39.The company, which is grappling with a slowdown in some of its once fast-growing emerging markets, said fourth-quarter profits fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $16.5bn. Revenues dropped 5 per cent to $27.7bn, missing Wall Street forecasts.Analysts at JPMorgan, Sanford Bernstein and Barclays lowered their price targets on the company following its results on Tuesday after markets closed.“We recommend that investors take profits in the stock after the disappointing earnings results and outlook,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz said. “Given the string of eight quarters of mixed performances, we think the IBM model is not nimble enough to jump-start the revenue and growth profiles.”US markets ended the day relatively unchanged, with the S&P 500 edging up 0.06 per cent to 1,844.85. The Dow declined 0.25 per cent to 16,373.34 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.41 per cent to finish at 4,243.00.

He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted on each of the six securities fraud charges. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.“He reaped the benefit of insider information obtained by Raj, and he planned to reciprocate by cultivating his own source of inside information,” alleged George Venizelos, an assistant director at the FBI in New York. “Now Rengan’s career arc has descended to the same place his brother’s did less than four years ago.”The criminal and civil charges come as the US Attorney’s office in Manhattan, the FBI and the SEC are wrapping up Galleon-related investigations before the five-year statute of limitations for securities fraud expires.Mr Rajaratnam, a graduate of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, was an analyst with SAC Capital for about a year before he left in 2004 to co-launch Sedna Capital, where his trading attracted scrutiny by SEC investigators. He closed Sedna in 2008 to join Galleon.The younger Rajaratnam, 42, surfaced in wiretapped phone conversations during his older brother’s 2011 trial. Raj Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence.While at Galleon, prosecutors alleged, Rengan Rajaratnam bought shares of Clearwire after he received a tip from his brother that Intel’s board had approved a $1bn investment in the company.On another occasion, prosecutors allege, he bought 250,000 shares of AMD after Raj told him: “AMD had a handshake with the …Arabs” who were to invest $6bn in the drive maker.“All right, thanks a lot man. I appreciate it,” Rengan Rajaratnam said, according to a wiretap transcript.Rengan Rajaratnam also allegedly sought to cultivate a former business school classmate working for McKinsey as a source of inside information.

Shares rallied in after-hours trading and rose again on Wednesday, closing up 4.4 per cent to $204.72.Better than expected results from both companies, as well as gains in Apple, scheduled to report results after market close, lifted the S&P 500 information technology sector, which was up more than 1 per cent by midday, even though broader markets were mixed.Apple shares closed 1.9 per cent higher at $514.17 ahead of the most anticipated earnings release.After the market close, the iPhone and iPad maker announced $13.81 in earnings per share, slightly above estimates, however it missed expectations on revenues due to lower iPhone sales. The stock lost more than 5 per cent in extended trading following the announcement.The benchmark S&P 500 dipped in and out of negative territory, however, the index finished the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,494.78, hitting a fresh five-year high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent higher at 13,779.17. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 3,153.67.A research note from Bespoke Investment Group said more than three quarters of stocks on the S&P 500 index were overbought – trading above their 50-day moving average. The research says such overconfidence often leads to a sharp drop weeks and months after.“Markets are waiting for more substantive news from the Congress on the fate of the debt ceiling,” said Jeremy Zirin, chief equities strategist at UBS Wealth Management.Commenting on the technology sector he struck an optimistic tone: “Valuations are at a two decade low and trading at an 8 per cent discount to the benchmark. Among the S&P 500 sectors, we expect the tech sector to have the strongest returns in 2013.”Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds, while optimistic about equities in general, cautions that national equity markets are misleading.“Investors should look at companies not from the point of view of the geography of their headquarters but their operations – where their revenues are coming from and where are their largest costs.”“While we see a broad-based rally, as fundamentals and the global economy improve, we will see that markets will get selective,” he added.In earnings news, McDonald’s shares were higher after the world’s largest fast-food chain restaurant by sales modestly beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations.The company struggled in 2012 with disappointing sales and declining profits during the global slowdown and competition from the likes of Yum Brands and Wendy’s. Its share price lost 12.1 per cent last year, making it among the worst hit Dow components.On Wednesday, McDonald’s shares added 0.6 per cent to $93.48.General Dynamics shares fell after the defence contractor reported an annual loss following an impairment charge in the fourth quarter due to a decline in government spending in the US and overseas.

50;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-12-11T23:22:12Z;Intel fights Arm in data centres with new Atom;;Intel has launched its first Atom processor for data centres, defending its high-margin server business from oncoming attacks by cheaper, low-powered chips based on designs of the UK’s Arm.The Atom S1200 (pictured) product family, formerly codenamed Centerton, consumes just 6 watts of power, compared to the 45 watts drawn by Intel’s high-performance Xeon processors that are traditionally used in data centres.Rather than cannibalising sales of Xeon chips, Intel argued at a San Francisco press conference that “microservers” densely packed with the smaller Atom processors would perform different functions.A Xeon-based server would be best suited to performing fast web transactions, for example, while an Atom one would suit a web hosting service packing in the sites of hundreds of less-demanding small businesses.Hewlett-Packard and Dell have announced plans to develop Arm-based microservers, using processors from Calxeda and Marvell respectively.But HP said on Tuesday it would also be shipping servers using the new Atom processor in the next quarter.Intel’s new chips have several advantages over the existing Arm alternatives. They support 64-bit instructions – Arm supports only 32 bits currently – making them compatible with all existing server applications and tools.They also allow virtualisation technologies, the reliability feature of Error-Correcting Code (ECC) and compatibility with x86 software used for years in data centres on servers powered by Intel and AMD processors.“In contrast, today Arm is itself deeply fragmented, with numerous vendors developing what they claim will eventually be world- and market-beating data-centre silicon,” said Charles King, semiconductor analyst with Pund-IT, in a note.This would make it painful for developers if they are forced to rewrite code and driver software for multiple platforms, he said.Intel also showed a road map that would see processors codenamed Avoton, featuring smaller 22-nanometre circuit widths, launching in 2013, with 14nm chips appearing from 2014 onwards, well ahead of the competition.The Atom S1200 dual-core processor is shipping from Tuesday at a price of $54 in quantities of 1,000 or more. Intel said more than 20 microservers, storage and networking systems using the processor would be appearing shortly, from companies including Dell, HP, Huawei, Quanta and Supermicro.

Barry Knapp, chief equity strategist at Barclays, said: “With a polarised federal government, we do not see an increased probability of avoiding the tax cliff, brinkmanship over the debt ceiling or enacting pro-growth tax and entitlement reform in 2013.”Shares in Jefferies jumped 14 per cent to $16.27 after US financial holding group Leucadia National said it would buy the midsized US investment bank in a deal that valued it at $3.6bn. Leucadia shares fell 3 per cent to $21.14.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year and comes a week after Stifel Financial, a rival investment bank to Jefferies, said it would buy boutique financial specialist KBW for $575m. Shares in Stifel gained 0.2 per cent to $30.37.Apple shares were 0.7 per cent lower at $542.83 as the iPad and iPhone maker tried to recover after falling into bear territory, down more than 20 per cent in recent weeks. The S&P 500 information technology sector lost 0.4 per cent.Retailer Target Corp fell 0.1 per cent to $61.98 as it followed Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by revenues, in saying that it would open its Black Friday discounting sales earlier than normal this year. Walmart shares rose 0.2 per cent to $72.48.JC Penney dropped 12.9 per cent to $17.97 as the US department store chain continued to struggle after it posted disappointing quarterly results last week.In a report released yesterday, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said JC Penney was the second-most heavily shorted company on the S&P 500. More than 40 per cent of the company’s publicly traded equity is held by investors who are betting on a decline in its share the price, the analysts said.Ebay shares were 0.5 per cent lower at $47.47 as the online marketplace company said it would partner with Xiu.com, a Chinese online fashion and luxury retailer, to launch a local shopping website in China.New York Times lost 2.5 per cent to $8.20 as its new chief executive, Mark Thompson, took up his post at the newspaper publishing company amid ongoing controversy at the BBC, where he was former director-general.
52;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-10-28T22:20:49Z;AMD eyes switch to low-power Arm chips;;Struggling chipmaker AMD will try to step out of the long shadow cast by arch-rival Intel on Monday as it announces plans for its first server chips made with the low-power designs of UK-based Arm Holdings.The announcement also signals a broader push by Arm to invade the internet-connected datacentres that have proliferated with the spread of “cloud” computing. In the process, it will widen a battle with Intel that already takes in tablets and, with the arrival last week of Microsoft’s Windows 8, some types of PCs.According to people familiar with its plans, AMD will make the announcement at an event in San Francisco on Monday. The company declined to comment.Arm-based chips are used in most smartphones and tablets, thanks to lower power consumption than rival processors based on the so-called x86 architecture employed by Intel and AMD. Using them more extensively in servers as well could hold down power costs for internet companies as more computing is concentrated in centralised datacentres, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight64.AMD has long struggled to keep up with Intel in the PC business, which accounts for three quarters of its revenues. This month it reported a 10 per cent year-on-year fall in its revenues for the latest quarter and forecast another 9 per cent decline in the final months of the year, while Intel is holding its revenues generally flat.Branching out into Arm processors would give it a clear technology differentiation from Intel for the first time, according to industry analysts.“This will position AMD as the only company that can do x86 and ARM,” said one person familiar with its plans.However, the diversification will not bring short-term relief for AMD, which recently said it would cut 15 per cent of its workforce to try to staunch the red ink from its current slump. While it is set to announce an Arm-based processor this week, servers containing the chips are unlikely to reach the market until 2014, two people said.Though a small number of servers already use Arm chips, the technology has not been widely adopted because the chips can access only small amounts of computer memory, greatly limiting the complexity of tasks they can handle, said Mr Brookwood. With the next generation of Arm designs, using the same 64-bit technology that Intel’s chip architecture moved to some years ago, memory will no longer be a limiting factor, he added.
53;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-10-19T00:17:52Z;AMD to cut 15% of staff as sales fall;;Advanced Micro Devices will cut 15 per cent of its workforce as it struggles to cope with falling demand for PCs, a tougher economy and the growth of tablet devices.The world’s second-largest maker of PC microprocessors had issued a revenue warning last week, saying sales would fall by about 10 per cent compared to the second quarter due to “weaker-than-expected demand across all product lines”.The Silicon Valley company has been slower to respond to the challenge from smartphones and tablets than its bigger rival Intel, which itself reported a 5 per cent year-on-year decline in quarterly revenues on Tuesday due to slowing demand for its chips.AMD will cut nearly 1,700 jobs from its workforce of about 11,000 to achieve annualised cost savings of about $190m.The move is part of a restructuring plan aimed at lowering AMD’s expenses by 25 per cent compared to those in the second quarter.“These are difficult, but necessary steps to ensure our plan has the right scale and scope to address the market and competitive challenges we face,” said Rory Read, chief executive.“[The company has to] diversify beyond the traditional PC market and become a leader in fast-growing and adjacent markets where we can differentiate and lead,” Mr Read said.It plans to expand in tablet, server and industrial embedded chip markets.AMD said it aimed to break even operationally in the third quarter of next year with $1.3bn in quarterly revenues.
54;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Wall St endures worst week since June;;Wall Street stocks recorded their worst week in four-and-a-half months, despite robust quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, two of the largest banking institutions in the US.The two banks reported strong earnings growth for the three-month period to the end of September on Friday, rounding out a mixed start to the quarterly results season.Financial sector stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 have led US equities higher in 2012, having gained 21.4 per cent since the start of the year. But the sector, which is the best performing subgroup on index, retreated 1.7 per cent on the week.JPMorgan Chase lost 0.2 per cent to $41.62 this week, seeing little by way of advances when it said net income rose 34 per cent to $5.7bn for the quarter, compared with the same time a year ago.The bank’s results, which handily beat market expectations, were bolstered by gains in its mortgage business that benefited from stimulus measures taken by the Federal Reserve in September to aid the lagging US economy.Shares in the company, which has been trying to defend its risk management practices after suffering a $5.8bn trading loss in April, have risen 25.2 per cent since the start of the year.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said the results, in particular the gains from mortgage activity, would be likely to reverberate across the broader banking sector. “All in, we think it’s a good quarter for JPMorgan Chase, and other banks should see some of the same benefits,” he said.Reporting shortly after JPMorgan Chase on Friday, Wells Fargo said its quarterly net income rose 22 per cent to $4.9bn, compared with a year ago. The bank, which is the biggest home loan lender in the US, saw a strong pick-up in mortgage refinancing. But the results failed to carry through to its shares, which fell 4.4 per cent to $34.25 on the week.Energy sector stocks declined for the week but one segment that defied the gloom was coal companies, two of which registered among the week’s top performing equities. Coal miner Peabody Energy rose 14.9 per cent to $25.71, while Consol Energy gained 12.1 per cent to $35.14, as natural gas prices continued to rise to multi-week highs. Companies that burn coal for energy often substitute the commodity with natural gas when gas prices are low.Overall, US equities suffered their worst week since the start of June as global growth worries coupled with mixed company results dragged down stocks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to 1,428.59 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 13,328.85.Alcoa, the aluminium company, highlighted the concerns with the global economy as it kicked off the third-quarter reporting season on Tuesday. The company cuts its forecast for global aluminium demand by 1 percentage point, noting the pronounced slowdown in Chinese industrial activity. Shares in Alcoa declined 4.4 per cent to $8.69 on the week.Positive labour market data on Thursday showed weekly jobless claims fell to a four-year low. Meanwhile, a US consumer survey said optimism about an economic recovery was at its highest level in five years.The week also saw two large public offerings record strong gains in their first days of trading. Realogy, a real estate franchise holding company, rose 20 per cent to $33.60 after it raised $1.1bn and listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Workday, an HR software provider, gained 73.9 per cent to $48.69 as it raised $637m and listed its shares on Friday.The Nasdaq Composite index lost 2.9 per cent to 3,044.11 as chipmakers on the tech heavy index continued to come under pressure. Echoing a warning from Intel that its third-quarter revenues would be below earlier guidance last month, Advanced Micro Devices said its sales would fall short due to weaker demand. Shares in the world’s second largest PC processor maker fell 14.9 per cent to $2.74. Intel shares lost 5.3 per cent on the week. Analysts at Credit Suisse said that AMD’s sales warning did not necessarily imply that Intel would miss its revised estimates when it reported later in the period.The S&P 500 information technology sector lost 2.9 per cent on the week. Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, lost 3.5 per cent to $629.71 to drag down the tech sector.Shares in Sprint Nextel, the US wireless operator, gained 10.2 per cent to $5.73 as reports confirmed that SoftBank, a Japanese telecoms group, was in talks to purchase a controlling stake in the company.
55;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-10-11T21:38:30Z;AMD warns of bigger sales drop;;Advanced Micro Devices, the world’s second-largest PC processor maker, has issued a revenue warning, blaming “weaker-than-expected demand across all product lines caused by the challenging macroeconomic environment”.A week ahead of its third-quarter earnings report, AMD said revenues would fall around 10 per cent compared to the second quarter. It had previously predicted a fall of around 1 per cent.Its bigger rival Intel also issued a third-quarter revenue warning last month. The Silicon Valley neighbour, whose microprocessors feature in four out of every five PCs sold, said chip sales would probably be more than $1bn less than previously forecast. It also cited “weaker-than-expected demand in a challenging macroeconomic environment”.Research firms Gartner and IDC reported on Wednesday that PC unit shipments slipped more than 8 per cent in the third quarter.As well as economic conditions, they blamed inventory clear-outs ahead of the launch of Windows 8 this month, uncertainty about demand for the new operating system, the high prices of thin-and-light “Ultrabook” laptops and consumers preferring to buy smartphones and tablets.AMD also reduced its gross margin forecast to 31 per cent from 44 per cent. It said this was primarily due to an inventory writedown of around $100m “due to lower anticipated future demand for certain products”.AMD shares fell 9.1 per cent on the news in after-hours trading in New York to $2.91. They had already fallen 40 per cent this year. Intel shares hit a 52-week-low on Thursday before closing down 0.4 per cent at $21.68.
56;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;AMD – abandon chip?;Departure of FD adds to woes of group facing huge structural challenges;You cannot blame Thomas Seifert for thinking there might be better opportunities for him outside of Advanced Micro Devices. It is hard to think of a company that faces greater structural challenges than AMD, which Mr Seifert served as chief financial officer and, briefly, as interim chief executive. The announcement of his departure still spooked investors, sending the shares down a tenth on Tuesday.AMD, to oversimplify only slightly, is a company without a niche. It competes primarily in microprocessors for PCs, where it is in second place after Intel, which has well over 80 per cent of the market. Five years ago, the conventional wisdom held, with some reason, that Intel needed AMD to have a certain degree of success so that Intel would not attract the ire of regulators and customers by becoming a pseudo-monopolist. The conventional wisdom now holds that the PC, if not dead, is on its way to being a secondary or tertiary computing medium, after the smartphone and the tablet.As such, Intel has all manner of competitors in making microprocessors, such as mobile specialists Qualcomm and Broadcom. Many use Arm Holdings’ architecture. Arm-based chips may soon appear in mass-market PCs and servers, upsetting Intel’s core businesses. AMD cannot depend on being the default alternative to Intel for much longer.AMD has tried to make room for itself by specialising in specific areas such as graphics processing chips and low-power products. But it is tough to beat Intel, even when you pick your battles: for example, Intel has gained share in CPUs with integrated graphics capacity in both of the past two quarters, according to Deutsche Bank. Is this surprising, when Intel outspends AMD on research and development by seven to one? The reaction to Mr Seifert’s departure looks overdone but – especially given that AMD’s valuation is not at a discount to Intel’s – it looks like worries about AMD’s dwindling strategic options have if anything been underplayed.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

But shares in the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues recorded gains on Tuesday, edging 0.3 per cent higher to $23.37. The shares have fallen just 3.6 per cent since the start of the year.Apple shares, meanwhile, continued their rise and crossed the $700 mark for the first time during market hours.Customers are expecting to receive the company’s latest smartphone, the iPhone5, this week.

Citigroup shares declined 0.4 per cent to $33.94 and Morgan Stanley fell 1 per cent to $17.63.The S&P 500 appeared to have lost some of the momentum that helped it reach multiyear highs last week after the Federal Reserve said it would extend its market intervention to stimulate the US economy.The benchmark index has fallen 0.4 per cent for the week.FedEx shares dropped in spite of reporting better than expected quarterly results as the package delivery company warned that a global slowdown would hurt its business.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $86.55 as the company said it was cutting its full-year outlook after beating analyst expectations for net income in the first quarter.FedEx blamed global economic weakness for a shift in customer preferences to cheaper sources for shipments of goods.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 13,564.64.Boeing rose 0.8 per cent to $70.45 as analysts at Credit Suisse said they believed the consensus forecasts for its 2013 sales were too high.“We think orders will slow as [year-on-year] comparables are tough, most airlines are already in the book and we will not see a new product soon enough to spur activity,” they said.Dole Food Company rose as much as 6.6 per cent as the fruit producer and distributor said it would sell part of its business to Japan’s Itochu.But the announcement of the sale, with funds expected to be used to help the company reduce its debt and lower its costs, failed to keep its share price higher for much longer than the morning session.Dole shares had retreated from their earlier highs, finishing 0.7 per cent higher at $13.80.Walgreen shares declined 0.1 per cent to $35.66, in spite of the pharmacy chain’s announcement that it expected to realise about $1bn in synergies by 2016 from its recently acquired stake in Alliance Boots.Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond dropped 3.4 per cent to $68.39 as it was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Oppenheimer.DirecTV, the satellite television operator, declined 1.4 per cent to $53.44 as a Bloomberg report said it was among several companies considering a bid for GVT, a Brazilian phone operator.
58;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Pulte climbed 6 per cent to $15.55.Rivals KB Home and Lennar Corp also rose, up 4.3 per cent to $12.77 and 4.3 per cent to $34.52, respectively.The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding index rose 3.8 per cent and has gained more than 80 per cent since the beginning of the year.Wider markets managed to hang on to gains and closed higher as investors welcomed news that Germany’s constitutional court deemed the European Stability Mechanism legal.Investors will also be watching for any clues of further quantitative easing measures when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy setting meeting on Thursday.“Markets have reacted well to the news coming out of Europe,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi.Mr Levkovich also said disappointing jobs numbers last Friday increased the probability that the Fed will initiate some kind of bond-buying programme.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential, pointed out that the markets were already at multiyear highs as investors pushed prices up because central bankers round the world were willing to step in to inject liquidity.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,436.56, hovering near its highest levels since the beginning of 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged at 13,333.35 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.3 per cent to 3,114.31.Seven of the 10 biggest S&P sectors were in positive territory, led by telecommunications, industrials and financials stocks.Financials extended their gains from the previous session. Citigroup shares added 1.3 per cent to $33.08.Goldman Sachs shares rose 1.3 per cent to $118.24 and JPMorgan climbed 0.8 per cent to $39.92. However, Bank of America lost 0.7 per cent higher to $8.97.In the technology sector, all eyes were on Apple, which unveiled its next generation iPhone 5.The most heavily weighted stock in the benchmark index, accounting for 4.7 per cent of the S&P 500 market capitalisation, traded between positive and negative territory before and after the unveiling. However, it recovered to close 1.4 per cent higher at $669.79 in heavy trading volumes.The stock, which had a 70 per cent correlation with the S&P 500 index in January, hovers near 40 per cent now, according to Birinyi Associates, indicating the likelihood of influencing the broader market has fallen substantially.“We believe Apple’s valuation is attractive and that shares can continue to benefit from strong iPad and iPhone demand, Mac share gains, international expansion and new innovations,” wrote analysts at Barclays.“We believe Apple deserves a higher multiple versus the group given our view that it is the best growth story in IT hardware over the long term.”Facebook shares enjoyed a second day of solid gains in heavy trading volumes, rising 7.7 per cent to $20.93, its biggest one-day rise since the IPO, as investors welcomed chief executive’s Mark Zuckerberg’s comments about mobile advertising.Mr Zuckerberg admitted mistakes were made in choosing mobile ad platforms and said he was addressing them.S&P Capital IQ analysts reiterated their “buy” rating for the social network stock, citing Mr Zuckerberg’s comments from the TechCrunch Disrupt conference about mobile advertising as well as shareholder concerns.Advanced Micro Devices rose 3.7 per cent to $3.89. The stock enjoyed an 8.9 per cent jump during the previous session after unveiling an energy-efficient server platform.In deal news, Vulcan Materials, producer of construction materials, jumped 10.7 per cent to $46.46 after an analyst at Sterne Agee wrote that the rival Martin Marietta is “fairly likely” to renew its share bid for the company after the four months injunction expires on September 15. Martin Marietta shares added 3.3 per cent to $86.89.Dole jumped 9.5 per cent to $14.07 after the California-based fruit and vegetable company said it is in advanced talks to sell its packaged foods and Asia fresh businesses to Japanese trading company Itochu Corp.Bucking the trend in an energy sector that saw solid gains was Chesapeake Energy – its shares fell 1 per cent to $19.89 as the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US has continued selling assets worth a total of $6.9bn, including sales already announced.Among other big losers on Wall Street was Monster Beverage, the largest maker of energy drinks and fruit juices by sales volumes. Company shares fell 9.9 per cent to $50.78 after two US senators wrote to the FDA calling for greater regulation of the beverages.
60;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-09-07T16:49:02Z;Intel cuts forecast amid softer PC demand;;"Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, has issued a sales warning as consumers spend more on tablets and smartphones and the PC industry slows ahead of the release of Windows 8.The Silicon Valley company, whose microprocessors feature in four out of every five PCs sold, said chip sales would probably be more than $1bn less than forecast for the third quarter.Its shares fell more than 2 per cent, while those of rival chipmakers Nvidia and AMD dropped more than 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.PC makers have been running down inventories in a slow period for sales and with uncertainty over demand ahead of the release of Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system on October 26.Intel said: “Relative to the prior forecast, the company is seeing customers reducing inventory in the supply chain versus the normal growth in third-quarter inventory; softness in the enterprise PC market segment; and slowing emerging market demand.”Strength in the enterprise and emerging markets had helped Intel in recent quarters as consumers spent less on PCs and more on mobile devices such as the iPad and iPhone.However, PC shipments to China fell 4.5 per cent in the second quarter – their first ever year-on-year decline, according to a report last week from Gartner, the research group.The company said another area of strong demand, for server microprocessors used in data centres, was meeting expectations.But “weaker-than-expected demand in a challenging macroeconomic environment” meant revenues were anticipated to be $13.2bn, plus or minus $300m, compared to a previous forecast of $13.8bn to $14.8bn.Sumit Dhanda, analyst with the ISI research firm, said: “While Intel's pre-announcement itself was not wholly unexpected, the magnitude of the reduction in revenue guidance seems large.”Intel is expected to show off thin Ultrabook laptops with touchscreens and hybrid tablet/laptop convertibles at its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week. But these will only be introduced in the fourth quarter and PC makers are still struggling to bring costs down and make such devices affordable for mainstream consumers.The IHS iSuppli research firm predicted this week that an era of “Wintel” dominance was coming to an end due to the much faster-growing tablet and smartphone markets, where chips based on designs of the UK’s Arm and operating systems from Apple and Google held commanding leads.It forecast that Windows’ share of the PC, tablet and smartphone market would slip from 44 per cent in 2011 to 33 per cent in 2016, while Intel’s share would drop from 41 per cent to 29 per cent. However, it said the total size of the market would double over the five years.Intel has failed to make any serious inroads into the smartphone and tablet markets thus far and will face a challenge in laptops, with a version of Windows for PCs being released next month that will run on Arm-based chips for the first time.Intel reduced its third-quarter gross margin forecasts by one percentage point on Friday, from 63 per cent to 62 per cent.It said capital spending for the year was now expected to be below the low end of its previous forecast of $12.1bn to $12.9bn, with the company accelerating the reuse of existing equipment for its next “shrink” of microprocessors to circuits that will be 14 billionths of a metre wide."
61;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-08-09T21:17:03Z;Wall Street stocks edge higher;;News Corp shares touched their highest level in five years as investors took a $2.8bn writedown of the company’s newspaper business in their stride.After-market traders had sent the stock down more than three percentage points on Wednesday evening following the announcement.But the widely traded class A shares climbed as much as 1.4 per cent to $24.05 in early trading on Thursday. The stock retreated by market close but was down just 0.3 per cent to $23.82.Attention overnight had focused on the scale of the writedown in the publishing business, which is to be demerged from News Corp’s entertainment business.But some analysts remained upbeat. “[It is] worth noting the company still hit their 2012 full-year guidance and also delivered a robust guidance outlook for 2013,” Jason Bazinet at Citigroup told clients.Despite strong data showing an unexpected fall in unemployment insurance claimants and a narrowing trade deficit, broader markets were generally flat.The S&P 500 closed fractionally up at 1,402.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1 per cent to 13,165.19 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index went up 0.3 per cent to 3,018.64.E Trade Financial rose 6.9 per cent to $8.57 after the online share trading company announced the exit of its chief executive.E Trade has faced pressure from shareholders, including Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, to explore a sale as shares have fallen 30 per cent in the past year amid subdued US equity trading volumes. Michael Tarkan, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said the departure of Steven Freiberg, who will be temporarily replaced by chairman Frank Petrilli, would rekindle takeover talk.But Mr Tarkan warned: “A potential acquirer would also likely have to provide a sizeable capital infusion to mark the company’s loan portfolio to current market value”, potentially putting off suitors.Monster Beverage fell 9.7 per cent to $61.20 as second-quarter revenue and earnings missed analyst expectations and the energy drink company said its gross margin, a measure of profitability, was down on the same period last year.However, Mark Astrachan, at Stifel Nicolaus, maintained his “buy” recommendation, telling clients: “We believe [the slowdown in sales] is more a function of timing than materially slowing end-demand.”Windstream Corporation declined 7.5 per cent to $9.30 as the internet provider’s expenses rose sharply, more than offsetting higher revenues and pushing quarterly earnings down 2 per cent compared with the same period in 2011.Nomura analysts highlighted losses in the consumer business, which Mike McCormack said “could signal increasing competition, which may lead to aggressive pricing or higher capital spending”.Kohl’s shares dropped 1.2 per cent to $51.42 after the department store chain reported weaker than expected sales and a 20 per cent slide in net income. It also lowered guidance for the third quarter.Paul Lejuez, a retail sector analyst at Nomura, said: “Kohl’s strategy for the second half of 2012 is to bring in more inventory units as management is willing to sacrifice gross margins to take back market share.“But we think having more units in the store is a risky strategy that could result in more markdowns than planned.”Seagate Technology and Western Digital, makers of hard disc drives, made gains after Lazard Capital analysts initiated coverage on the sector with “buy” recommendations on both.The sector was hit hard last year when widespread flooding in Thailand disrupted supply chains, while the increasing popularity of solid state drives threaten to eat into sales.But Edward Parker at Lazard told clients that the sector’s two largest companies by market share could prosper as smaller rivals struggle. “Despite ongoing signs of weakening demand and the receding of peak margins, we believe consolidation and the aftermath of the floods in Thailand have changed the pricing dynamics of the industry.”Western Digital rose 2.8 per cent to $43.03 and Seagate 1.4 per cent to $33.09.Semiconductor stocks Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology fell 0.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent to $4.37 and $6.81 respectively. Rival Nvidia, which closed up 3.4 per cent to $14.71 on Thursday, jumped even higher in the after-hours market. Shares rose 5.4 per cent to $15.51 after the company beat second-quarter earnings expectations and reported record revenue growth from its smartphone and tablet technology.
62;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Yields on US junk-rated debt hit new lows;;Demand for US junk-rated debt has propelled yields towards new lows, as investors seeking returns in a low-interest rate environment have been attracted by a record number of deals so far this month.The Barclays High Yield index has dropped to 6.63 per cent, just 2 basis points shy of its all-time low of 6.61 per cent set in May 2011. So far this year, high-yield bonds have returned 9.9 per cent, on pace to more than double last year’s gain of 4.2 per cent.The prospect of further easing in September by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has boosted market sentiment, while last week’s US jobs report has soothed near-term worries about the economy.The $9.36bn of junk-rated deals sold so far this month represent a record pace for August, according to Dealogic data that goes back as far as 1995.“We are seeing some investors sell investment-grade debt and buy high-yield at a time of strong inflows into the market,” said Wesley Sparks, fund manager for global high-yield at Schroders. “Investors have a lot of cash and there is a lack of supply.”This is illustrated by a slew of new deals at the start of this week, including Constellation Brands, MarkWest Energy, Advanced Micro Devices and SandRidge Energy, trading higher in price and lower in yield after they were sold. New issues have strongly outperformed the broad market, providing investors with outsized returns.“High yield new issues have outperformed the US High Yield Index or the appropriate quality index by approximately 1.8 per cent year-to-date,” said Barclays.Further deals were due on Tuesday, led by Iron Mountain pricing $1bn of debt.But some doubt that the rally in junk can extend much further. Many companies are facing pressure on their margins and struggling to cut costs.“While the bid for high-quality yield is understandable in this environment, we question the extension of this reach into the economically and risk appetite-sensitive portions of the credit spectrum,” said Oleg Melentyev, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.With investment grade debt yielding an average of 2.8 per cent, investors are eyeing higher average yields of 5.25 per cent for double-B rated debt and 6.1 per cent for single-B rated companies.One missing part of the junk-bond rally has been companies with triple C ratings, or those in the highly speculative range and which yield about 10.1 per cent.“If the rally continues, we need to see investors stretch for the riskier part of the market, not remain focused on double-B rated companies,” Mr Sparks said.
63;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Intel warns on outlook for new orders;;"Intel warned of lower than expected revenues in the second half of the year as PC makers hold back from ordering its computer chips in the face of economic uncertainty and the October launch of Windows 8.The world’s largest chipmaker by revenues and a bellwether for the PC industry, predicted 2012 sales would rise around 4 per cent, down from its earlier expectations of high single-digit growth. Its forecast of $14.3bn in third-quarter sales was below Wall Street expectations of $14.6bn.Paul Otellini, chief executive, told an analyst conference call that a recovery expected in the US and western European markets, where there had been “softness” for several quarters, had failed to materialise.In the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, PC prices had been rising with the value of the dollar, while China’s economic growth had been slowing.“While we still see growth [in China], we don’t see quite as much as we first thought,” he said.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main microprocessor rival, warned last week that its second-quarter revenues would be down about 11 per cent on the first quarter, after previously predicting a 3 per cent rise. It blamed softer sales late in the quarter in China and Europe, along with a weaker consumer buying environment for PC makers.Intel said inventory levels for its microprocessors were healthy, but were being “managed below historical averages”.Mr Otellini said Windows 8 was not appearing until the fourth quarter and PC makers had moved to just-in-time ordering of Intel’s chips.He was upbeat about Ultrabooks – a thin and light laptop category promoted by Intel – although analysts view current prices of $800 and upwards as beyond the mainstream consumer.The chief executive said more than 140 models were in the pipeline based on its latest processor, with more than 40 touch-enabled and a dozen convertible into tablets. He was “very confident” there would be $700 systems in the market this autumn.The company is beginning to break into tablets and smartphones. It reported the launch of Intel-based smartphones in India, China and Europe during the quarter and said more than 20 Windows 8-based tablets would use its processors.Intel reported second-quarter revenues a shade lighter than expected at $13.5bn, blaming softness in its Nand Flash memory business. Profits of 54 cents a share topped Wall Street forecasts of 52 cents.The main strength was in its data centre group, where its ""Romley""-codenamed server chip helped sales grow 15 per cent year-on-year for the division. It also helped overall gross margins to increase to 63.4 per cent, up from 60.6 per cent a year earlier.Intel shares initially rose in after-hours trading in New York on the news before trading 1 per cent lower at $25.15."
64;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;US domestic stocks beat multinationals;;Shares in domestically focused US companies are outperforming those of multinationals on New York’s benchmark S&P 500 index by the most in a year.The divergence reflects fears among equity investors that the slowing global economy will impair the earnings of many S&P companies that rely on overseas sales, particularly given the dollar’s strong rally against the euro since March.In recent weeks a string of multinational companies have warned about lower second-quarter earnings, among them Advanced Micro Devices, Cummins and Procter & Gamble. The second-quarter earnings season is expected to show the weakest expansion of profits since the same quarter of 2009, while the dollar has gained nearly 9 per cent against the euro since the start of the second quarter.Within the S&P 500, 122 companies depend on overseas operations for more than half their sales and this basket of stocks has dropped 2.1 per cent in the past month, according to Bespoke Investment Group.By contrast, 121 companies in the S&P regarded as domestically based have gained 3.6 per cent in the past four weeks. Since the start of the year, such domestic stocks are up 8.7 per cent, while multinationals are in negative territory, down 0.1 per cent.“The spread between the two baskets has really widened in recent days to its highest levels in a year,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “It is still early in the earnings season, but as of now investors want nothing to do with multinationals ahead of their second quarter reports.”The weakening euro could hurt foreign earnings for US companies.“Companies with revenues in Europe saw their profits dented when they tried to convert their transactions into dollars,” said Quincy Krosby, financial market strategist at Prudential Financials.Moreover, the US economy is still growing at a much better rate than the eurozone, boosting the appeal of companies with a domestic focus. “There is still growth in the US, albeit anaemic, while the slowdown in Europe and China has lowered demand in those regions,” said Ms Krosby. “So, we have seen reallocation from mega caps to US-oriented companies.”Investors have sold shares in AMD and DuPont, for example, over the past two weeks on worries about lacklustre sales in Europe and China.AMD, the second-largest PC microprocessor maker in the world, slumped 11.2 per cent on Tuesday after the company warned that revenue was expected to drop 11 per cent for the second quarter. Shares in DuPont, the US chemical company, have declined 8.4 per cent over the last three months.Bespoke showed that the best performing domestic companies over the past 12 months included the US discount stores, such as Ross Store and Dollar Tree. The other group of forerunners were the homebuilders, such as Lennar Corp, D.R. Horton and PulteGroup as the recent positive housing data suggested the bottoming in this sector.Barclays analysts have cut estimates across a wide range of sectors exposed to global growth, including industrials and technology.“Equities are likely to respond poorly,” said Barry Knapp, a US equity strategist at Barclays. “Although the declines to the second- quarter earnings are clear, we think the fallout from Europe [with its] impact on US growth have yet to be felt.”
65;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Global slowdown fears weigh on Wall St;;Advanced Micro Devices shares tumbled after the company warned that its revenue for the second quarter was expected to drop 11 per cent.The second-largest PC microprocessor maker in the world sank 11.2 per cent to $4.99. AMD, which issued the warning late on Monday, blamed the lacklustre sales in China and Europe for weaker-than-expected quarterly results.It is due to report its second-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.James Covello, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: “The fact that AMD missed its guidance is not surprising to us given several weak PC sales data points.”Goldman Sachs maintained its “sell” rating for AMD with a 12-month target price of $5.50, cut from $6.25. Nomura also reduced its target price from $8 to $6.In another note to its clients, JPMorgan said the stock will remain under pressure given weak PC demand, AMD’s low market share and Intel’s “superior products”. The investment bank lowered its earnings per share estimates for the company to 50 cents from 76 cents for this year.Intel, the close rival of AMD, traded 2.3 per cent lower at $25.56.The world’s biggest chipmaker announced on Monday a $4.1bn investment in Dutch semiconductor equipment-maker ASML as a move to strengthen its research and development capability of smaller chips.Romit Shah, analyst at Nomura, said: “While these investments in ASML do not grant Intel an exclusive access to the tools, we believe Intel will be the biggest beneficiary of these technologies due to its high volume of shipments.”Other technology stocks dropped. IBM decreased 1.8 per cent to $186.26 and Nvidia lost 3.1 per cent to $12.81.Facebook fell 2.2 per cent higher to $31.47. The social networking website was ranked as one of the top 10 US technology companies by market capitalisation over the past month, according to McGraw-Hill Financial.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the Nasdaq, dropped 0.9 per cent to $608.21.Cummins fell 9 per cent to $86.91, as the diesel engine maker also lowered its full year revenue forecast to approximately $4.45 billion, in line with 2011 versus its previous guidance for a growth of 10 per cent year-on-year. The company did not provide specific earnings guidance.“However, we expect pent-up demand for trucks in the US to drive improving revenue trends once economic uncertainty eases,” said Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “We still believe CMI is well positioned in truck engines and power generation equipment.” Mr Corridore maintained the “buy” rating for the stock.US equities extended losses on Tuesday after trading in negative territory for the previous three consecutive sessions, as the market swung between being pressured by the soft trade data of China and an easing of the eurozone debt crisis after finance ministers reached agreement to support Spain’s banks.The S&P 500 was down 0.8 per cent to 1,341.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,653.12, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index lost 1 per cent to 2,902.33.The consumer staples and utilities indices were the only subgroups that traded in positive territory, rising 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. The materials sectors dropped 1.5 per cent.Shares in aluminium manufacturer Alcoa fell 4.1 per cent to $8.40. The company’s second-quarter results announced after the market closed on Monday were modestly better than expected.S&P Capital IQ upgraded its rating to Alcoa from “hold” to “buy” and raised the company’s 12-month target price from $10 to $11.DuPont, the US chemical company, added 0.4 per cent to $47.65, and Dow Chemical dropped 2 per cent to $30.56.Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said third-quarter losses are expected to appear in lower-weighted sectors – materials, utilities and telecoms that account for a total of 10 per cent in the S&P 500.The defensive telecoms index decreased 0.2 per cent on Tuesday. AT&T edged down 0.3 per cent to $35.44, and Verizon also dropped 0.1 per cent to $44.70.Energy stocks remained weak after trading in negative territory for the previous two consecutive sessions.ExxonMobil lost 0.7 per cent to $83.11, and Chevron, the second-largest US oil group by market value, moved down 0.6 per cent to $103.88. ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company by market value, dropped 1.6 per cent to $53.48.Bank stocks were mixed. Morgan Stanley decreased 1.6 per cent to $13.71 and Goldman Sachs shed 0.2 per cent to $94.25. Bank of America lost 1.1 per cent to $7.48, but JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $34.25.
66;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-05-16T04:00:20Z;AMD bridges Ivy gap with Trinity;;Intel told its investor day last week it would be producing 2m units a week of its latest “Ivy Bridge” processors by the end of June, but the chipmaker faces fresh competition from Tuesday’s consumer and business announcements by rivals AMD and Nvidia.AMD launched its second-generation “Trinity” processors, touting longer battery life and lower prices than Intel’s offerings for notebooks and PCs, while Nvidia threatened to challenge Intel in the data centre and enterprise with the unveiling of its VGX graphics processing unit (GPU) platform.AMD finally achieved “Fusion” last year – the codename for marrying a traditional central processing unit (CPU) with a GPU on the same die. Delays following the inception of the concept in 2006, when it bought graphics chipmaker ATI, meant it lost a two-year lead over Intel, which reached the same goal in 2011 with its Core processors, codenamed Sandy Bridge.Despite mis-steps, heavy losses, major management changes and the spinning off of its manufacturing arm into Globalfoundries, AMD has hung in as a competitor, retaining a market share of around 20 per cent to Intel’s 80 per cent in the “x86″ microprocessor market that dominates the PC world.AMD refers to its combined processors as APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) and first-generation ones for PCs and laptops were codenamed Llano. Their Trinity successors just announced are said to offer double the performance per watt and up to 12 hours’ battery life for notebooks.While Intel has a huge marketing campaign underway for the Ultrabook category of thin, fast-starting laptops, AMD sees itself playing in ultrathin notebooks that don’t quite meet Intel’s Ultrabook specification.HP announced “Sleekbooks” last week, featuring both Intel and AMD processors. An AMD one with a 15.6in display will come out a month later than a 14in Intel version, but cost $100 less and feature an hour’s extra battery life – at an estimated nine hours.AMD is also offering an alternative to Intel’s Rapid Start – its Start Now technology can boot a PC in as little as 10 seconds and resume from sleep mode in two seconds.AMD expects Trinity – the official branding will be for A10, A8, A6 and A4 Vision APUs with varying numbers of cores – to feature in all-in-one PCs and traditional designs as well. It boasts that a record number of PC models for the company will use the processor. It did not provide a number (while Intel cited 670 “design wins” at Ivy Bridge’s launch), but named brands such as Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.Lenovo announced a new lineup of Thinkpad laptops on Tuesday, all featuring Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors, with the standout model being the X1 Carbon – “the lightest 14in Ultrabook in the industry” with its carbon-fibre casing helping it weigh only 3lbs.Meanwhile, Nvidia announced technology that would reduce the need for office PCs with powerful Intel processors. At its GPU technology conference in Silicon Valley, it showed off its VGX processor board for servers in data centres. It will deliver a virtualised PC experience to up to 100 users. Applications will be streamed from the cloud, allowing businesses to provide cheaper, more basic terminals for their workers.
67;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-05-09T04:01:55Z;Sleekbooks make HP debut;;HP has announced a new line of “Sleekbooks” - a variation on Intel’s Ultrabook category that adds processors from its rival AMD and achieves lower price points.The leading PC maker also unveiled Ultrabooks under its Envy brand name including a new model of the Spectre, the premium ultrabook it introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.HP’s introduction of thin-and-light Sleekbooks (pictured above and left) is its attempt to escape the strictures of the Ultrabook specification and make the price affordable to the mainstream consumer.One with a 15.6in display and using lower-priced AMD processors will be available in the US in June starting at $600. That’s $100 cheaper than an Intel-based Sleekbook with a 14in screen going on sale this Wednesday. The AMD version will also have an extra hour of battery life at an estimated nine hours.HP’s Intel-based Ultrabooks start at $750 and $800 for 14in and 15.6in versions respectively, while an “XT” version of the Spectre (left) will start at $1,000 – $400 cheaper than the original Spectre.It uses lighter, less expensive materials, weighing 3.1lbs rather than the 3.8lbs of the original.HP characterised the laptops’ launch, along with a raft of other computers, printers and displays as “the first show of resolve for the newly created HP Printing and Personal Systems group”.The lineup looked impressive at a demonstration of the new models in San Francisco and the prices were a step change in affordability.HP also showed off its first business Ultrabook – the 14in EliteBook Folio, which had an integrated smartcard reader, docking capabilities and the ability to add a battery slice extension to the bottom. It weighs 3.5lbs and is expected to be available in October.
68;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-05-06T17:25:59Z;Eye treatment offers NHS potential saving;;The National Health Service could save £85m a year by substituting the approved treatment for a serious eye condition with cheaper and equally effective small doses of a cancer drug, research claims.Conclusions from the first year of a clinical trial in 610 patients in Britain with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) showed Avastin was just as safe and effective as the use of Lucentis.The findings, presented on Sunday at the 2012 meeting in Florida of the Association for Research and Ophthalmology, will spark fresh tensions with Novartis, the Swiss company that commercialises Lucentis in Europe, and which has challenged NHS use of Avastin for AMD in the courts.Roche, which developed both Avastin and the biologically similar fragment of the drug it named Lucentis, has no financial incentive to test the two patented drugs against each other for AMD.But the sharp price difference has spurred studies by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research, which funded the Ivan study reported on Sunday, as well as the Catt study by the US National Eye Institute, which has come to similar conclusions.The organisations acted following widespread “off label” use of Avastin for AMD by health practitioners to save costs in the US, Portugal and other countries, with at least 20 primary care trusts in the UK considering its use.In the UK, specialists in 23 hospitals and universities have compared the results of the two drugs injected into patients’ eyes each year, in a trial still to run for another two years.The first year’s findings suggest “equivalent visual function” between the two drugs. It identified fewer heart attacks and strokes in patients treated with Avastin for AMD, and higher rates of other side effects which were not typically associated with the drugs.Use of small doses of Avastin was cheaper not only because of the lower cost of the product, but also because the study showed it could be given less frequently “as needed” rather than monthly, as the regulatory authorisation provided for Lucentis allows.Novartis and Roche argue that use of Avastin for AMD carries a greater risk of side effects and a danger of infection when the drug is split by pharmacists to use in small doses for injecting into the eye. They claim the numbers of patients in the Ivan and Catt studies are also too small to analyse potential side effects.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is planning record investment to help meet demand for its contract services. That is very different from the likes of SK Hynix and the memory chipmakers still hoping the death of one of their number will lead to a sustained rise in prices.TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker by sales, will spend more than $8bn on capex this year – using more than four-fifths of operating cash flow for a third consecutive year. Risky? Not so much. PC makers are still restocking as last year’s flood- and tsunami-related supply chain disruptions ease. Demand for cutting edge chips to power Windows 8-compatible computers and for rivals to Apple’s supposedly imminent iPhone 5 should lift sales this year. But due to the high cost of production – much of TSMC’s spend will go on expanding its ability to produce chips with a miniaturised circuit width of 28 nanometres or less – the number of contract manufacturers is limited. Intel, the largest chipmaker by sales, is also sniffing around the foundry business. That leaves the likes of chip designer Qualcomm with few choices.Alas supply in SK Hynix’s memory chip market is not so limited. D-Ram, or dynamic random access memory, prices have risen since Elpida collapsed, but Hynix and Micron (previously numbers two and four, far behind Samsung) are still reporting losses. A return of Elpida under a new owner could cut short the rally. TSMC is not threat-free either: Samsung could offer competition. And AMD spin-off, Global Foundries, will open its US 28nm-capable plant this year.Earnings valuations at Hynix and TSMC are in line with long-term averages. And both produce in-demand products. But TSMC is for now the better bet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Morgan Stanley gained 4.9 per cent to $19.51, while Wells Fargo rose 2.1 per cent to $34.07.SunTrust, the regional bank that failed the Fed’s stress test, added to its gains and rose 3.7 per cent to $24.49.Michael Rose, senior analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said: “For SunTrust, if you exclude what they asked for in dividends and buybacks, they would have passed.”Oil prices fell quickly after a Reuters report said the US and the UK were working on a deal to release their strategic petroleum reserves. The news triggered a rally by transportation stocks, which had dropped on Wednesday on fears of the effects of high oil prices on the sector.Gains were led by rail company CSX, which was up 8.5 per cent to $21.92.

Another chipmaker Cree gained 6.3 per cent to $30.46.Cisco Systems, the world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment, fell 1.4 per cent to $19.91. The company said on Thursday that it had agreed to acquire NDS, the video and content security software company, for $5bn.Economic data released before the markets opened showed that new jobless claims had fallen 14,000 to 351,000, while February wholesale inflation was subdued at just 0.4 per cent.Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “In order to see an improvement in payrolls data from admittedly encouraging levels, we estimate that the weekly claims series must head towards the vicinity of 310,000.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4 per cent higher at 13,252.76.Miner Freeport-McMoRan rose 0.6 per cent to $38.35 as reports said the company would restart production at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia.

The benchmark US index has now risen 11 per cent in the year to date. The financial sector – led by JPMorgan, which reached its highest mark since May – climbed 3.9 per cent on the day, clearly outpacing other groups, and is up more than 18 per cent for the year.Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs recorded gains of larger than six per cent each on the day. Shares in those major banks also reached multi-month highs, but Citigroup dropped 4 per cent after hours as it was revealed that the bank required more capital following the stress tests.Wells Fargo said it planned to increase its January declared dividend an additional 10 cents to 22 cents. Shares of the bank, which gained 5.7 per cent during the trading day, were up 0.5 per cent after hours.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 per cent to 13,180.40, its highest point since December 2007.The blue-chip heavy index was led by earthmover Caterpillar, which rose 4 per cent at $113.30. The construction equipment provider has climbed more than 25 per cent since the new year. Miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 2.2 per cent to $39.09. Dow Chemical and DuPont each added about 3 per cent to $34.60 and $52.68.The Nasdaq Composite Index also broke into unfamiliar territory and closed above the 3,000 point threshold for the first time since December 2000. The Nasdaq was up 1.9 per cent to 3,039.88.The most heavily weighted stock on the index, Apple, continued to guide the Nasdaq’s rise, once again hitting an all-time high. The maker of the popular iPad and iPhone products added 2.9 per cent to $568.10.The announcement by JPMorgan added to other positive market indicators that came throughout the day on Tuesday. Retail data released in the morning showed sales rose to their highest in five months.Economists, however, sought to temper the significance of the retail report.Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, warned: “After a weak December, retail sales picked up considerably in January and February …However, retail sales data, like many other time series, seem to have received a boost from much better than normal weather in many areas of the country combined with overly generous seasonal adjustment factors, which is a very potent combination.”Later in the day, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would leave interest rates unchanged.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.3 per cent to 428.20. Gains were led by chip makers including Micron Technology, which increased 5.1 per cent to $8.49. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.5 per cent to $7.76.CME, the US’s largest futures exchange, edged up 1 per cent to $272.99 after Monday’s news that its chief executive, Craig Donohue, is to step down at the end of the year. The exchange has struggled to restore confidence in its markets since the collapse of MF Global. Despite gains in recent months, shares are still trading down more than 8.5 per cent in the past year.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein, said: “At the current stock price we believe CME shares offer exceptional value for a firm that can generate high single to low-double-digit growth rates long term, has stable pretax margins exceeding 60 per cent, boasts a defensible business model and has a number of real options related to mandated over-the-counter clearing.”Cyclical material stocks, such as US Steel, which was up 7.3 per cent to $28.31, also made strong gains.Retailing group Urban Outfitters was among the day’s worst performers, down 5.3 per cent to $27.95. The company reported a 48 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits after it was forced to offer heavy markdowns to clear year-end inventories.Brian Tunick, retail analyst at JPMorgan, said: “Going forward, we continue to believe that with inventory under control and new management focused on improving product offerings, Urban Outfitters represents an attractive opportunity. We maintain a “buy” rating as we believe that the Street will remain excited over the potential improvements brought about by the “reassembled band”, setting up impressive [2012 fiscal year] opportunities.”Shares in China’s largest online video provider, Youku, fell 1.5 per cent to $31.40 after it climbed over 27 per cent on Monday as announced plans to merge with smaller rival Tudou.

Markets will watch Friday’s release of non-farm payroll figures closely.“It's a bullish sign that the S&P 500 has rebounded immediately off the lows this week and volatility [as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index] barely moved above 20,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It suggests the market could test post-crisis highs again.”Cyclical material stocks led the S&P 500 as all main sectors climbed on the day. The benchmark index closed up 1 per cent to 1,365.91 as the materials sector gained 1.6 per cent.Owens-Illinois, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of glass bottles, climbed 4.4 per cent to $23.68.Fertiliser maker CF Industries gained 4 per cent to $183.22.Financial stocks built on gains from Wednesday after reports that investors holding well over three-quarters of Greece’s private debt had agreed to participate in the country’s €206bn debt restructuring.Wells Fargo led the major banks, up 3.3 per cent to $31.40.Morgan Stanley gained 1.6 per cent to $18.18. Bank of America crossed the $8 mark, up 0.5 per cent to $8.06. Online share trading broker Etrade went up by 3 per cent to $9.68.AIG dropped 3.9 per cent to $28.41 after the US Treasury said it planned to sell up to $6.9bn in shares of the insurer rescued by the government during the financial crisis.This is the latest stage of a gradual sell-down of the 77 per cent stake the Treasury still owns in the insurer after the bailout in 2008.AIG said on Wednesday that it would buy back up to $3bn of Treasury shares.Shares in Coach, the luxury leather goods retailer, climbed to an all-time high, rising 4.6 per cent to $76.79, among the top gainers on the S&P 500.The company said its sales continued to gather momentum.American Eagle Outfitters climbed 1.4 per cent to $15.75 as Nomura updated shares in the clothing retailer to “buy” from “hold” on confidence in the company’s new chief executive.Paul Lejuez, retail analyst at Nomura, said: “American Eagle has had its challenges over the past several years, some self-inflicted and some a function of the competitive landscape.“New chief executive Robert Hanson is addressing these challenges with a focus on return on invested capital, and we believe American Eagle can beat consensus earnings per share of $1.06 in [its] 2012 fiscal year.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.6 per cent to 12,907.94.Gains were led by Alcoa as the aluminium manufacturer rose 2.3 per cent to $9.77. Cisco, the world’s largest seller of networking equipment, climbed 1.4 per cent to close at $19.68.McDonald’s was the biggest loser on the Dow, down 3.2 per cent to $96.96, after the company’s like-for-like sales in February fell below analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The world’s largest restaurant chain said severe winter weather in Europe last month was partly to blame for its disappointing figures.The Nasdaq went up 1.2 per cent to 2,970.42 on the day. Apple rose 2.1 per cent to $541.99, as analysts began interpreting the implications of its latest products, including a third-generation iPad, unveiled on Wednesday.Richard Gardner at Citigroup said: “With the addition of so many new features at the same prices as iPad 2, Apple has once again made it nearly impossible for competitors to undercut iPad on price and still earn a profit.While there are cheaper tablets on the market, they do not offer the screen size, screen resolution, ease of use or wealth of apps – both Apple-branded and third party – that iPad does. iPad 3 leaves us convinced that Apple will continue to dominate the tablet market throughout 2012.”The Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks went up 1.5 per cent to 418.36. The index has gained over 3 per cent since Tuesday’s close. Among chipmakers, Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.2 per cent to $7.47, while Intel Corp dropped 0.3 per cent to $26.84.
73;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-03-07T05:28:17Z;Intel expands in data centre cloud;;Intel has launched its next-generation server processor to boost its presence in data centres and cloud storage, while at the same time pooh-poohing an acquisition by rival Advanced Micro Devices in the same area.At a launch event in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel said the Xeon E5 product family represented up to an 80 per cent performance improvement over its previous generation. It said it was not impressed with the server technology of SeaMicro and declined to buy it before AMD announced a $334m deal last week.Intel said the E5 also delivered the best performance per watt in terms of energy efficiency in data centres and information could be moved in and out of the processor at up to triple previous speeds.The chip represents Intel expanding its product line in data centres from the use of its processors in servers to storage and networking products as well – the E5, formerly codenamed Romley, will be used in all three areas.The amount of internet traffic going through data centres is expected to grow by 33 percent annually through 2015, as consumers and businesses increasingly access their content and information through the data being stored in the centres’ “cloud”.Intel predicts the number of cloud servers will more than triple globally by 2015 to meet demand. Revenues for its data centre group grew 17 per cent in 2011 and Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, has described the E5 as “probably the most well-rounded product we’ve produced in this genre so far”.AMD, its main competitor in PC processors, bought SeaMicro last week to try to win back server market share lost to Intel in recent years.But Diane Bryant (pictured), head of the data centre group, said Intel felt it had a very robust and superior solution in the micro-server segment where SeaMicro operates.“We did look at SeaMicro’s fabric technology – I think there’re very few people that they didn’t come to and shop their solution to, so we were one of many and were asked if we would be interested in it or even in licensing the technology,” she said.“We were not impressed and we declined and very soon thereafter, our competitor acquired them.”

US Steel Corp shed 4.7 per cent to $26.21.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,363.44 as analysts sought to temper pessimism.“This should not have been a surprise for the markets [and] the full report released last night showed [the Chinese] are offering further measures to stimulate their economy,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.Stocks had fallen during the morning session on tepid US economic data, as a gauge of factory orders fell for the January period, but recovered slightly in afternoon trading.“This is a continuation of the market needing strong data from the US to show the economy is self-sustaining,” Ms Krosby said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,962.81, as blue-chip material stocks were also hit by China’s growth warning. Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, lost 3.6 per cent to $9.87; earthmover Caterpillar shed 2.1 per cent to $110.09; and Dupont fell 1.1 per cent to $50.89.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,950.48, slipping further from the psychologically important 3,000 benchmark, which it breached intraday for the first time in 11 years last week.Apple shares opened higher, to within $2 of its record high of $548.21 set last week. But the iPad-maker declined 2.2 per cent to $533.16.First Solar was the biggest loser on the S&P, dropping 6.5 per cent to $28.08. The world’s largest maker of thin-film solar panels continued to reel from its disappointing fourth-quarter results released last week, while reports suggested natural gas producers are as likely to benefit from clean energy subsidies as renewable energy companies.WPX Energy climbed 2.8 per cent to $18.33, as analysts speculated that the natural gas producer could be subject to a takeover bid, after its shares sold off, as natural gas prices fell last year.Big bank stocks dropped as attempts continued to secure participation in the planned private sector exchange of Greek debtBank of America was down 2 per cent to $7.97, Morgan Stanley was off 3.1 per cent to $18.48, Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $33.68 and Goldman Sachs was off 1.1 per cent to $119.95.AIG gained 2 per cent to $30.39 on news that it would sell $6bn worth of shares in AIA Group. The insurer, which was bailed out by the US government during the financial crisis, said it expects to use the funds to pay down debt it owes to the US Treasury.Fertiliser manufacturer CF Industries fell 5.5 per cent to $177.98 as Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that the company’s comprehensive natural gas price hedging strategy, reduces the potential for the company to benefit from low prices for the commodity this year .“While hedging adds visibility to CF’s margins, it may have left some profit potential on the table with [year to date] average [natural gas] prices near $2.60,” PJ Juvekar told Citigroup clients.Advanced Micro Devices lost 5.2 per cent to $7.07 as the semiconductor manufacturer said it would pay at least $150m to break an exclusivity agreement with one of its clients.Micron Technology also fell 5.2 per cent to $8.20 as the Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks fell 2.6 per cent.Micron, which manufactures dynamic random access memory for computers, had rallied strongly last week after a Japanese rival filed for bankruptcy, raising hopes of consolidation in the sector.Zynga shares fell 4.9 per cent to $13.97, after Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan removed his “buy” recommendation on the stock, after it briefly topped his $15 target last week.“We believe Zynga shares are fairly valued and could be range-bound in the near-term until we see greater clarity around the strength of newer games and their ability to increase both users and payers,” said Mr Anmuth.Groupon, the e-coupon company, dropped 5.6 per cent to $18.13.MetroPCS shares slumped 5.7 per cent to $9.96 as Sanford Bernstein analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on shares in the wireless network.“[The company’s] long term prospects are more pedestrian,” Craig Moffett told clients in a note. “Competition is greater in their core markets than it once was – due partially to the shifts down-market from Sprint and T-Mobile.”Polypore International, the plastics manufacturer of a key lithium battery component for the Chevrolet Volt, dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.91 after reports late Friday said Chevrolet would temporarily suspend production of the electric vehicle.Computer Science Corp rose 2 per cent to $31.93, as the company signed a letter of intent with the UK’s National Health Service, as it attempts to rescue a lucrative contract."

Stocks barely paused for breath when consumer spending data showed a fall in real disposable income in January, leading Goldman Sachs to lower its first-quarter growth forecast.A surge in the price of crude oil triggered a pullback in mid-afternoon trade but the S&P 500 rebounded to finish near a day high.Despite the US market’s apparent resilience to bad news in 2012, Sam Stovall at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ became the third equity analyst in a week to urge clients to retreat from equities.“We view current price levels . . . as very good areas in which to lighten equity exposure. We think the next pullback could be particularly sharp,” Mr Stovall said in a note.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 climbing 1.6 per cent. Bank of America was up 1.9 per cent to $8.12 and JPMorgan rose 2.9 per cent to $40.37, its highest close since August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.2 per cent higher at 12,980.3 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to 2,988.97.Among investment banks, Goldman Sachs surged 5 per cent to $121.13, a six-month high, and Morgan Stanley added 3.5 per cent to $19.19.Nomura analysts forecast that the sluggish start to the year in US M&A and equity trading activity would pick up as a result of the buoyant markets.“Investor risk appetite has increased and asset levels are higher,” Glen Schorr told Nomura clients. “If asset prices can hold relatively steady, we think activity in these businesses will likely see some improvement.”February same-store sales exceeded analysts’ expectations for many retailers.Shares in Gap climbed 7.2 per cent to $25.05 as sales rose 4 per cent, beating the average analyst estimate for a decline of 1.4 per cent.The clothing store chain endured a torrid 2011 but shares are now within reach of 10-year highs, having gained by a third this year.Mid-market department store chain Kohl’s was one of the few companies to disappoint with its same-store sales figure. It slipped 1.6 per cent to $48.87.Advanced Micro Devices climbed 2.2 per cent to $7.51 after the semiconductor manufacturer’s move to buy computer server manufacturer, SeaMicro.The purchase appears designed to staunch AMD’s loss of market share to Intel in sales of personal computer chips. Shares in Intel lost 0.1 per cent to $26.86.It was the second sign of consolidation in the semiconductor space this week after Japanese computer memory chipmaker Elpida filed for bankruptcy. But analysts said the two cases were different.“The computer memory space is ripe for consolidation because the industry has high fixed costs and products are easily substitutable,” said Srini Pajjuri at Crédit Agricole Securities.“AMD’s acquisition, on the other hand, is more strategic. It’s partly vertically integrating to improve its offering to computer manufacturers.”First Solar fell 5.8 per cent to $30.42 as investors continued to sell the stock after the solar panel manufacturer declared an unexpectedly large quarterly loss this week.At one point in February, shares in First Solar were up almost 50 per cent for the year, following the trend for last year’s S&P 500 laggards to outperform in 2012.But the poor earnings report and a planned reduction in German subsidies for solar panels have seen its shares fall $20 in two weeks and the stock is down 10 per cent for the year.Finisar ended a volatile day up 4.6 per cent to $21.23. The stock had fallen as much as 10 per cent in pre-market trading after the telecoms equipment provider saw earnings fall 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.6 per cent to $8.59, giving back part of a strong gain on Wednesday, which analysts had put down to unrealistic expectations of an imminent housing recovery.
76;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD makes $334m move on SeaMicro;Bid to grab server market share from Intel;Advanced Micro Devices is buying the chip designer SeaMicro for $334m in a move to grab market share from its close rival Intel in the server market, and fend off an impending challenge from ARM-based products.AMD, the second largest PC microprocessor maker after Intel, said it would begin offering products combining its Opteron processors and SeaMicro’s technology in the second half of 2012.The Silicon Valley company has ceded server share to Intel in recent years and had less than 10 per cent of the market in 2011 – a factor in the decision to replace its chief executive, Dirk Meyer, last year, according to reports.Analysts also fear it may be squeezed by the introduction of low-power processors in servers, based on chip designs of the UK’s ARM.But SeaMicro specialises in energy-efficient, high-bandwidth microservers and its technology should match up well against ARM chips. It will be known as the Data Center Solutions Group within AMD - tackling a high-growth area where companies are offering cloud services from remote data centres.“By acquiring SeaMicro, we are accelerating AMD’s transformation into an agile, disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position,” said Rory Read, the new chief executive, in a statement.“SeaMicro is a pioneer in low-power server technology. [This] uniquely positions AMD with a compelling, differentiated position to attack the fastest growing segment of the server market.”AMD said $281m of the $334m purchase price would be paid in cash, funded from existing reserves.
77;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-02-10T00:26:07Z;Intel pays $6.5m to end New York lawsuit;;Intel is close to winding up a series of antitrust actions against it around the world with an agreement with the New York attorney-general to terminate a lawsuit.Intel said it would pay $6.5m to meet part of New York’s costs for the suit, which was filed in November 2009.The world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues said in a statement that the agreement followed a December ruling that greatly reduced the scope of New York’s case.The agreement “expressly states that Intel does not admit either any violation of law or that the allegations in the complaint are true, and it calls for no changes to the way Intel does business”, it said.“We have always said that Intel’s business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers, and we are pleased this matter has been resolved,” said Doug Melamed, Intel’s general counsel.New York’s original suit had alleged that Dell and other computer makers received billions of dollars in rebates from Intel in exchange for not using processors made by its rival, Advanced Micro Devices.Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25bn in 2009 in exchange for dropping all complaints against it and it later paid another rival chipmaker Nvidia $1.5bn on similar terms.The Silicon Valley company has been investigated and fined by the European Commission as well as being the subject of inquiries by regulatory bodies in Japan and Korea.It has also reached an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission to use an open industry standard to make it easier for other chipmakers to connect their own products to its chips.

It had climbed as high as 1,333.47, a gain of more than 21 per cent from the close on October 3, as equity analysts said the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep interest rates low until the end of 2014 was bullish for equities.“The Fed intervention should turn savers into investors, bringing money back into the market,” said Douglas Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “For the next three years at least, bank deposits will make no money, and even the most conservative savers can’t be happy with zero returns.”Utility and material stocks appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move, with both sectors gaining in a falling market. Analysts said material stocks offer a hedge against the inflationary effect of low interest rates – as commodity prices rise with inflation – while low interest rates would make it easier for utility companies to fund infrastructure investments.Apple, meanwhile, briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as its shares surged 6.4 per cent to $447.28 following blockbuster results on Tuesday. That helped the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a handy 1.1 per cent gain over the week, closing at 2,816.55.It also triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.For example, Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $6.82, even though the company cuts its forecast for full-year earnings.But the news was less good for companies supplying other smartphone manufacturers. SanDisk shares tumbled 11 per cent to $46.70 over the week, as the semiconductor manufacturer said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt 2012 revenue, and announced it had put a new production facility on hold.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.5 per cent to 12,660.46, lagging other indices, as poor fourth-quarter results weighed on several companies.Mobile phone network Verizon fell 4.5 per cent to $37.21 and rival AT&T was off 4.4 per cent to $29.16, as both reported unexpectedly large payments to their pension funds. Pension contributions also sapped margins at 3M, although shares in the technology supplier still climbed 2.1 per cent to $87.46 on strong earnings.Caterpillar was another bright spot in the Dow, climbing 5.3 per cent to $111.28 as the earth-moving company gave a bullish forecast for spending on construction in the US.But that was not enough to sustain a rally in homebuilders, which sold off on Thursday as December new home sales came in lower than expected. Lennar ended the week up just 1 per cent at $22.28, although the stock remains up 13.4 per cent for the year.With the quarterly earnings of 196 S&P 500 constituents reported, companies have beaten analysts’ forecasts at the lowest rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Revenue growth is also set to outpace earnings growth, suggesting US corporate margins are being squeezed.The financial sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent over the week, although data from Lipper showed funds investing in US banks had attracted inflows for eight successive weeks, the longest such run since March 2000.Brokers Charles Schwab and E Trade Financial fell 9 per cent to $11.67 and 15.2 per cent to $8.19 respectively, as fourth-quarter earnings were hit by low trading volumes.Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell 10.4 per cent to $16.89, as mark-to-market losses on collateralised debt obligation securities hit earnings by $12.1m, or four cents a share. Brian Zabora at Stifel Nicolaus said Zions was the only regional bank he covers that still had exposure to CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.Netflix jumped 23.5 per cent to $123.79 over the week as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [domestic earnings] and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix is now up almost 80 per cent for the year, although part appears to be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset."

But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.
80;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:25+0000;Pioneering stem cell treatment for eye patient;;A Yorkshire bar owner with progressive eye disease is the first patient outside the US to receive a treatment based on human embryonic stem cells.Marcus Hilton, 34, received an injection of 50,000 retinal cells – derived from embryonic stem cells – into his right eye in an hour-long operation at Moorfields Eye Hospital on Friday.“I feel a bit bruised but OK,” Mr Hilton told the Financial Times on Monday, after leaving the hospital in London and before heading home to Wakefield. “It is quite exciting to be a pioneer.”If all goes well, the new cells – developed by Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), a biotech company based in Massachusetts – will establish themselves and grow in the retina, where his own cells have been destroyed by a genetic disorder called Stargardt’s disease.At the same time, The Lancet medical journal published an encouraging scientific paper about the first two US patients who received a similar treatment at the University of California, Los Angeles, in July.The primary aim of these “phase one” clinical trials is to confirm that the treatment is safe. No safety concerns have emerged after the cell transplantation, The Lancet reports.But the researchers also look for improvement in the underlying condition. Both US patients, who are partially blind, showed some recovery in vision. One moved from not being able to read any letters on an optician’s chart before treatment to being able to distinguish five letters: the other moved from reading 21 to 28 letters.“Despite the progressive nature of these conditions, the vision of both patients appears to have improved after transplantation of the cells, even at the lowest dosage,” said Robert Lanza, ACT chief scientist. “This is particularly important, since the ultimate goal of this therapy will be to treat patients earlier in the course of the disease where more significant results might potentially be expected.”Back in the UK, Mr Hilton has lost almost all his central vision although he still has enough peripheral sight “to function from day to day.”“I know that this trial is mainly about safety – but I’m hoping there will be some improvement in my vision as a bonus,” he said. “All will be revealed in two months’ time when I have my next sight test.”Although some groups object to treatments derived originally from human embryos, on religious or ethical grounds, Mr Hilton is not worried. “I think about the benefits that could come to hundreds of thousands of people,” he said.Mr Hilton is the first of 12 Stargardt’s patients who will be treated at Moorfields by gradually increasing doses of retinal cells during the next 18 months or so, said Professor James Bainbridge who leads the UK trial.Separately, another research group at Moorfields is developing a stem cell treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in older people. It hopes to start a clinical trial this year.In the US, ACT is testing its stem cell treatment for both AMD and Stargardt’s disease.But Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist at King’s College London, warned against excessive expectations. “If everyone expects that blind patients will see after being treated with [stem cells], they risk being unnecessarily disappointed,” he said.
81;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2012-01-20T22:03:33Z;S&P 500 on cusp of bull market territory;;A week dominated by fourth-quarter results saw tech companies drive a rally that was belatedly joined by bank stocks and left the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bull market.Linear Technology sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks on Wednesday as the company said orders for circuit products had picked up in December and January, paving the way for a strong first quarter of 2012.Linear surged 10 per cent to $33.06 over the week while rivals Advanced Micro Devices, up 13.4 per cent to $6.42, and Jabil Circuit, which climbed 9.3 per cent to $23.00, benefited from the improved sentiment.“Historically, [Linear] has generally been right in guiding investors through the cycle bottoming process …usually seeing changes in demand before peers,” John Pitzer at Credit Suisse told clients.Wireless networking companies joined the rally on Wednesday. F5 Networks defied falling revenues from government clients to beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.F5 climbed 12.6 per cent to $120.27, while rival Juniper Networks was up 9.2 per cent to $22.99, though some analysts were cautious about excessive valuations.“At over 24 times our full-year 2012-expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep [F5] moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.The tech rally accelerated at the end of the week as larger companies reported. Old tech appeared to dominate new as IBM, up 5.2 per cent to $188.52, and Microsoft, up 5.2 per cent to $29.71 outperformed Google, which slid 8.4 per cent on Friday alone to $585.99.On closer inspection, the contrasting share price performances were a result of very different factors.Google shares had climbed 2.3 per cent to the close on Thursday in anticipation of strong fourth- quarter results while Microsoft’s gains came in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales at its core Windows business: analysts had simply been braced for worse.The tech rally left the Nasdaq Composite index up 2.8 per cent for the week to 2,786.7 while IBM and Microsoft helped the Dow climb 2.4 per cent to 12,720.48.The S&P 500 climbed 2 per cent over the week – now up 4.6 per cent for the year – and is on course for its best January in 15 years. The benchmark index has now climbed 19.7 per cent since its close on October 3, just short of the 20 per cent gain that would indicate a bull market.The CBOE Vix index of volatility in the S&P 500, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, closed below 20 for the first time in almost six months on Thursday before falling to 18.4 on Friday, in a further indicator of bullish sentiment.But market participants warned against excessive optimism, noting high inflows into exchange-traded products that profit from a rise in volatility.“Risk assets have had a nice run of late but at least some investors are hedging their bets,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex.Bank earnings hugged the headlines over the week with investment banks the clear winners as Goldman Sachs climbed 9.9 per cent to $108.74 and Morgan Stanley climbed 10.6 per cent to $18.39 while there was one clear loser – Citigroup slumped 3.6 per cent over the week to $29.27.Investor enthusiasm for investment banking stocks was somewhat surprising, given the abysmal fourth-quarter trading volumes reported by most banks. Morgan Stanley was the one bank to buck the trend, however, while Goldman impressed investors by cutting deeply into costs by reducing staff and pay.“Expectations about pay in the industry have changed but clearly cutting headcount is not something that can be done every quarter,” said JJ Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. “Eventually, US banks need a kinder interest rate environment to generate sustainable earnings growth.”Bank of America climbed 7 per cent to $7.07 over the week, its highest close since October, as it reported a second successive quarter of profit, despite losses at its investment banking business.Credit card companies were the laggards of the financial sector with American Express virtually flat for the week while Capital One fell 5.9 per cent to $46.03 as the company spooked investors with higher than expected costs that pushed profit far below most analyst expectations.Goldman Sachs analysts said “further outperformance” by credit card companies was unlikely, despite several companies reporting an increase in outstanding loans and improving lending margins in the fourth quarter.“Spend volumes decelerated and expenses were elevated,” Goldman told clients.Overall, with 77 companies S&P 500 companies having reported by Friday afternoon, only 55 per cent have beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, one of the lowest rates in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“The market reacts positively to bad news [and] terrible earnings reports are ignored: [these are] signs of a bull market,” worried Mark Ivanhoff at Ivanhoff Capital.The rollercoaster ride continued for investors in Sears Holdings. The department store chain’s market capitalisation halved in the last two months of 2011 after the company announced store closures.But shares rose 46 per cent to $49 this week as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders. Mr Lampert had increased his personal stake in the company last week.Marathon Petroleum climbed 12.5 per cent to $37.17 over the five day period as activist investor Jana Partners disclosed a 5.5 per cent stake in the refiner and promised to push for reforms to increase shareholder value.

83;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
84;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-12-27T16:33:53Z;Foreign groups push to get Thai business moving;;Thailand’s worst floods in five decades have largely subsided, but the impact on the global supply chain remains difficult to quantify as foreign manufacturers offer contrasting accounts of the true extent of the damage.About a quarter of the 1,000 large foreign manufacturers affected by the floods in the country, each of which plays an important role in the global supply chain for the consumer electronics and automotive industries, have resumed some operations, according to analysts.However, estimates by manufacturers of hard disk drives – Thailand accounts for 45 per cent of global production – other technology groups and carmakers vary widely in terms of damage caused by the floods and the effect on future production in the country.Thailand produced 1.8m vehicles in 2010, half of which were exported. However, flood damage hit component manufacturers and large carmakers such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, causing a 36 per cent drop in exports for 2011, according to HSBC.Toyota, one of Thailand’s biggest foreign investors, recently said recovery had been quicker than expected at three of its plants but halved its annual profit forecast to $2.6bn, blaming flood damage. Honda, meanwhile, said its Thai assembly plant would not reopen until April, resulting in more than 100,000 units of lost production, but plans to move some motorcycle production to the country from Japan.Intel, the world’s biggest chip supplier, lowered fourth-quarter revenue guidance by about $1bn in early December, anticipating shortfalls in computer production due to flood damage, but Intel’s rival Advanced Micro Devices played down the impact of HDD shortages on the personal computer market.These diverging views are important because they will play a crucial role to shape manufacturing in the country, and therefore to form the wider supply chain network on which so many companies depend globally.How quickly the economy can recover is “tricky stuff”, says HSBC economist Frederic Neumann.“On the surface, price pressures are up and the economy is likely to rebound over the first half of 2012. On the other hand, [Thailand-based] companies will face major new investment outlays and steeper production costs, at least in the short term. However, as the water recedes, the economy will [probably] bounce back swiftly, spurred by a jump in public and private investment.”Japanese companies, such as Toyota, Honda, Sony and Toshiba, and a handful of US groups, including hard-disk drive maker Western Digital, must import costly new machinery and await repairs to damaged infrastructure in addition to paying higher premiums for flood insurance.Some, such as Japan’s Nidec, a maker of hard-drive components, are reconsidering the location of their plants within Thailand or outside the country while ON Semiconductor, which acquired a Thai subsidiary of Sanyo Electronics this year, said it would close most Thai operations.However, most Japanese companies still see the country as a preferred manufacturing location, according to a recent survey of 55 Japanese companies with flood-damaged plants by Jetro, the Japanese government trade body. None intends to leave the country, and 70 per cent to date have decided to restart production in the same locations.Indeed, the alternatives for manufacturers are limited, according to Sriyan Pietersz of JPMorgan Thailand research, as few countries can offer the same skilled labour force, convenience and relatively low manufacturing costs.“The question one has to ask is: where would they go? There is nowhere comparable in the region.”The critical challenge for Bangkok is to restore investor confidence. The Thai government estimates overall flood-related damage at about Bt1,300bn ($41.4bn). To boost investor confidence, the Thai Cabinet on Tuesday approved a Bt350bn budget to repair infrastructure and add to flood defences and a separate Bt50bn for insurance funding. There were no decisions about how the budget would be financed but the main proposal under consideration is for a Bt350bn issue of government “flood bonds”.The budget is in addition to the government’s pledge of Bt130bn for general flood recovery initiatives, of which an emergency package of Bt 20bn was approved in mid-December.Industry groups call for firm spending commitments on flood protection and water management plans, as well as fast-tracked infrastructure repair.Post-flood insurance is vital, most Bangkok-based analysts agree, as the top insurers await government commitments to build costly new flood defences and to help manufacturers recover before they decide premiums and policies for coming years.“We are all trying to get back up and running here, but for the future outlook, it seems to be entirely up to whether companies can be assured this won’t happen again,” said Judy Benn, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand.

Advanced Micro Devices, closed up 7.3 per cent to $5.45 and Altera Corp gained 6.4 per cent to $37.98. The Philadelphia Sox index of semiconductor stocks climbed 3.5 per cent.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,254 for its third straight day of gains, as investors shrugged off a downward revision to third-quarter growth, and focused instead on another fall in jobless claims to new year lows.Banks did much of the work, as sentiment continued to firm after Tuesday’s bumper take up of European Central Bank long-term loans by eurozone banks.Citigroup climbed 5.9 per cent to $27.65 and Morgan Stanley was up 6.5 per cent to $15.88 as the financial sector climbed 2.1 per cent, twice the gain of any other sector. Goldman Sachs ended the day 2.6 per cent higher to $94.42, although reports that its debt had been downgraded by Standard & Poor’s, soon denied by the rating agency, had knocked a percentage point off its valuation in the mid-afternoon.The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.5 per cent to 12,1169.65, ExxonMobil climbed for the second day running. The oil major finished 1.4 per cent higher $84.29 as US crude oil nudged $100 a barrel. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.9 per cent at 2,599.45.Akamai Technologies rose 18.6 per cent to $31.63 as investors in the internet services company applauded its $268m purchase of Contendo, a “cloud” services company.“This is a very positive move,” said Michael Turits, a tech analyst at Raymond James. “Akamai are doubling down on the cloud side of their business, which has seen faster growth and has higher margins than their core video acceleration business.”Mead Johnson Nutrition fell 10.1 per cent to $68.76 after Walmart withdrew the company’s Enfamil Newborn powder from its 3,000 stores. A baby who had been fed the formula had died from what preliminary tests indicate was a rare bacterial infection.The government has not ordered a recall of the product and Mead said its records showed the lot tested negative for the bacterium before it was shipped. Walmart spokeswoman Dianna Gee said the company decided to pull the lot “out of an abundance of caution” while health officials investigate. Walmart slid down 0.3 per cent to $59.19.Bed Bath & Beyond, fell 6.3 per cent to $57.58. The home furnishings retailer beat earnings per share estimates on third-quarter sales of $2.34bn, which came in as expected, but margin growth ground to a halt at 40.9 per cent for the quarter.The company has been one of the star performers in the S&P 500 so far this year, as it consistently increased operating margin for several quarters.“These results suggest that the magnitude of earnings per share upside may slow in future quarters,” said Gary Balter at Credit Suisse.TripAdvisor tumbled 11.3 per cent to $24.53 on its second full day of trading on the Nasdaq.Morgan Stanley analysts recommended investors sell shares in the travel review website, while Barclays Capital gave it a lukewarm “hold” rating.TripAdvisor was spun-off by parent Expedia, the travel booking website, and initially debuted with a higher market valuation. However, Expedia climbed 4.5 per cent to $29.15, with investors appearing to favour the standalone transactions business for now.First Solar, the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer, whose market cap has slumped by more than 70 per cent this year, was up 7.4 per cent to $34.15 as analysts said it could make an attractive bid target at its current valuation.Robert W Baird’s renewables team told clients that General Electric or Siemens AG might consider an approach for the company to increase their exposure to the $55bn solar power industry.American Greetings sank 21.1 per cent to $13.39 after third-quarter profit at the cardmaker fell nearly 40 per cent compared to last year.Chief Executive Zev Weiss said not all of the spending increases would be permanent, telling analysts, “some of that is one time,” but conceded spending would weigh on margin in 2012.The CBOE Vix index of volatility continued to tumble, approaching 20 for the first time since July, before settling at 21.30.

It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,236.47, although the index had fallen as low as 1,227 before a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 12,021.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,612.26.“Participants didn’t want to be short last week, because the risk was to the upside in case the summit came up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Now investors are more willing to exit, and they’re telling us European leaders didn’t do enough.”Cyclical bank and material stocks led the fallers, with Morgan Stanley off 6.1 per cent to $15.38 and Alpha Natural Resources falling 8.8 per cent to $21.39.Citigroup also fell 5.4 per cent to $27.22 and Bank of America fell 4.7 per cent to $5.45, even though Richard Ramsden, Goldman Sachs’ US banks analyst, was broadly positive on the sector after Goldman’s bank conference last week.Mr Ramsden told clients that conference participants had pointed to strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, and suggested all major US banks would pass tougher Fed stress tests.Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, fell 6.3 per cent to $116.07. Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500. Shares rose 15.4 per cent to $39.48, after its smaller rival, Martin Marietta, launched a hostile takeover, offering half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share. Martin Marietta climbed 1.7 per cent to $74.61.M&A hopes helped Netflix to a 6.2 per cent gain. Shares climbed to $75.26 on chatter than Amazon or Verizon could make a play for the video-streaming website, which has seen its share price fall from more than $300 this year.Apple provided ballast for tech shares, falling just 0.5 per cent to $391.84, as Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga, said the iPhone maker had its best November on record with sales up 17 per cent month on month.Lockheed Martin bucked the market, falling just 0.7 per cent to $74.61 after the Pentagon said it had placed a $4bn order for 30F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.Edwards Lifesciences climbed 5.1 per cent to $67.85, on the back of upgrades from several analysts. A Morgan Keegan noted pointed to the group’s strong product pipeline and prospects in China.General Motors fell 1.7 per cent to $20.80, relatively unaffected by a decision to halt production of its Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown plant, which GM blamed on a supplier issue.
87;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Intel: when the chips are down;The stock is up 30 per cent in three months, far outpacing technology indices;"It’s been a dreary autumn for tech investors. Despite low valuations and sound results, most shares have not rallied. Intel is a big exception. The chipmaker’s stock is up 30 per cent in three months, far outpacing technology indices.The key support for the move up has been remarkable top-line growth. In the past four quarters, according to research group IDC, worldwide personal computer chip revenue growth has averaged 12 per cent; Intel’s PC chip unit (which accounts for half the company’s revenue) has averaged 16 per cent growth. The outperformance is largely explained by three factors. Intel has been taking share from its smaller rival AMD. It product mix has improved as it sells fewer low-priced Atom chips for cheap laptops. And finally, Intel’s growth has been strongest in the emerging world. The company estimates that about half its chips go into PCs sold into developing countries. It is widely thought that the researchers’ measurements miss sales in these regions.Is it time to take gains? For short-term traders, perhaps. Recent news about the Brazilian economy, for example, suggests that the global slowdown may not be confined to the developed world. The positive effect of product mix will not last forever either, and AMD will stop stumbling sooner or later. All this suggests growth will level off in the next few quarters.Intel investors with a longer-term view should stay right where they are, though. The company’s scale in chip manufacture is a sustainable advantage. It has longer term growth opportunities in chips for corporate data centres and for mobile devices. And it generates more than enough cash to support or increase its considerable dividend (the yield is over 3 per cent). And the rally only drove the share price to 10 times this year’s earnings, a valuation that a slower-growing Intel can support.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

89;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Arm’s reach extends to servers;;"Five years ago, microchip experts would have laughed at the suggestion that the same small chips found inside a mobile phone would be used to run the servers in a data centre.Yet this week Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest computer manufacturer by sales, said that it would start producing servers using chips designed by Arm Holdings. The Cambridge-based company’s designs are found in nearly all of the world’s mobile phones; they are also in Apple’s iPad tablet, but they have always been seen as lacking the power to run larger computers.The announcement puts Arm in direct competition with Intel, which has up to now dominated the $9bn server processor market. Intel’s x86 architecture for microprocessors is powerful and capable of making vast computations at high speed. It has been difficult for others to compete with this in the past two decades, when computers were expected to become faster and more capable each year. Intel has more than 90 per cent of this market.Now, however, the cost of energy is rising and internet companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and Google are running vast, concentrated data centres full of hundreds of thousands of servers. Power consumption has become an important issue.Arm-designed processors, designed for mobile handsets with limited battery life, are being seen as a good, low-power alternative. HP said Arm-based servers could use up to 90 per cent less power, and take up 94 per cent less space that conventional servers.“The cost of running and maintaining IT equipment has become a major expense for companies and everyone is scrutinising how they could bring their energy consumption down,” says Sergis Mushell, processor analyst at Gartner.Simply getting enough power to a data centre – which can use as much electricity as a small town – can be tricky in densely populated areas such as London, says David Chalmers, chief technology officer at HP UK. Data centres near the Docklands financial district in London, for example, have suffered a number of power cuts over the past few years.Companies are experimenting with building data centres in cold places – Facebook, for example, is building a facility in Sweden’s Lapland– to cut down on the cost of cooling servers, which can account for nearly half of running expenses. But they are also increasingly looking for new types of computer hardware.HP said the first Arm-based servers would be out early next year.Low-power servers will not be suitable for very complex computing tasks, warns Mr Chalmers. But they might be ideal for internet companies such as Facebook, which need to send relatively simple information out to very large numbers of users.Mr Mushell believes that low-power servers could account for about 10-15 per cent of the market.“Servers are evolving. Internet applications are not very demanding but you need lots of them,” says Nick James, analyst at Numis. “It is a material opportunity for Arm. It may initially be a niche market, but if you get an ecosystem of software around Arm-based server chips, it is easier to build further on the position and move further into the market.”Microsoft said earlier this year that it was making the next version of its computer operating software, Windows 8, capable of running on Arm-based chips, a key indicator that the software industry is beginning to create products for Arm’s designs.Arm also announced last month that it would bring out a 64-bit processor design, which has more memory and storage and is better suited for computers than its traditional mobile chips. Intel and AMD chips are nearly all 64-bit and Arm’s lack of capability in this market was seen as a major hurdle to its computer ambitions.Shares in Arm Holdings have risen 74 per cent over the past year, largely on the back of excitement over the company’s chip designs being in the iPad and smartphones. They rose another 5 per cent the day after the HP announcement.Arm has become the highest-rated stock in the semiconductor industry, trading at more than 38 times estimates for next year’s earnings. This is reminiscent of multiples that other chip companies, such as Intel and Qualcomm, had in their heyday.“There is not much in the industry which trades on these multiples, but there are not many companies that have such opportunities,” says Mr James.Nevertheless, Arm still faces a number of challenges. As fast as Arm moves into Intel’s market, Intel is challenging Arm’s mobile-phone dominance. In September, Intel announced an alliance with Google that would see Android-based smartphones optimised for Intel’s chips. HP, meanwhile, has said that it will also experiment with using Intel’s low-power Atom chip for its servers, although these will come a little later than the Arm version.Mr Mushell says Intel cannot be underestimated. “When threats emerge Intel is very good at executing to recapture the market. It has the largest factories and tremendous expertise in processor technology. It can innovate very fast,” he says."
90;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-11-01T19:50:01Z;HP to put Arm chips in servers;;Hewlett-Packard has said it will begin making servers using chip designs from Arm Holdings from next year, the first time the UK company’s architecture will be used in traditional computer hardware in direct competition with Intel.Arm’s low-power designs are used in most mobile phones, and in Apple’s iPad tablet computer. Until now they have not been considered powerful enough to run larger computers and servers. Intel and AMD, which use the x86 architecture for chips, have dominated the server market.However, internet content companies such as Facebook, which run large data centres, are searching for low-power options for their servers as energy prices rise. This has driven HP to experiment with using Arm’s mobile phone technology.“The physical and electrical power requirements are getting to such a scale that you need to look at alternatives. Customers are wrestling with the fact that energy costs are going in just one direction,” said David Chalmers, CTO of Servers, Storage and Networking HP UK.“In London, getting enough power into a data centre inside the M25 is starting to be a constraining issue,” he added.Large data centres can use as much power as a small city, and face additional costs and taxes associated with government carbon reduction targets. Many are looking for creative ways to reduce costs, with Facebook, for example, building a new data warehouse in Lapland because the location offers cheap hydroelectric power and the cold climate means less energy is needed to cool the computers.Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services group, is among the companies evaluating the new low-power servers.“The volume of data processed in financial markets has increased exponentially, and traditional scale-up or scale-out architectures are struggling to keep up with demand without vastly increasing cost and power usage,” said Niall Dalton, director of high-frequency trading at Cantor Fitzgerald.HP said the new servers, to be ready early next year, could use up to 90 per cent less energy and take up 94 per cent less space than current hardware. Mobile phone-style chips not only use less power, but they generate less heat, so servers can be built without bulky cooling fans and heat sinks.HP will also be experimenting with using Intel’s low power chips, known as Atom, and chips from AMD. However, the Arm-based servers will be the first to be made, early next year.Arm and Intel have started to compete more directly with each other over the past few years. Intel created the Atom chip as an attempt to break into the mobile phone market but has failed to gain any traction so far.

We need to focus on excellence now.”She said she had heard from customers who wanted HP to retain the division, which turns a modest profit on more than $40bn in sales. Ms Whitman had hinted that she and the HP board were likely to come to that conclusion. On Thursday, she said the decision was hers but that the board, which has been badly divided on many issues for years, gave unanimous approval.Ms Whitman also said she was not considering whether to reverse another controversial decision by Mr Apotheker, to stop producing tablets and smartphones using HP’s webOS touch-based operating system.Instead, she said her next big decision involved what else to do with that software. She and Todd Bradley, PC division chief, said the possibilities included using it in other HP hardware, selling it off or licensing it to outside manufacturers. “Todd and I are committed to alternative devices, such as tablets and ultra-thin notebooks,” Ms Whitman said.Mr Apotheker’s August announcement that the company would study the merits and probably jettison the PC division angered investors and was one of the main reasons for his exit.The company’s about-face removes the largest uncertainty about its future and ensures it will continue to have the maximum clout when it bargains for components that go into both PCs and servers. It will also maintain a main entryway for selling other gear to business customers.Finally, the move will help the PC business retain employees and shore up its sales to companies, which anecdotal evidence suggested were in jeopardy because of concerns about service and product development.“A quick decision on the outcome was a good move,” said Gartner analyst Mark Fabbi, who had previously recommended that clients weigh the risks before buying their first personal computers.Among the reasons Mr Apotheker cited for a spin-off was the pressure from Apple and its hit iPad tablet. An independent company could move more quickly, he said.Such challenges will make growth difficult, analysts said. “They need to move faster”, said Shaw Wu, and analyst at Sterne Agee. “They may do Android tablets, but even that is not an automatic recipe for success.”Also, on Thursday, shares in Advanced Micro Devices, the PC chipmaker, rose 8 per cent in after-hours trading on news that the company had surpassed analysts’ expectations on revenue and earnings for the third quarter. Net income was $97m, compared to a $118m loss in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose to $1.69bn from $1.62bn the year before.Additional reporting by Richard Waters
92;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-10-18T22:53:42Z;Record revenues and profits boost Intel;;Intel beat Wall Street expectations with record quarterly revenues and profits as sales of its processors for data centres and notebook PCs boomed.However, sales of its low-power Atom microprocessors fell 32 per cent as the netbook market fell sharply in the face of competition from tablets such as Apple’s iPad 2.The world’s biggest chipmaker by sales reported revenues of $14.3bn, well ahead of the consensus of analyst forecasts of $13.9bn, while profits of 65 cents a share beat expectations of 61 cents.Intel shares rose as much as 5 per cent to $24.60 in extended trading in New York on the news.The Silicon Valley company has benefited from the growing strength of emerging markets, enterprises updating equipment and the roll out of servers in new data centres, despite growth in the consumer PC and notebook market slowing.Stacy Smith, chief financial officer, said: “It was a phenomenal financial quarter.“We are seeing emerging markets driving significant unit growth and …in the data centres, as we see this explosion of devices that are connecting to the internet driving the build out of the internet cloud, we think we are uniquely positioned to benefit from that trend.”On the sharp decline in Atom revenues, Mr Smith said consumers were moving away from netbooks and were more attracted to notebooks – now available at lower prices. He told the Financial Times that tablets were also eating into the netbook market and had become “the new refresh device” when consumers looked to upgrade their equipment.The company has yet to make an impact with its chips in tablets or smartphones, while the first ultrabooks – thinner, lighter notebooks aimed at rivalling tablets – are only starting to appear in the current quarter. Paul Otellini, chief executive, said more than 70 models were in the pipeline.Revenues in Intel’s core PC client group were up 22 per cent year-on-year to $9.4bn. This compares to just 3.6 per cent unit growth in PC shipments in the third quarter, as reported by the IDC research company last week.Intel may have benefited from the travails of its main rival AMD, which warned last month that growth in its third-quarter revenues would be half of what it expected after problems at GlobalFoundries, where the chips are manufactured.Intel’s record overall revenues of $14.3bn, up 28 per cent on a year earlier, included contributions from the acquisition of the McAfee security software company and chipmaker Infineon’s mobile business. However, Mr Smith said revenue growth was still 17 per cent excluding the acquisitions.Intel forecast that revenues would grow to about $14.7bn in the fourth quarter, ahead of analyst forecasts of $14.2bn, according to Bloomberg, with gross margins of about 65 per cent. The company has authorised a further $10bn to buy back shares.

Mr Ahmed has not been accused by the government of any wrongdoing. His lawyer has previously said his client would be exonerated.Adam Smith, a former Galleon portfolio manager who pleaded guilty to insider trading, testified this year during Mr Rajaratnam’s trial that he learnt about takeover deals from Mr Ahmed when they occasionally met for lunch.Mr Smith worked with Mr Ahmed at Morgan Stanley, where they became friends, before he left to join Galleon. In 2006, Mr Smith testified that he met Mr Ahmed for lunch in California and learnt that Advanced Micro Devices was in talks to acquire ATI Technologies.Immediately following the lunch, Mr Smith testified, he called Mr Rajaratnam and passed on the information. He also testified that he learnt that Integrated Device Technology was in talks to acquire Integrated Circuit Systems in early 2005 from Mr Ahmed.Prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have not charged Mr Ahmed with any wrongdoing. To prove that he was part of the scheme, prosecutors would need to show that he knew Mr Smith was trading on the information.

It would have spawned an interesting strain of management literature about the virtues of amateurism and make-do-and-mend improvisation.Instead, Britons are condemned to suffer the comparison between Scott’s failed expedition and that of the efficient, well-prepared and Antarctic-ice-cool Norwegian Roald Amundsen, replayed again and again as a lesson to business leaders.Jim Collins, one of the most successful management writers of the past two decades, and Morten Hansen, a Norwegian-born Insead and Berkeley professor, start their new book with the familiar tale.Amundsen, they write, displayed all the attributes of companies that thrive in chaos – “fanatic discipline”, “empirical creativity” and “productive paranoia”. Scott, on the other hand, “left himself unprepared and complained in his journal about his bad luck”.Hansen was part of the research team on previous Collins books Built to Last (written with Jerry Porras) and Good to Great. He gets equal billing for this one, but – Norwegian flag-waving aside – it still looks like a Collins production. Methodical research (into “6,000 years of combined corporate history”) provides a clutch of paired companies: in this case, seven that beat their industry index by at least 10 times over a period of at least 15 years, and seven that did not.These examples yield five or six key lessons, rendered memorable by quirky catchphrases. Where Built to Last introduced readers to Big Hairy Audacious Goals and Great to Good offered us the Hedgehog Concept and the Doom Loop, brace yourself to learn here about 10Xers (those outperforming companies), the 20 Mile March and the SMaC Recipe.These are the irritating tunes you’ll be unable to get out of your head after the show, but they accompany a credible plot. Leaders succeed in a turbulent world not by taking bolder risks, promoting more innovation, acting faster, changing their companies more radically or having more luck than their competitors, the authors claim. Instead, they pace themselves by making regular advances: they don’t over-reach when the going is fair; they don’t slack off when the going is tough (the 20 Mile March). They stay specific, methodical and consistent (“SMaC”), basing their strategy on proved elements.As they write in the epilogue: “We sense a dangerous disease infecting our modern culture and eroding hope: an increasingly prevalent view that greatness owes more to circumstance, even luck, than to action and discipline – that what happens to us matters more than what we do.”In the most interesting chapter, Collins and Hansen try to quantify and analyse the role of luck. The paired companies experienced similar doses of good and bad fortune, they find, but the 10Xers made more of the ups and (because they rebounded more strongly), the downs. They worked harder and generated a higher “return on luck”.AMD, compared here with Intel, squandered its good luck in the mid-1990s by failing to bring to market a new generation of microprocessors quickly enough. Microsoft’s Bill Gates, meanwhile, “didn’t just get a lucky break and cash in his chips”, but “kept pushing, driving, working” towards his goals.Collins has learnt from his own experience. In the 10 years since Good to Great was published, the 11 case studies have not all held up well. But Great by Choice insulates its chosen companies from retrospective criticism. By using the period 1975 to 2002, for instance, the authors can focus on Microsoft’s success against a floundering Apple, despite the pair’s more recent reversal of fortune.Great by Choice’s praise for corporate evolution over revolution is not as groundbreaking as its authors suggest. But it is a sensible, well-timed and precisely targeted message for companies shaken by macroeconomic crises."

AMR ended the day down 33 per cent at $1.98 on speculation that the company may file for bankruptcy.A sell-off in big bank stocks followed almost immediately afterwards. Citigroup led fallers down 9.8 per cent to $23.11, Bank of America fell 9.6 per cent to $5.53, a full 47 cents below its previous year low. Goldman Sachs was down 4.7 per cent to $90.08. All three stocks were at levels not seen since March or April 2009.Morgan Stanley fell to a level not seen since December 2008. The stock was down 7.7 per cent to $12.47, amid heavy trading in options.In just three hours of trading, open interest in $5 October puts on Morgan Stanley – giving buyers the right to sell 100 Morgan Stanley shares for $5 in October – increased by a factor of five to 24,000. The cost of $5 October puts doubled from 12 to 25 cents during the day.The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose to 558 basis points at the close of the New York Session, up 72bp. That equates to $558,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years.Bank of America CDS rose 30bp to an all-time wide spread of 446bp, while Citigroup rose 33bp to 348bp.Shell-shocked banking analysts were at a loss to explain the falls.“I left for lunch at midday and things were quiet, I came back and the bottom had fallen out of banks,” Christopher Mustacio at Stifel Nicolaus said.Tentative explanations ranged from the reports about American Airlines, although the company’s $11bn is unlikely to sink a bank, to exposures to Europe, where Franco-Belgian bank Dexia had been downgraded, before markets opened.But all analysts agreed the falls did not reflect the fundamentals. “Investors are afraid of 2008, there’s a sell first, ask questions later attitude,” said Mr Mustacio.Dan Greenhouse, chief investment strategist BTIG, said investors might be “derisking in case the S&P 500 breaks through 1,100, because a lot of people think it will fall a lot more if it does”.And therein lies the importance of the 1,100 figure. Although the S&P 500 has suffered heavy selling during August and July, the 1,100 had served as a signal for bargain hunters to pour back in to the market. When the benchmark index touched its previous year intraday low of 1,101.54 on August 9, it rebounded immediately, closing the day at 1,172.88.On Monday, the barrier was broken in the last minutes of trading, holding out hopes for a quick bounce on Tuesday.But Monday’s losses leaves the S&P 500 perilously close to bear market territory, signalled by a fall of 20 per cent from a previous cyclical high. The benchmark index is down 19.4 per cent since its April 29 peak.Shares in trust banks also fell sharply, after Sanford Bernstein Research evaluated the revenue impact of a flatter yield curve on lending margins, and revenue from reinvested earnings.Bank of New York Mellon fell 4.7 per cent to $17.72, State Street lost 5.5 per cent to $30.40 and Northern Trust Corporation retreated 2.8 per cent to $34.01.Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said earnings per share at all three institutions could suffer a 3-4 per cent hit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 per cent to 10,665.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.3 per cent to 2335.83.Yahoo jumped 2.7 per cent to $13.53 as Wall Street had its first chance to react to news of a potential bid that broke after the markets closed Friday.Jack Ma, chairman of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, which is 40 per cent owned by Yahoo and controls Yahoo China, told an audience at Stanford university that he was “very, very interested” in buying Yahoo.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 8.4 per cent to $57.90 as analysts weighed the company’s sales of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch I and 550MW Desert Sunlight plants, immediately after securing government loan guarantees on Friday.Micron Technology, a volatile semiconductor stock that suffered heavy selling last week after poor quarterly results, was down a further 14.1 per cent to $4.33, the first time the stock has broken through the $5 level since 2009. Fellow semi stock Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.8 per cent to $4.53 as fallout from weak quarterly results last week continued.Frontier Communications fell 7.4 per cent to $5.66 after Macquarie recommended that clients sell the stock due to the telecommunications group’s dependence on high-yield debt funding.Pharmaceutical Product Development jumped some 25.8 per cent to $32.28 after confirming that it would be acquired by Carlyle Group and Hellman & Friedman in a $3.9bn cash deal.Energy and industrial stocks linked to global economic growth, however, sold off heavily.Wynn Resorts fell 0.7 per cent to $114.32. The company is down by a third in just two weeks, on fears of a decline in junket tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macau, which accounts for up to a third of the company’s revenue.
96;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-09-30T21:00:01Z;Doctors face pressure to use cheaper eye drug;;Doctors are coming under growing budgetary pressure to prescribe a cancer drug for patients with a severe eye disease instead of a more expensive authorised alternative – despite potential side-effects.The General Medical Council, the doctors’ disciplinary body, is poised to release new guidelines this year which could provide prescribers with more freedom to use medicines beyond their officially approved uses.Under certain circumstances doctors are already allowed to prescribe drugs “off label” when treating patients for whom the products have not been rigorously tested.The rules allow for licensed medicines to be given in doses or among groups of patients, such as children, for which clinical proof is often limited, as well as “unlicensed” medicines which have not been authorised for particular diseases.Existing GMC guidance says doctors should “be satisfied that [a medicine] would better serve the patient’s needs than an appropriately licensed alternative”. The draft revision issued this year, which has triggered concern it is too lenient, says they should be “satisfied, on the basis of authoritative clinical guidance, that it is as safe and effective as an appropriately licensed alternative”.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: “We proposed this change as a result of inquiries from doctors, medical directors and commissioners about the opportunity costs of prescribing expensive licensed medicines when more cost-effective, off-label options are recommended by Nice [National Institute for Clinical Excellence].”Several commissioning bodies overseeing at least 20 English primary care trusts (PCTs) have recommended a switch to Avastin rather than the related but costlier medicine Lucentis – the only drug authorised by Royal College of Ophthalmologists to treat the condition of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) – a cause of blindness.The safety of the treatment has been questioned by ophthalmologists as well as by Roche and Novartis, the drug companies which jointly developed and sell both medicines.Clara Eaglen, policy and campaigns manager at the Royal National Institute for the Blind, said: “We’re fully aware of the financial pressures facing the NHS, but . . . safety is paramount and PCTs should not abandon evidence-based medicine and prescribe Avastin off label for quick financial gain.”Responding to the sharp difference in price of two drugs, prescribers have split vials of Avastin into multiple doses to be used in the far smaller quantities required to inject into the eye to treat AMD – and at a fraction of the price.Lucentis, known generically as ranibizumab, costs nearly £900 for an injection, compared with £50 for Avastin (bevacizumab) in equivalent quantities, according to estimates from the North East Treatment Advisory group. A typical treatment requires up to 14 injections over two years.Pharmacists say they are supplying 20,000 doses a year of Avastin for AMD, while the NHS is paying £130m a year for Lucentis.Initial findings comparing the two drugs suggested that they were equally effective at treating AMD but Novartis has criticised the studies for being too small too identify rare side-effects. Cases of infection have been identified in AMD patients using Avastin, which is a modified version designed to remain in the body far longer than Lucentis.The Ship cluster, which represents primary care trusts across Hampshire, voted on Tuesday to encourage doctors to prescribe Avastin for AMD to generate savings of up to £5m a year.“It would save money [and] achieve equivalent outcomes,” according to the board briefing document.Stockport primary care trust has provided Lucentis in its own centres while offering to pay for patients to receive Avastin in private clinics with shorter waiting times, in a move it estimates will save £1.8m this financial year.Cathy Yelf, head of external relations at the Macular Disease Society, said: “Everybody is talking about it. We’re quite clear that we would rather people have Lucentis. But the cost differential is so enormous that with the circumstances PCTs are finding themselves in, it’s completely understandable.”Dr Nick Lee, a consultant ophthalmologist with the Hillingdon Hospital, who helps run Lucentis clinical trials supported by Novartis, said he and colleagues in west London had written to their health trust in the spring warning that they would not prescribe Avastin for AMD.“It is very difficult for us clinicians to support a drug, purely on economic grounds, that is also inferior.”Novartis and Roche, which say they have spent large sums developing and testing Lucentis specifically for AMD, have no incentive or legal requirement to study the relative safety and efficacy of Avastin, so the clinical trials examining the two drugs currently under way have been funded by public bodies including the US National Eye Institute.Tim Cave, medical director for the company in the UK, said it was considering reducing the price of Lucentis. He added: “We’re worried that in looking at efficiency people are throwing out the principle of keeping patients safe.”

It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things,” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.Other analysts blamed the divergence between the two indices on mutual fund managers taking profits, and dumping less well-known stocks, before they have to declare quarter-end positions to their clients.A mixed performance by semiconductor stocks captured the week’s other theme of strongly backing outperformers and dumping laggards.Chip-manufacturer Jabil Circuit was up 6.3 per cent for the week to $17.79, after eking out impressive earnings-per-share growth for the quarter ended August 31.For other semiconductor stocks, stagnant sales dominated. Micron Technology fell 23.4 per cent for the week to $5.04. The stock fell 14 per cent on Friday after Micron declared a quarterly loss of 14 cents, on falling sales of Dram memory components to computer manufacturers.Micron’s rival Advanced Micro Devices was down 20.6 per cent for the week to $5.08, after its own quarterly results, published on Thursday, showed the company had failed to make an impression in the growing tablet market.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, often watched as an indicator of global industrial health, because semiconductors are used in everything from solar panels to smartphones, was down 5.9 per cent for the week.The week had started brightly, with the S&P 500 up above 1,190 at one point on Tuesday on hopes of a comprehensive deal on eurozone sovereign debt. But the rally reversed on reports of disagreements between European countries over further writedowns for private holders of Greek debt.Since the index dipped below 1,200 at the start of August, it has traded in a narrow band between 1,100 and 1,220, with volatile rallies and sell-offs quickly reversed.“The longer issues in Europe remain unresolved, the more nervous the market will get, and the S&P 500 could break below 1,100 even without big news,” said Channing Smith, director of equity strategies at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were up 1 per cent for the week, more than any other sector. Life assurers were the main beneficiaries, with Genworth Financial up 7.7 per cent for the week to $5.74.Most big banks also fared well, with Citigroup up 2.5 per cent for the week to $25.61. But Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $6.12, only 12 cents off its year-low. BofA dropped certain claims against the Lehman Brothers estate to resolve its long-running bankruptcy case.Other highly cyclical stocks fell. Material stocks were down 2 per cent, over continued concerns about falling Chinese demand if the world economy stagnates.Alpha Natural Resources, the metallurgical coal supplier which is dependent on Chinese demand for steel, fell 13.2 per cent to $17.69. ANR’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent since the start of August.Gaming group Wynn Resorts continued its recent sharp decline, falling 17 per cent over the week to $115.08. The stock has suffered from rumours of declining tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macao, although data suggest Macao arrivals remain robust.Big tech stocks, which have outperformed other cyclical stocks during market volatility this quarter, also had a rough week. Apple fell 5.7 per cent to $381.32 and Google fell 2 per cent to $515.04.Consumer staple stocks outperformed consumer discretionary stocks, and utilities were up, in a sign that investors were buying defensively even as the broad index rose.Ingersoll-Rand was down 11.1 per cent for the week to $27.56. The stock fell 13.8 per cent on Friday after the company cut its earnings per share guidance for the current quarter by more than 10 per cent.Netflix fell 12.4 per cent to $113.27. The market capitalisation of the video streaming and DVD delivery company halved in September after it had lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after a price hike.

It was sandwiched by the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 1.3 per cent to 11153.91, and the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 0.4 per cent to 2,480.76.“Investors are heading to the safety of names offering quality and yield,” said Andrew Wilkinson, Chief Economic Strategist at Miller Tabak.“Risks appear to be rising as the month ends: Not something that was on the cards first thing this morning,”In the first minutes of trading the S&P had surged 2 per cent on news that the latest eurozone bailout packaged had passed a key vote in the German parliament, and an upward revision to second quarter growth data.Financials led the way, eventually closing up 2.8 per cent with life insurers faring particularly well.Genworth Financial closed up 7.8 per cent to $6.00 and Lincoln National Corporation up 5.6 per cent to $16.46.Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 6.6 per cent to $15.09 and rival Goldman Sachs was up 3.7 per cent to $99.87, although Deutsche Bank predicted Goldman would delcare a loss this quarter.Discover Financial Services, the Illinois-based credit card company, fell 1.2 per cent to $23.60 after revealing regulators plan to bring an enforcement case over its marketing of fee-based products.But it was a strange rally, with defensive utility stocks the second best performing sector in the S&P 500, ending the day up 1.5 per cent, and cyclical consumer discretionary and tech stocks down, 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Advanced Micro, a semiconductor manufacturer, which supplies personal computer companies, fell 13.7 per cent to $5.31 after the California-based company reduced its forecast for quarterly revenue and gross margins.“We believe AMD had a tremendous opportunity to gain revenue share in notebooks this year,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote to clients. “However, a lack of component supply has been a major impediment to growth and will probably not be resolved in the near term.”Fellow semiconductor stock Micron Technology, which was set to declare results after the bell Thursday, was also down 4.1 per cent to $5.87.Consumer discretionary stocks were led down by internet stocks Amazon, off 3.2 per cent to $222.44 and Netflix, down 10.9 per cent to $113.19.James Cordwell, tech analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Netflix was suffering a “slow bleed” because of investor uncertainty over the company’s strategy, in the wake of a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses.Several traders speculated that mutual funds were dumping small cap and less well known stocks ahead of the quarter end, when they will have to reveal holidings to clients.But others said the move to more liquid, highly traded stocks, made strategic sense.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things.” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.US-listed Chinese stocks had a rough day after the Securities and Exchange Commission said the Justice Department is looking into allegations of accounting fraud.Sina Corporation, the e-commerce and social networking site, fell 9.7 per cent to $73.23. Youku, the recently listed video-streaming website fell 18.3 per cent to $16.25.Edwards LifeSciences tumbled after the administrator of the government’s Medicare and Medicaid programmes dealt a blow to hopes of a rapid roll-out for its new cardiovascular device.The medical device manufacturer is banking on strong revenue from its transcatheter aortic-valve implant (TAVI) device, a treatment for aortic stenosis – a heart disorder – that does not involve an operation.On Thursday, the Centre for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) began the process for considering covering TAVI under the government’s health programmes.CMS approval would normally lead to private insurers following suit.But CMS suggested that trials be limited to patients deemed inoperable rather than include patients seeking an alternative to operations.“We think TAVI will deliver very good growth for Edwards in the long-term,” said Jason Mills, medical devices analyst at Cannacord Genuity. “But we think the consensus expectations on Wall Street have been too agressive on rollout in the first few years and that’s what’s suggested by CMS today.”Edwards shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.87.Mosaic, the phosphate and potash producer, fell 5.2 per cent to $54.20 after reporting earnings of $1.17 a share for the quarter ended August 31.
99;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-09-28T23:22:17Z;AMD warns of slowing revenue growth;;AMD, the second-largest PC microprocessor maker, warned that growth in its third-quarter revenues would be half of what it expected following chipmaking problems.The news drove its shares down more than 8 per cent to $5.64 in extended trading in New York on Wednesday.The Silicon Valley company said production quality levels or “yield” at its Globalfoundries plant in Dresden, Germany, had affected the ramping up of production of its Llano processors, made with circuits just 32 billionths of a metre wide. Supplies of 45-nanometre chips had also been hit by manufacturing problems.As a result, the company expects to announce revenue growth of about 5 per cent compared with the second quarter, when it reports third-quarter earnings on October 27. Its previous guidance was for 10 per cent growth.Gross margins are expected to be 44 to 45 per cent, compared with its earlier forecast of 47 per cent, due to fewer of the higher-margin Llano chips being sold.Margins have also been affected by shipments of its next-generation server processor, codenamed Interlagos, happening later in the quarter than anticipated.AMD divides the PC microprocessor market with Intel, but its bigger rival had a 79.3 per cent market share in the second quarter, with AMD gaining 1.5 percentage points on the first quarter to 20.4 per cent, according to the IDC research firm.
100;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-09-02T08:51:55Z;Setback for ‘off label’ use of Roche drug;;Efforts by doctors to undercut high prices on Roche’s blockbuster eye drug Lucentis have been set back by reports of infections in patients receiving a cheaper but unapproved alternative.The New York Times reported that the US Veteran’s Administration said it had switched to using Lucentis at its Los Angeles centre following five cases of patients losing their sight after receiving small quantities of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin prescribed “off label” – without formal regulatory approval – to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) of the eye.It follows an alert on Tuesday from the Food and Drug Administration that 12 patients seeking AMD treatment had developed serious eye infections after receiving injections of Avastin from a centre in Florida, and reports earlier this year of four patients treated by the Veterans’ Administration system in Nashville contracting infections.Avastin – known generically as bevacizumab – is approved by regulators for treating cancer, but many health systems have encouraged “splitting” of the product into the far smaller quantities required to treat AMD, rather than using Roche’s related compound Lucentis – known generically as ranibizumab – which is approved for AMD, but much more expensive.Where Lucentis sells in the US at $2,000 per injection, Avastin split into up to 16 doses for AMD costs as little as $50 per injection, triggering wide-ranging off-label use as health insurers including the state-backed Medicaid and Veterans’ Administration seek to save money.Eye specialists at the US National Institutes of Health have even funded their own clinical trial suggesting comparable efficacy and safety of the two products, although Roche and Novartis – its European partner for Lucentis – have questioned the reliability of the data.The pharmaceutical companies have argued that the two products are distinct, and warned that splitting a single vial of Avastin for multiple AMD patients is both more expensive and brings a greater risk of infection than critics of Lucentis claim.The FDA has not warned against the practice, but said: “Health care professionals should be aware that repackaging sterile drugs without proper aseptic technique can compromise product sterility, potentially putting the patient at risk for microbial infections. Health care professionals should ensure that drug products are obtained from appropriate, reliable sources and properly administered.”Roche said: “Avastin is not FDA-approved for intravitreal use in the eye and we do not support or promote the off-label intravitreal use of Avastin for disorders of the eye.”
101;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Chiesi sentenced to 30 months;;"Danielle Chiesi, the former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader and ex-beauty queen who became the star of the government’s insider trading case against Raj Rajaratnam, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for her involvement in the Galleon Group founder’s scheme.Ms Chiesi, who pleaded guilty to three conspiracy charges in January, never testified against Mr Rajaratnam but stole the show during his trial as jurors listened to dozens of recorded phone calls between the two.Her court appearance on Wednesday marked the first sentencing of a major defendant in the case. As part of her plea bargain, the US government had agreed a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months, at the discretion of the judge.“The message to Wall Street needs to be loud and clear: If you trade on inside information, you will be caught; if convicted, you will be sentenced to prison,” said Richard Holwell, the federal judge who pronounced the sentence.Ms Chiesi, who wore a pale pink sleeveless silk dress and a pearl necklace, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.“It won’t happen again,” she told the judge just before being sentenced. Her lawyers had asked the judge for leniency, saying that Ms Chiesi was manipulated by Mark Kurland, her former boss and lover, who was the first defendant sentenced in the case.Mr Rajaratnam was convicted in May and faces a September 27 sentencing, also by Judge Holwell.Prosecutors called Ms Chiesi the “consummate Wall Street insider”. They said she would use her charm and physical appeal to talk up powerful sources, getting inside tips about corporate activity that she would then pass on.In a statement as part of her plea bargain in January, Ms Chiesi told the judge she was “deeply ashamed” and apologised to the many people she said she had hurt, including her family. She said she did not personally profit from the trades.Prosecutors said Ms Chiesi had made $4m from illegal trades involving technology companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Akamai Technologies and IBM."
102;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-07-06T06:23:58Z;AstraZeneca unit loses patent rights;;"An English judge has dealt a blow to AstraZeneca by overruling the patent rights of MedImmune, its subsidiary, to a screening technique used in drugs including Roche’s blockbuster eye treatment drug ranibizumab.The High Court ruled that MedImmune’s two patents were invalid, clearing the way for Roche and Novartis, its European marketing partner, to produce the drug without paying royalties to their Anglo-Swedish rival.The intellectual property dispute between MedImmune and Novartis could have serious financial implications for AstraZeneca, which is fighting the same issue in other European courts.The dispute centred on a biotechnology screening method called “phage display” on which MedImmune and the UK Medical Research Council had claimed intellectual property rights.A judgment in MedImmune’s favour would have been a blow to the commercial prospects for ranibizumab, known by its brand Lucentis, which treats age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye condition.However, Mr Justice Arnold rejected the claim brought by MedImmune against Novartis on Lucentis, concluding in a 261-page judgment: “As MedImmune concedes, it follows that both patents are invalid.”Lawyers said the case was important because the ruling had invalidated two patents for lack of inventive step and priority date. Pharmaceutical companies that may be paying to use the screening method will be watching this finding.The UK was the first jurisdiction to rule on the case, which is set to be appealed, but the two companies are also litigating over the patent rights in other countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.AstraZeneca said: “We continue to believe that the patents are valid and infringed by Novartis’ activities in respect of Lucentis; accordingly, MedImmune will be seeking permission to appeal.” Novartis declined to comment.Genentech, now controlled by Roche, has been marketing Lucentis, while licensing the rights to the drug in Europe to Novartis. Its control over the AMD market has been weakened by a study funded by the US federal National Eye Institute, which argued that Avastin, a similar and cheaper drug, was just as effective.Analysts have also cautioned that Lucentis faces fresh competition from aflibercept, Regeneron and Bayer’s drug."
103;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Bear Stearns trader ‘controlled by lover’;;Lawyers for Danielle Chiesi, the former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader who pleaded guilty to insider trading, say she was manipulated by her ex-lover and are asking a judge for leniency when she is sentenced later this month.Ms Chiesi is facing 37 to 46 months in prison for allegedly obtaining inside information from senior executives at IBM and Advanced Micro Devices and sharing it with her boss, Mark Kurland, Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon Group, and others.Ms Chiesi “was motivated by an unhealthy and abnormal desire to please, or conversely, by an extreme need to avoid rejection and abandonment,” her doctor said, according to court filings.“The primary focus of this was Mark Kurland,” her lover for 20 years until her October 2009 arrest, according to the filing.Mr Kurland, who pleaded guilty to insider trading, was sentenced to 27 months in prison. Ms Chiesi’s lawyers are asking for a lighter sentence. Prosecutors said the range of 37 to 46 months is “appropriate” for Ms Chiesi’s role in the scheme saying she was “not merely Kurland’s minion”.Ms Chiesi did not testify against Mr Rajaratnam but was a constant presence during his two-month trial as the jury heard her voice recorded during phone conversations. The calls revealed both her bravado and insecurity.Her lawyers allege Mr Kurland controlled her by offering just enough praise when she obtained company secrets and then belittling her knowledge of financial statements.He also controlled her compensation when she worked for him at New Castle Partners, a hedge fund owned by Bear Stearns. She joined New Castle in 1996 after they had already been romantically involved for three years, according to the court filing. Mr Kurland’s lawyer could not be reached.Ms Chiesi obtained information from executives at IBM and AMD with whom she was having an affair, according to her lawyers, prosecutors and court testimony.Billy, Ms Chiesi’s boyfriend, accuses Mr Kurland of engaging in “psychological exploitation” to turn “Dani” into his “virtual servant”, according to court filings that quote a letter submitted by Billy, with no last name given.At one point Mr Kurland relocated Ms Chiesi to San Francisco after his wife learnt of the affair, the filing says.Her lawyers say it was these psychological and emotional forces, not greed, that impacted Ms Chiesi’s actions.Ms Chiesi has struggled since her arrest, her lawyers said, and was once involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility for her “destructive behaviour”.Her therapist has diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder, according to the court filing.
104;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;PC makers step up efforts to combat iPad;;The fightback by PC makers against Apple’s iPad intensifies this week as new products and prototypes go on show at Computex, the world’s second-biggest consumer electronics trade fair, which opens on Tuesday in Taipei.PC makers have seen sales fall in the past year as consumers have flocked to the iPad. Now, more than a year after the iPad’s launch, they hope to hit back with their own tablet models and notebooks and netbooks.HP, Acer, Asus and Lenovo are among PC makers expected to unveil new tablet and notebook PC models at Computex.Chipmakers such as Intel, Nvidia, AMD and Arm will reveal plans for chips that would allow for more powerful and less battery-intensive mobile devices.These products represent a two-pronged strategy by PC makers: on the one hand, a big push to revive consumer excitement in laptops, and, on the other, to compete head-on with Apple’s iPad 2 tablet with either cheaper or more creatively designed versions of their own.Another focus of the show is likely to be PC makers’ plans for notebooks or tablets based on Chrome, Google’s operating system that was previewed by the internet company in May.A number of hardware makers have already started selling their tablets, such as Acer’s Iconia, the Eee Pad Transformer by Asus, and Motorola’s Xoom.However, while some models, such as that of Asus, have been selling well in the US, total sales volumes of these rival tablets are still far behind those of the iPad. None have captured consumers’ imaginations in the same way.This has been partly due to supply constraints for high-end touch screens as a result of the disruption caused by the Japan earthquake.Lenovo, which launched its LePad in China in late March, said on Thursday it was facing a supply shortage. The LePad, which will launch in the US in July, is being manufactured by Compal and Wistron of Taiwan.Whatever the sales figures for tablets – and estimates vary wildly – reviving consumer interest in notebook PCs is also becoming increasingly urgent.Research firms are providing hard evidence that consumers are showing less commitment towards forms of computing other than tablets.Global desktop and notebook PC sales declined slightly in the first quarter to 81.3m units down from 81.6m a year earlier, according to a report by the IHS iSuppli research firm last week.However, Acer, the number three PC maker and one that relies more than others on netbooks, saw its shipments fall by 20 per cent year-on-year as that category’s appeal faded in the face of competition from tablets.“IHS believes that the jury is still out on exactly how much tablets are cannibalising PC sales,” Matthew Wilkins, principal analyst for compute platforms research at IHS said.“However, the rising number of tablet models on the market, along with certain high-profile product launches during the first quarter, caused confusion among consumers as to exactly how to view the tablet platform relative to the PC platform,” he added.IHS iSuppli predicts shipments of traditional PC-style tablets will be outstripped 10 to one by media tablets such as the iPad over the next five years with 889m of such tablets shipped by 2015 compared with 89m PC tablets.However, it thinks PC makers could benefit from new hybrid formats, such as where tablets can be docked with keyboards and turned into laptops.Asus, which has enjoyed success with its Eee Pad Transformer tablet, on Monday unveiled the Padfone, a design for a smartphone that could be fitted into a tablet. It also said its next Eee PC netbook, which would run on the Meego operating system or on Windows, would be sold at $199.Intel sees notebook PCs being completely reinvented over the next two years to fend off the challenge from tablets.At its analyst day this month, Paul Otellini, chief executive, said notebook PCs would become more mainstream-priced consumer electronics devices. In a description that sounded like Apple’s MacBook Air, he said they would become “ultra-thin, ultra-capable” portable devices with all-day battery life, higher performance than the fastest laptops, instant-on capabilities, touch features and constant internet connectivity.Intel sees low to mid-teens percentage growth in PC sales continuing over the next several years as they become more affordable in emerging markets. On average, it took 175 weeks of income to buy a notebook computer in China in 1995 but this was down to seven weeks by last year.Acer likewise sees greater opportunities in notebooks than in tablets. Oliver Ahrens, head of Acer China, said so far demand for its Iconia tablet appeared very strong but it would wait to see if that continued before it made a strong production push.“We see notebooks as a content creation device and tablets as a content consumption device, so we expect notebooks to remain very strong,” said Mr Ahrens. “In the past, consumers have had to replace their notebook every 18 months because of the processor and software upgrades and I am not clear about how consumers will be convinced to replace their tablets at the same frequency.”He added that the Android operating system had yet to become more attractive to consumers. “It is not sexy enough,” he said.
105;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-05-15T18:47:46Z;The walls have ears;Insider trading: After the Raj Rajaratnam case, illicit information will be swapped by other means;"Unbeknown to Danielle Chiesi, the financial world was just weeks away from collapse. It was late August 2008 and the hedge fund trader had something rather more particular on her mind. Having gleaned secret corporate information about Advanced Micro Devices, Ms Chiesi’s worry was that she would attract the authorities’ attention when trading in the chipmaker’s shares. So she turned to her trusted ally, Raj Rajaratnam.“Do you think that I should be showing a pattern of trading AMD?” Ms Chiesi asked the founder and head of the Galleon hedge fund firm, according to a secretly recorded wiretap. “I think you should buy and sell, and buy and sell, you know,” was Mr Rajaratnam’s response, the recording shows.That trick and half a dozen others were revealed during the recently concluded trial of Mr Rajaratnam. But they did not save him from being convicted last week on 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud. He could be given up to 19 years in prison when he is sentenced this summer.The case has shed new light on the cat-and-mouse game that plays out daily on Wall Street and in the City of London. High-flying traders are using ever more sophisticated technology – pay-and-throw-away mobile phones, instant messages and social networking sites – to ferret out information, while “expert network” consultancies that offer access to corporate insiders are springing up to help them.Authorities are also stepping up their game, using sophisticated data mining, dawn raids and – in the US – wiretaps and body microphones, techniques traditionally reserved for Mafia cases and violent crime. Their use of wiretaps has also expanded to other white-collar crimes and is being adopted by prosecutors across the country. Top enforcers on both sides of the Atlantic are also calling for longer prison sentences as a way to increase deterrence.“They have escalated financial crime to the level of vice and drug crime. It is no longer seen as a crime that doesn’t impact people,” says Julian Korek of Kinetic Partners, a regulatory consultancy.Not only did the financial crisis shake the confidence of investors in the system, but evidence is also mounting that well-connected insiders such as Mr Rajaratnam have routinely been trading ahead of corporate announcements, creaming off profits that would otherwise go to ordinary “buy and hold” investors. Official statistics show that abnormal trading consistently occurs ahead of one in every three or four deals involving larger London-listed companies, and academic studies suggest the problem is equally rife on Wall Street.Authorities hope their victory in the Galleon case will be an important first step towards changing that behaviour. Other cases are pending; the US attorney’s office in Manhattan has charged more than 45 people with insider trading in the past 18 months. In the UK, where insider dealing enforcement has historically lagged behind, the Financial Services Authority last winter convicted its first ever active banker and has several cases pending.By jailing dozens of bankers, traders and consultants, and bringing charges in both the US and the UK, they hope to impress on the entire financial services sector – not just top banks – that it must take insider dealing seriously. “For organised criminality, there is a lot of money to be made here,” says Tracey McDermott, acting head of FSA enforcement. “The risks are getting higher, but what will really make the key insiders sit up is when we bring home our biggest cases – and we’re getting there.”Some signs exist that the message is starting to get through. Hedge funds and private equity firms are spending more on training and compliance, and mutual funds – some of the biggest buyers of information – are scrambling to figure out exactly where the boundaries lie on insider information.“This case has already affected everyone …from portfolio managers, analysts and employees, officers, and directors of public companies, including both the buy side and the sell side. It has already started to happen. Everyone is much more tight-lipped these days,” says Ron Geffner at Sadis & Goldberg, a New York law firm.Two rounds of high-profile police raids last year – one in London in March and another in New York and Connecticut in November – sent additional chills through many in the industry. However the jury is decidedly still out on whether Wall Street’s behaviour will really change. Every generation of traders seems to have its own big insider trading scandal, dating back to the case of Ivan Boesky in the 1980s. “Like a lot of things in the hedge fund industry, people have a kneejerk reaction and then the memory fades,” says a consultant who advises hedge funds. “I still think it’s a pretty fraternal industry, which means people are still chatty.”Would-be insider traders bet they will not be caught. Agents investigating the crime must review millions of pages of documents and trading records to match trades with tips.Compliance officials say they can tell the traders are becoming smarter – but not necessarily more honest. More often than not, when a regulated firm is asked by authorities to hand over the tape of a suspiciously timed phone call involving an employee, the first words that come up are: “Dude, call my private mobile.”…The Galleon case shed light on some of the strategies already in use. Days before his arrest, Mr Rajaratnam instructed a McKinsey consultant who was one of his tipsters to use prepaid cellphones to hide their tracks. Government wiretaps also caught him telling an underling to create an e-mail chain that would show they had discussed investing in Spansion, a Californian technology company, to hide the fact that his interest had been sparked by a tip from the same consultant.Adam Smith, a Galleon portfolio manager, testified that he destroyed his laptop after Mr Rajaratnam was arrested. In another case, a former trader with SAC Capital of Connecticut is captured on tape describing to a friend, who was wearing a body wire, how he broke his flash drives into multiple pieces and during a midnight stroll around Manhattan threw them into four separate waste trucks.“The one thing that this case will likely do is push those who are intent on breaking the law to even more inconvenient and ridiculous measures that involve smashing hard drives or meeting on park benches,” says Dan Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor. As Frank Partnoy, law professor at the University of San Diego, put it in the Financial Times last Thursday: the case “will ultimately provide a ‘road map’ for anyone looking to profit by trading on insider tips”.One former regulator agrees. “Inevitably, people learn from these things but sadly it is not just the good guys.”The long-term impact of the case may also be blunted because of its heavy reliance on wiretaps, which are inadmissible in UK courts. Even in the US, such evidence is expensive and labour-intensive to gather, and its use is heavily controlled by the courts. In the Rajaratnam investigation, FBI agents recorded more than 2,400 phone calls and spent hours reviewing them for evidence and leads. At the trial they elected to play 45 of them to support their case.Prosecutors need to gain approval from Washington supervisors before they can seek authority from a judge to use such methods. They also have to go before a judge every 30 days to justify their renewal. The calls require 24-hour monitoring by FBI agents, who are obliged to stop a recording if it is a conversation taking place between spouses. As the investigators in Manhattan learnt, the modus operandi has its risks.The judge overseeing the Rajaratnam case allowed the wiretaps to be used at trial but chastised the prosecution for a “glaring omission” in its application because of a failure to disclose an investigation conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a case involving Craig Drimal, a trader who was charged with insider trading, the FBI listened to more than 1,000 calls, but those included some of a personal nature with his wife. The judge allowed the tapes but scolded investigators for making “egregious” errors by listening to husband-and-wife calls. Mr Drimal pleaded guilty.Even when wiretaps are granted, they do not capture all the calls traders make or limit ways they exchange information. The FBI had authorisation to tap one of Mr Rajaratnam’s phones but did not have access to others, including his office phone, BlackBerry or phones at his homes in Connecticut and Manhattan.Still, the success of the Manhattan US attorney’s office in obtaining convictions built on wiretapped evidence has caused prosecutors in other parts of the country to begin using them for other white-collar crimes.…Looking ahead, US prosecutors have signalled more charges are likely. Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan, said last month while announcing another insider trading case: “I wish I could say that we were just about finished investigating pervasive insider trading, but sadly we’re not.”Prosecutors are targeting company insiders, as it is their willingness to provide secret information on which traders feed. Mr Bharara has also sought to raise the stakes for those who cross the line. “The nature and scope of insider trading activity has evolved substantially but the guidelines have not completely kept up,” he told the US Sentencing Commission.On the other side of the Atlantic, the FSA is beavering away on its highest-profile case to date – the arrest last year of seven people including top City of London professionals – but 14 months on, it has not filed any criminal charges. UK enforcers also see sentence lengths as crucial to the success of future investigations. The FSA only recently gained the power to enter into plea bargains with co-operating defendants and so far its use of these has been limited.Margaret Cole, interim head of the FSA’s business conduct unit, says increasing the maximum sentence from the current seven years would deter some would-be criminals and strengthen the regulator’s hand in prosecuting others: “A longer sentence is important, because a lot of enforcement work is about sending messages that this is serious, to disincentivise people from doing it.”Defence attorneys warn that long sentences may not be enough. “Plea bargaining is only as good as the evidence you can bring to the table – and the FSA could be said to be behind the SEC as, generally speaking, they don’t have wiretaps on personal mobiles,” says Shane Gleghorn of Taylor Wessing, a UK law firm.In the end, success in the fight against insider dealing will lie with the broader financial world and whether it is willing to ask tough questions of apparently lucky investors. “One of the myths about Wall Street and the hedge fund world is that people think everyone is cheating. But this is an extremely competitive industry where everyone wants to know they are playing from the same deck,” says Philip Harris of Skadden Arps law firm. “People want the markets to be honest.”Additional reporting by Dan McCrum"
106;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-05-12T00:56:04Z;Lawyers see green light in verdict for wiretaps;;Wiretaps are likely to be used more widely in insider-trading probes following their critical role in the prosecution of Raj Rajaratnam, lawyers say.Former prosecutors and defence lawyers say the criminal trial showed the power of wiretaps, court-approved covert listening devices which helped bolster the government’s $63m insider trading case against the founder of Galleon Group. AAfter the verdict on Wednesday, John Dowd, Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer, said he would appeal against the conviction based on the judge’s decision to allow the wiretaps to be played during the trial.Prosecutor Jonathan Streeter told the judge the difficulty in bringing insider-trading cases against hedge fund traders proved the “necessity of wiretaps”. The government has already increased the use of such devices. In a related insider-trading case scheduled to start on Monday, prosecutors are relying on wiretaps and “body wires”, recording devices worn by co-operating witnesses, to bolster their case.Lawyers expect the trend to continue. The government’s ability to use the defendant’s own voice in a trial makes it harder for lawyers to construct a defence for their clients’ trades, they say.“You can’t just say ‘a conversation was taken out of context’ when you have a recorded phone call,” says Philip Hilder, a former federal prosecutor. “It is one of the most powerful tools a prosecutor has and to utilise them in a white-collar case like this one is devastating for the defence.”Mr Hilder says he expects “prosecutors will utilise their wiretap tool more often. The risk-reward for the government will be emboldened”.Wiretaps do have their problems. They are expensive because the government needs to monitor calls 24 hours a day. Investigators also have to follow rigorous procedures or risk having the evidence suppressed. The two judges who allowed the government’s wiretaps to be used in the insider-trading trials both criticised the government for sloppiness.Prosecutors played 45 secretly recorded phone conversations between Mr Rajaratnam and his alleged co-conspirators. On one call, Mr Rajaratnam was heard discussing the exact date when Advanced Micro Devices’ sale of a chip unit would be announced. On another, he said he had 100 per cent certainty that a takeover of PeopleSupport would go through despite a cautionary press release because he had a source on the company’s board.Those admissions, while deflected by his lawyers, proved difficult to overcome. The tapes were bolstered by a series of witnesses – including two business school classmates of Mr Rajaratnam – who admitted to committing crimes.Without wiretaps, the government often has to rely on circumstantial evidence such as trading and phone records. In some respects, the Galleon case was no different. The government presented a series of phone records that took place between Roomy Khan and Mr Rajaratnam and were followed by his trades in the shares of Hilton Hotels and Polycom. The government did not call Ms Khan, a stock trader who has plead guilty and is co-operating. The jury was asked to connect the dots and accept the government’s allegation that inside information was relayed during the calls. Ms Khan was considered a high-risk witness given a history of insider-trading offences.In his defence, Mr Rajaratnam’s legal team showed the jury dozens of analyst reports and news articles suggesting there were other bases for his trades. The team hired a finance professor to testify that a lot of the supposedly secret information had already leaked into the market.

Testimony revealed that traders and others were able to exploit friendships to reach into executive suites and boardrooms to gain access to secret information.“Every reputable company and advisory entity, including investment banks and McKinsey, has got to be horrified by this,” says J. Robert Brown Jr, a securities law professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law.Prosecutors depicted a network of insiders that included a number of senior company managers, a Wall Street banker and some board members.Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund trader who pleaded guilty in the case, allegedly received information about Advanced Micro Devices from Hector Ruiz, then the chipmaker’s chief executive. Mr Ruiz has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.Ms Chiesi also allegedly obtained information about AMD’s sale of its chip manufacturing business from Robert Moffat, a senior IBM executive. Mr Moffat pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in prison. She had another source at Akamai Technologies, who has not been charged in the case. On calls they bragged about their access to corporate insiders.In one recorded call, Mr Rajaratnam said to Ms Chiesi that he “must defer to you on IBM”.“And Akamai too,” Ms Chiesi responded.“But [with] AMD, bring it on, baby,” Mr Rajaratnam said.Mr Rajaratnam’s ties reached into board rooms. Rajat Gupta, former global head of McKinsey, allegedly called Mr Rajaratnam within moments of two Goldman Sachs board meetings when he served as a director of the bank. One call took place 23 seconds after the meeting ended.Mr Gupta has been charged with civil violations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have called him a co-conspirator.Anil Kumar, a former senior partner at McKinsey, testified that since 2006, he breached the confidentiality rules of McKinsey, a business that prides itself on its exclusivity, and shared secrets about his clients with Mr Rajaratnam. Mr Kumar has pleaded guilty to insider trading.Rajiv Goel, an employee at Intel’s treasury department, testified that he sought earnings information from a contact in investor relations for Mr Rajaratnam in April 2007 and also provided regular updates about investment plans by Intel Capital, an arm of the chipmaker.Mr Goel also testified that Mr Rajaratnam bought shares of @Road for him after learning from the company’s chief executive that it would be acquired. Krish Panu, who later joined Galleon, was chief executive of @Road at the time. Mr Goel has pleaded guilty to insider trading.The trial revealed holes at Moody’s Investor Service, the credit rating agency, where Deep Shah, a junior analyst allegedly tipped Roomy Khan, a former Intel executive and stock trader.Ms Khan then tipped Mr Rajaratnam who bought stock. Mr Shah has been charged with insider trading but remains a fugitive. Ms Khan has pleaded guilty.During the trial, jurors heard how Galleon insiders sought to add to their network and deepen their connections to corporations. Mr Rajaratnam was recorded speaking with his brother Rengan about recruiting another McKinsey partner.Adam Smith, a former Galleon portfolio manager who pleaded guilty to insider trading, testified that he recruited an Intel employee for inside information. He eventually cut ties with the Intel insider because his sources dried up.Mr Smith also testified that he had a number of contacts in Taiwan at technology companies who gave him information and links to a Morgan Stanley investment banker who provided him with information about three corporate takeovers.

109;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-05-11T18:12:06Z;A victory for those interested in clean markets;The conviction should encourage regulators to pursue other financial institutions writes John Gapper;A few days after the jury retired in the Raj Rajaratnam trial, and it was clear that we were in for a long wait, I talked with a senior US securities regulator about the possibility of Mr Rajaratnam being cleared, in spite of the damning evidence against him. It would be, we agreed, a nightmare.Happily, the nightmare has been avoided with the conviction of Mr Rajaratnam on all 14 counts. The sense of relief at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice that they can crack down on blatant abuses of inside information at hedge funds and on Wall Street must be profound.The defence mounted by Mr Rajaratnam was insidious because it had an element of truth to it – inside information on corporate transactions and takeovers constantly leaks into the stock market, leading to movements in share prices before announcements. He was trading on equal terms with a lot of professionals, his lawyer argued.One can only speculate as to the jury’s verdict if the prosecution had not held its trump card – wiretaps of actual phone calls in which Mr Rajaratnam told others that he had inside sources among senior executives and board members of companies including Goldman Sachs and Advanced Micro Devices.At the very least, without those 47 tapes and evidence from executives such as Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, it would have been harder to defeat the “everyone’s doing it” defence. The fact that the jury kept coming back into the courtroom to hear the tapes again shows their importance.Insider trading is, like a lot of white collar crime, hard both to detect and to prove. Few professionals will expose themselves by trading in their private accounts just after they have gained inside information – instead, most minor insider trading rings involve one person passing titbits to an accomplice who is hard to trace.Mr Rajaratnam was clearly not worried about getting caught since the Galleon hedge fund had a mass of legitimate information and research. He talked openly to his confidants about his sources on corporate boards, not suspecting that his calls might be taped.The Rajaratnam conviction will and should encourage regulators and law enforcement officials to pursue other hedge funds and financial institutions involved in similar behaviour – for others clearly are. It has repaid what was a long, expensive and complex inquiry into an elaborate conspiracy.One of the shocking revelations during the trial was how casually some professionals exchanged valuable information, as if there was nothing wrong in doing it in small circles.Rajat Gupta, the former head of McKinsey and a board member of Goldman and Procter & Gamble, was taped chatting about Goldman board meetings to Mr Rajaratnam.Similarly, the inquiry has turned up evidence of abuses inside “expert networks” that offer hedge funds and other investors access to professionals with insights into industries and companies. All of this has shown graphically how leaks spread within financial markets.Mr Blankfein’s evidence that Mr Gupta was breaching his duty of confidence to Goldman was a corrective to this. If Mr Rajaratnam had been cleared, it would have made it far harder not only for regulators but financial institutions themselves to keep trading abuses in check.Wall Street ought to be happy about the conviction, no matter how poorly it reflects on some people’s behaviour. It cannot afford the idea that its employees are not only overpaid, but often break the law to become entrenched.Some will take the trial as a warning to cover their tracks more carefully and not to assume that only calls on trading floors will be listened to. Like the US raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound, which revealed that its special forces possessed stealth helicopters, everyone now knows that the Department of Justice is willing and able to use wiretaps.The obvious response to this for determined wrongdoers is not discuss anything sensitive via e-mail or on phones but to rely on face-to-face meetings. The techniques revealed in the trial will not eliminate abuse, just make it more time-consuming.Still, the prosecutors and law enforcers deserve at least one day of celebration. They peered into the chasm of defeat during the jury’s discussions and have emerged with their powers and authority reinforced. For all those with an interest in clean markets, that is very welcome.
110;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-05-05T18:50:33Z;Intel wants grip on mobile market;;The revolution in chip design announced by Intel this week is being seen as an attempt to see off a threat from Arm Holdings, the UK chip designer, which challenges its dominance in microprocessors.The world’s biggest chipmaker by sales on Wednesday unveiled a breakthrough 3D structure for its next-generation processors that the US company estimated could give it a three-year lead over competitors.Intel already has 80.8 per cent of the PC processor market, compared with 18.9 per cent for its rival AMD, according to figures released on Thursday by IDC, the research firm.However, it has failed to produce chips power-efficient enough for use in mobile phones and tablet computers, where Arm-based chips dominate.In particular, Apple’s iPhone and iPad handheld devices have used chips based on Arm’s designs, rather than Intel’s.Arm is also moving into Intel’s core PC market. IDC predicted that more than 13 per cent of PC processors would be based on Arm’s architecture by 2015.However, with Intel’s new design promising to cut power consumption in half compared with its current generation, a breakthrough into phones should be nearer.The design’s introduction on chips with circuit widths of 22 billionths of a metre will go into mass production later this year.“We’ve been asking what’s your road map to get into cell phones?” said Len Jelinek, semiconductor manufacturing analyst at iSuppli, the research firm.Lee Simpson, semiconductor analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said: “This is Intel starting to advance into mobile.”As early as next year, he said, customers such as Apple could be considering Intel chips for their devices.Arm, however, made light of the threat. “There is no real surprise in the announcement,” said Ian Drew, executive vice-president of marketing at Arm. “3D technology has been talked about for a decade.“Yes, Intel is the first to announce it, but there are lots of people following them quite quickly. We also need to wait and see how these chips will work in practice,” said Mr Drew.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a pivotal manufacturer for Intel rivals Qualcomm, Nvidia, and others, said its chips would remain competitive with Intel’s even though it would not use 3D transistors until the 14-nanometre generation arrived.The company said that while Intel would have more powerful transistors as a result of its new design, TSMC’s chips would have better interconnections and higher transistor density such that, “in terms of overall performance we won’t lag behind Intel”.Shang-Yi Chiang, vice-president of research and development, said TSMC had worked on 3D transistors since 2003.“If anyone is going to push Moore’s law to the furthest, TSMC will be there,” he said.Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies, said that to rival Arm-based chips, Intel may have to wait an extra generation and a further two years, when it can shrink circuitry to 14-nanometre widths.“As far as being competitive with Arm, I think the 22nm generation may be close to par but maybe not at par and will certainly not be enough reason to uproot the established architecture,” he says.“When it gets to the 14nm generation, it may have enough of an edge that the device makers and carriers will look at that.”Arm shares fell 7.3 per cent on Wednesday on speculation about the Intel announcement.They rebounded by nearly 3 per cent on Thursday. Many analysts took the view that Intel’s advance posed little immediate threat.A bigger loser was Soitec, a French semiconductor maker that pioneered an alternative technology for dealing with increasingly small-sized chips.Soitec shares have fallen more than 9 per cent since Wednesday.
111;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Galleon jury ordered to restart deliberations;;The jury in the insider trading case against Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon Group, was instructed to restart deliberations when one juror was excused and replaced.By the end of the day Wednesday, no verdict had been reached.After six days of deliberations, the judge had told the jury to start their discussions anew after he excused a juror for medical reasons and replaced her with an alternate juror who had not participated in the past week’s discussions. The jury did not sit on Tuesday.The prosecution and lawyers for Mr Rajaratnam did not object to the replacement. Mr Rajaratnam was not present in court. On Sunday, he underwent emergency surgery for a bacterial infection in his foot.Prosecutors have charged Mr Rajaratnam with making more than $63m in profits and averted losses by trading after he received tips about corporate secrets before they were announced to the market.Just before lunch on Wednesday, the jury asked to hear nine tapes they had already sought in their deliberations, for the benefit of the new male juror.It has been more than a week since the newcomer has heard arguments or viewed evidence in the case.The jury also asked to hear three additional calls, which included an alleged tip by McKinsey partner Anil Kumar about lay-offs at Ebay and another alleged tip that the sides had “shaken hands” on a transaction involving Advanced Micro Devices.Prosecutor Reed Brodsky renewed his request to the judge to provide the jury with transcripts of the recorded calls in their deliberation room, a request which the judge has previously denied. Mr Brodsky said if the jury had the transcripts, they would know exactly what they are looking for.He noted that the jury asked for transcripts of two of three calls related to what the government said were Mr Rajaratnam’s efforts to recruit another McKinsey partner into the alleged insider trading scheme.The jury “didn’t ask for the call right in between”, Mr Brodsky said. “[They] can’t identify that call.” Mr Brodsky said that the issue was “critically important”.A lawyer for Mr Rajaratnam, who has objected to the government’s request, said providing the transcripts would interfere with the jury’s deliberations.The judge did not rule on the matter immediately.Three alternate jurors remain in waiting. Two jurors were previously excused during the trial.The jury now consists of eight women and four men.
112;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-05-03T21:25:12Z;Roche study disputes eye drug finding;;Using Roche’s cancer medicine Avastin to treat vision problems carries a greater risk of side effects than its more expensive drug Lucentis, a company-supported study released on Tuesday suggested.The report – funded by Roche’s US arm Genentech – will intensify debate over the relative merits of the two drugs. It follows publication last week of a closely watched study sponsored by the US government-funded National Eye Institute, which concluded that Avastin (known generically as bevacizumab) was just as effective as Lucentis (ranibizumab).Both drugs were developed by Roche. But Lucentis’s much higher price has triggered widespread “off label” use of Avastin by doctors – which is legal but not authorised by regulators – to treat the eye condition wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Doctors have purchased vials of Avastin for cancer patients and “split” them into up to 16 smaller doses required in monthly AMD treatments, for a price nearer to $50 than the $1,500 charged for Lucentis.Roche and Novartis, its Swiss neighbour that has licensed Lucentis for sale outside the US, are stepping up a campaign to support Lucentis, which they argue is distinctive.Initial findings of the company-backed analysis of 78,000 Medicare patients at the conference of the US Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology indicated an 11 per cent greater chance of death and 57 per cent higher chance of stroke among those taking Avastin than Lucentis.With neither company interested in funding an expensive study that could undermine Lucentis, the US National Eye Institute instead funded its own trial, known as Catt, which has so far cost $24m and has another year to run.The preliminary findings of the Catt study support use of Avastin for AMD, at a time when US healthcare reform is supporting “comparative effectiveness” studies of competing medicines.They also create uncertainty, as the US Food and Drug Administration, the regulator, would only grant an “indication”, endorsing the use of Avastin for AMD to a company able to manufacture it. Roche, which holds the patent, has no such interest and could challenge anyone who did.Novartis has criticised the design of the Catt study, both for how it tests vision improvement and the small number of patients studied.
113;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-04-28T21:36:32Z;US study blow for Roche and Novartis;;Roche and Novartis suffered a setback to the prospects for their blockbuster eye treatment Lucentis after the preliminary findings of a US government-funded study suggested a much cheaper alternative was just as effective.The results, after one year’s treatment of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using small doses of Roche’s Avastin, indicated it provided as much benefit as the much more expensive Lucentis (known generically as ranibizumab).The conclusions will rekindle a fierce debate over whether healthcare systems, doctors and regulators should encourage greater use of Avastin (bevacizumab) to save money, despite continuing concerns over safety and long-term efficacy. They follow the highly unusual decision of the National Eye Institute, part of the federally funded National Institutes of Health, to fund the so-called CATT clinical trial comparing the two drugs, which released its initial findings on Thursday.In the research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine and disputed by the two Swiss drug companies, Philip Rosenfeld from the University of Miami concluded: “Healthcare providers and payers worldwide will now have to justify the cost of using ranibizumab.”The study, which has so far cost $24m to test the two drugs on 1,185 patients, said there was “virtually identical” improvement in visual acuity, a measure of vision, while cautioning that 24 per cent taking Avastin reported serious adverse effects compared with 19 per cent on Lucentis.Avastin and Lucentis are closely related and were both developed by Roche through its US subsidiary Genentech. But Lucentis was specifically launched for AMD – which causes blindness – and in the US is sold for $2,000 per injection. It licensed Lucentis to Novartis outside the US.Despite a lack of approval by regulators for using Avastin for AMD, doctors were able to offer similar results by buying Avastin, a treatment given in much higher doses to treat cancer, and “splitting” it into up to 16 separate injections to patients with AMD for as little as $50 each.Trevor Mundel, head of global development at Novartis, expressed concern over side effects and the measure used for efficacy in the CATT study. “It would be unprecedented and unethical to use anything other than Lucentis,” he said.
114;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-04-26T23:21:52Z;Galleon jury asks to listen to calls again;;The jury weighing the insider trading case against Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon Group, asked to hear nine tapes of recorded phone calls on its second day of deliberations without reaching a verdict.The calls involved subjects ranging from an alleged e-mail cover-up to an Italian vacation. Several of the calls included discussions about Advanced Micro Devices and Spansion, two stocks that US prosecutors allege were involved in the insider trading scheme.The jury’s deliberations on Tuesday follow a seven-week trial. Prosecutors allege Mr Rajaratnam made more than $63m in profits and avoided losses by trading based on corporate secrets he learnt from acquaintances. Mr Rajaratnam has maintained his trades were based on Galleon research and publicly available information.Prosecutors have alleged Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey partner, tipped Mr Rajaratnam about takeovers involving Spansion and AMD. A conspiracy charge involving Mr Kumar is the basis of count four in the 14-count indictment.In one call, the jury heard Mr Kumar tell Mr Rajaratnam that Spansion had a term sheet – used in corporate transactions – due the following day.Mr Rajaratnam asked, “Do you think we should buy Spansion for the fund?”Mr Kumar replied, “Let me see what comes in tomorrow.”In another call the same day, Mr Rajaratnam relayed the information about the Spansion term sheet to two Galleon employees. “This is very confidential,” Mr Rajaratnam tells them.Later in the call, Mr Rajaratnam discusses creating an e-mail trail to “protect ourselves”.Mr Kumar has pleaded guilty to insider trading.On Monday, the jury of nine women and three men asked for defence exhibits related to Clearwire, a stock Mr Rajaratnam traded after allegedly being tipped by Rajiv Goel, a former Intel executive. In the indictment, the conspiracy charge related to Mr Goel is count three.Separately on Tuesday, Craig Drimal, a former hedge fund trader, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud for trading on inside information. Mr Drimal, 54, pleaded guilty to trading shares of 3Com and Axcan Pharma after allegedly being tipped about potential acquisitions by Zvi Goffer, another trader who learnt the information from two lawyers working on the takeover deals. Mr Drimal made $6.3m from trading.“I deeply regret my actions that have caused such great pain to my family and friends,” Mr Drimal said. He is not co-operating with the government’s effort to prosecute others and prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence ranging from 70-87 months.Mr Drimal’s plea comes weeks before he and others were expected to go on trial in the scheme involving Mr Goffer, a trader at Incremental Capital who has been dubbed “Octopussy” for having multiple tentacles or contacts for information. Mr Goffer, who has attended portions of Mr Rajaratnam’s trial, has pleaded not guilty.Mr Drimal, who worked for Incremental Capital and traded at times from Galleon’s office, is the latest trader involved in the Octopussy case to plead guilty. Last week, a former lawyer at Ropes & Gray pled guilty to insider trading as have two others.
115;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-04-25T20:50:28Z;Weaker earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street receded slightly from the strong gains seen last week after a string of disappointing earnings reports from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson Controls.Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, released particularly lacklustre earnings, reporting a 9 per cent fall in first-quarter net income as higher raw material costs ate into its profitability.The company also revised up its estimate of input inflation for the rest of the year in response to the rising price of pulp, oil and resin. This worried investors, pushing the stock down 2.7 per cent to $64.24, amid wider unease over the effect of rising commodity costs on margins.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest makers of processors for personal computers, reported that profits had more than doubled to $510m, or $0.68 per share, for the first quarter.But investors were a little disappointed by the news, and the stock lost 0.1 per cent to $8.70. This was largely because expectations for earnings in the tech sector were high after bumper earnings results from Intel, Apple, IBM and Qualcomm in the previous week. AMD added 5.3 per cent last week as sentiment jumped for such stocks.These results left the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent to 1,335.26 at the close, paring some of the sharp gains on Wall Street in the previous week.Of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 80 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.This week, 181 S&P companies will report their earnings, setting the tone for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 12,479.88, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,825.88 in the session. The broadly negative sentiment was offset by the news that new family home sales rebounded 11.1 per cent to 300,000 in March from the previous month. This was higher than expected but “still miserable in absolute terms”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Volumes were very low as many markets around the world were closed for Easter Monday and investors were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the announcement on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve on US monetary policy.“People are waiting to see what is going to happen with the Fed, but my expectation is that there will not be much news,” said Timothy Holland, portfolio manager of the Aston/Tamro Diversified Equity Fund.“Core inflation has not moved dramatically, and employment and gross domestic product are still not that great, so the Fed will likely just continue to be supportive,” he said.In corporate news, Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, reported profit up 29 per cent in the first quarter as volume growth helped offset its higher costs. But investors were hoping for more and the stock was down 2.8 per cent to $39.60.RadioShack, the cons­umer-electronics chain, reported first-quarter earnings down 30 per cent and lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 10 cents a share. Earnings were affected by lower margins, weakness in its T-Mobile business and the expense of rolling out its branded wireless kiosks in Target stores. But the stock was still up 0.1 per cent to $15.85.Polycom, the maker of video conferencing equipment, said its first-quarter earnings had risen more than sixfold. Its shares were up 12.6 per cent to $58.43.In deal news, Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest gold producer, announced a C$7.3bn cash offer for Equinox Minerals, the Australian-Canadian copper miner. This sent shares in Barrick down 6.8 per cent to $51.86, while shares in Equinox Minerals added 10.5 per cent to $8.74. Equinox is already the target of a hostile offer by China’s Minmetals Resources. Barrick offered C$8.15 a share, compared with Minmetals’ C$7.NYSE Euronext said it was set to increase its forecast for cost savings by up to a third from a deal with Deutsche Börse, in a further effort to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Shares in NYSE were down 0.7 per cent to $38.76 while Nasdaq and ICE were down 1.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, to $27.23 and $122.
116;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Emerging markets boost US chip industry;;The US chip industry is looking forward to a strong second half of the year after shaking off the effects of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, weak economic conditions and gloomy analyst predictions.The tablet segment is not cannibalising the PC market to the extent many feared, while increased corporate buying and the strength of demand in emerging markets have been highlighted by semiconductor companies reporting earnings in the past week.“Emerging markets are now over 50 per cent of unit volume,” said Tom Kilroy, head of sales at Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.“That’s kind of off the radar screen for a lot of analysts.”IDC and Gartner, the research groups, this month reported a decline in PC sales in the first quarter and predicted growth this year of 6 and 11 per cent respectively. But Intel expects 13-15 per cent growth, with more than 400m PCs sold worldwide. It says the research groups are missing a lot of sales by local manufacturers and lesser known brands in emerging markets.Intel reported first-quarter sales and made second-quarter forecasts well ahead of Wall Street estimates last week, while rival AMD also reported “great traction” in emerging markets and this “white box” arena.Consumer demand in the US and Europe, where economic conditions are still difficult, was reported to have been “soft” by Intel and AMD as the public opted for tablet devices or delayed purchases. However, other mature markets, such as Australia and Korea, were seeing strong PC sales, as were China and Brazil, the number two and three markets for PC sales this year.Emerging markets are maturing to the extent that higher priced PCs, smartphones and tablets are selling well.“There were concerns when we moved towards emerging markets, but people there are buying higher-end devices,” said Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm chief executive, in a Financial Times interview after the leading mobile phone chipmaker raised its forecast for average selling prices for phones this year by $9 to $199-$209.Corporate purchases are also helping the industry. Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, said the prospects looked good for sales of PCs – combining its latest processors and Windows 7 – in the second and third quarters. He said a replacement cycle was under way with 75 per cent of enterprise PCs still running two-generations-old Windows XP.The effect of the disaster in Japan on consumer demand and the supply chain for PCs and mobile devices appeared to have been slight, according to Intel and Qualcomm, with little impact on sales and no effect on supplies.
117;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Demand for new chips boosts AMD profits;;Advanced Micro Devices, number two in PC microprocessors to Intel, reported first-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street expectations as it saw strong demand for its first generation of “Fusion” chips, combining a video engine with general computer processing.Both AMD and Intel are moving this year to processors that handle both video and general data on the same chip. AMD’s “Brazos” platform featuring these “accelerated processing units” (APUs) sold well in the first quarter and the Silicon Valley company said it expected the higher end Llano platform to be widely available in systems in the current quarter, offering improved graphics and all-day battery life in notebooks.“APU unit shipments greatly exceeded our expectations and we are excited to build on that momentum now that we are shipping our Llano APU,” said Thomas Seifert, chief financial officer and interim chief executive, in a statement.However, he acknowledged during an analyst conference that there has been “continued softness” in AMD’s server business, where it has lost market share to Intel’s processors.But he said he expected to see market share gains in the second half, with AMD introducing a new “Bulldozer” chip design in servers in late summer.Mr Seifert took over the chief executive role in January from Dirk Meyer, who left after a disagreement with the board over strategy. The chief financial officer said the board was “actively interviewing” for a permanent successor.AMD said its graphics chip business appeared to gain some share from its chief rival Nvidia during the quarter and it said it had picked up business from Apple, where its chips featured in the latest MacBooks.Overall revenues of $1.61bn were in line with analyst expectations, while underlying profits of 8 cents a share topped Wall Street estimates of 3 cents. AMD said it expected second-quarter revenues to be flat to slightly down, again in line with analyst figures of $1.59bn.AMD shares fell 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading on the news to $8.67.
118;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-04-19T08:24:51Z;Texas Instruments profits dip with quake impact;;Texas Instruments reported lower profits and revenues than expected as it became the first major chipmaker to report the effect of the Japan earthquake on earnings.Two of TI’s three Japanese factories were damaged in the disaster and it warned on Monday that the biggest impact on revenues would take place in the second quarter.“We will only be operating with partial output at our factories there,” said Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, on an analyst conference call. “Our Japanese customers are still in the early stages of restarting their own factories and we and our customers may face potential supply-chain disruption.”The Dallas-based company reported first-quarter revenues of $3.39bn and profits of $666m, or 55 cents per share, after the market closed. This was below Wall Street expectations of profits of 58 cents a share on revenues of $3.40bn. TI shares fell 2.4 per cent to $33.95 in New York in after-hours trading.TI said both the quake and weaker demand for its wireless baseband chips used in mobile phones had hit sales, although new orders were strong.“We expect growth in the second quarter, though it will be pressured by the situation in Japan,” said Rich Templeton, TI chief executive. “Provided consumer and enterprise demand remain strong, we expect a good second half of the year.”TI earlier this month announced its biggest acquisition in more than a decade, a $6.5bn all-cash deal for Silicon Valley’s National Semiconductor.The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel, reports first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, followed by Qualcomm and Freescale on Wednesday and Advanced Micro Devices on Thursday.
119;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-04-18T23:09:33Z;Galleon prosecutors introduce new evidence;;Lawyers for Raj Rajaratnam have rested their case following testimony from a finance professor who sought to drive home the defence’s position that trades made by the Galleon Group founder were not based on inside information.Prosecutors responded on Monday by playing a new recording of a phone call between Mr Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns hedge fund manager, that was aimed squarely at rebutting the defence.In the call, Ms Chiesi is heard questioning why anyone would buy Advanced Micro Devices shares on September 30 2008. “That is a very bold move to make, unless you know what we know,” she says.Mr Rajaratnam responds: “It’s been widely speculated. What people don’t know is the time.” He says it is “the seventh”, referring to October 7, when AMD announced the sale of its chip-manufacturing business to the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi.Prosecutors played the call after a week of testimony from Mr Rajaratnam’s witnesses.The defence’s position is that he traded based on news reports and research, not on secret tips he received from company insiders.Previously, the prosecutors played recordings of Ms Chiesi and Mr Rajaratnam swapping information about AMD’s planned asset sale, which was announced on October 7. Mr Rajaratnam lost money on the trades.Both sides are expected to argue their case before the jury on Wednesday and then the jury will begin deliberations.The stakes are high. Mr Rajaratnam faces more than 15 years in prison if convicted. The government has devoted a lot of resources to the trial – the largest insider trading case in a generation – and is continuing to investigate others tied to the trading.During the seven-week trial, the government has played more than a dozen audio recordings and called 18 witnesses.
120;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-04-12T23:35:46Z;Goldman was ‘key’ Galleon partner;Ex-COO appears for Rajaratnam defence;A former senior Galleon Group executive has testified that the precarious state of the financial industry and concerns about its trading partner Goldman Sachs were frequently discussed inside the hedge fund in July 2008, prompting a meeting with senior bank executives that summer.On Tuesday, Richard Schutte, a former chief operating officer at Galleon, testified that Goldman was one of the firm’s “most important partners”. Mr Schutte was in court at the trial of his former colleague, Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, on insider trading charges.Mr Schutte told the court that Galleon had paid the bank $30m-$35m in commissions and prime broker fees in 2008 and the bank held $600m in Galleon customers’ assets. His testimony seemed aimed at suggesting an alternative reason why Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, had asked Rajat Gupta, a Goldman board member, in July 2008 if the bank had considered merging with a commercial bank.Earlier in the trial, now in its sixth week, prosecutors played a recorded audio tape from July 29 in which Mr Rajaratnam said he had heard a rumour that Goldman might buy a commercial bank. The tape appeared to support government allegations of Mr Rajaratnam’s solicitation of inside information and Mr Gupta’s willingness to provide it. Mr Gupta has been called a co-conspirator but has denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also allege that Mr Gupta tipped off Mr Rajaratnam about Warren Buffett’s $5bn investment in the bank and warned him about its worsening financial condition.In the tape of the July call, Mr Gupta is heard telling Mr Rajaratnam that Goldman’s board discussed the possibility of merging with a commercial bank, such as Wachovia. Mr Rajaratnam was scheduled to meet with Gary Cohn, Goldman’s president, two days later.On Tuesday, Mr Schutte testified that the near collapse earlier that year of Bear Stearns and a run on the banks were “an increasing concern” at Galleon and discussed at nearly every Galleon morning meeting.Mr Schutte said it was “an impetus for the meeting” with Mr Cohn of Goldman. The hedge fund sought Mr Cohn’s perspective on the industry and wanted to “get comfortable that they were evaluating all alternatives to protect the balance sheet” and be assured that they weren’t “heading down the same path as Bear Stearns”.During the meeting with Mr Cohn and other Goldman representatives at Galleon’s offices, Mr Schutte said they discussed the options available to banks, such as combining with a large bank. Mr Schutte was asked if he had heard any discussion of inside information and whether any was supplied or sought.“No,” he replied.The defence suggested that Mr Rajaratnam bought Goldman stock because a research group said it expected Congress to pass the troubled asset relief programme legislation, which meant it could buy bad assets from banks.The case continues
121;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Chiesi steals spotlight in Rajaratnam case;;Heard but hardly seen, Danielle Chiesi, a former hedge fund trader and ex-beauty queen, has stolen the spotlight in the government’s insider trading case against Raj Rajaratnam.Over the past five weeks, jurors listening to the government’s evidence against Mr Rajaratnam have heard dozens of recorded phone conversations between the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund and his male friends and colleagues.Yet the most striking voice is that of Ms Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader who pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading. Her voice, inflected with a New York accent, has been broadcast into the courtroom, describing trading strategies with Mr Rajaratnam and doling out company secrets, which prosecutors allege she obtained from senior executives at technology groups Advanced Micro Devices and IBM.She does not bother to disguise the names of these companies in the phone calls, which were secretly recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of its probe into Galleon. Prosecutors have relied heavily on the recorded calls in building their case against Mr Rajaratnam, who is accused of reaping $63m in illegal trading profits or averted losses.Ms Chiesi, the only female voice on the calls, is brash and blunt. Before the judge allowed prosecutors to play certain recordings, he edited out what a prosecutor referred to as “blue” language – a show business term for comedians whose acts contain sexually explicit content.Though her voice is familiar, the jury has only had a single glimpse of Ms Chiesi, from a photograph of her that prosecutors have affixed to a board. In the picture her platinum hair is swept into a loose bun with her head tilted to the side. In the calls Ms Chiesi flaunts her contacts in the upper echelons of corporate America. She mentioned “Hector” when discussing Hector Ruiz, the former chief executive of AMD, and Robert Moffat, a senior IBM executive, who she said had visited her mother’s house one Sunday.Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey consultancy director, testified during the trial that Ms Chiesi had “intimate” relationships with Mr Moffat and Mr Ruiz.Mr Moffat has pleaded guilty and Mr Ruiz has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Mr Ruiz, has previously said: “Any suggestion that the relationship was intimate is untrue.”On the recorded calls, Ms Chiesi calls her friends “baby”. On one call she tells Mr Rajaratnam that Akamai, an internet infrastructure group, is “gonna guide down. I just got a call from my guy. I played him like a finely tuned piano”. She begs the Galleon boss to hold off trading so she can make the trade.Prosecutors allege Ms Chiesi was tipped off by Kieran Taylor, a former Akamai marketing executive and friend of the Chiesi family. Mr Taylor has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Mr Rajaratnam made $5m in profits from the sale, while Ms Chiesi made $2.4m in profits. After receiving the tip, she said she felt like a “warrior” and the information grab was a “conquest”.But “Dani”, as she is known, also seems to seek out Mr Rajaratnam’s advice. “I’m a chick in this business with a reputation of knowing AMD and IBM. So what would you tell me to do?” she asks him on one call. Mr Rajaratnam tells her, “I would trade. I mean I would sell 250, buy 250, you know.” Another time she asks him whether she should create a trading pattern in a stock.Mr Rajaratnam also told her to be “radio silent” about IBM and Akamai to avoid any suspicion.Ms Chiesi is scheduled to be sentenced next month. Her lawyer has said she is not co-operating with the government, never traded in her personal account, and was never asked to testify against Mr Rajaratnam.

But losses in the materials and energy sectors weighed on Wall Street, leaving the wider indices only slightly higher in the session.Shares in the internet equipment company were up 4.9 per cent to $18.07 after John Chambers, chief executive, made a rare admission of failure and signalled a shake-up to refocus Cisco on its most important markets.He said that the company’s strategy was “sound”, but added that they had been slow to make decisions and had “lost the accountability that has been a hallmark of our ability to execute consistently for our customers”.Cisco’s stock has fallen 27 per cent since the start of 2010 at a time when the Nasdaq Composite has risen by 23.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the technology sector, semiconductor stocks saw gains. These were led by Broadcom, the chipmaker, which added 3.9 per cent to $39.95 after Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on the stock from “perform” to “outperform”, citing the growth in wireless markets and networking.This helped related semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices was up 4 per cent to $8.43, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 1.5 per cent, adding to the 2.3 per cent gain in the previous session. Sentiment in the sector continued to be high following Texas Instruments’ agreed $6.5bn deal to acquire National Semiconductor.Overall, the S&P technology sector was up 0.7 per cent, the best performing S&P sub-index. The benchmark S&P 500 was only up 0.2 per cent at 1,335.54.In the energy sector, oilfield service stocks were the worst performing. Cameron International lost 2.5 per cent to $55.30 while Halliburton fell 2.6 per cent to $48.41. The S&P energy sector was 0.9 per cent softer.In the materials sector, it was coal miners that suffered the most as investor confidence in global demand took a turn. Massey Energy fell 3.5 per cent to $67.59 while Peabody Energy declined 3.7 per cent to $69.56.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.3 per cent to 12,427.13 and 2,799.82 respectively.The S&P 500 index has now added 6.2 per cent this year boosted by a sense that the fundamentals of the US economy are improving. “Macro outlook in the US is slightly more positive compared to the past few quarters. Economic sentiment in Europe remains choppy, but trends appear to be stabilising,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.Technical analysts at JPMorgan Securities argued that in the short term the S&P was likely to see highs of 1,344, while in the second quarter the index was likely to trade between 1,353 and 1,367.Over the year the S&P 500 would face a ceiling of between 1,420 and 1,440, they argued, suggesting the S&P could still rise a further 7.8 per cent this year at its peak, on top of the 6.2 per cent added already.In corporate news, shares in Monsanto lost ground after the world’s largest seed company by revenues reported disappointing revenues, sending the shares down 5.7 per cent to $69.16. But the company also beat estimates for its earnings per share and confirmed guidance for the year.American Superconductor tumbled 41.6 per cent to $14.47 after the maker of wind turbine components and transmission lines said it expected to report a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter after Sinovel Wind Group refused to accept shipments.Cephalon was down 0.5 per cent to $77.02 after the drugmaker rejected the $5.7bn bid offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, saying that the offer undervalued the company.Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was fractionally higher at $24.32 after it won an auction to buy the bankrupt Blockbuster film rental chain for $320m. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy protection in September with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn.Transatlantic Holdings added 2.8 per cent to $50.60 after the reinsurer formerly owned by American International Group said that its first-quarter catastrophes cost was $355m, including about $240m from last month’s Japanese earthquake and tsunami.Optical networking stocks saw gains. JDS Uniphase added 2.3 per cent to $19.58 while Oclaro rose 7.6 per cent to $11.72.
123;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-29T23:23:03Z;Ex-Galleon manager tells of passing secrets;Takeover tip from Morgan Stanley banker shared;Adam Smith, a former Galleon Group portfolio manager, has testified that he passed to Raj Rajaratnam secret information about roughly half a dozen companies that he obtained from corporate insiders.Mr Smith is the first Galleon employee to testify in the insider trading trial, now in its fourth week, and said that since his early days as an analyst at the firm in 2004, he sought confidential information because he needed to find an “edge” to help the firm and its founder, Mr Rajaratnam, earn profits.He said on Tuesday that at Galleon an edge was a person or analysis that could inform the firm’s trading decisions. Having an edge was “a key component to arbitraging consensus [on Wall Street] which was essentially our strategy,” Mr Smith testified.He said that he learnt information about earnings and takeovers from sources inside some technology companies and from his former Morgan Stanley colleague, Kamal Ahmed, an investment banker. Mr Ahmed, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, is on administrative leave. His lawyer has said he will be exonerated.Mr Smith told the jury that learning exact earnings figures before they were announced was akin to “cheating on the test”. Mr Smith pleaded guilty in January and is co-operating with the government.He said he had given Mr Rajaratnam information he learnt from Mr Ahmed about Integrated Device Technology’s takeover of Integrated Circuit Systems in 2005. After the announcement, he testified, Mr Rajaratnam told him that “Kamal was a good contact and I should stay in touch with him”.In May 2006, Mr Smith said, he had lunch with Mr Ahmed in California and learnt that rumours that Advanced Micro Devices was in talks to acquire ATI Technologies were true. Immediately after the lunch, he said, he called Mr Rajaratnam and relayed the information. A former McKinsey partner previously testified he also tipped off Mr Rajaratnam about the deal.Mr Smith said that he “put in all my chips” and doubled his investment, based both on his own research that suggested ATI was undervalued and his knowledge of the takeover talks. He said that was having “two torpedoes in the water”, explaining that if one missed, the other would be likely to get a hit.Mr Smith said he created an e-mail trail for Mr Rajaratnam explaining his legitimate research reasons for buying the stock, even though the takeover was the “primary” reason. He said Mr Rajaratnam admonished employees who put sensitive information in e-mails.The defence has argued Mr Rajaratnam traded on legitimate research.Mr Smith, who spoke calmly during his testimony, said he initially “hadn’t thought clearly” about what he had done by sharing confidential information he received about the Integrated Device takeover.When the deal was announced in June, however, he said he had “a sinking feeling in my stomach that this might be a problem … I had a moment of worry”.Mr Smith updated Mr Rajaratnam about the technology group takeover by referring to it in e-mails as the “two eyes” after the first initials of both groups.

Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.
125;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-17T01:03:48Z;Insider trading trial star witness challenged;;"The lawyer for Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund billionaire on trial for insider trading, tried to discredit the US government’s star witness during cross-examination over allegations that he was paid for giving client secrets to Mr Rajaratnam.John Dowd, the lawyer, suggested that Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey partner, was paid $1m for helping Mr Rajaratnam launch investment funds, contrary to the consultant’s assertion that the money was paid in exchange for the secrets of his technology company clients.Under questioning by Mr Dowd, Mr Kumar said he was paid $2.1m by Galleon, Mr Rajaratnam’s hedge fund group, for information about McKinsey clients.Mr Dowd and Mr Kumar sparred frequently during his cross-examination, with Mr Dowd at one point stating: “I’m here to ask the questions and you’re here to answer them.”The court reporter often had to ask them to repeat themselves when they spoke over each other. Another time, Mr Dowd stood close to Mr Kumar and was shouting at him.Mr Dowd focused his questioning on a $1m bonus Mr Kumar testified he had received in early 2007 from Galleon after informing Mr Rajaratnam of a plan by Advanced Micro Devices to acquire ATI Technologies.Mr Dowd went through four amended partnership agreements for an investment fund Mr Rajaratnam had set up with Rajat Gupta, the former head of McKinsey, called New Silk Route.He also presented several e-mails that he said showed Mr Kumar had arranged meetings with prospective investors in a fund and introduced potential investment opportunities.One meeting involved Mr Kumar’s friend, Sunil Mittal, the chief executive of Bharti Telecom, now part of Bharti Airtel.The fund ultimately invested in a rival to Bharti. When asked about arranging the deal, Mr Kumar testified he was not involved, “I would never betray him.” The deal, he said, “was an embarrassment to me.”Mr Dowd said the $1m payment “was really for your work for” three investment funds, including New Silk Route.Mr Kumar retorted “no”. “It seems an usual way to pay me.” He said none of the funds knew about the payment, which he maintained was made by Galleon for the AMD deal information.When presented with Galleon records that stated $1m was paid to Mr Kumar under a code for consulting services, Mr Kumar responded: “I don’t think they could pay me for insider trading in their records, sir.”Prosecutor Jonathan Streeter later also asked Mr Kumar about the payments, revealing that the partnership agreements were signed several months after Mr Kumar received the $1m payment.Mr Dowd also attacked the allegation that Mr Kumar provided Mr Rajaratnam secret information about an Abu Dhabi investment fund’s plan to invest in AMD’s chip manufacturing business. He showed copies of industry publications that had reported in July 2008 that AMD was pursuing that strategy. One article said the likely suitor was the Abu Dhabi investment fund.Prosecutors allege Mr Kumar tipped Mr Rajaratnam about the deal six months before its October 2008 announcement and focused on an August 2008 phone call in which Mr Kumar relayed that there was a “handshake” agreement. That call set off a flurry of further calls between Mr Rajaratnam and other Galleon traders.Mr Kumar emphasised that the articles were “speculating” about the investment but because of his insider role, he knew for certain that a deal would happen and that it would involve a sum of $6bn.Mr Dowd also cross-examined Mr Kumar on his testimony that he tipped off
Mr Rajaratnam on October 3 2008 that Ebay planned to announce “massive lay-offs” the following Monday.Mr Dowd read from an article published in September 2008, citing that analysts expected Ebay to announce lay-offs of 10 per cent of its staff, suggesting the information was already public.“It was speculation, not public,” Mr Kumar replied. “Ebay had not told anyone this information yet.”An Intel investor relations manager later testified he shared non-public information about the chipmaker’s earnings with Rajiv Goel, an Intel executive, the day before the company announced its results. The manager told Mr Goel “this makes you an insider”. Mr Goel has pleaded guilty to tipping off Mr Rajaratnam about Intel’s quarterly earnings. He is expected to testify as part of a co-operation deal with the government.The trial continues."
126;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-15T01:38:12Z;Prosecutors say trader passed tips from ‘intimate’ ties;;"Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund billionaire on trial for alleged insider trading, received tips and swapped information with a cadre of associates including one trader who peddled information she obtained from “intimate” relationships with two executives, prosecutors said on Monday.Prosecutors played more than a dozen phone conversations recorded in late 2008 relating to a plan by Advanced Micro Devices to sell its chip-manufacturing business to the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi. The calls, which provided updates of deal terms and the timing of the deal’s announcement before it was public, were buttressed with testimony from Anil Kumar, the former McKinsey consultant who has pleaded guilty in a co-operation deal with the government.The tapes provided the jury with a sense of Mr Rajaratnam in action. Lawyers for Mr Rajaratnam say his trades were based on research.Mr Kumar testified that in 2008 Mr Rajaratnam told him that his value as a source was “a little bit diminished” because he had another source in Danielle Chiesi, a Bear Stearns hedge fund trader who had “intimate” relationships with Hector Ruiz, the then-chief executive of AMD, and Robert Moffat, then an IBM executive.Ms Chiesi has pleaded guilty but is not co-operating with the government. Mr Moffat has pleaded guilty; Mr Ruiz has not been charged.Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Mr Ruiz, said: “Any suggestion that the relationship was intimate is untrue.”In one call on August 15 2008, just after 11am, Mr Kumar relayed to Mr Rajaratnam that there was a “handshake agreement” between AMD and Abu Dhabi’s investment fund. At 11:20am, Mr Rajaratnam was on the phone with Ms Chiesi and told her about the handshake and plans to invest $6bn to $8bn. At 2:02pm, Mr Rajaratnam told his brother he learnt that AMD had “a handshake with the Arabs”, and said, “I’m buying some” AMD stock, according to the tape.Mr Kumar testified that he provided Mr Rajaratnam notice on September 30 that the deal was expected to be in the range of $5bn-$6bn and would close on October 7.Mr Rajaratnam next phoned Ms Chiesi: “The date is October 7.” He added: “I blew it out today. I’m gonna become Mr October.”Ms Chiesi said: “Everybody is being investigated. Do you think I could buy it here, honestly?”She thanked him for calling her on a secure phone line. “I’m a little nervous because you know people are going to investigate me.”Mr Rajaratnam said if she wanted to own 500,000 shares, she should buy 1m and then sell 500,000, according to the tape.Prosecutors allege Mr Rajaratnam was instructing her to create trading patterns as a disguise.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in San Francisco"

David never agreed to do anything like this.”Mr Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon hedge fund group, is facing accusations of using his business associates to gather secret company information and use it to reap millions of dollars in illegal profits. Mr Rajaratnam has denied the accusations.On Monday, federal prosecutors played a tape of a phone conversation between Raj Rajaratnam and his brother Rengan, who has not been charged. Rengan Rajaratnam said he had caught up with Mr Palecek, his Stanford Graduate School of Business classmate, about Advanced Micro Devices, a McKinsey client.Rengan Rajaratnam recalled that Mr Palecek said, “Buy as much as you can as soon as you can.” Rengan Rajaratnam quoted his friend as saying that his best information was inside information and suggested that Galleon put his friend’s wife on the firm’s payroll.“He’s definitely thinking about playing ball,” Rengan Rajaratnam told his brother, Raj.Mr Palecek worked in McKinsey’s Palo Alto, California, office until his death in February 2010 and was head of McKinsey’s semiconductor practice.One person who knew Mr Palecek said any alleged involvement in the insider trading scandal would come as a shock.During the meeting, Dominic Barton, global managing director, is expected to address any reputational damage inflicted on McKinsey by the trial, in which Anil Kumar, another former McKinsey partner, is a key government witness. Mr Kumar has pleaded guilty in the hope of a lighter prison sentence.The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed separate civil insider trading charges against Rajat Gupta, one of Mr Barton’s predecessors as elected head of McKinsey. His lawyer says the charges are “baseless”.Born in the US, David Vaclav Palecek was of Czech descent and joined McKinsey’s Prague office before attending Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, where he met his wife, Melissa Black. He rejoined the firm in Palo Alto and became a partner in 2003. Towards the end of his life, Mr Palecek led McKinsey’s global semiconductor practice and was its US west coast chief financial officer.
128;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-14T18:48:08Z;Ex-McKinsey partner traded tips for cash;;Anil Kumar, the former McKinsey partner, testified in a New York court on Monday that he told Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of hedge fund Galleon Group, about strategic plans and earnings guidance for at least three McKinsey clients in exchange for payments.Mr Kumar, a government witness at the insider trading trial of Mr Rajaratnam, told the jury how he leaked details of “super-confidential” negotiations by chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices to buy either Nvidia or ATI Technologies, the graphics companies.The court heard the 2006 talks were so secret that the project was at first code-named “Supernova,” and then “Go Big”, said Mr Kumar, who advised AMD on the deal in his capacity as a McKinsey’s consultant.When Mr Kumar updated Mr Rajaratnam that AMD was going forward with the ATI deal, he said he recalled the hedge fund founder questioning him, since Nvidia was the stronger of the two companies. “I said, come on,” Mr Kumar recalled. He told Mr Rajaratnam: “I’m in the inner circle” referring to AMD.He also recalled later telling Mr Rajaratnam that AMD would pay at least $20 a share, a premium to where the company was trading at the time.Mr Kumar said he knew that Mr Rajaratnam was buying AMD stock, but he did not want to know the specific details.When Mr Rajaratnam sought to renegotiate his payment, saying he would pay him after the trades were placed, Mr Kumar objected saying it was too much of a “slap” in the face to acknowledge that he was involved in a “bigger” crime.Mr Kumar received a “bonus” from Galleon of $1m that year for supplying information about the AMD deal.Not all the deals worked out. Mr Kumar told Mr Rajaratnam that another one of his clients expected to lose money, so Mr Rajaratam took a short position on the stock. But the company announced a takeover, causing the stock to rise instead. Mr Kumar said that Mr Rajaratnam said he was “very upset about losing money” this time.Mr Kumar also offered an account of Mr Rajaratnam’s providing him with unsolicited records from Intel – a rival of AMD.Prosecutors are expected to play recordings of the phone calls between Mr Kumar and Mr Rajaratnam.Mr Kumar’s account came on the second day of his testimony for prosecutors in Mr Rajaratnam’s trial.
129;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Former McKinsey partner ‘owed’ Rajaratnam;;Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey partner, testified that he shared client secrets with Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, because he felt obligated to him after agreeing to accept $500,000 a year in consulting fees.“Mr Rajaratnam kept asking me for that information and I felt that I owed him something given how much money he was paying me,” Mr Kumar testified on Thursday.Mr Kumar’s testimony, which is expected to continue for several days, came on the first day of Mr Rajaratnam’s federal trial on insider trading charges. Earlier in the day, prosecutors placed photos of Mr Kumar and two other co-conspirators on a black Velcro board facing the jury.Mr Kumar has pleaded guilty to securities fraud and is co-operating with the government in hopes of a lighter prison sentence. He has agreed to forfeit $2.7m in fees and profits he received from Galleon.Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer is painting a different picture of Mr Kumar, saying he defrauded the government by not paying taxes and his own partners at McKinsey by not sharing his consulting fees with the firm.Mr Kumar said he twice, unsuccessfully, tried to win Galleon as a McKinsey client. Then, in the fall of 2003, Mr Kumar ran into Mr Rajaratnam after leaving a charity dinner.“He pulled me aside,” recounted Mr Kumar, who at times pressed his hands together as he spoke. Mr Rajaratnam appealed to Mr Kumar’s ego, saying he wasn’t interested in McKinsey, according to Mr Kumar. “I want your input. I’m willing to pay you $500,000 a year just for you,” Mr Kumar recalled him as saying.Mr Kumar testified that Mr Rajaratnam told him that while Mr Kumar was in India, he had missed out on fortunes being made in the US. Mr Rajaratnam said he would pay Mr Kumar to take notes about what he knew and chat once a month about his ideas, Mr Kumar said.He described how Mr Rajaratnam instructed him to set up a Swiss bank account and an offshore account investing in Galleon, using his housekeeper’s name to avoid detection.After he began receiving money, in $150,000 instalments, Mr Kumar said Mr Rajaratnam “got quite specific” in his questions about quarterly earnings and profits.On two occasions, Mr Kumar testified, he told Mr Rajaratnam about strategies considered by his client, Advanced Micro Devices.“I was proud” of AMD’s strategy, Mr Kumar said. “Sadly, I violated everything in sharing it with Mr Rajaratnam.”Mr Kumar said he didn’t know the specifics of Mr Rajaratnam’s trading. “I knew it was valuable. He would thank me,” Mr Kumar testified.
130;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-09T01:27:04Z;Top Goldman executives on Galleon witness list;;Goldman Sachs’ two most senior executives, Lloyd Blankfein and David Viniar, chief executive and chief financial officer respectively, were among the high-profile names on a list of those who may be called as witnesses in the insider trading trial of hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, co-founder of Galleon Group.The list, which contains names of people and companies that may be mentioned in the trial or who may be called as witnesses, also included Hector Ruiz, the former chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, and Sam Miri, a former Marvell Technology executive.Kamal Ahmed, a Morgan Stanley banker, was also named. Mr Ahmed has been identified in court papers as a banker who allegedly tipped another person, who has been identified as former Galleon employee Adam Smith, about a merger. Mr Smith pleaded guilty to tipping Mr Rajaratnam. Mr Ahmed has not been charged with any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said he will be exonerated.One of the companies mentioned was Gerson Lehrman Group, an expert network firm that matches industry specialists with money managers. In a separate insider trading investigation, prosecutors have filed charges against several employees of expert network firm Primary Global Research, several public company employees that consulted with the firm and four hedge fund employees.This is the first time Gerson Lehrman’s name has been identified by the government in the broad and expanding insider trading probe. The firm is not alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing.Judge Richard Holwell, who is overseeing the trial, read the potential witness list aloud to a courtroom filled with more than 100 prospective jurors as he began the process of winnowing the group down to 12 jurors and six alternates to sit for the two-month trial. No jurors were selected by the end of day on Tuesday, but Judge Holwell said he expected to have a jury seated on Wednesday, with opening statements from the government and defence to follow.Prosecutors have charged Mr Rajaratnam with allegedly making $45m in illicit profits by trading nine stocks based on secret company information. Mr Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing and is mounting a vigorous defence.Mr Rajaratnam, who was wearing a charcoal grey suit and blue tie, sat at the defence table for more than five hours as he listened to the jurors respond to 52 questions.Among the questions asked was whether the recession could impact a juror’s impartiality and whether hearing about wealthy individuals and multimillion dollar transactions would make it difficult for them to decide the case fairly. Two jurors were dismissed based on their answers to those questions.When the judge asked if any of the prospective jurors in the room had heard about the Galleon case, eight said that they had. The judge excused one of them.Another prospective juror who raised his hand when asked whether he personally or any of his friends lobbied or took positions on law enforcement, said he had been a friend of Reverend Al Sharpton, a previous Democratic presidential candidate, for 30 years. He was also dismissed.
131;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-04T11:43:10Z;The iPad 2 is worth the wait;Cameras, colours and improved graphics added to tablet;"Apple set up a “pop-up” store backstage at its unveiling of the iPad 2 in San Francisco on Wednesday, with long, wide tables staffed by its “Genius” assistants showing off dozens of its updated tablets to journalists.We were wowed by the origami tricks performed with the ingenious new rollback Smart Covers for the device and tapped away at the instrumental keyboards on the GarageBand app just launched.But there were also mixed reactions, likely to be mirrored in Apple stores when iPad 2 goes on sale on March 11 in the US and March 25 in 26 other countries.For those already in possession of the first version of the “magical and revolutionary device”, there were frowns as they pondered whether to upgrade after less than a year to the new version – with the same screen, battery life, operating system and apps – or to hold on for iPad 3 and, maybe, a higher-resolution display and more memory and features.For others like me, who held off buying the first iPad, this was the one we were waiting for – cameras, thinner and lighter, many thousands of apps and purpose-designed to bring its screen to life and full utility.In fact, Apple has displayed its patented Goldilocks method of doing neither too little nor too much to improve on an already successful device – enough to encourage existing users to consider upgrading, certainly enough to attract new buyers, while leaving everyone wanting more.More important, iPad 2 keeps Apple on top of the competition in terms of time to market, matching their higher specifications and increasing its domination in apps that enthral consumers.The new model is an iPad to the power of two: a dual-core processor for double the computing power and up to nine times better graphics performance; two cameras added for taking photos, making movies and videoconferencing with the included FaceTime app; and it even comes in two colours: black or white.The front and rear camera additions in particular may get many iPad ditherers off the fence and into Apple’s stores. The fact that the iPad is down to 1.3lbs from 1.5lbs and 33 per cent thinner will help too.It maintains its 10-hour battery life.They may also like the ingenious new Smart Covers in 10 different colours. These are folding screens of polyurethane or leather that protect the glass display and lock on to the side of the iPad magnetically. They fold back or forward automatically to turn the iPad on or off and can be turned into a stand for the device. They are far less bulky than standard cases.In spite of rumours, the resolution of the iPad’s screen remains the same; it is lower in resolution and size than the recently launched Motorola Xoom. The Xoom is the first tablet to feature Android’s Honeycomb operating system, which is the first version to be purpose-designed for tablets.Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, was dismissive on Wednesday of the Xoom and Google’s Honeycomb – it costs $800, he pointed out, which is more than all but one version of the new iPad, whose prices remain the same (the original iPad has dropped in price by $100). Honeycomb had barely 100 apps designed for the bigger screen at launch, compared with 65,000 now available for the iPad, he added.That software edge is the key differentiator for Apple. Demonstrations of touch-enabled versions of Apple’s iMovie and GarageBand Mac programs emphasised that consumers can do far more on an iPad currently than on any other tablet.With the launch last week of another update in Apple’s MacBook Pro line – which is adopting iPad characteristics – and now of the iPad 2, Apple is moving its customers one step nearer to the post-PC world Mr Jobs spoke of at Wednesday’s launch.The new MacBook Pro freshens up Apple’s line of laptopsSwitching from a PC to a Mac meant changing the tech habits of a lifetime in the past, but increasing familiarity with Apple’s devices and computing philosophy, through the success of the iPad and the iPhone, is making that transition easier.As a PC guy, I have been gradually seduced in this way. PCs and laptops based on Microsoft software have been nearly all I have used for more than 20 years – they were standard issue at work and, for personal use, more programs and games were available, and the PC gave me a lot more bang for my buck than Macs.But then I bought an iPod Touch, was mightily impressed by the latest MacBook Air – and have now been testing one of the new MacBook Pro models launched last week.Apple talks about the “halo effect” around its best products, whereby consumers go on to buy its other devices because they expect they will be just as good. There may also be an “escalator effect”, whereby they ascend to higher-priced items – the iPod’s success helped Mac sales, the iPhone has helped iPad sales.Now the iPad is prompting consumers and Apple itself to look at the MacBook line afresh – particularly with the major update of the MacBook Air notebook in October: – “what would happen if a MacBook and an iPad hooked up”, as Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, put it.The MacBook Pro line aims to satisfy professional computing demands and is priced accordingly. A new line of MacBook Pros launched last week, and my review unit’s configuration costs $1,500 (£1,300 in the UK), with its 13in screen, Intel Core i7 2.7Ghz dual-core processor, 4GB of memory and a 500GB hard drive. There are cheaper configurations with less power and more pricier versions with more power, bigger screen and better graphics.One small but potentially significant addition is a Thunderbolt port – a new proprietary standard introduced by Apple and Intel. Thunderbolt offers data transfer speeds twice as fast as the latest – and increasingly available – USB 3.0 standard, which itself is 10 times faster than the generally available USB 2.0 standard. Thunderbolt, by contrast, lacks wide industry support.But Apple is up with the pack in introducing Intel’s second-generation Core i5 and i7 processors. With regular processing and graphics engines combined on the same chip for the first time, performance is much improved, particularly in processing media – such as converting video to different formats and editing movies.Graphics are further boosted in the higher-end models with a separate graphics chip from AMD. Other features include an improved FaceTime HD webcam, backlit keyboard and a battery life of up to seven hours.Windows users worrying about adapting to the Mac’s OS X desktop interface and operating system may find, like me, that they spend most of their time inside a familiar web browser anyway, accessing documents and e-mail in the cloud.Overall, I was very impressed with the build quality of the MacBook Pro and the extra video performance. However, its Windows rivals still offer more features and connectivity – such as HDMI, 3D capabilities, mobile broadband built in and punchier sound – at cheaper prices.The 11.6in MacBook Air is also lighter on the pocket and almost half the weight of the 13in Pro. Apple went back to the Mac with its iPad ideas to develop the Air. The Pro, in still representing the best in conventional thinking of what a laptop should offer, is only keeping time with the rest, rather than sharing in the Air’s future vision.Windows notebook or MacBook Pro? Both are still needed for data-intensive professional uses, but many will find an iPad or a MacBook Air will do all they need in the post-PC world that Mr Jobs spoke of this week when launching the iPad 2.chris.nuttall@ft.com"
132;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-02T22:27:41Z;Insider trading: Brought to court;As authorities take ever sterner action on illicitly obtained information, in their sights are not just one-off tips but networks of professionals, write Kara Scannell and Brooke Masters;"Mark Anthony Longoria was busy fielding calls from Wall Street. As a supply chain manager with Advanced Micro Devices, he had broad responsibilities – but this was not part of his day job at the chipmaker. “Tony” Longoria also moonlighted as a consultant for Primary Global Research, a firm that matches industry experts with money managers seeking corporate information.AMD was due to report earnings and Mr Longoria was in high demand. Paid $300 an hour, he participated in 40 calls with 15 clients over a 60-day period, according to court documents. On July 21 2009, prosecutors allege, he provided exact revenue numbers and other financial data to a securities analyst and a hedge fund consultant.All three have been charged with insider trading. The other two have pleaded guilty. Mr Longoria is in plea negotiations with prosecutors, says his lawyer. The case is part of an expansive five-year US investigation into the misuse of secret company information that has ensnared more than 40 individuals from across Wall Street and corporate America.The probe targets the myriad sources of information through which professional traders gain an edge in fast-moving global markets. Just this week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Rajat Gupta, former head of McKinsey, the management consultancy, alleging he passed on information he learnt as a board member of Goldman Sachs. He denies wrongdoing.Not since the groundbreaking 1980s investigation that led to the jailing of arbitrageur Ivan Boesky has Wall Street been so shaken. The US probe comes, moreover, at a time when authorities around the world – most dramatically in the UK and Hong Kong – are also attacking insider dealing with unprecedented fervour. Seeking to restore investor confidence shaken by the financial crisis, government enforcers are targeting professional traders and their close-knit and personally beneficial relationships.“Insider trading corrodes that investor confidence. It undermines the integrity of the markets by tilting, unacceptably, the playing field in favour of those whose greed drives them to betray the duties and confidences they owe others,” Robert Khuzami, SEC enforcement director, said recently. “It short-changes every other investor who executes trades, with all the attendant risks, on the basis of trading decisions made by dint of hard work and genuine analysis.”Prosecutors have charged a wide range of professionals: hedge fund managers, employees of listed companies, a credit rating analyst and two lawyers. The first big test comes next week when Raj Rajaratnam goes on trial. The billionaire co-founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund has pleaded not guilty to allegations that he traded in more than 30 stocks based on inside information.The investigation has prompted some hedge funds to close. According to corporate security and investigation executives, some investment managers are also having their offices and homes swept rigorously for listening devices. The probe has also highlighted a potential downside of the exponential growth of the hedge fund industry, which meant thousands of investment firms were seeking to attract investors. With so many traders looking for some kind of edge, “expert network” firms such as Primary Global grew up to service them.At the same time, institutional memories of the 1980s insider dealing probes began to fade, and many hedge funds lacked the elaborate compliance departments that big banks use to deter improper trading. Prosecutors allege some information providers then began peddling non-public information in exchange for fees to a cadre of all too willing buyers.Across the Atlantic, the UK Financial Services Authority is flexing both its criminal and regulatory muscles against the suspicious trading that routinely floods its markets. The watchdog recently began using real-time monitoring and intelligence gathering to catch insider dealers in the act. Years behind their US colleagues in terms of bringing criminal cases, the UK authorities have nonetheless shocked traders with high-profile raids on City of London institutions last year and a series of warnings and civil cases that target leaks and rumour-mongering. In January, the authority won its longest criminal sentence to date in its first successful prosecution of an employed banker.“A little enforcement goes a long way. If we can stigmatise this activity as criminal, the large majority of people will not want to engage in it,” says Jamie Symington, an FSA enforcement department head.Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, too, has brought a slew of insider trading cases over the past couple of years, including the 2009 prosecution of a former Morgan Stanley senior banker, who was jailed for seven years.Authorities have also ramped up their cross-border information sharing and they are starting to bring joint cases. US and UK prosecutors are currently co-operating on a case in which UK spread betters allegedly traded ahead of technology mergers based on information leaked from the US. US prosecutors also convicted a London-based, Greek-born investment banker at Switzerland’s UBS for tipping off family members and a US-based portfolio manager at Jefferies, a New York investment bank.The increased attention to professionals arises out of previous – sometimes failed – efforts to investigate and deter widespread trading ahead of corporate announcements. US authorities have previously investigated expert network firms but dropped the probes after failing to develop evidence of wrongdoing.…Insider dealing has been around for about as long as markets have existed. The FSA’s own statistics reveal unusual trading ahead of nearly 30 per cent of UK mergers in recent years; academic research suggests similar trends hold true in the US.In the past, many cases involved one-off situations, where an assistant at a company obtained internal information and shared it with a family member or friend. But the recent cases purport to show a more sophisticated machine at work. Traders have allegedly peddled inside information as a cost of doing business, taking a calculated risk that they would not be caught. Insider trading has become “more professionalised” and “institutionalised among large networks of market professionals”, Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC’s market abuse unit, said recently.Court documents allege traders use pay-as-you-go mobile phones to hide their tracks and store tips on flash drives rather than company computers that may be subject to compliance programs. Some also buy and sell stocks repeatedly to create false patterns, and print out research reports as apparent justification for their trades, prosecutors maintain.In one instance, prosecutors allege, a hedge fund manager called Samir Barai told Jason Pflaum, an analyst, not to worry about the federal investigation because they could rely on the “mosaic theory” as a defence, according to a note sent using BlackBerry Messenger and cited in a court document. Mr Barai denies wrongdoing, while Mr Pflaum has pleaded guilty and is co-operating with the government. Under the mosaic theory, traders can defend themselves against insider trading charges by showing that they based their decisions on large quantities of information rather than a single element.“Disturbingly, many of the people who are going to such lengths to obtain inside information for a trading advantage are already among the most advantaged, privileged and wealthy insiders in modern finance,” said Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan, in a speech last year about what he called a “corrupt network” of insiders.As traders have grown more sophisticated, enforcers too have had to become smarter. Insider trading cases are generally difficult to prove, because they are based on circumstantial evidence and juries have often been reluctant to convict. The SEC has recently lost two civil insider trading cases.Both US and UK authorities are looking for relationships among bankers and traders rather than just unusual stock movements. US officials are also tapping phones to record conversations and wiring co-operators to build up more direct evidence.US and UK law enforcement officers are also calling for longer prison sentences for insider trading, and the FSA is moving to publicise its civil cases more quickly – before the appeals process is complete. “We want to change the way people behave. The sooner we make the decision public, the sooner [people] can change their behaviour,” says Tracey McDermott, of the FSA’s enforcement department.Defence lawyers argue, however, that insider trading is a victimless crime: the person on the other side of the trade always has their own reasons for buying or selling. They also complain that US enforcers are going too far, attacking legitimate research techniques.“An essential element in the deployment of enforcement resources is getting your priorities right,” says Tony Woodcock, a UK partner with Stephenson Harwood, a law firm. “I question whether putting individuals or entities, who are in most cases doing their best to navigate unclear and moving standards in a complex industry, through aggressive and lengthy enforcement adds anything to what could more efficiently be achieved through better supervision.”…Concern about professional insider trading has developed alongside the exponential growth of both independent research firms and hedge funds and other rapid-fire traders, say many observers.Until a decade ago, banks were the main providers of corporate research on companies. But a 2002 analyst scandal changed the landscape. Ten US investment banks agreed to separate their research from investment banking operations and set aside money for independent research. At the same time, Regulation Fair Disclosure, an SEC rule forbidding companies from sharing confidential data with favoured analysts and investors, removed an important source of information about companies.“It’s not like you can turn off the information spigot,” says Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Michigan. Instead, “it got channelled in a way that I don’t think anybody ever expected”.Some on Wall Street and in the City say the authorities are changing the rules of the game through criminal charges rather than writing new regulations. They argue that not all the information that is learnt from company insiders is material, which the US Supreme Court defines as information a reasonable investor would want to know when trading. Some of the data that were allegedly passed on by company insiders, such as the volume of semiconductor wafer shipments, might be important to someone specialised in technology companies, defence lawyers argue, but may not matter to an average investor.The farther away the authorities get from pursuing traditional inside information, such as on corporate takeovers, the more difficult it could be to win cases, says Prof Henning. “That will be the challenge for the SEC if they start bringing cases more on the edge” of materiality.………………………………………THE GALLEON CASEA test of how evidence of rings plays before the juryIn a legal showdown set to start next week, US prosecutors will go head to head with hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam to try to prove he violated securities law by trading on inside information, writes Kara Scannell.The battle, in a lower Manhattan courtroom, will pit a team of federal prosecutors who have been investigating the case for more than two years against John Dowd, a veteran Washington defence lawyer with a reputation for not pulling punches.The stakes are high for the government. Though more than 20 people have pleaded guilty in its assault on alleged insider-trading rings of professionals, the trial will be the first test of how their evidence and legal theories play before a jury of New Yorkers.For Mr Rajaratnam, whose Galleon Group hedge funds were liquidated after his 2009 arrest, the stakes are equally high. If convicted, the Sri Lankan-born American faces up to 15 to 20 years in prison. The former fund manager has denied doing anything wrong and is fighting for his reputation.Mr Dowd, through a spokesman, declined to comment. The US attorney’s office in Manhattan, which is prosecuting the case, also declined to comment.Prosecutors have alleged Mr Rajaratnam’s funds made more than $45m from trading nine stocks based on tips he received from various sources. According to the indictment, the tips came from four associates in several professions: Roomy Khan, a former Galleon trader; Rajiv Goel, a former finance executive at Intel, the technology group; Anil Kumar, a former partner at McKinsey, the management consultancy; and Danielle Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns hedge fund manager. Each pleaded guilty.While neither side will reveal, even to the other, how it plans to present its arguments, lawyers following the case expect the government to rely heavily on Mr Rajaratnam’s secretly recorded phone conversations. The aim is to present the jury with Mr Rajaratnam discussing tips inappropriately, in his own words, with alleged co-conspirators.To be successful, prosecutors will have to prove that the information Mr Rajaratnam obtained was material, or meaningful to an average investor, and that he received it from an insider who was prohibited from sharing it.The defence is expected to attack the government allegations on many fronts. In a court filing, the lawyers argued that Mr Rajaratnam’s duty to his investors was to research stocks and that he did not necessarily know the source of the information.Lawyers say that the evidence appears to be stacked against Mr Rajaratnam but his fate will boil down to which side does a better job of convincing the jury."
133;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-02T00:32:48Z;Rising to the top at McKinsey;;Until civil insider trading charges were filed against Rajat Gupta on Tuesday, he was regarded as one of the great success stories at McKinsey, the elite management consultancy he led for almost a decade.Born to a middle-class family in Maniktala, Calcutta, Mr Gupta joined McKinsey in 1973 from Harvard Business School. After a 21-year rise, he was elected as managing director in 1994, the first Indian to head a global company.However, the Securities and Exchange Commission allege that after retiring from McKinsey in 2007, Mr Gupta abused his position on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble to pass inside information to Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon.Mr Gupta’s attorney called the allegations “baseless” and said his client did nothing wrong. Mr Gupta has not been charged criminally, and Mr Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing.This marks the second time McKinsey has been linked to the insider trading investigation.A McKinsey partner, Anil Kumar, pleaded guilty to providing Raj Rajaratnam with inside information about Ebay and Advanced Micro Devices and is co-operating with the government.“We were saddened to learn about the civil charges against our former colleague”, said a spokesperson for McKinsey.Former McKinsey colleagues, who did not want to be identified, said Mr Gupta’s alleged actions were completely at odds with the consultancy’s values.“What he is alleged to have done . . . It is so incredible as to be absurd,” said one.Client confidence features heavily in the five tennets of founder James O. McKinsey, that call on consultants to “adhere to high ethical standards in everything the firm does”.For a private company that prefers to operate out of the public eye, any hit to the consultancy’s repution will be felt from the reaction of its clients, says Stephen Davis of the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance. “However, relationships are far less fragile than most people think. McKinsey was able to weather its involvement in Enron because people ultimately judge them on their smarts and advice,” he said.Only client relationships that are already weak might be at risk to poaching by competitors, says Robert H. Bloom, a former US chief executive of Publicis and author of the business strategy book The New Experts.But he cautions that Mckinsey might be more vulnerable than normal because it comes against “a backdrop of frustration at the failure of people in high places to take responsibility”.

135;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-03-01T00:03:12Z;Former AMD manager in talks to plead guilty;;"A former supply chain manager of Advanced Micro Devices, who prosecutors allege provided inside information to hedge funds, was in talks to plead guilty, his lawyer said on Monday.Mark Anthony Longoria, the former AMD executive who also worked as a paid consultant for Primary Global Research, was charged last year by federal prosecutors with passing quarterly earnings information to hedge fund managers. Primary Global is a network firm that matches industry experts with investors.Jonathan Marks, an attorney for Mr Longoria, said, “We are in plea negotiations” with the government. Prosecutors face a deadline of March 7 to file an indictment, seek an extension or present a guilty plea.Prosecutors face the same deadline in their case against Walter Shimoon, a vice-
president at Flextronics International, who was charged with insider trading. Mr Shimoon’s attorney said it was a “fluid” situation and declined further comment.A spokeswoman for the US attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.If Mr Longoria cuts a deal and agrees to co-operate, he would be the second public-company employee to plead guilty in connection with the expert network investigation. Daniel Devore, a former global supply chain manager at Dell, pleaded guilty last year in a co-operation deal with the government.Mr Longoria’s co-operation could provide prosecutors with information about other hedge funds who may have traded using his information. AMD has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not paying Mr Longoria’s legal fees.Mr Longoria, 44, was one of Primary Global’s most sought after consultants. In a 60-day period, Mr Longoria allegedly had 40 conversations with 15 of the firm’s clients, according to court documents. Mr Longoria made over $130,000 in consulting fees, the documents said.As alleged in public documents, Mr Longoria tipped officials at two hedge funds, including Richard CB Lee, co-founder of Far & Lee. Mr Lee previously pleaded guilty and is co-operating with the government against Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Group co-founder. Mr Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing and is expected to go to trial next week.Mr Longoria also allegedly gave inside information to an analyst at Barai Capital Management, according to court documents. The analyst has pleaded guilty, while the firm’s founder has denied wrongdoing."

The recent departures of chief executives at Hewlett-Packard, Pfizer and AMD have brought the issue to prominence.At Apple, since its chief executive took a six-month leave of absence in 2009, which later turned out to have been for a liver transplant, Mr Jobs’ eventual replacement has topped the list of shareholder concerns.Investors and Apple’s many loyal fans believe Mr Jobs – the driving force behind devices such as the iPad – is irreplaceable, and yet, irrespective of his health issues, like all chief executives he will need to be replaced at some point.The proposal to disclose detailed succession planning policy was put forward by the Central Laborers’ Pension Fund of Jacksonville, Illinois, before Mr Jobs’ abrupt departure on open-ended medical leave last month.Apple argues that publicising such information would hand competitors an unfair advantage and undermine efforts to recruit and retain executives.But “Apple completely misconstrues the intent of the shareholder proposal”, says the Central Laborers’ union. “If Apple talked to us that would have been cleared up.”The union is simply asking for discussion of succession, it says, citing Wells Fargo, the bank, and Whole Foods, the retailer, among 30 companies that have adopted the measure.Such moves reflect a long-term shift towards greater communication between shareholders and directors.“Previously boards were just crisis advisers to management”, says John Wilcox of Sodali, a consultancy, “but over 25 years of corporate governance reform we’ve redefined the job. Boards are now representatives of shareholders”.Pushing that agenda, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest US public pension fund by assets, wants Apple to introduce majority voting in elections for board members.“In this day and age for a company to say that they can’t or that they won’t is somewhat ridiculous”, says Anne Simpson, senior portfolio manager in charge of corporate governance at Calpers, which holds a 0.24 per cent stake.At present Apple’s “plurality” voting system allows a director to be elected unopposed with just one vote in favour.“If you can’t elect directors by a majority, then its not an election, it’s a coronation,” says Ms Simpson.For a fund with $228bn under management, the argument that if you dislike the way a company operates you sell your shares is not realistic, she adds.Apple counters that “the unusual mechanics of California law create the risk that directors who enjoy overwhelming shareholder support may fail to be elected” if there are insufficient votes.Under majority voting, a director is required to gain an affirmative vote of slightly more than 25 per cent of the ballot under California rules, or else they are forced to stand down even if no votes are withheld. The end of discretionary voting by brokers will mean lower votes, making it “significantly more difficult” to elect a director even when shareholders are satisfied, Apple argues in its proxy statement.Majority voting is now seen as “standard best practice” says Stephen Brown, director of corporate governance at TIAA-CREF, which manages $453bn for individuals and academic and non-profit institutions, and owns 1 per cent of Apple shares.

Mr Kumar has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify during Mr Rajaratnam’s trial.Mr Gupta was a senior partner at McKinsey until the end of 2007.His lawyer did not return a call for comment. The lawyer previously said his client, who has not been charged with any crimes, did nothing wrong.A second McKinsey partner, not identified by name, is alleged in the filing to have been a “tipper” who provided information to Mr Rajaratnam about a number of stocks while employed at the management consultancy. Mr Kumar is expected to testify that he shared non-public information about Business Objects, EMC, Juniper, Spansion and Samsung with Mr Rajaratnam, according to documents filed by his lawyers. Mr Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing. Some of those companies were previously identified in court filings but the information was not alleged to have come from Mr Kumar.The US attorney’s office and McKinsey declined to comment.Mr Kumar did not have an immediate comment. He previously pleaded guilty to providing Mr Rajaratnam with inside information about Ebay and Advanced Micro Devices and is co-operating with the government.McKinsey objected to Mr Dowd’s subpoena, saying it was overly broad and that it had already turned over documents to Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyers, according to court filings. Defence lawyers said Mr Kumar and another McKinsey partner ran a joint consultancy out of McKinsey’s offices. Galleon was also a client of McKinsey’s in 2008, according to court documents.
138;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-31T21:36:15Z;US stocks boosted by Exxon earnings;;"Strong earnings results from ExxonMobil and better-than-expected consumer spending data lifted Wall Street, helping to pare some of the sharp losses seen late last week.The US markets were one of the few around the world unruffled by the continued turmoil in Egypt, bouncing back from the 1.8 per cent losses seen on Friday.This helped the S&P 500 index finish the month 2.3 per cent higher in what was the first January gain for four years and the best January performance since 2006. Investors were bullish due to a healthy earnings season and optimism over the state of the US economic recovery.On Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,286.12, led by energy stocks after ExxonMobil posted earnings up 46 per cent thanks to high oil prices.The oil group reported earnings of $9.25bn, or$1.85 a share, in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.62 per
share. These were the best results since 2008, when the energy group reported a record profit of $14.8bn.“ExxonMobil posted staggering quarterly income,” said David Buik at BGC Partners.The company’s shares were up 2.1 per cent to $80.68, still 25 per cent off its 2008 peak share price despite the price of Brent crude topping $100 a barrel on Monday.The earnings results lifted related stocks, with Hess, another energy group, up 3.2 per cent to $84.12. The S&P energy index jumped up 2.6 per cent to 543.84.Also helping to boost the wider markets were strong consumer spending figures from the commerce department. Data showed consumer spending had grown by 0.7 per cent in December, beating economists’ estimates of 0.5 per cent growth.But the US savings rate edged lower, falling from
5.5 per cent in November
to 5.3 per cent last
month, showing that this extra consumption was partly as a result of people dipping into their savings accounts.In other economic data, the Chicago Purchasing Manager Business Barometer rose by 2 points to
68.8 in December, ahead
of the median forecast of 64.5. This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain 0.6 per cent to 11,891.93, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,700.08. The indices were up 2.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively over the month.Shares in Massey Energy, the fourth-largest US coal producer, rose 9.8 per cent to $62.86 on news that it was being bought by Alpha Natural Resources, the third-largest coal producer in the US, for about $8.5bn in cash and stock.Under the terms of the deal, Massey shareholders will receive 1.025 Alpha Natural Resources shares plus $10 cash for each share held, valuing Massey at $69.33 a share, or 21 per cent more than its last trading price on Friday. Stocks in Alpha Natural Resources fell 7.2 per cent to $53.73 on the announcement.Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas company, was up 8.1 per cent to $29.53 on news that Cnooc, China’s largest offshore oil andgas producer, is buying a stake in some of their concerns.Cnooc will pay $570m in cash for a 33 per cent stake in Chesapeake oil and gas fields in Wyoming and Colorado. This is the second onshore US deal in four months from Cnooc.Stocks in oil tanker owners lost ground in the session. On Friday, shares in tanker owners had jumped on fears that the protests in Egypt would lead to the Suez Canal, an oil-shipping choke point, being closed down.Investors had speculated that the extra 6,000 miles the oil would have had to be shipped round Africa from the Middle East to Europe and America could have proved lucrative for those doing the transporting.Even so, owner stocks lost much of the ground they had made. Frontline, the world’s largest oil tanker operator, was down 4.4 per cent to $25.93 while Overseas Shipholding Group was down 3.4 per cent to $33.24.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker by sales, was down for most of the session after saying it had discovered a design issue in a recently released support chip for its latest processors, prompting the company to halt some shipments and warn of a revenue shortfall. But the stock closed flat at $21.46.Some of Intel’s rivals gained on the news, with Advanced Micro Devices up 4.5 per cent to $7.83."
139;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-31T18:57:04Z;Fix for Intel’s flawed chip to cost $700m;;Intel announced that a faulty chip in its new mainstream processing platform would cost it $700m to fix and would reduce revenues by $300m in the current quarter.The news is an embarrassment to the world’s biggest chipmaker by sales – it had declared its second-generation Core i3, i5 and i7 processors would be “transformational” for the personal computer.Wall Street reacted by marking down Intel shares – they were at $21.24, 1 per cent lower in midday trading in New York, while those of its rival, AMD, rose 5 per cent to $7.87.The new processor design, codenamed Sandy Bridge, which combines graphics engines with processors for the first time, was launched in consumer PCs and notebooks in January.Paul Otellini, chief executive, had told analysts that Intel’s customers were embracing the product – it was being included in more than 500 new PC models.“When you get your hands on a Sandy Bridge PC, you will realise that this is more than just a very fast microprocessor, it’s a visually stunning computing experience,” he said on an earnings call in January.But on Monday, Intel announced it had discovered a design problem with a chip that supported the processor and linked to hard disks and DVD drives, potentially impacting performance over time.Intel said it had stopped shipments of the chip, corrected the design and begun manufacturing the fixed version.“The company expects to begin delivering the updated version of the chip set to customers in late February and expects full volume recovery in April,” it said in a statement.Intel will work with PC makers over returns.It said few consumers would have been affected, with systems featuring the flawed chip only shipping since January 9 and only those with second-generation Core i5 and i7 quad-core processors hit.However, discontinuing production of the chip and beginning the manufacture of the new version was expected to reduce revenues by $300m this quarter.Intel also announced that its acquisition of Infineon Technologies’ wireless division closed on Monday. Its technology will help Intel’s push into chips for smartphones.The company said it expected its acquisition of security software company McAfee to close by the end of the quarter. The deal was cleared by the European Union last week.The combined effect of the chip set problems and the deals closing lifted Intel’s first-quarter revenue forecast to about $11.7bn, up from $11.5bn, the company said.
140;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-27T01:14:01Z;Former Galleon managers admit insider trading;;Two former Galleon Group portfolio managers pleaded guilty to trading ahead of corporate takeovers based on inside information and agreed to co-operate with the government in its case against Raj Rajaratnam.Former portfolio manager Adam Smith, 38, pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in a federal court in New York on Wednesday. Prosecutors allege his trades resulted in $1.3m in profits.Former trader Michael Cardillo also pleaded guilty to having received and traded on inside information in stocks such as JM Smucker and Procter & Gamble, federal prosecutors said.Mr Cardillo’s lawyer said her client “has taken the first step in moving on with his life”. Mr Smith’s lawyer said his client “made a mistake” and acknowledged it.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against both men.The guilty pleas increase the pressure on Mr Rajaratnam, the hedge fund billionaire, who is scheduled to go to trial on February 28.According to prosecutors, Mr Smith directly shared non-public information with Mr Rajaratnam and others at the hedge fund. If he testifies, he would be the only Galleon employee identified so far who could provide evidence against Mr Rajaratnam.Mr Rajaratnam has denied the allegations. A spokesman for Mr Rajaratnam on Wednesday declined to comment.According to prosecutors, Mr Smith was tipped by employees at technology companies Nvidia and Intersil about their quarterly earnings. He then allegedly shared that information with Mr Rajaratnam and others who profited from trading. Mr Smith also allegedly destroyed computer files and documents in October and November 2009 after Mr Rajaratnam’s arrest, court papers say.Mr Smith began his career at an investment bank and worked at Galleon from 2002 until 2009. Mr Cardillo was employed at Galleon from 2003 until late 2009.The new court documents link Mr Cardillo to another previously identified string of alleged insider traders through Craig Drimal, a trader at Incremental Capital who worked out of Galleon’s offices.Mr Drimal allegedly provided inside information about 3Com and Axcan to Mr Cardillo, who made $730,000 in illegal profits, court documents allege. Mr Drimal received information about a 3Com acquisition, from Zvi Goffer, a trader at Schottenfeld Group, say court papers. Mr Drimal and Mr Goffer have pleaded not guilty.Mr Smith of Galleon was also tipped by an unnamed investment banker about three corporate takeovers and shared the tips with Mr Rajaratnam, say court filings. Among the deals Mr Smith knew about in advance were Integrated Devices’ acquisition of Integrated Circuit in 2005, Advanced Micro Devices’ acquisition of ATI in 2006, and a potential acquisition of Vishay in 2008.Morgan Stanley advised both AMD and Integrated Devices on their transactions, according to Dealogic, a research firm.Last week, a Morgan Stanley banker was referred to in court filings as having been alleged by prosecutors to have tipped the AMD deal to an intermediary, who passed the information on to Mr Rajaratnam, according to court filings. The bank said the banker was placed on leave.A lawyer for the banker, Kamal Ahmed, said his client is co-operating with Morgan Stanley’s investigation and he expects his client will be fully exonerated.Nvidia previously surfaced in the government’s expanding insider trading probe. Prosecutors charged Winifred Jiau, who once consulted for Nvidia and was employed with research firm Primary Global, with tipping two unnamed hedge fund managers about Nvidia and Marvell Technology. She has denied wrongdoing.
141;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-22T00:31:46Z;Morgan Stanley named in Galleon case;;A Morgan Stanley banker allegedly leaked details of a takeover deal, which was ultimately passed to Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, prosecutors say.The new allegation, which was revealed in a letter sent to Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer, is the first time the government has identified Morgan Stanley in connection with the Galleon probe.Prosecutors said the banker tipped the details of Advanced Micro Devices plan to buy ATI Technologies to someone, who then shared the information with Mr Rajaratnam. The names of the banker and intermediary were redacted.“We have placed the banker on leave and are fully co-operating with the government’s investigation,” said Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley.Federal prosecutors also announced new charges against Mr Rajartnam on Friday, expanding the number of companies that he allegedly traded on based on inside information.According to the indictment, Mr Rajaratnam provided an unnamed co-conspirator with inside information about Goldman Sachs in October 2008. The previous month Warren Buffett agreed to make a $5bn investment in the bank.The superseding indictment released on Friday by the office of the US Attorney in Manhattan also named Integrated Circuit Systems, Xilinx, Vishay Intertechnology and Spansion.A spokesman for Mr Rajaratnam declined to comment on the indictment. In court papers his lawyers asked a judge to deny a separate government request to subpoena Galleon for information about other stocks.In the subpoena, prosecutors are seeking information from Galleon concerning trading in Procter & Gamble, as well as compensation information about Mr Rajaratnam and three other Galleon employeesThe new allegations come weeks before Mr Rajaratnam’s trial is scheduled to begin on February 28. They follow a guilty plea this week by Danielle Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader who prosecutors allege was a key co-conspirator in the insider trading scheme. Ms Chiesi is not co-operating with the government, her lawyer said. With Ms Chiesi’s case resolved, lawyers say it allows the government to focus squarely on Mr Rajaratnam’s trial.“The government’s view now becomes we’re going at him with all guns blazing,” said Jacob Frankel, a defence lawyer. “What started out as simply a large and significant investigation really has spawned and anyone identified as a tipper or potential tippee” could be charged, he said.It’s not clear whether Mr Rajaratnam will seek to postpone the trial date to deal with the new allegations, although lawyers say it is likely.
142;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-19T19:07:13Z;Ex-Bear trader pleads guilty in Galleon case;;A former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader pleaded guilty on Wednesday to US federal criminal charges in connection with the Galleon insider trading investigation but is not co-operating with the government, her attorney says.Danielle Chiesi, 45, a former employee of New Castle Funds, once part of Bear Stearns Asset Management, pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside information about technology companies to hedge funds and others.As part of the plea-bargain with the US government, Ms Chiesi and prosecutors agreed to a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months, which is at the judge’s discretion. Richard Holwell, a US district judge, set a sentencing date of May 13.Ms Chiesi, dressed in a black pants suit and with her platinum blonde hair swept up stylishly, entered the courtroom arm-in-arm with two of her nieces. Her mother and sister were also in court.In a statement to the judge, she said the guilty plea caused her great pain. “I am deeply ashamed,” she said.She had “ruined” a 20-year career on Wall Street that she loved. She described it as an “honourable profession”.Her lawyer Alan Kaufman said Ms Chiesi is not co-operating with prosecutors and he does not expect she will be testifying in the US government’s case against Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Mr Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing and is scheduled to go to trial on February 28.Ms Chiesi told the judge that she did not personally profit from the trades. Acknowledging that her conduct had hurt many people, including her family, she apologised to them and to the court, her voice cracking as she did so, adding that she took full responsibility for her actions.She declined to comment as she left the courtroom.Her lawyer said later in a statement that Ms Chiesi was “hopeful that by acknowledging what she did do and what she did not do, she can move on with her life and that her privacy, and her family’s privacy, will be respected.”As part of the plea-bargain the US government had agreed a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months – at the discretion of the judge.Ms Chiesi admitted to passing inside information about IBM, Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices to several people, including her boss at New Castle, Mark Kurland. Prosecutors allege New Castle made $1.7m in profits from the inside information.Prosecutors allege Ms Chiesi received non-public information from Robert Moffat, a former IBM executive with whom she had an “intimate relationship”, about IBM, AMD and Sun Microsystems. Ms Chiesi shared information with Mr Rajaratnam, prosecutors allege, who in turn gave her information about AMD and other public companies.Mr Moffat has pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in prison. Mr Kurland also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 27 months in prison.More than a dozen people have pleaded guilty to insider trading since October 2009 when the government filed its case against Ms Chiesi and Mr Rajartnam.Recorded phone conversations cited in court filings showed Ms Chiesi and Mr Rajaratnam spoke frequently.Last year, the US government won a legal victory when a judge ruled that wiretapped conversations could be used at trial. Ms Chiesi’s trial was set for this spring.According to the Department of Justice, during a recorded phone call Ms Chiesi told an unnamed co-conspirator information about AMD, and added remarks about Martha Stewart, the celebrity home stylist. “I’m dead if this leaks. I really am … and my career is over. I’ll be like Martha [expletive] Stewart.”Ms Stewart was convicted of obstructing a US government investigation into whether she traded on inside information about ImClone. She was convicted after a trial and served five months in prison.
143;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;TSMC, Nvidia face graphic novelty;;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, and Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, on Thursday announced they have together produced 1 billion GeForce graphics processors. An impressive milestone, but it comes at a time when winds of change are blowing through both the contract chipmaking and the graphics card industry.Nvidia’s partnership with TSMC was for years a perfect example of TSMC founder Morris Chang’s vision of how foundries, or contract chipmakers, could enable the rise of ‘fabless’ chipmakers – chip designers without their own production facilities – to challenge vertically integrated giants such as Intel and Samsung.As 2011 begins, however, those battle lines are no longer as clearly delineated as before, and the graphics card market is coming under threat. Intel and AMD have both unveiled new products that integrate graphics and computing processing power onto a single chip, thus reducing the need for separate, or ‘discrete’ graphics cards such as Nvidia’s Geforce. Intel last week also settled a long-running legal dispute with Nvidia and agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5bn to license its technology.A decrease in the graphics card market would be a negative for both TSMC and Nvidia, but both have responded by shifting their strategies. Nvidia’s Tegra processors now power a number of tablets, while TSMC is receiving orders to manufacture some of the new integrated processing chips from AMD.Analysts and investors also begin the year with concerns over the massive capacity expansion and capital investment planned by contract chipmakers. TSMC and its rivals Samsung, Globalfoundries and others would likely spend a combined US$60bn on capacity expansion between 2011 and 2014, according to CLSA, the equity broker.Bhavtosh Vajpayee, head of technology research at CLSA, argues however that concerns of overcapacity cutting profits and margins are not warranted, at least in the case of market leader TSMC. Overall market growth, driven by increasing outsourcing and strong demand for new products such as smartphones and tablets, means demand growth is likely to keep up with supply.Despite emerging competition from Globalfoundries and Samsung, TSMC is able to maintain its edge because its technology lead enables it to move faster than competitors. Concern should be instead be focused on smaller players who arrive later to the market for each new generation of technology. Mr Vajpayee estimates that being 5 quarters late would halve returns relative to TSMC, while being 10 quarters late would lead to negative returns.So while Thursday’s announcement may arguably have marked the high point for the iconic Geforce graphics card, TSMC and Nvidia should adapt just fine to the changing market.
144;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-11T21:51:20Z;US stocks up on strong earnings;;US equities rose for the first time in four sessions, lifted by strong corporate results as the earnings season kicked off with a forecast-beating performance from Alcoa, the world’s largest aluminium producer.Healthy figures from the housebuilding, education and retail sectors also served to lift sentiment.Alcoa, the first of the Dow components to report this year, posted its strongest quarterly results in two years. The figures showed that underlying earnings, excluding one-off items, were 21 cents per share, beating the consensus forecast of 19 cents per share.Its shares, up 25.7 per cent since the start of December, fell 1.2 per cent to $16.30 on the news, as some traders used the news to book profits.The beginning of the results season also saw Apollo Group, the US education company that owns the University of Phoenix, gain 13.5 per cent to $40.74 after also posting forecast-beating first-quarter earnings. These gains in the stock followed a sharp 5.5 per cent loss in the previous session after it reported that new student enrolment had fallen by 42.4 per cent at the University of Phoenix.“Major operational and regulatory challenges remain, but we continue to rate the stock overweight as we see the risk/reward as favourable,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note following the results.The news from Apollo, a bellwether for the education sector, helped lift related stocks. Career Education was up 7.5 per cent to $20.01 while Corinthian Colleges gained 1.5 per cent to $4.65.In the retail sector, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, jumped 6.4 per cent to $75.03 after forecasting that its fourth-quarter profit would be well ahead of analysts’ expectations.It said profit, excluding store closures, restructuring and other items, will be between $3.39 and $4.12 per share compared with the $3.05 forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The news helped Walmart rise 1 per cent to $54.29 and Costco 0.8 per cent to $71.07.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher to 1,274.48, also lifted by news that Japan had committed to buy eurozone bonds to help reduce borrowing costs for vulnerable nations. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,716.83, a three-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 to 11,671.88.The Dow was helped particularly by gains from Hewlett-Packard, up 1.3 per cent to $45.43 after UBS raised its rating on the stock.Limiting gains on the US indices were losses from technology stocks AT&T and Verizon Wireless. AT&T fell 1.5 per cent to $27.91 after rival Verizon Wireless said that it would begin selling a version of Apple’s iPhone smartphone next month.AT&T had previously been the only network in the US on which the iPhone was available. The stock had lost 6.9 per cent in the past four sessions in expectation of the news. Verizon fell after the announcement, losing 1.6 per cent to $35.36. Overall, the S&P telecommunications index was down 1.5 per cent to 126.50 – one of the few indices to lose ground.Also in the technology sector, Advanced Micro Devices, which makes microchips and microprocessors, was down 9 per cent to $8.36 after announcing late on Monday that Dirk Meyer, chief executive, had resigned. Thomas Seifert, chief financial officer, was named as interim chief executive officer.In other results news, Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilder, posted earnings of 17 cents per share compared with the 6 cents predicted by analysts polled by FactSet Research. The results sent shares in the company up 7.1 per cent to $20.24.Energy stocks rose in the session as the US Energy Information Administration forecasted that crude oil would average at $93 a barrel this year.Halliburton, the second biggest oilfield services company in the world, was up 3.2 per cent to $39.38 while the S&P energy index rose 1.6 per cent to 515.12.Most of the stocks that were embroiled in deal activity in the previous session lost ground.Shares in IGate continued to fall back after the IT outsourcer announced that it was buying India’s Patni Computer Systems. The stock fell 9.9 per cent to $15.44.This year has seen the busiest start for mergers and acquisitions activity for a decade with deals worth $34bn announced globally on Sunday and Monday and deal volumes so far in 2011 at $83bn, up from $67bn in the same period last year.

146;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-11T01:50:01Z;Day of the Long Knives at AMD and Microsoft;;When CEOs and other senior executives quit unexpectedly, the final straw that led to the move is not always visible. But Monday’s exits at Microsoft and AMD are a sign that even solid business performance is no guarantee of job security at companies whose fortunes have been tied to the PC era.AMD, which has just dispensed with the services of CEO Dirk Meyer, said it needed someone else at the helm to take advantage of an “opportunity to create increased shareholder value over time” (that sounds like a job description for all CEOs: If Mr Meyer wasn’t up to the task, one wonders what he was doing in the job in the first place.)As my colleague Chris Nuttall points out, Meyer established a fairly good record in his 30 months at the top. AMD clawed its way back to profitability under the 15-year company veteran, who had taken over as chief executive in July 2008 after Hector Ruiz left under a cloud.The company had been debt-ridden since its acquisition of Canadian graphics chip maker ATI for $5.4bn in 2006. The deal, aimed at combining graphics and general processing functions on a single chip, had a bumpy start. AMD has only just achieved its objective, around a year later than intended.Mr Meyer also oversaw the hiving-off of AMD’s manufacturing arm into a new company, Globalfoundries. All in all, a solid performance – though much of the company’s big share-price rebound of the past two years can be attributed to the economic recovery and return of financial stability, and its strategy was set under Ruiz.The pending departure of Bob Muglia, the head of Microsoft’s server and tools division (he won’t leave until the summer), also feels unexpected.Muglia’s division has progressed steadily – though a gaffe last year that antagonised developers (he suggested that Silverlight was no longer as important to Microsoft’s strategy as it had been) didn’t help his cause. That is not the sort of thing people want to hear from the person in charge of the company’s all-important developers tools business.Echoing AMD, Steve Ballmer said Microsoft simply needed someone better suited to the challenges ahead.Goldman Sachs analyst Sarah Friar summed it up this way in a report last year: “The shift to Cloud computing will mark the largest paradigm shift in IT in at least a decade, and Microsoft is positioned to emerge as a dominant player, but others are still ahead, including VMware in internal Clouds and Amazon in external Clouds.”It is still possible that something entirely different accounted for the departure of one or both of these executives, and the companies are being sparing with the truth (though in this age of full disclosure, that is less likely than it might once have been.)Based on the evidence to date, they are casualties of the mounting pressure on companies that thrived in the client-server age – and they won’t be the last.
147;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Intel to pay $1.5bn in Nvidia settlement;;Intel is close to winding up extensive legal disputes surrounding its microprocessor business following an agreement to pay rival chipmaker Nvidia $1.5bn.The deal represented an out-of-court settlement between the two Silicon Valley companies and is similar to one reached with another neighbour, AMD, in November 2009.Intel’s rivals have been named as victims of its alleged monopolistic practices in investigations by regulators in Japan, Korea, Europe and the US.Intel’s chips are in four out of every five PCs sold and its settlements with AMD and Nvidia end its rivals’ complaints that Intel has used its superiority to try to exclude them from the market.Nvidia and Intel said on Monday they had agreed to drop all outstanding legal disputes between each other.A new six-year agreement for the cross-licensing of their technologies has been signed and Intel will pay Nvidia $1.5bn in licensing fees over the next five years.Intel had also agreed a five-year cross-licensing deal with AMD and paid it $1.25bn, with AMD agreeing to drop all complaints.The world’s biggest chipmaker settled its biggest outstanding case with regulators last August, when it agreed with the US Federal Trade Commission to use an open industry standard to make it easier for other chipmakers to connect their own products to its chips.The technology has been moving faster than the legal arguments involving Intel over the past 10 years.Last week, Intel introduced new processors combining graphics and media engines with the main processor for the first time.This could reduce the need for separate graphics chips made by Nvidia.However, Nvidia’s own graphics processing units are now challenging Intel’s chips as all-purpose processors and Nvidia is moving towards greater involvement in mobile computing, with chips based on the architecture of the UK’s Arm, rather than Intel’s x86 processor designs.“This agreement signals a new era for Nvidia,” said Jen-hsun Huang, Nvidia chief executive.“Our cross licence with Intel reflects the substantial value of our visual and parallel computing technologies. It also underscores the importance of our inventions to the future of personal computing, as well as the expanding markets for mobile and cloud computing.”Nvidia shares were up 4 per cent in extended trading on the news in New York at $21.45, while Intel’s were flat at $20.69.
148;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Executives go at Microsoft and AMD;;The mounting pressure on tech companies that thrived in the PC era, caused by a new generation of mobile devices and the rise of “cloud” computing, have led to the removal of senior executives at Microsoft and AMD.Microsoft said on Monday that it would replace the head of its server software division in the latest round of a high-level executive shake-up that is likely to claim more heads.Meanwhile, AMD announced the sudden departure of its chief executive, Dirk Meyer, and said a search had begun for a replacement.While both executives had been credited by Wall Street with solid performance, the companies said they needed different leadership for the changed times.The departure of Bob Muglia, announced on Monday but not due to take effect until the summer, raises to four the number of executives who reported directly to Steve Ballmer, chief executive, and who have left since last May. The shake-up is part of a rethink of the senior management team as Microsoft it reacts to broader changes in the computing landscape, according to one person familiar with the changes.By contrast, Mr Meyer’s exit took many in the chip industry by surprise. AMD’s share price has risen 97 per cent during his tenure. He spoke about the company’s future at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week.The company said he had resigned in a mutual agreement with the board. Thomas Seifert, chief financial officer, will take over as interim chief executive.Bruce Claflin, AMD chairman, said the company needed to show significant growth, establish market leadership and generate superior financial returns. “We believe a change in leadership at this time will accelerate the company’s ability to accomplish these objectives,” he said.Mr Ballmer, meanwhile, hinted that the shift to cloud computing had prompted him to replace Mr Muglia. In an internal memo, Mr Ballmer said: “All businesses go through cycles and need new and different talent to manage through those cycles.”A low-key figure, Mr Muglia drew heavy criticism from developers in October when he suggested that Microsoft would put less emphasis on Silverlight, an important technology that it had been promoting for developing web services. Mr Muglia was later forced to retract his comments. Microsoft has yet to pick a replacement for Mr Muglia.
149;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Microsoft in Windows tablet move;;Microsoft has broken with two and a half decades of company history with plans to extend its next Windows operating system beyond the realm of traditional PC chips, repositioning itself for the upheaval in personal computing touched off by Apple’s iPad.However, the change in technology strategy, which marks a turning point in the so-called “Wintel” alliance between Microsoft and Intel that has dominated the PC era, will not bear fruit in new devices for “two to three years”, a Microsoft executive said.The world’s biggest software company announced its plans on Wednesday, on the eve of the annual International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which is set to see the unveiling of a slew of touch-screen tablet computers designed to compete with the iPad.Companies including Motorola and Toshiba showed off tablets on Wednesday that will run on a new version of Google’s Android operating system, which is also being revised to make it a stronger competitor to the software underpinning the iPad. While no launch dates or prices were given, executives indicated they planned to put the devices on sale before the end of March.Lenovo and Samsung also showed off hybrid devices with built-in keyboards that can be used either as a tablet or a laptop PC, echoing a design already launched by Dell.Despite the coming spate of rivals, most analysts predict that Apple will continue to dominate the tablet category this year.Microsoft played down the competition with Apple as it demonstrated Windows running on a new class of chips with lower power requirements, making them more suitable for portable devices.Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live division, said the new technology direction was intended eventually for a wider family of machines than tablets. The change will put Windows on chips based on a design by the UK’s Arm Holdings and made by Qualcomm, Nvidia and Texas Instruments.Microsoft presented the move as part of a broader strategy that would benefit Intel and AMD, makers of traditional PC chips.The next version of Windows will run on so-called “system on a chip” hardware – integrated pieces of silicon that combine processor, memory, graphics and other functions that previously required larger circuit boards.A version of Windows for smartphones already runs on ARM chips, but Mr Sinofsky continued to resist calls for Microsoft to use this to mount an earlier challenge to the iPad.
150;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Intel and AMD keen to prove they are still a force;;Intel and AMD, whose processors have dominated the personal computer world, have fired back at accusations that they are being undermined by the next wave of computing in tablets and smartphones.Intel vaunted the extra capabilities of notebooks and desktop computers at the launch of its next-generation processors ahead of the International Consumer Electronics Show. Separately, AMD gave a demonstration to journalists of new visual effects that could be achieved with its latest Fusion processors.Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, told reporters that the PC was capable of constantly reinventing itself and had become more innovative and affordable. The latest generation of microprocessors from Intel for desktop PCs and notebooks add graphics and media engines to the same chip for the first time. “This is not only the best product we’ve ever built but it’s also the most exciting product we’ve ever built,” he said.The launch focused on Intel’s core market, but Mr Otellini said the company would make announcements at the Mobile World Congress in Europe in February on its so far unsuccessful effort to break into the smartphone market.Analysts at Piper Jaffray downgraded Intel from “overweight” to “neutral” on Monday, stating that it was missing out on the popularity of tablets and smartphones, with versions of its Atom processors optimised for tablets probably not arriving in products until 2012.“We think the train is leaving the station in the ultramobile era, and so far Intel is not on board … Intel is less relevant,” they said.The challenge for Intel and AMD is to prove to consumers that extra features, such as being able to handle media better, make notebooks and desktops still worth having, ahead of tablets and smartphones powerful enough to play high-definition video. Intel demonstrated a screen with 70 home movie clips playing at once to help find favourite moments.“We think the notebook is still an important form factor … there’s still the need for computational capability above and beyond the tablet,” Dirk Meyer, AMD chief executive, told reporters at a CES briefing.
151;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2011-01-04T22:01:54Z;Legal expenses refused in trading probe;;Some technology and hedge fund executives caught in the US investigation into alleged insider trading on Wall Street are having trouble hiring lawyers because their employers are refusing to pay their legal fees, attorneys say.Among the technology companies that have refused to advance legal fees to employees charged criminally are Flextronics, Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.Several hedge funds have also refused to advance attorneys’ fees to employees, say defence lawyers, who, as a result, have turned away prospective clients.Federal prosecutors are investigating money managers’ use of expert network firms as part of an insider trading investigation. Expert network firms match hedge funds with industry experts, such as doctors or technology company executives.Companies typically pay the legal bills of employees accused of misconduct while performing their corporate duties. Insider trading cases are different, lawyers say, because the companies are the victims of the alleged fraud.Brad Bailey, a lawyer representing a former Taiwan Semiconductor employee charged this month in the insider trading investigation, said: “Most companies have an out-clause where they void indemnification” once someone is charged criminally.Hedge fund policies are less uniform. Some funds will only advance legal fees for senior managers, lawyers say, while others agree to cover legal expenses.Marvin Pickholz, a defence lawyer, said some employers may be withholding legal fees to show the government they are co-operating. He suggested that this could put pressure on executives to seek quick settlements with the authorities rather than bear the costs of long legal battles.“If you don’t advance the fees, the person out of desperation will take a civil injunction or [an industry] bar,” he said.Defending a multiyear investigation can run into millions of dollars. Sun-Times Media, the former Hollinger International, cited more than $117m in legal fees to defend Conrad Black and other former Hollinger directors as one reason it filed for bankruptcy.For some individuals charged in the insider trading probe, legal fees will almost certainly surpass any money they made from their alleged bad conduct. In the insider trading case, one consultant was allegedly paid $22,000 for tips while another allegedly made $200,000.
152;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Battery life is over 10 hours with the machine using one of AMD’s new Fusion chips combining general and graphics processing and running cool with HP’s CoolSense technology.The dm1 is available on January 9 in the US at prices starting from $450.Coming later at prices to be determined are new versions of the HP Envy 17 notebooks, launched last May, which also feature the CoolSense Technology and are updated with the next- generation processors from Intel and AMD being introduced this week.
154;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-12-29T20:26:24Z;US consultant charged with insider trading;;Federal prosecutors charged a California consultant at an “expert network” firm with allegedly passing inside information about two technology groups to hedge fund traders.Prosecutors allege that Winifred Jiau of Fremont, California, provided non-public information about Marvell Technology Group and Nvidia ahead of earnings announcements to hedge funds in exchange for $200,000 in fees she was paid by an expert network firm.The charges are the latest by the US attorney’s office in Manhattan in an expanding insider trading investigation of public companies’ employees passing information to hedge funds through expert network companies that connect them.According to court papers, Ms Jiau’s tips about Marvell’s financial results for the quarter ending in May 2008 were used by two unnamed hedge fund traders to make more than $820,000 in profits.Ms Jiau relayed information to the hedge fund traders from sources within Marvell, the complaint says.The government’s case was aided by a research analyst at a New York hedge fund who is co-operating with the investigation as well as digitally recorded phone conversations the principal trader at the same hedge fund had with Ms Jiau.The recordings were turned over to the authorities when they executed a search warrant last month.In another call, Ms Jiau gave the two traders Nvidia’s revenue number for the second quarter of 2008 and said the company would announce a stock buy-back on August 15, the complaint says. Ms Jiau said her contact was a “sales guy”.Four days later, Nvidia announced earnings that matched the revenue number Ms Jiau allegedly provided, as well as a $1bn increase to its stock repurchase programme.A spokesman for Nvidia said Ms Jiau was a contractor for the firm and left a year ago.Marvell did not respond to a request for a comment.
155;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;US charges five as part of trading probe;;The US investigation into alleged insider trading on Wall Street gathered pace with the announcement of criminal charges against an “expert-network” employee and four company insiders accused of tipping off hedge funds.Information provided to investors included details from a subcontractor about Apple’s iPad before it was launched and revenue figures for Advanced Micro Devices before they were released, according to court papers filed on Thursday.The charges were announced by Preet Bharara, US attorney in Manhattan, who suggested more arrests were coming. “Over the next many months and beyond,” he said, his office would “root out corporate corruption and insider trading”.The FBI arrested four people on Thursday, including an employee of Primary Global Research, which links industry experts with investors, and current or former employees of AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor and Flextronics International who served as Primary Global consultants. The companies involved are not alleged to have done anything wrong and either said they were co-operating or they could not be reached for comment.Prosecutors revealed that a fifth person, Daniel Devore, a former global supply manager for Dell, pleaded guilty last week to fraud and conspiracy charges for providing inside information to Primary Global’s clients. Mr Devore, who is co-operating with prosecutors, received $145,750 for consulting services. Mr Devore’s lawyer declined to comment. Lawyers for the other people charged could not be reached for comment or declined to comment.Mr Devore said in court, according to a transcript, that he provided non-public information to clients of two other expert-network firms, Guidepoint Global and Vista Research, which was acquired by Guidepoint last year. Neither firm has been accused of wrongdoing. A Guidepoint spokesman could not be reached for comment.No investors were charged in the probe on Thursday.The case was bolstered by an unnamed securities analyst who is co-operating with the government and Richard CB Lee, a hedge fund manager who has pleaded guilty to providing inside information in the case against Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, according to the criminal complaint.Mr Rajaratnam, who is due to go on trial in February, has denied wrongdoing.Prosecutors on Thursday announced conspiracy and wire fraud charges against James Fleishman, an executive at Primary Global. Primary Global said Mr Fleishman has been employed since 2006 and had been placed on leave. Mr Fleishman could not be reached for comment.Mr Fleishman is the second person who worked at Primary Global to be charged. Last month, prosecutors announced fraud charges against Don Ching Trang Chu, a former employee, for allegedly providing inside information to firm clients. Prosecutors alleged Mr Chu passed inside information to Mr Lee.Primary Global, based in Mountain View, California, says on its website it has consultants “focusing on semiconductors, data centres, software, telecommunications or internet.”Mark Anthony Longoria, an AMD supply chain manager, was also arrested by the FBI on conspiracy and fraud charges for allegedly telling a co-operating witness about AMD revenue information, product sales figures and gross-margin information. He received $200,000, according to court documents.“It appears that AMD is the victim of an insider trading scheme,” the company said. “AMD has been cooperating with the US attorney’s office and will continue to do so. AMD has a clear and comprehensive policy regarding insider trading and a worldwide insider trading training program. AMD additionally has policies regarding work by its employees outside of AMD including consulting arrangements such as the so-called expert networks that appear to be at the heart of the government’s insider trading investigations.”Also arrested was Walter Shimoon, who was the senior director of business development at Flextronics, which supplied electronic components for Apple’s iPhone and iPod devices. Prosecutors allege Mr Shimoon provided confidential sales forecast information and new product features about Apple’s iPhone and iPad. He worked with Primary Global from 2007 until November 2010 and was paid $22,000. Mr Shimoon could not be reached for comment.The FBI arrested Manosha Karunatilaka, an account manager at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co who worked with Primary Global from 2007 until June 2010, for allegedly providing product sales and shipping information. A spokeswoman for the company said Mr Karunatilaka had his contract terminated Thursday and that the firm has cooperated with the investigation.
156;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-10-21T15:21:25Z;Semiconductor makers;Capital spending is the crack cocaine of the chipmaking industry;Capital spending is the crack cocaine of the chipmaking industry. Every so often a post-binge moment of clarity occurs as the manufacturers look around and realise profits have disappeared. But it is a struggle to stay clean – as cash rolls in, dreams of an extra foundry, or of the fun to be had with new lithography equipment, nag away. Relapses are inevitable, which is why the sector has tended to operate on a rough two-year cycle of boom and bust. At the right time it can be highly rewarding to be a pusher of plant and equipment.Those dealers, the equipment makers, only trade at around 10 times prospective earnings, which is low by historical standards. The concern is that their chipmaking customers may soon return to rehab. Yet while weaker than expected growth for PC sales have prompted worries that capex may be flat or down next year, there are reasons to expect order growth into 2011.For one, increased competition for outsourced chip production may force incumbents such as Taiwan’s TSMC and UMC to respond. America’s Globalfoundries – the former manufacturing arm of AMD – is on a major expansion drive since entering the market last year, with a new foundry planned as part of Abu Dhabi’s continued diversification away from oil. And Korea’s Samsung, busy making chips for Apple’s iPad, is adding to the pressure.Meanwhile, rapid sales growth for smartphones and tablets entails big demand for solid-state flash memory. Goldman Sachs estimates that just to meet the needs of these devices will require spending $13bn on manufacturing capacity by 2012, implying a more than doubling of “Nand”-related capex next year. And even abstemious Intel may have to increase capex more than expected as it makes a challenging technology transition. Plenty of time for a few more hits.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

Meanwhile, chipmakers were boosted after AMD narrowed its losses in the third-quarter.Dutch chip-manufacturing equipment maker ASML Holding rose 1.6 per cent to €23.37, its highest point for two months, while German chipmaker Infineon rose to a six-month high up 3.4 per cent to €5.63. Paris-listed STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest semiconductor company, rose 0.5 per cent to €5.65.The European market was briefly boosted at lunchtime when Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke indicated that a further round of quantitative easing was likely, but these gains quickly fell away. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,085.59, a weekly gain of 1.3 per cent.In Paris, shares in Carrefour fell 4.1 per cent to €38.51 after Europe’s biggest retailer trimmed its 2010 profit forecast. Unexpected costs from its Brazilian business from unsold stock offset a stronger than expected rise in third-quarter sales.“[Carrefour’s] Q3 trading update – with little improvement in France and concerning developments in Brazil – should serve as something of a ‘reality check’ on the current challenging state of the business,” said an analyst note from Execution Noble.The retail sector was slightly down across the region on Friday, despite better-than-expected US retail figures, with Ahold, the Dutch supermarket operator, off 0.7 per cent to €9.59 and Delhaize, the Belgian food retailer, falling 1.2 per cent to €49.44.The week began with a round of upgrades for the region’s carmakers, giving them a momentum that was maintained throughout the week. In France, Peugeot soared 10.3 per cent on the week to €27.88 while Renault was up 1.5 per cent to €39.23.The sector shrugged off poor September sales figures announced by the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association on Friday. Frankfurt-listed Volkswagen rose 3.3 per cent over the week to €92.20 while Daimler, the world’s largest truckmaker, rose 5 per cent to €47.73.The Xetra Dax finished the week at a two-year high up 3.2 per cent to 6,492.30 while the CAC 40 gained 1.7 per cent to 3,827.37.Oilfield services stocks were given a lift on Wednesday after the ban on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was lifted four weeks earlier than expected.Zurich-listed Transocean, the offshore drilling contractor which operated the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, rose 6.1 per cent in the week to SFr64.40.
158;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-10-14T17:57:13Z;Rivals yet to scratch surface of Apple’s lead;;Apple’s quarterly results on Monday are expected to confirm 2010 as the year of the iPad but the tablet category to which the gadget belongs is in its infancy.A swathe of companies are approaching tablets as either large-format smartphones or keyboard-less notebooks but none has so far mounted a serious challenge to the iPad.Therefore, in spite of the hooplah that greeted the creation of an entirely new computing sector at the iPad’s launch, the success and size of this category is far from being determined.Apple could sell about 15m units this year of a product it unveiled in January and only introduced in April, according to analyst estimates. By comparison, the iPhone sold less than 6m units in its first full year.The iPad’s only significant challenger in 2010 looks like being the Samsung Galaxy Tab, a seven-inch tablet that will go on sale in November.Hewlett-Packard, the leading PC maker, has postponed a planned tablet launch till next year and Research in Motion will not introduce its recently unveiled seven-inch tablet, the BlackBerry PlayBook, until the first quarter of 2011.On Tuesday, ZTE, the fast-growing Chinese telecom equipment maker, became the latest IT company to join the bandwagon. The ZTE Light, which runs on Android and has a seven-inch screen, is expected to go on sale before the end of the year.Doug Reid at Stifel Nikolaus, the investment bank, expects the iPad to have an 82 per cent market share of the 19.2m tablets he forecasts will ship this year.Mr Reid said its dominance would be due to the end of shipment delays, a “window of de-facto market exclusivity” and the likelihood that rivals will try unsuccessfully to integrate their hardware with operating systems such as Android that are unproven relative to Apple’s iOS.Apple is also likely to upgrade the iPad in January: a seven-inch alternative to its 9.7-inch screen is rumoured, while front and back cameras for video conferencing is expected.As well as being a hit with consumers, the iPad is being rapidly adopted in the corporate world.Good Technology, which makes consumer-oriented devices secure on corporate networks, says the iPad entered its top five of devices activated on such networks in its first two months.Apple’s rivals, while eager to enter the segment, are hoping that tablets will not cannibalise sales of netbooks and notebook PCs– expected to be about 40m units and 170m units respectively in 2010.That may already be happening, without consumers actually buying tablets. The latest data from Gartner, the research firm, suggest that netbook sales are flagging. It said consumers were holding off purchases and adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to the forthcoming tablets.Warren East, chief executive of Arm, whose chip designs are the blueprint for the iPad’s processor, said recently the next five years might see the end of the PC and “a new era of computing based on smartphones and tablets”.Intel, AMD and Microsoft, who have more of their business tied up in the PC, have maintained tablets will help grow the overall PC market into a bigger pie, while analysts say a mixture of both cannibalisation and the addition of new sales is most likely.Christian Heidarson, principal analyst at Gartner, says direct competition from tablets will likely only shrink the PC market by 8 per cent this year. “But from 2013 onwards, the impact will be significantly more pronounced …we will see tablets with the same capabilities as netbooks retailing for $300 instead of $600,” he says.Arthur Hsieh, analyst at UBS, said the netbook was originally aimed at people who wanted a second computer, or those who would not buy a full-featured notebook and that “the tablet pretty much fulfils both these functions”.What most analysts agree on, however, is that Apple will maintain a significant lead against competitors for at least the next year due to their struggles with different operating systems.Tablets using Android, originally designed to power smartphones, do not easily display content at a high resolution without extra customisation. While Samsung has worked out a compromise on its seven-inch Galaxy tablet, LG this month shelved its plans until a more tablet-friendly version of Android is released next year.Meanwhile, analysts say that problems persist with Windows 7, which they say remains difficult to use without a mouse and a keyboard. This has led to a number of prospective tablet makers, such as Lenovo, preferring to wait for Android rather than launch a Windows-based tablet.Gartner’s Mr Heidarson says PC and smartphone makers are likely to find more success in making seven-inch tablets rather than trying to compete directly with Apple’s 9.7-inch iPad.Mobile operators are much more likely to want to subsidise a seven-inch tablet such as the Galaxy Tab than a bigger model that users may not always carry around with them.
159;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-10-14T17:13:13Z;Intel ready to close the gap on rivals;;Intel issued a clear warning this week that it intends to be a leading player in tablets, a category where its microprocessors have so far failed to figure.The world’s biggest chipmaker has so far been happy to defend its dominant position in netbooks with its Atom processor, while biding time for the tablet market to mature.But weakness in netbooks in the third quarter and fears that sales could be cannibalised by tablets has brought Paul Otellini, chief executive, off the fence.In pointed remarks during Tuesday’s analyst conference call covering Intel’s quarterly earnings, Mr Otellini said he wanted to respond to “the big question on everybody’s minds” of how Intel would respond to its lack of a presence in tablets. He congratulated Apple on inventing the category and predicted tablets would expand the computer market just as netbooks had done.This fitted with his forecasts earlier this year that tablets would be “additive” rather than taking away from other PC sales, but this time he went on to admit that tablets could impact some PC sales.“At the margin, they probably will. Consumers will have a limited amount of discretionary income and some will choose to purchase a tablet instead of upgrading an existing PC or purchasing a netbook in any given period,” he said.But in the long run, tablets would help grow the overall PC market, he insisted. “At Intel, we are going to utilise all of the assets that are at our disposal to win this segment,” he said, adding that Intel was working with partners on tablets running Windows, Android and its own MeeGo operating system.However, Intel is unlikely to dominate in tablets in the same way it has taken over the netbook category.AMD, its closest rival, is launching its Ontario platform, a low-power chip competitor to Atom, next year. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia also competes here with its Tegra processor.Both could win customers manufacturing 10-inch tablets, which could run Windows and serve as netbook replacements. Tablets, with screens of about seven inches, are seen more as enlarged smartphones. Makers may favour Arm-based chips from established smartphone suppliers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments.This category of chipmakers are moving into e-readers and tablets after the failure of the smartbook category, which attempted to combine a netbook’s features with the long battery life, connectivity and always-on state of a smartphone.

Economists had forecast an increase of 1 per cent for the leading indicator of manufacturing activity. Including transportation, orders fell 1.3 per cent as Boeing saw civilian aircraft orders decline sharply.“It’s the realisation that the double dip is receding in probability and I would say the durable goods data today is in some sense the frosting on the cake,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist with Principal Global Investors. Mr Baur said it was natural to see a weakening in economic growth after a sharp rise.“Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard was bare so manufacturers had to ramp up production very fast from a low level just to put stuff on the shelves. Then this began to decelerate and that’s where everyone starts to worry.”All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose – nine rising more than 1 per cent and six more than 2 per cent.Industrials led the risers, up 2.8 per cent, on hopes for a speedier economic recovery. Caterpillargained 4.6 per cent to $79.73 and Cummins added 2.9 per cent to $90.86.Housebuilders, which were yo-yoing all week in response to mixed data on the housing market, soared 3.1 per cent after new-home sales remained steady, at a low 288,000, in August. The financials sector, which has suffered after some analysts lowered their projections for quarterly bank profits, advanced 2.8 per cent, wiping out the week’s losses.Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $25.15, Goldman Sachs rose 1.6 per cent to $147.28 and Citigroup jumped 2.7 per cent to $3.90.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index added 2.6 per cent, lifted by news from Nike. The world’s largest manufacturer of athletics shoes beat expectations with its first-quarter profit and offered a positive outlook. Earnings per share were $1.14 compared with predictions of $1 per share after strong demand in China and the US.Sales soared 8 per cent and future orders jumped
13 per cent. Shares in Nike added 2.5 per cent to reach an all-time high of $79.57.But also in athletic apparel, retailer Finish Linefell 9.2 per cent to $14.25 after it missed estimates because it failed to restock popular items quickly enough.The technology sector, which has been the biggest riser so far in September, up 12.6 per cent, advanced 2 per cent. Amazon hit an all-time high, rising 5.2 per cent to $160.73.Chipmakers were in focus after Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, said the software maker might buy a chip manufacturer.Oracle fell 0.6 per cent to $26.96 but US-listed shares of ARM Holdings, which designs chips that power iPhones, surged 7.6 per cent to $19.79 on speculation that it could be a target.Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker, rose 6.9 per cent to $6.84 in spite of saying third-quarter sales would be weaker than predicted because of lower demand for notebook computers in Europe and North America.Rival Intel, which reduced its forecast at the end of August, gained
2.3 per cent to $19.42.Gold companies, which have risen this week with the price of gold, continued to climb, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2.8 per cent to $86.61."
161;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-09-23T22:52:31Z;AMD warns as Android tablets loom;;"AMD has followed Intel in warning that revenues suffered in the third quarter due to slackening consumer demand.The news on Thursday reinforced the view that PC makers and their microprocessor partners have suffered a tough “back to school” season. With tablets, eReaders and smartphones exciting the consumer imagination more than laptops, it could be an equally tough holiday season ahead.AMD said sales for its quarter ending September 25 should be down 1 to 4 per cent on its June quarter “due to weaker than expected demand, particularly in the consumer notebook market in Western Europe and North America.”Intel gave a similar warning four weeks ago, predicting sales could be down by 5 per cent “affected by weaker than expected demand for consumer PCs in mature markets”.Neither Intel nor AMD are likely to generate much more interest in the fourth quarter in the Windows-based PCs they support. The big launches of laptops and PCs featuring their new chips are not due until the New Year, although advance chip sales to ramp those launches should help them in the final quarter.The poor state of Western economies and the lack of consumer confidence seem to be the major factors.
But the impact of Apple’s iPad and the forthcoming introduction of a number of rivals should not be ignored.Best Buy told the FT last week it had no hard numbers, but it seemed “there was some replacement of netbooks by iPads going on”.Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, has said he sees tablets as “additive” to the market, rather than cannibalising netbook and laptop sales. The company has been focused on netbooks, but it unveiled a Dell tablet running Windows at its developer forum this month and Mr Otellini said it was working with Microsoft on tablets for the enterprise.That won’t help third or fourth quarter numbers. Tablets appearing this autumn will overwhelmingly feature Google’s Android operating system and Arm-based microprocessors rather than the x86 ones of Intel and AMD.Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray analyst, issued a report on Thursday – “iPad is the Mac of the Masses” – raising his forecasts for sales of the iPad (featuring Apple’s own A4 Arm-based processor) in 2011 from 14.5m to 21m – almost double the 10.7m expected to be sold this year.Mr Munster sees Android providing the main challenge and first competition to the iPad, with eight to 10 competitors in the market by year’s end.“Long term we expect tablets to account for 17 per cent of the PC/Netbook market by 2012 (66m tablets out of 380m PCs/Netbooks),” he writes.Intel’s Atom and AMD’s Ontario processors should secure a piece of that new market by then, but it looks as though Arm-based processors will start out with the lion’s share."
162;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-09-14T04:25:34Z;Intel’s Sandy Bridgehead in graphics world;;Intel introduced “Sandy Bridge” on Monday as a chip that would revolutionise the PC, with analysts agreeing it was part of a graphics trend that could reshape the industry.Sandy Bridge will compete with rival products from AMD and Nvidia, with chipmakers focusing on consumer interest in watching and processing high-definition video as the best use case for the extra capability they are adding to processors.Sandy Bridge represents the latest annual refresh of Intel’s microprocessors on it’s so-called “tick-tock” timeline.The “tick” year is when Intel shrinks the size of the circuitry on chips as it did with “Westmere” chips this year, narrowing it to 32 billionths of a metre. The “tock” year is when the chips are redesigned and Sandy Bridge marks a major overhaul of the Intel architecture.The Silicon Valley company has long been a leader in selling integrated graphics chips embedded in PC motherboards as a cheap if less powerful option than competing “discrete” graphics cards that take up their own upright slot in the PC – AMD’s ATI division and Nvidia dominate this category.With Sandy Bridge, Intel has been able to put its graphics processor on the same chip die as the central processing unit (CPU) microprocessor for the first time. This means they can share resources, such as memory on the chip, making computers more energy efficient.“Sandy Bridge will revolutionise PCs again,” Paul Otellini, chief executive, told the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco.“This chip has unprecedented feature integration for us: on one single chip, we’ve put in place all the critical capabilities for computing.”AMD acquired ATI in 2006 to achieve its ambitious vision of “Fusion” computing, where the CPU is merged with the GPU (graphics processing unit) on a single chip. It has suffered delays, but its “Zacate”, “Ontario” and “Llano” “accelerated processing units” are finally due in the first half of next year.“The GPU on Sandy Bridge is still their little integrated graphics processor put on the die,” said John Taylor, AMD spokesman.“It’s a much smaller fraction of the overall die area than what we’re doing with Fusion, where we’re delivering a true discrete-level GPU, true parallel-compute engine, in addition to the multi-core x86 microprocessor.”Dual-core Zacate and Ontario should appear in products early in the New Year around the same time as Sandy Bridge, Zacate drawing 18 watts will challenge it in laptops and all-in-one PCs, while Ontario at 9 watts is a netbook processor rival. The more powerful Llano has been delayed and should appear in products by mid-2011, says AMD, in both dual-core and quad-core configurations.Nvidia has specialised in GPUs and discrete cards, but has been challenging Intel in devices such as netbooks with its Tegra microprocessor in recent months.In a response to the unveiling of Sandy Bridge, it said: “Intel’s been proclaiming the death of discrete graphics for years, but real GPUs just keep getting more important. Today’s visual computing applications – like photo and video editing, playing games, and browsing the web – use a GPU for the best experience.”We are likely to get the first sight of desktop PCs and laptops running Sandy Bridge chips, probably labelled as second-generation Core i3/i5/i7 processors, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.Intel showed a laptop prototype running Sandy Bridge and displaying the same graphics capabilities as a laptop with a discrete card.Nvidia said consumers didn’t need to wait for Sandy Bridge: “There are excellent Nvidia GPUs today at every price point that run rings around Sandy Bridge. Of course, our GPU performance will increase again next year to maintain our advantage.”A study released today (above) by Jon Peddie Research says an inflection point is occurring with the combination of CPU and GPU on the same chip that will make traditional integrated graphics processors extinct by 2015. Discrete graphics cards will also decline to 10 per cent market share by then, from 30 per cent today, it suggests.“[These combination chips] will truly revolutionise the PC and associated industries,” the study predicts.“The amount of computation capability available in the size, weight, power consumption of systems equipped with [these chips], and for the price they will be offered, will upset the market dynamics like never before, and maybe not since the introduction of the PC.”
163;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-09-13T21:55:59Z;Ex-IBM executive jailed in Galleon case;;"A former senior executive at IBM was sentenced to six months in prison after pleading guilty to charges arising from the Galleon hedge fund insider trading probe.Robert Moffat, 54, a former senior vice-president of IBM, admitted in March that he provided insider information to Danielle Chiesi, then a consultant at New Castle Partners, an equity hedge fund unit of Bear Stearns Asset Management.Mr Moffat gave Ms Chiesi, with whom he was having an affair, tips relating to IBM, Lenovo and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to court documents.The sentencing on Monday is the latest development in what US prosecutors term the largest hedge fund insider trading case in history.Mr Moffat is one of 12 people to plead guilty in the case, in which a total of 21 people have been charged.Ms Chiesi and Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, are due to stand trial next year on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud in relation to what prosecutors allege was a multimillion dollar insider trading ring involving some of America’s best-known companies. Both have denied wrongdoing.Mr Moffat’s lawyers had sought probation, stressing their client did not trade on the inside information or make any money from it.Mr Moffat, whose career of more than three decades at IBM ended with his arrest last autumn, told the court he had “made terrible mistakes in judgment that will haunt me for the rest of my life.”The information passed on by Mr Moffat between August and October 2008 included the earnings data on Lenovo, which he learnt of as a non-voting member of its board, as well as disappointing sales at IBM and plans by AMD to sell its manufacturing operations, according to prosecutors.In imposing the sentence on Monday Deborah Batts, the US federal court judge, said that “white collar crime is just as destructive to the social fabric as drugs and violence”.In addition to Mr Moffat’s six-month prison sentence, the judge also imposed a $50,000 fine and a two-year term of supervised release.Preet Bharara, the Manhattan US attorney, said the prison sentence sent a signal to
white-collar workers of how seriously the courts treated such offences."
164;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-09-12T09:01:15Z;SWFs eye domestic advantages;;Sovereign wealth funds are exploiting their overseas investments to contribute to economic development back home.“In conversation with several Middle East SWFs, they see themselves almost as sovereign development funds,” said Nuno Fernandes, professor of finance at Swiss business school IMD.This may take the form of inviting investee companies to market their products in the home market, influencing decisions about where to site offshored production facilities, building joint ventures with the companies in the home market, or acquiring intellectual capital to develop a new domestic industry.Mubadala, one of several funds in Abu Dhabi, parlayed an initial 8.1 per cent holding in American computer chip maker AMD into a 20 per cent stake and a spin-off of its manufacturing operations in a joint venture with the Advanced Technology Investment Company of Abu Dhabi (ATIC), generating a substantial return for itself.In its annual report, Mubadala congratulated itself on the outcome: “As well as having a solid commercial return, the AMD partnership also demonstrates Mubadala’s mandate of delivering social value to Abu Dhabi.”Also in Abu Dhabi, the International Petroleum Investment Company bought 70 per cent of MAN Ferrostaal, to give the emirate access to the company’s expertise in petrochemicals, solar power and project construction and management, according to a report from the Monitor Group and Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei*.This kind of strategic investment has been happening outside the Middle East too. The China Investment Corporation, for example, has been actively seeking to invest in resource companies such as Indonesia’s biggest coal company, Bumi.“From an international perspective, SWFs help stabilise global financial markets and from a domestic point of view co-ordinate macroeconomic policy,” according to the Monitor/FEEM report. “The latter probably remains the dominant driver of their own choices.”Once feared as the bogeymen of international investment, then loved as the white knights who, it was hoped, would bail out western financial institutions during the financial crisis, SWFs have developed the new function partly in response to criticism at home after losing money during the crisis. Their approach, however, is shaped by experience of political hostility in target nations.SWFs have in general avoided getting formally involved in corporate governance, but this does not mean they are passive investors. “If you look at the external metrics of engagement, such as board positions, it’s true they’re under-represented,” said Prof Fernandes, “but there are many pieces of evidence that they are engaged in more backdoor activity.”These activities are less likely to attract unfavourable political comment in the target country, while benefiting the economic development of the home nation, he added.The need to support the domestic economy has become a significant policy driver for SWFs, according to the Monitor/FEEM report.“As their domestic markets were hit by the effects of the global recession, SWFs inevitably became more active at home in providing financial support – patriotism proved far more important than presence in foreign markets,” said Vanessa Rossi of Chatham House in an article for the Monitor/FEEM report.*Back on Course: Sovereign Wealth Fund Activity in 2009
165;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-09-10T04:07:25Z;Arm’s Eagle chip has soaring performance;;Arm’s unveiling of the capabilities its Cortex-A15 processor design, previously codenamed Eagle, expands the possibilities for Arm-based chips well beyond the mobile phone industry they dominate.The launch in San Francisco on Wednesday night also expanded Arm’s share price in London on Thursday as it rose 4 per cent to a new 52-week peak of 403p – 200 per cent higher than a year ago.The market’s reaction seems a fair reflection of the significance of the launch to Arm. Rivals Intel and AMD ought to be concerned.The chipmakers have been emphasising the quick return on investment that can be achieved from their latest energy-saving server chips, but Arm trumps both with the smaller power demands of its chips and the A15 has the muscle to take them on in the data centre.With HP and Dell present to provide testimonials, Mike Inglis, head of Arm’s processor division, described how the A15 would give five times the performance of Arm’s most powerful mainstream processor design today – the A8, which is found in many high-end smartphones.The A15 is scalable from smartphones to high-end servers. Mr Inglis described dual-core, quad-core and octo-core configurations and processor speeds of 2.5Ghz in a small power envelope. There is support for virtualisation, memory support up to 1 terabyte and advanced error correction for data integrity.Texas Instruments, the first licensee of the design, showed a roadmap of products for the A15 combined with its OMAP platform that led from smartphones to eReaders, smart TVs and home automation. It cited savings of 15 per cent in power and double the performance of the A9 – the Arm design expected to first feature in products this Christmas.It is likely to take two years for the A15 design to work its way through to products on the market, Warren East, Arm chief executive (pictured), cautioned.He told me software and systems would have to be adapted for Arm-based servers as well, although the company’s own website has been powered by Arm server chips for the past year.Intel may have to defend its PC territory from Arm, but, with its Atom chip, it is also attempting to invade the smartphone, smart TV and embedded chip markets where Arm has a strong presence.Mr East said Intel could not match Arm at the other end of the scale where its Cortex-M0 is the company’s smallest, lowest power and most energy efficient processor.“Intel talks about embedded, but they’re talking about something that has three times the number of transistors of the Cortex-A9,” he said.The far smaller M0 design is ideal for simple sensor devices using chips costing $1 or less, but Mr East said the volumes sold of such chips would be “immense”.This explained in part his comments earlier in the evening, when he announced Arm would celebrate its 20th birthday in two months’ time and 20bn Arm-based processors had shipped in that time.“But we’ve barely scratched the surface, we’re really only just getting started,” he said, predicting Arm microprocessors would hit the 100bn mark in the next decade.
166;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:00:02+0000;My Portfolio: America the not-so-beautiful;;"While I have been more than happy with the performance and stability of my UK shares, the laggards this year have been my US-listed holdings, just five of them, which account for about 10 per cent of my portfolio.I am clearly missing something. In 2009, my UK shares produced a total return of 50.3 per cent, double the FTSE 100’s 25 per cent. Yet the US portfolio, which held similar shares, managed only 14.5 per cent, not much more than half its benchmark, the S&P 500. This year too, my American shares have continued to disappoint. Returns to date are a negative 12 per cent compared with only minus two per cent on the benchmarks. My UK shares are up one per cent in 2010, reflecting the defensive and high income holdings I have gradually been switching into since last September.The reasons for the US underperformance are varied. Some stocks I hold have a very high beta. Advanced Micro Devices, which I bought exactly a year ago as a geared recovery play on news of its $1bn settlement win against Intel, catapulted from $4.40 per share to $10, but has now sagged to just over $6.50. That’s one of the better stories. So too is the value raid on BP ADRs (American depositary receipts). They were $31 in June and I took profits at $39.75 for half the holding earlier this month. I’ve been a little unlucky with Anardarko, the oil company partner of Tullow Oil. The stock has recovered to as high as $55 but is still well below the acquisition price of $65
last September. Apache, another oil explorer, continues to languish well below my most recent acquisition price too.I have also been disappointed in my biggest US holding, General Electric, which I regard as an exchange traded fund (ETF) for the US economy. I piled into the shares in March 2009, pretty much at the stock market low, at prices varying from $4.99 to $6.91. At first, GE went great guns, getting up to $16 last September. But it hasn’t moved any higher, though I remain convinced that it will improve.However, the real damage was caused by the shorter-term activity in the account, and much of this comes down to trying to be too clever. That includes trying to hedge using an inverse SPDR ETF. Somehow I managed to lose heavily on this. Forays into technology stocks such as EMC didn’t do well in 2009, and overall there was just far too much trading. This year, however, I haven’t traded very much at all but there is still this nagging underperformance. Quite how to resolve this isn’t clear. Trying to replicate my UK strategy by going in search of yield would be fine if it were not for US withholding taxes, which crimp the income by 15 per cent (or 30 per cent if you don’t lodge the “tax alien” paperwork with your US broker). These payments can be offset against UK taxes, but the paperwork is time-consuming. I’d really prefer to retain growth stocks, since that is what the US excels in, yet the growth stocks I have chosen just don’t seem to be performing. Certainly
I think that I will have to sell down my holding in Anardarko, and possibly Apache too. While the US shares are dragging the entire portfolio’s performance down by only one point, it is the niggling investment mistakes I must be making, rather than their size, that worry me. If I don’t fix them, they could be replicated elsewhere on a larger scale.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments. He may have a financial interest in any of companies, securities and trading strategies mentioned."

Materials were flat but industrials fell 0.3 per cent.The number of initial jobless claims fell for the first time in a month and the fall was sharper than economists had forecast, with the number of people starting to claim unemployment benefit last week dropping by 31,000 to 473,000.“It’s hard to be excited by 473,000 new claims for unemployment benefit but obviously its better than 500,000,” said Doug Cliggott, US equity strategist at Credit Suisse.“If we keep getting initial jobless claims in the 450,000 to 500,000 range, that probably means a higher unemployment rate which in turn would likely trigger a greater effort on the part of the Fed to ease monetary policy further.”A manufacturing report from the Chicago Federal Reserve showed industrial activity in the region rose in July, driven by gains in the car, steel and machinery sectors. The index was up 2.2 per cent after falling 0.2 per cent in June.But the Kansas City Fed said manufacturing slowed in August.Regional indicators are being examined more closely than usual after a dip in industrial production in Philadelphia sparked a multi-day sell-off last week.Investors were cautious ahead of the release of the revised US second quarter GDP figure, expected to be revised down, and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s speech in front of the world’s central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.The information technology sector led the fallers, down 1.1 per cent, with IBMdropping 2 per cent to $122.78, SanDisk sliding 5.2 per cent to $35.78 and Advanced Micro Devices losing 4.2 per cent to $5.87.Financials also suffered, falling 0.9 per cent with Morgan Stanley down 1.9 per cent to $24.63 and JPMorgan Chase lower by 1.5 per cent to $35.70.In deal news, the bidding war between computer makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard for 3Par, a data storage company which would extend their ability to offer “cloud computing”, ended before the bell
yesterday.3Par approved a deal with Dell at a marginally higher price to that offered by Hewlett-Packard during the week. The acquisition will cost Dell $24.30 a share, valuing the data storage company at $1.53bn. HP offered $24 a share.3Par fell 2.7 per cent to $26.03, Hewlett-Packard nudged down 0.1 per cent to $38.22 and Dell lost 0.3 per cent to $11.75.Intel fell 1.6 per cent to $18.18 after it was reported that it is close to agreeing a deal to buy Infineon Technologies’ wireless business.Time Warner lost 1.4 per cent to $50.96 after it bought a Chilean TV network for $150m as part of its plan to expand its investments in emerging markets. Chilevision was previously owned by Sebastián Piñera, the country’s president.Cisco fell 2.4 per cent to $20.70 after it bought Extend Media, a privately- owned provider of software that manages online video content. Cisco did not disclose how much it paid for the company.Novartis completed its acquisition of Nestlé’s stake in Alcon, the world’s largest eyecare company, for $28.3bn. US-listed shares in Novartis, which now owns 77 per cent of Alcon, rose 0.5 per cent to $50.80 and Alcon fell 1.4 per cent to $158.08.Wal-Mart declined 1.1 per cent to $50.97 after it asked the US Supreme Court to block female employees from suing on behalf of their whole female workforce, as many as 1.5m women. The retailer is accused of paying women less than men for the same jobs."
168;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Intel agrees anti-trust settlement with US;;US regulators on Wednesday announced a settlement of charges against Intel that they said would go further in limiting the chipmaker’s anticompetitive conduct than earlier moves in Europe and Asia.The agreement marked the resolution of the most prominent antitrust case brought since the Obama administration took office, although the Federal Trade Commission, which brought the case, is an independent agency.It is also set to bring down the curtain on a decade-long series of antitrust investigations around the world into how Intel uses its dominance of the PC microprocessor market to restrict competition, particularly from smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices.Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the FTC, roundly denounced Intel over what he called its “unfair, deceptive and anticompetitive conduct”, and said the settlement would bring quick benefits for consumers.However, some industry experts questioned whether the regulators would be in a position to enforce some of the more technical aspects of the agreement, leaving doubts about its effectiveness.Echoing steps already taken by European, Japanese and South Korean regulators, the FTC said the settlement would prevent Intel from threatening penalties against customers that buy chips from other companies, or paying them to buy only its own chips.Mr Leibowitz said the US regulators had also gone further than their counterparts elsewhere by extending the restrictions on Intel beyond the core processors of computers to also include graphics chips and chipsets, which bundle a number of different chips in a single product.Among the extra requirements are a stipulation that Intel must use an open industry standard to make it easier for other chipmakers to connect their own products to its chips.
169;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-07-22T23:37:20Z;Dell settles with SEC over fraud charge;;Dell agreed to pay a $100m penalty on Thursday to settle a fraud charge by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging false accounting based on undisclosed payments from Intel.The SEC said in a court filing that Dell would have missed Wall Street expectations for every quarter in a five-year period from 2002 to 2007, but for the payments from Intel to secure the exclusive use of its chips in Dell computers.Michael Dell, the company’s founder and chief executive, and Michael Rollins, a former chief executive, agreed to pay a further $4m and $3m, respectively, to settle accusations that they failed to disclose the real reason for Dell’s winning streak.Neither the company nor Mr Dell admitted to the alleged fraud, detailed in a 61-page suit filed along with the proposed settlement in a Washington federal court.Dell has restated its financial results for the period in question and this year set aside the amount of the penalty when it disclosed settlement talks.The details of the case had been aired in a suit brought against Intel by rival chipmaker AMD, settled last year for $1.35bn.But the SEC charges made public on Thursday were severe enough to prompt Dell’s board to issue a statement. “Dell’s Board reaffirms its unanimous support for Michael Dell’s continued leadership and the management team in its ongoing commitment to transparent accounting, integrity in financial reporting and strong corporate governance,” Sam Nunn, presiding director, said.The SEC lawsuit has damaged the image of Mr Dell, who founded the company in his college dorm in 1984 and became a business icon when his pioneering direct sales approach took his company to the top of the industry in revenue terms.During the period of improper payments, in part disguised as rebates, Dell revenues rose from $35bn to $57bn. At one point in 2003, when Dell was discussing potential contracts with AMD, Mr Dell and Craig Barrett, Intel’s chief executive, shook hands on a proposal for the chipmaker to pay $258m to Dell over four quarters. Two days later, Mr Dell told Mr Rollins and others to “close down” the discussions with AMD, the suit says. It says that Dell, when faced with the prospect of missing profit targets, would ask Intel for more money.According to the SEC, Intel regularly paid Dell to remain the sole supplier of some chips until the first fiscal quarter of 2007, contributing as much as $720m, or 76 per cent of the manufacturer’s operating income.Dell executives told investors and analysts that cost controls were behind the company’s consistently strong margins. After Dell started to buy from AMD as well as Intel, cutting off the payment stream, it blamed the 36 per cent drop in profits on “pricing too aggressively in the face of slowing demand and to component costs declining less than expected”, the SEC said.
170;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-07-20T21:49:43Z;Intel nears settlement in market abuse probe;;"Intel seems close to putting behind it a decade of market abuse complaints from round the world in a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission this week.The deal will include concessions on the US chipmaker’s business practices, according to a person familiar with the settlement, but will not include fines because the FTC does not have the authority to issue civil penalties.A resolution with the FTC would complete investigations by the national regulatory authorities in the US, Europe, Japan and South Korea into complaints that the world’s biggest chipmaker has abused its market dominance.The FTC inquiry has been more wide-ranging than those of its predecessors. The processor technology that drives the world’s computers has changed significantly since Intel’s rival Advanced Micro Devices first filed a complaint to the European Commission in 2000.The central processing units (CPUs) made by Intel and AMD under Intel’s “x86” designs are now rivalled in importance by graphics processing units (GPUs) as PCs are used for more multimedia tasks.The FTC had alleged in a case launched last December that Intel used “threats and rewards” aimed at PC makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM to coerce them not to buy AMD CPUs.It also alleged Intel secretly redesigned key software to stunt the performance of rivals’ chips that were licensing its “x86” microprocessor design.But, in addition, the FTC alleged that Intel was repeating in GPUs its tactic of slowing down competitors, such as graphics chipmaker Nvidia, so that it could catch up.“There also is a dangerous probability that Intel’s unfair methods of competition could allow it to extend its monopoly into the GPU chip markets,” the FTC said.Intel at the time responded to the FTC allegations saying the FTC case was misguided and based on claims it had not fully investigated.Intel, which has a more than 80 per cent global market share in computer microprocessors, is expected to accept curbs to its marketing of its chips, according to the person familiar with the FTC settlement.The FTC declined to comment on reports of a settlement and Intel said talks were continuing and it had nothing to add at this point. Nvidia also declined to comment.David Balto, a former antitrust attorney at the FTC, has warned that the commission needs to pay special attention to GPUs in its remedy if it is concerned about future competition.“For a GPU remedy to work, you need at least three elements – a licence to the x86 [design], a clear agreement about interoperability between the GPU and CPU, and finally a strong enforcement mechanism – with clear standards and a timetable for prompt resolution of disputes,” he said.While the FTC had taken Intel to court, both parties asked for a one-month suspension of proceedings in June to try to work out an out-of-court settlement that would lead to a consent order being agreed. The suspension ends on Thursday but, while it can be extended, a deal is expected to be announced by the end of the week.A similar case brought by the New York attorney-general last year is still outstanding and Intel is appealing against a record €1.06bn ($1.44bn then) fine imposed by the European Commission in May 2009.The South Korean FTC fined Intel about $26m in 2008 and Japan’s Fair Trade Commission ruled in 2005 that it had abused its monopoly power and the company accepted a “cease and desist” order. Intel paid AMD $1.25bn last December in settlement of a civil action its rival brought over the same issues.AMD said a new five-year cross-licensing agreement with Intel would allow it to
compete on a level playing field."
171;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-07-16T00:17:16Z;AMD sees server splurge, graphics gains;;The splurge in server sales, which Intel highlighted on Tuesday as a revival of corporate hardware spending, is also benefiting its rival AMD.On its second-quarter earnings call on Thursday, the Silicon Valley neighbour said shipments of its new Opteron 6000 server chips nearly quadrupled compared to the first quarter “ramping late in the quarter as our largest customers transitioned the bulk of their AMD-based offering to the new platform.”AMD seems a little behind Intel in exploiting the server “refresh”. It only completed the rollout of its Opteron 4000 series of server chips, which are specifically designed for “cloud” data centres, in late June.“We expect to see the substantial impact of our new-generation server products to fully materialise in the third quarter,” said Dirk Meyer, chief executive.AMD is also behind Intel in moving its processors onto silicon with smaller 32-nanometre-wide circuitry.While Intel said on Tuesday it was accelerating production of its 32nm chips in the second half to meet expected demand for those featuring a new design, codenamed Sandy Bridge, AMD said it was having production problems with 32nm and would delay its design, codenamed Llano, by a couple of months. It will not appear until the first half of next year.On the positive side, AMD is bringing forward its chip codenamed Ontario. Like Llano, it will achieve AMD’s cherished ambition of “Fusion”, bringing together a central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) for the first time on a single 40nm sliver of silicon. AMD is calling this an APU (Accelerated Processing Unit).This is AMD’s big advantage over Intel. While its bigger rival has admitted defeat with an ambitious Fusion-style combination chip, codenamed Larrabee, AMD is finally reaping benefits from its 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI for $5.4bn.AMD reported record GPU shipments in the second quarter with sales up 87 per cent on a year earlier. That helped it to an overall revenue increase of 40 per cent to $1.65bn for a net loss per share of 6 cents.Ontario will combine a new processing core codenamed Bobcat with a GPU capable of running the latest DX11 graphics standard. Its low power demands and high performance will finally enable AMD to compete in categories such as netbooks and tablets, where Intel has dominated with its Atom processor.“It’s a game-changer that significantly expands our addressable market,” said Mr Meyer.“Based on strong customer demand and an accelerated engineering cycle, we now expect Ontario to be the first Fusion APU we bring to market.”Ontario will ship in the fourth quarter and should show up in devices early next year, meaning AMD is likely to be facing off with Intel in the netbook and tablet zones of the Consumer Electronics Show in January.

However, initial jobless claims data provided some support. Claims were 429,000 last week, significantly better than the 445,000 average estimate by economists.Despite the positive start to the earnings season, investors have switched focus to the macroeconomic outlook, said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global. “The markets are back to worrying about regional growth here in the US, and the slowdown in growth in China.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,096.48, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eased 0.1 per cent to 10,359.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,249.08.US-listed shares in BP surged in the final hour of trading to close up 7.6 per cent at $38.92 after the company said it had stopped the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time in about three months.Goldman Sachs rose 4.4 per cent to $145.22 on reports that the bank was close to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the agency’s Abacus lawsuit, as well as some lower-profile investigations.JPMorgan closed up 0.3 per cent to $40.46 as the second-largest US bank by assets reported a 76 per cent increase in profits in the second quarter– beating consensus estimates – as loan losses in mortgages and credit cards fell.“While analysts appeared to be not as impressed as the headline might have led one to expect, the macro crowd got a lift from the bank’s report, as a slowing in provisions for troubled mortgage and credit card loans pointed to an improving economy,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.NBTY, a maker of nutritional supplements, surged 43.4 per cent to $53.74 as
the company agreed to be bought by Carlyle, a private equity group, for $3.8bn, or $55 per share, in one of the biggest private equity deals so far this year.Shares in AIG were 0.4 per cent lower to $37.38 following the the resignation of Harvey Golub, AIG’s chairman, after he lost a power struggle with the company’s chief executive that could cause further turmoil at the bailed-out insurer.Amazon dropped 1 per cent to $122.06 as the online retailer was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral” by BofA Merrill Lynch.Marriott International declined 1.6 per cent to $31.66 even as the hotel chain unveiled slightly better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and raised its full-year earnings forecast, citing improving travel demand.It forecast full-year earnings of $1.05 to $1.13 per share, higher than the forecast it gave in April and compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.06.Rival hotel chains also fell, with Starwood Hotels down 0.6 per cent at $46.35, Hyatt Hotels 2 per cent lower at $36.75 and Wyndham Worldwide off 1.4 per cent at $21.45.Google rose 0.6 per cent to $494.02 and Advanced Micro Devices declined 0.4 per cent to $7.41 ahead of their second-quarter results, scheduled for release after the market’s close. Both reports will be closely watched for insight into
the technology sector following Intel’s better-than-expected results earlier this week.Intel was 0.7 per cent higher yesterday to $21.51.Apple dropped 0.5 per cent to $251.45 as the company announced a press conference for Friday to address connectivity issues regarding its latest iPhone.Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the move was unprecedented, suggesting a higher likelihood of repair and recall scenarios. He estimated this could leave Apple with a pre-tax charge of up to $900m or 71 cents per share.The stock has fallen 3.3 per cent since Tuesday when the device failed to get a recommendation from the Consumer Reports magazine in its latest review of smartphones."

However, core retail sales, which exclude petrol, building materials and cars, increased by 0.2 per cent, the first gain since March.There has been a steady decline in bullish sentiment on the sell-side, said John Horcher, director of sell-side sales at First Coverage, a research group that tracks market sentiment. “We are seeing the sell-side get a little more scared of the market as it’s been rising recently. Sentiment is trending downward.”After a choppy morning, the S&P 500 closed flat at 1,095.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, at 10,366.72, while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.4 per cent to 2,249.84.Yum Brands, a fast-food chain operator that owns Taco Bell among others, was 1.2 per cent lower at $41 following the release of its second-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday.The company said it expected to earn $2.43 per share this year, below the average analyst estimate of $2.48.However, its earnings for the past quarter beat expectations, coming in at 58 cents per share compared with the average estimate of 54 cents.Intel added 1.7 per cent to $21.36 after reporting the best quarter in its history. Its corporate customers increased information technology spending, boosting hopes that businesses are engaged in a long-awaited “refresh” of both hardware and software in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 1.1 per cent to $7.44.But the disappointing retail sales data weighed on retailers. Department store chain JC Penney fell 0.9 per cent to $22.99, rival Dillard’s was down 1.3 per cent at $22.11 and Macy’s dropped 0.5 per cent to $18.38.However, a number of thrift stores inched upward. Dollar Tree added 1 per cent to $42.06, Family Dollar Stores was up 1.5 per cent to $37.08 and Dollar General advanced 1.9 per cent to $28.23.Homebuilders were among the day’s laggards as the sector was downgraded from “attractive” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, who cited a lack of immediate catalysts to boost the stocks’ performance. A rise in new home sales last month was smaller than the analysts at the brokerage had expected.Lennar Corp led the sector lower as it dropped 4.3 per cent to $14.59. Pulte was down 3 per cent at $8.54, Toll Brothers fell 2.3 per cent to $17.16 and DR Horton dropped 0.9 per cent to $10.34.Annaly Capital Management announced a common stock offering of 60m shares, sending its shares down 4.1 per cent to $17.52. The mortgage real estate investment trust said it expected gross proceeds of $1.1bn from the offering.RadioShack, a consumer electronics goods retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, as it fell 5.5 per cent to $21.17, on reports that an ongoing “soft” auction for its sale had seen a fall in interest from potential buyers.Northrop Grumman, a global security company, rallied 3.1 per cent to $56.99 after it said it was considering a possible sale or spin-off of its ship unit, in a deal that could be worth as much as $4.5bn.Caterpillar inched down 0.1 per cent to $66.70 even as estimates for its second-quarter and full-year earnings were revised upwards at RBC Capital Markets, citing evidence suggesting better than expected end-markets. The broker sees earnings per share in the quarter of 85 cents, up from its prior estimate of 72 cents. Caterpillar will report its second-quarter earnings on July 22 before the open.JPMorgan Chase lost 0.3 per cent to $40.35 a day before its second-quarter earnings release. Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate is 71 cents per share.Marriott International, due to report earnings on Wednesday after the market’s close, rose 0.9 per cent to $32.16. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of 29 cents from the hotels group.
174;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-06-22T00:38:09Z;Intel and FTC seek antitrust settlement;;Intel and the US Federal Trade Commission indicated on Monday they may soon reach an out-of-court settlement of their antitrust case, filing a a joint motion to suspend administrative trial proceedings until July 22.The two parties said the suspension was needed while they considered potential settlement of the case originally brought by the FTC last December.They said this would create a month’s window, till July 22, during which time they would review and discuss a proposed consent order.“The terms of the proposed consent order are confidential and Intel will make no additional public comment on the matter at this time,” said the chipmaker in a statement.A consent order is an alternative to litigation, whereby the FTC can gain compliance from a company it has accused of unlawful conduct.Intel criticised the FTC last December for taking it to court when settlement discussions were already at an advanced stage.“This case could have, and should have, been settled. Settlement talks had progressed very far but stalled when the FTC insisted on unprecedented remedies – including the restrictions on lawful price competition,” said Doug Melamed, Intel general counsel, at the time.“The FTC’s rush to file this case will cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars to litigate issues that the FTC has not fully investigated.”The FTC has alleged the world’s biggest chipmaker abused for a decade its dominant market position.The FTC’s action followed similar charges by regulators in Europe, Japan and Korea, but its complaint against Intel was broader - alleging anti-competitive behaviour in the graphics chip market.Intel is alleged to have not only used illegal tactics to dissuade customers from buying PC microprocessors (CPUs) from its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), but was also repeating in graphics processing units (GPUs) its tactic of slowing down competitors so it can catch up.“There also is a dangerous probability that Intel’s unfair methods of competition could allow it to extend its monopoly into the GPU chip markets,” the FTC had said.Intel denied the allegations and described the FTC’s case as “misguided”.
175;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-06-11T02:45:24Z;Dell board says chief will not be barred;;Dell’s board of directors on Thursday sought to reassure investors that Michael Dell, the computer company’s chairman and chief executive, would not have to step down as the result of an investigation by US regulators.The company said it was revising its results for its previous quarter, ending April 30 – recording a $100m liability to establish a reserve for a potential settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC alleges Mr Dell broke “negligence-based fraud provisions” of federal securities laws. They relate to his company’s disclosures and alleged omissions before 2008 regarding its commercial relationship with the chipmaker Intel.Dell investors filed a class-action lawsuit in 2007 alleging that the company had been secretly receiving as much as $1bn a year from Intel for buying its chips exclusively and snubbing those of Intel’s rival Advanced Micro Devices.This had led to improper accounting of profits and margins, they alleged.Intel paid AMD $1.25bn in December in settlement of a civil action its rival brought over similar allegations. Alleged abuse of its dominant market position in microprocessors has also been the subject of investigations by regulators in Europe, Japan, Korea and by the US Federal Trade Commission.In a regulatory filing, Dell said its chief executive and SEC staff had recently begun talks on a settlement framework that would resolve the allegations.“Any such settlement …would not include any bar against Mr Dell’s service as an officer and director of a public company. Any settlement would be made without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations,” its statement read.The investigation began as far back as 2005. Dell finally began buying chips from AMD in 2006.Dell also carried out an independent investigation, completed in 2007, which led to a restatement of financial reports.“We are hopeful that these settlement discussions will achieve a comprehensive resolution in the near future,” said Sam Nunn, presiding director on Dell’s board.“The independent directors of the board have affirmed that Michael Dell will continue to lead the company as its chairman and CEO, and he continues to have our complete confidence and support.”Mr Dell resumed control of the company as CEO in 2007, after the resignation of Kevin Rollins.The liability reduces Dell’s net income for the last quarter by $100m or 5 cents a share.Its shares fell 2 per cent to $12.81 in after-hours trading on Thursday.
176;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

Several analysts have cited it as Amgen’s single most important future growth driver. The drug is expected to generate peak sales of $750m to $1bn.Futures and options broker MF Global fell 3.6 per cent to $7.32 after it said it planned to sell up to $150m in shares to raise funds in an effort to restructure its capital base and reduce pressure it faces from rating agencies.The move, however, will negatively impact its earnings per share ratio.Interactive Brokers, a global electronic market maker and broker, added 2 per cent to $16.97 after it posted record brokerage activity last month.Chris Allen, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “We do expect some moderation in June but given the strength in May and our positive view on the environment for the market making business, we foresee upside potential for our second-quarter

178;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-06-01T07:13:46Z;Abu Dhabi to create regional semiconductor hub;;Abu Dhabi on Tuesday announced plans to bring the global chipmaking industry to the Middle East, as the oil-rich emirate seeks to diversify its economy into knowledge-based industries.Ibrahim Ajami, chief executive of the state-owned Advanced Technology Investment Company, said his company would invest in building an advanced technology cluster on a 3km-square piece of land just outside the Abu Dhabi international airport.Besides building infrastructure, Mr Ajami said Atic would also increasingly explore “the various modes of investment required” to start attracting other semiconductor companies to Abu Dhabi.“Abu Dhabi is a wealthy nation today because it sits on a lot of resources, oil and gas resources. But oil is finite and will one day run out. Our plan is to bring the semiconductor industry to Abu Dhabi one day,” Mr Ajami told a press conference at Taipei’s Computex trade show.Atic – which was spun out of Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment vehicle in 2008 – flexed its financial muscles when it invested $1.4bn in a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices of the US to spin off its manufacturing arm into a new company called Globalfoundries last year.Atic then paid $1.8bn for a majority stake in Chartered Semiconductor of Singapore, in September last year, which put Globalfoundries just behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and United Microelectronics as the world’s third-biggest contract chipmaker.Mr Ajami said Globalfoundries “will be the nucleus, will be the heart” of the new technology cluster, but added that he did not rule out making other acquisitions to bring those companies to Abu Dhabi.Mr Ajami said Abu Dhabi’s focus would be on building a “capital intensive, manufacturing-driven cluster” rather than one focused on software or chip design, which typically earns higher margins.“We had to invest and play along the dimensions where we think we have a comparative advantage. Capital intensity is one and energy intensity is another,” he added.He said, however, that Atic would not go on an acquisition spree “just to build lots of capacity or because of valuations …that is not how Atic thinks about its investment strategy”.“We will not build our semiconductor ecosystem by announcing we’ll open a fab in Abu Dhabi tomorrow”, he said.Instead, the emirate will invest in Globalfoundries and also in training a pool of domestic talent in Abu Dhabi over the next five years.The plan includes establishing a new semiconductor polytechnic university in the city, and sending students on internships at Globalfoundries’ facilities in New York, Dresden and Singapore.Globalfoundries on Tuesday also announced it would spend an additional $3bn to expand capacity at its existing Dresden plant and at its advanced factory in New York, which is still under construction.The investment would increase Globalfoundries’ capacity in advanced 12-inch technologies by one-fifth.The move, which reflects confidence in the continued recovery of the technology sector, comes in addition to the $6bn investment Globalfoundries already committed to when it was founded last year.
179;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-05-19T16:50:02Z;Netbooks face tablet challenge;;The netbook has been knocked off its perch as the fastest growing category in the PC industry, toppled by two newer concepts that pose a challenge for the world’s biggest chipmaker.Intel has dominated netbooks with its Atom microprocessor, but ultra-thin notebooks and tablet devices are enjoying a huge growth spurt.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel’s rival in “x86” processors, has led in the development of ultra-thin or Consumer Ultra Low Voltage (CULV) as the category is known, while a host of semiconductor makers are competing in tablets with chips based on designs by the UK’s Arm.In addition, Intel is unrepresented in a sub-category of netbooks known as smartbooks, which favour Arm-based chips and 3G wireless connectivity.“Everybody says tablets are going to eat the notebooks’ and netbooks’ lunch,” Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, told analysts at the company’s annual investor meeting last week, while insisting: “On the scale of the PC industry, they’re relatively insignificant.” Mr Otellini said tablets were fundamentally consumption devices that would not take away market share from netbooks.He showed a chart representing 700m PCs shipped a year by 2014, with desktop PCs growing at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent, notebooks at 22 per cent, netbooks 15 per cent and tablets 73-88 per cent, according to the Gartner and InStat research firms.Despite the high growth rates for tablets, they would only take up 50m-60m of those 700m units by 2014 on the most optimistic estimates, he pointed out.Netbook shipments grew by about 103 per cent in 2009, but the market is now maturing. The iSuppli research company predicts growth of 30 per cent this year and 19 per cent in 2011.Intel feels it can help sustain the category with battery life and performance improvements from Atom. It also sees strong growth at better price points in emerging markets.Mooly Eden, general manager of Intel’s PC Client Group, told analysts Intel was serious about tablets and would actively participate in the category. “Stay tuned for Computex,” he said, referring to the upcoming Taipei show.Taiwanese manufacturers planning tablets seem to be giving Intel a serious look“Arm is better than Intel at power consumption but that is because its performance is not nearly as good,” said Sambora Chen, marketing director of notebooks at MSi. “That is not so much a problem in mobile phones because the display is much smaller, but it is an issue for notebooks and tablets.”Arm processors have dominated in mobile phones because their low-power operation extends battery life. As their performance has improved, they have come into competition with Intel’s Atom chips which, in turn, are becoming competitive on low-power operations.The Apple iPad’s A4 processor is reported to have an Arm-based design. Marvell Technology said recently it would ship Arm-based server chips this year, challenging a core Intel strength.Intel has said its latest Atom chips should start to appear in smartphones in the second half, although handset makers seem reluctant to switch.Tsai Ming-kai, Mediatek chief executive, says because all its chips have been designed with Arm “it just takes too much effort” to switch to Intel.AMD has not produced a processor that is competitive with Atom in netbooks and smaller devices. Instead, it came up with the ultra-thin or “thin and light” concept for notebooks early in 2009, hoping consumers would turn to a category that provided more functionality and bigger screens than netbooks, but was still light, affordable and capable of long battery life.For its latest generation, it has announced 26 ultra-thin notebooks, up 30 per cent on last year, offering up to eight hours of battery life. Intel is expected to respond in the second half with ultra-low voltage versions of its Core i3 and i5 processors.
180;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Kumar pays $2.8m to settle in Galleon case;;A former McKinsey director who has already pleaded guilty to insider trading in the Galleon hedge fund probe agreed to pay $2.8m to settle civil charges stemming from his actions, according to documents filed in federal court on Monday.Anil Kumar, who was a senior partner and director at McKinsey, signed a consent order with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, calling for him to pay $2.6m in disgorgement and another $190,621 in interest for his role in the Galleon affair. The consent order was filed on Monday.Mr Kumar is one of 21 people who was charged late last year with participation in an alleged insider trading ring centred around Galleon and its founder, Raj Rajaratnam. So far, 11 people, including Mr Kumar, have pleaded guilty in the matter, eight of whom have pledged to cooperate with prosecutors.Mr Rajaratnam and another individual alleged to be at the centre of the ring, Danielle Chiesi, have pleaded not guilty and promised to fight the charges.In January, Mr Kumar pleaded guilty to passing along material, non-public information concerning a proposed acquisition of ATI Technologies by Advanced Micro Devices, a McKinsey client. After receiving the information, Galleon accumulated ATI stock. When the deal was announced in July 2006, Galleon sold its holdings, netting profits of $19.2m.According to his plea, Mr Kumar received between $1.75m and $2m over a period of several years for providing the inside information to Galleon.
181;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-05-09T04:27:13Z;HP, AMD find their MUSE with thin notebooks;;HP emphasised compelling designs and colours, but also its expanded use of AMD processors in its back-to-school laptop lineup this week.Ultra-thin laptop concepts pushed by AMD could literally be the shape of things to come, with netbooks suffering a setback in the first quarter and Intel taking another shot at this higher-end category.HP unveiled its broadest selection and largest single introduction of AMD-powered laptops this week, with 14 notebooks introduced under AMD’s Vision and Vision Pro brands.Chris Cloran, general manager of AMD’s Client division, told me AMD’s platform for ultra-thin laptops is now in its third generation since the concept and first model was introduced with HP in January 2009.“They’re between netbooks and notebooks, sexy and thin but with the full PC experience” is his definition.MacBook Air-like but cheaper, ultra-thin or “thin and light” has been AMD’s strategic answer to the success of netbooks, where it does not have a product to compare with Intel’s Atom processor.Both battery life and performance have been increased this time around and Mr Cloran said the growing integration of AMD’s processors with graphics chips from its ATI acquisition was “changing the experience” for users, right down to web pages with graphics loading much faster. HP says AMD’s chips in its new dm3 model are giving 7 hours of battery life.AMD does seem more competitive with its bigger rival on both performance and price and is expected to announce next week that its chips will be available on 109 laptop models this summer compared to 40 a year ago, according to a Reuters report. An AMD version of HP’s Pavilion dv6 laptop will cost $530, compared to $650 for an Intel version.Intel is also paying more attention to ultra-thin. At a briefing this week, it announced less powerful versions of its Core i3 and i5 processors would be aimed at the market.Analysts refer to this segment as CULV – Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage notebooks. In a report this week, the iSuppli research firm predicted 14.5m CULV notebooks would ship this year, up 93 per cent on 2009. That compares to only 30 per cent growth for netbooks, except netbooks are a more mature segment and forecasts are for a much larger 34.5m units to be shipped.Intel reported a 19 per cent fall in netbook chips shipped in the first quarter compared to the fourth, but blamed this on inventories being cleared after the holiday season. However, the netbook category is under pressure from not just CULVs but smartbooks and tablets – notably the iPad, with Morgan Stanley reporting only 5 per cent growth rates for netbooks year-on-year in April.The other major trend, judging by HP’s new lineup, is the degree of effort going into design and looks.“It’s kind of shock and awe, everything in the lineup is new,” Stacy Wolff, head of HP notebook design, told me.He talked about a MUSE strategy focused on Materials, Usability, the Sensory appeal of products and the overall Experience of the user interface, packaging and use of the product.The design and feature sets brought in with its Envy 13 and 15 high-end models are filtering down to the mainstream Pavilion consumer laptops with, among the features, aluminium cladding, backlit keyboards, a larger touchpad, clean lines, chemically etched designs, textured finishes, slot-loading DVD players and a range of colours and matching wallpapers and accessories, from a champagne colour on the dv6 [pictured at top] to Sonoma Red on the dv5 and “preppy pink” on the Mini 210 netbook.Prices range from $1400 for the Envy 17, with its 17.3-inch screen to $280 for a new version of the HP Mini 110 netbook.
182;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-04-07T19:30:23Z;Global computer server sales see rare boom;;The global computer-server industry is witnessing a once-in-decade sweet spot of sales growth, boosted by a rare alignment of economic recovery, big technological advances and soaring data-handling needs.Servers, the heart of computer networks, are seldom regarded as the racy end of the information technology sector. But after a difficult 2009, server manufacturers are suddenly seeing strong growth with customers reinvesting in ageing IT infrastructures as recessionary conditions recede.JPMorgan analysts recently more than doubled their estimates for server revenue growth in 2010 from 6.2 per cent to 14.3 per cent – “a unique phenomenon in IT hardware”.IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Oracle, as well as processor makers Intel and AMD, have all rushed to bring out a range of server products.Part of the turnround is being driven by pent-up demand after a 2009 in which worldwide server revenue declined 18.9 per cent to $43.2bn, according to research firm IDC. Businesses had deferred purchases of servers during the economic down times to save costs, extending the replacement cycle for products that tend to have a working lifespan of about five years.But analysts also point to financial incentives to upgrade, saying the newest generation of servers can pay for themselves in a few months amid reduced costs of power and cooling. This is in spite of higher price tags for many of the new products.One example is the development of processors for servers, which have advanced in recent years from a single core or “brain” doing the work to multiple cores being squeezed on to chips. High-end eight-core processors introduced by Intel last week can be deployed in a single server that replaces 20 older single-core servers and achieves the same performance. Intel claims this reduces energy costs by more than 90 per cent.AMD, Intel’s smaller rival, also introduced eight- and 12-core processors last week.In addition, server upgrades are being driven by more data-intensive applications and an explosion in cloud computing where services and data are stored and served from remote data centres.“This next wave is the biggest one of all, and highly dis­ruptive,” says Howard Elias, head of cloud services at EMC, the data storage equipment company. “We’re talking about a change in the way IT infrastructure is operated, produced and consumed.”Matt Eastwood of IDC’s enterprise server group said there could be a shake-out in the industry. “Optimal conditions for market inflection occur only once a decade and IDC believes that market shares could shift dramatically as the winners and losers of this new market cycle are determined,” he said.Additional reporting by David Gelles
183;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-04-07T19:30:23Z;Servers soaring as recession thaws;;At Intel’s launch of its newest processors in San Francisco last week, Jean Gonnord of France’s atomic energy commission gave a thank-you speech to the chipmaker.The programme director for numerical simulation at the Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique (CEA) told the audience he appreciated the on-time delivery of his order for 18,000 of the chipmaker’s new Xeon 7500 8-core chips.Priced at more than $2,500 (€1,877, £1,642) each, perhaps Intel should have been thanking him.The order is destined for just one supercomputer – among the world’s five fastest – which will run checks on France’s nuclear arsenal. The order might be exceptional in size, but it is typical of the major upgrades taking place in servers and high-performance computing (HPC) this year.The “refresh cycle” is good news for chipmakers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and for server vendors, who are led in terms of sales by IBM, followed by Hewlett Packard, Dell and Oracle.A once-in-a-decade market inflection took place in the fourth quarter of 2009 as business shook off the effects of the recession, according to IDC, the research firm.Although full-year server revenues for 2009 were down nearly 20 per cent on 2008, the rot stopped late in the year as companies re-evaluated their needs for server upgrades.“There have been a lot of deferrals of orders that should have gone through in 2009, so to that extent there is pent-up demand,” says Jean Bozman, IDC server analyst.“Also, the bigger, older servers …some have been held onto for a very long time and technology has gotten so much better.”About 40 per cent of the installed base of higher-end servers are still running single-core processors and, according to Gartner, the research firm, more than 1m server upgrades were delayed by the downturn.Switching to energy-efficient multi-core servers can dramatically cut the amount of power, space and cooling needed for them in data centres, meaning they can pay for themselves in less than a year.“You can get your money back in five months and in seven months you’re making money,” says Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel’s data centre group. “It’s a cash machine for IT [departments].”Some of this surplus is going into new projects, which in turn require new equipment, according to Steve Schuckenbrock, Dell’s head of large business deals. “We’re going to see this run for a long time,” he said.Intel’s smaller rival AMD launched its own line-up of high-end server processors – the Opteron 6000 series – the day before Intel and claims it offers similar performance but better value in different segments of the server market.“Just because people are having to go through a refresh because they’ve got to end-of-life on their servers or they’re no longer supported on their warranty, that doesn’t mean they’re going to rush out and buy the most expensive servers,” says John Fruehe, head of server marketing at AMD.Both chipmakers and server manufacturers have timed their new offerings to perfection, says Jim Ganthier, vice-president of marketing for Hewlett Packard’s industry standard servers division.“We’re seeing a perfect convergence of new products coming along at just the right time and we are able to deliver radical [returns on investment] to our customers.”He says the work of 20 old servers can now be done on just one new HP ProLiant server and buyers can see a return on investment in about two months.As well as more powerful hardware, consolidation of servers is being further enhanced by virtualisation software. This allows servers to be split into many virtual machines and pooled with others to allow greater task-sharing.Other factors driving server sales include the growth of cloud computing, where web services and applications are delivered from data centres and the need for business information to be served in real-time.JPMorgan analysts expect server revenues to grow in 2010 at a higher rate than other segments such as PCs, printers and storage.The new processors will drive more than profits as they help scientists better predict natural disasters, explore the universe and tackle major diseases.“We’re going to transform scientific discovery at a rate and pace never before seen on earth,” says Mr Skaugen.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn
184;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel and AMD serve up multi-core contest;;Servers, whether the tall wardrobe type or those pizza-box slices of hardware that slide into racks in data centre ovens, seem suddenly almost sexy.We have had lavish beauty-contest launches from AMD and Intel on Monday and Tuesday of new high-performance server chips at San Francisco’s De Young Museum and the old Federal Reserve building respectively.Sashaying down the microcircuitry catwalk, Intel’s Xeon 7500s and AMD’s Opteron 6000s won admiring testimonials from data-crunching executives for their lean energy needs and powerful performance, giving them the ability to pay for themselves in savings on electricity and licensing costs in a matter of months.HP, Dell, Cray, SGI and Acer – a new AMD vendor – are among those introducing new systems based on the 6000s, which are either eight or 12-core processors.HP, Dell, Cray, SGI, IBM, Oracle and many other vendors have announced systems based on the 7500s, which have up to eight cores.AMD says it is delivering more cores – or processing brains – and more memory for less money. Intel says data centres can replace 20 single-core servers with a single 7500 system. The 7500s follow the launch of 5600 chips for the “volume server” market two weeks ago.“Intel typically has done really well in multiprocessor [systems], in government and done fairly well in high-performance computing. AMD typically does really well in the price/performance area,” says Jim Ganthier, head of marketing for HP’s Industry Standard Servers, which feature both processors.Intel has more than 80 per cent market share in servers, but the pie seems about to get bigger this year with a once-in-a-decade “inflection point”, according to the research firm IDC, where customers are re-evaluating their needs and upgrading their infrastructures.An increase in data to be managed, the growth of cloud computing, the need for real-time business information and the compelling benefits of virtualisation technology – where one server can be split into many virtual machines – are among the factors prompting the refreshing of equipment.The most alluring argument for an upgrade is the cost savings, with HP claiming outlays on new equipment can be recovered in less than a quarter.“When our CIOs [chief information officers] go and have conversations with their CFOs [chief financial officers], they can promise them a two-month ROI [Return On Investment] . These are radical savings that we’re delivering to our customers,” says Mr Ganthier.
185;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-03-29T23:32:13Z;Ex-IBM executive admits to Galleon tip-offs;;Robert Moffat, a former senior vice-president at IBM, admitted on Monday he provided inside information to a person involved with the Galleon Group hedge fund insider-trading scandal.“I disclosed material non-public information to Danielle Chiesi, a friend who I knew worked at a hedge fund,” Mr Moffat told Frank Maas, the judge in the federal southern district of New York court in Manhattan. “I knew that the information I provided would be helpful to her in performing her job executing securities transactions.”Mr Moffat said that in 2008 he gave Ms Chiesi, then a consultant at New Castle funds, a unit of Bear Stearns Asset Management, information about AMD, Lenovo and his own company that he learnt in the course of his 31-year career in computer hardware.Ms Chiesi was indicted, along with Galleon’s founder, Raj Rajaratnam, for passing information to the fund, which prosecutors say took in $49m (€37m, £33m) trading shares of technology companies based on the tips. Both individuals deny the charges.Mr Moffat, according to the complaint, told Ms Chiesi of the nature and timing of plans by AMD to sell its manufacturing operations to investors in Abu Dhabi. He also said he told her about disappointing sales at IBM and poor earnings at Lenovo, of which he said he learnt as a non-voting member of the computer-maker’s board.The complaint, which investigators assembled through telephone surveillance, also says that Ms Chiesi spoke to an unnamed executive at AMD and at Akamai.So far 21 individuals have been charged as part of the insider-trading ring, including former executives from other US companies, including McKinsey, the consultancy, and Intel, the chipmaker. It is believed to be the largest insider trading case.Mr Moffat is the 11th person charged by the US attorney to plead guilty. Eight others have agreed to co-operate with prosecutors.His attorney, Kerry Lawrence, of firm Briccetti, Calhoun & Lawrence, said in a statement: “While [Mr Moffat] has pleaded guilty, it is also important to understand that he never engaged in any trading …and received no money or other financial benefit from anyone relating to those transactions.”
186;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-03-23T23:27:45Z;IBM faces fresh EU antitrust complaint;;Antitrust problems for IBM mounted on Tuesday when a fresh complaint about its business practices was filed with Europe’s top competition regulator.The new complaint comes from TurboHercules, a French company, which is accusing the US group of refusing to allow customers to run IBM’s mainframe operating systems on anything other than IBM mainframe hardware, an illegal practice known as “tying”.This is the latest in a spate of complaints against the US technology company on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, competition officials at the European Commission started to look at IBM’s mainframe activities several years ago, following objections from a small technology company called PSI.PSI was subsequently bought out by IBM but a second complaint from another smaller rival of IBM’s, called T3 Technologies, followed in January last year. Microsoft, one of IBM’s big rivals, made investments in both PSI and T3 at various stages.Meanwhile, in the US, the Department of Justice started a preliminary investigation into IBM’s dominance of the mainframe computer market last autumn, sending out requests for information. This appeared to be triggered, at least in part, by a complaint from the Computer and Communications Industry Association, an industry group that includes some large IT companies such as Google and Microsoft, as well as much smaller groups.The US complaint was said to be somewhat broader than the two original complaints in Europe, for example, citing T3’s experiences but also making allegations about IBM’s behaviour towards Hercules, an open-source product designed to enable IBM’s systems to run on Intel and AMD-based servers and personal computers.The complainant, TurboHercules, was set up last year to commercialise Hercules’s open-source “emulation” software – which includes disaster recovery products that protect customers’ data if there is a mainframe failure.The French company claims to have asked IBM to license its mainframe operating systems to customers for use with Hercules – but says it was accused of patent infringement in reply.When asked to comment on the TurboHercules complaint, IBM said: “We have not been notified of this complaint and are thus unable to comment.”Roger Bowler, TurboHercules’s founder, said his company was “by no means anti-IBM”.In its complaint to the commission, TurboHercules is asking competition officials to order IBM to end the alleged tying and make available its interfaces and protocols.
187;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel’s Joy of Six;;A year after launching its “awesomely spectacular” four-core Xeon 5500 server processor, Intel is coming out with its six-core successor, the 5600.Its debut today represents the beginning of a new battle with Advanced Micro Devices over “volume servers” – a key market segment where the bulk of server chips are sold for systems that run applications and processes in data centres and company IT departments.Intel and AMD will also be clashing over higher-end servers – Intel plans to introduce eight-core Nehalem-EX processors by the end of the month to compete with AMD’s eight- and 12-core “Magny-Cours” processors.Both companies can smell the blood of IT managers looking to upgrade their servers to new ones that can pay for themselves in energy, warranty and software savings in a matter of months.As well as two extra cores or brains, the 5600s improve on their predecessors by using smaller, more efficient 32-nanometre circuitry (codenamed Westmere), rather than 45nm.Boyd Davis (pictured), head of marketing at Intel’s Server Platforms Group, told me 15 old single-core servers could be replaced with just one Xeon 5600-based server to give the same performance and it would pay for itself in as little as five months.“About a third of the installed base is still those old single core servers,” he said.“If an organisation has 50 of those old single core servers and it replaces them with three Xeon 5600-based servers, it can save $10,000 a month, so it really is a very strong economic value proposition to get rid of the old infrastructure.”New applications driving purchases include web services, which operate in the “cloud” on remote servers, and virtualisation, where computing tasks are handled by pools of servers configured dynamically as virtual machines.The 5600 series also promises better security and faster processing with the handling of advanced encryption on the chip.The Gartner research firm predicted last month that worldwide server shipments would grow in the middle to high single digits this year after a 17 per cent fall in 2009.IDC reported a 19 per cent decline to 6.6m units, but said volume servers experienced the sharpest rebound in the improving fourth quarter, with 10 per cent revenue growth.IDC said there had a been a once-in-a-decade market inflection in the fourth quarter.“Customers are actively re-evaluating their IT needs and refreshing their infrastructures,” it said.Hence, increased competion between Intel and AMD, with the latter addressing volume servers with two different platforms compared to Intel’s single approach.“AMD has the right strategy to capitalise on the rebounding server market by offering targeted platforms for the high end and low end of the volume market,” says Pat Patla, general manager of AMD’s Server and Embedded Division.“We are able to offer extreme performance scalability in one platform, while delivering cost efficiency and unrivalled power efficiency in the other.”
188;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-03-03T17:14:28Z;Atic gets ready for chip challenge;Abu Dhabi company enters toughest of markets;On the wall of Ibrahim Ajami’s office in Abu Dhabi, a web of geometric patterns cut into what looks like a bronze-gold disc is set in a dark wood frame. But, rather than a piece of modern art or a vinyl record, the object is a wafer, a slice of pure silicon semiconductor material worth about $6,000, which is at the centre of Mr Ajami’s ambitions.A pristine wafer, made up of integrated circuits, is the end product of the semi-conductor industry. A 300 millimetre wafer may contain 200 dies and each die may contain up to 2,000m transistors.Produced in conditions 100,000 times cleaner than a medical operating theatre (see picture) by tools that cost up to $600m apiece, each wafer takes about three months to manufacture.Mr Ajami is chief executive of Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Investment Company, or Atic. If anything illustrates the scale of Abu Dhabi’s high-tech manufacturing ambitions it is the fact that Atic made not one, but two multibillion-dollar acquisitions last year. It thereby joined a select band of companies with the scale and the pockets to compete in the cutting-edge contract chip industry.Atic invested $1.4bn in a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices of the US to spin off its manufacturing arm into a new company called Globalfoundries. AMD had suffered nine consecutive quarters of losses and rising debts as it tried to keep up with Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.Then, in September, Atic paid $1.8bn for a majority stake in Chartered Semiconductor of Singapore. Contract chipmakers make wafers to the designs of other manufacturers and Chartered was the world’s third-biggest. Including debt and convertible preference shares, the deal was worth about $3.9bn.“For the next three years we’re going to invest whatever it takes to build this company up,” Mr Ajami. “I want to make sure that Globalfoundries grows faster than any other global foundry [chip manufacturing] company in the world.”Mr Ajami’s financial targets are simply revenues – “top line in year one and top line in year two”, as he puts it.“The core theme of the Chartered acquisition was really customers, and it is really the driving force behind that acquisition,” he says.Analysts see the Chartered deal as a move to ensure that Globalfoundries has access to customers when new capacity being built in facilities in New York and Dresden comes on stream. The deal also gives Atic exposure to growth in Asia, which Globalfoundries lacked given it had factories only in Europe and the US, say analysts.Atic itself was spun out of Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment vehicle, in 2008. Mubadala retains a 19.3 per cent stake in AMD.Abu Dhabi’s rulers have given a team of technocrats the task of diversifying the emirate’s revenues away from oil and gas. Aerospace, renewables and high-tech engineering, among others, have been identified as industries of the future that will provide skilled, well-paid jobs for UAE nationals in a “knowledge economy”.Every month, Mr Ajami flies to Singapore, Dresden, New York and San Francisco to visit Atic subsidiaries. “It’s tough . . . We have conference calls late at night a lot and we have conference calls early in the morning . It’s a truly global company. It’s the biggest management challenge.”It is not just geography that is a problem. Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund from which Atic bought its stake, spent 22 years trying to make money out of Chartered.Analysts say Singapore’s disposal of its shares was a recognition that it had failed to build a world-class company. Semiconductors are all about the scale needed to cover research and development costs and huge investment in manufacturing facilities.Chinese companies have tried to enter the business, but failed to make money. Only Taiwan, home to United Microelectronics Corporation and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing International Company, has succeeded. TSMC, which has a market share of 49 per cent according to iSuppli, is the clear industry leader and plans capital expenditure of $5bn this year alone.Atic is responding by building a $4.5bn manufacturing facility in Saratoga, New York, which is due to be finished in 2012. It is expanding a similar facility in Dresden from 25,000 wafers a month to 60,000, at a cost of $3bn. It is also expanding its plants in Singapore. Managers expect that, with the Atic investments, Globalfoundries will roughly double its capacity in 300mm wafer production.But even TSMC has said that it is worried about falling margins.“If you are well positioned in the market place then actually you can generate the kind of returns [you want]. The problem is only very few companies do it,” says Mr Ajami.“I think they [TSMC] are going to be around and they’re going to do very well, but I think the market is ready for another significant player. I think customers have indicated that very clearly to us,” Mr Ajami says. “It’s not a volume game, it’s really a whole evolving dynamic between capacity and prices and technology leadership.”
189;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Europe keeps a close eye on US;;That European antitrust regulators scrutinise the activities of large US companies is hardly remarkable: Europe is a big market and many US companies have global reach. More surprising, perhaps, is that they have, on occasion, taken a harder line than their US regulatory counterparts.Such scenarios are rare, but four cases stand out over the past 15 years.In 1997, Seattle-based Boeing wanted to take over rival aerospace manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, a $16bn deal which had the backing of the Pentagon and was approved unconditionally by the US Federal Trade Commission. But it ran into problems with the then-EU competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, and was only cleared when Boeing offered some 11th-hour concessions.Three years later, General Electric tried to take over Honeywell, an engineering-based conglomerate. The $41bn deal was given conditional approval by the US authorities, but it was opposed by Mario Monti, who had succeeded Mr Van Miert as Europe’s top competition watchdog. His concerns centred on the aerospace and aviation electronics operations, and this time potential remedies could not be found. GE walked away from the deal, as senior US officials lashed out at Brussels.Microsoft has faced regulatory problems in several jurisdictions, including the US. But the software group’s tussle with Brussels was particularly tortuous, starting with a complaint lodged by Sun Microsystems in 1998 and effectively only ending last December. During the intervening period, EU officials looked at inter-operability issues – how Microsoft’s products work with those of other companies – and at the “tying” of Windows Media Player and the Internet Explorer browser with the Windows operating system.Brussels’s first investigation led to Microsoft being fined €497m ($671m) for abuse of a dominant position in 2004. But the commission subsequently claimed the software group had failed to comply with its ruling, leading to further fines topping €1bn. These are still under appeal.The subsequent pursuit of claims that the company was illegally bundling its IE browser with Windows had a more constructive outcome. Last year, Microsoft offered to provide PC users with a screen within the Windows software which would allow them to choose between a dozen rival browsers, to be offered in random order.The proposal, which took the form of legally binding commitments formed after input from competing browser companies, was finally accepted by EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in December. The deal is being implemented: Microsoft has been testing the proposal, and could start rolling it out across Europe next week.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s smaller competitor, first brought a complaint about the world’s biggest chipmaker to Brussels in 2000. After raids in 2005, the commission formally accused Intel in 2008 of trying to do deals with computer manufacturers to push AMD out of the central processing unit business.There were further raids later that year, and the charges were expanded to allege that rebates had also been used illegally to persuade a big electronics retailer to sell Intel-based PCs only. In May last year, Ms Kroes imposed a €1.06bn fine on Intel for abusing its dominant position – the largest single penalty to be levied on any company for antitrust abuses in Europe. Intel is appealing.The EU action followed adverse findings by regulators in Japan and South Korea. But it was only in 2008 that New York’s attorney-general launched an antitrust investigation into the company’s activities, while the Federal Trade Commission finally lodged a complaint – involving allegations which were similar to the EU’s, although broader – last December. Intel, meanwhile, paid a further $1.25bn to settle a private antitrust action lawsuit brought against it by AMD.
190;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-01-28T08:47:34Z;TSMC plans record $4.8bn investment;;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, plans to invest a record $4.8bn this year to expand advanced chipmaking capacity.Morris Chang, founder and chief executive, said the investment – the most TSMC has spent in one year – would allow it to consolidate its leadership both in terms of market share and technological capabilities.“We do not expect a situation where capacity will exceed demand, nor do I expect there to be a price war” in chips made using those technologies, he said.TSMC commands roughly half of the worldwide contract chipmaking market and its clients hail from nearly the full spectrum of digital products.Its heavy capital investment is therefore seen as a vote of confidence in the continued recovery of the broader technology and consumer electronics industry.It is also a challenge to Globalfoundries, the new contract chipmaker spun off from AMD and backed by Abu Dhabi. Globalfoundries, which is building an advanced chip factory in New York state and last September acquired Singapore-based Chartered Semiconductor for $3.9bn, has likewise said it wanted to focus on cutting-edge technologies.TSMC posted some of its strongest quarterly results since the financial crisis on Thursday – net profit reached T$32.7bn ($102m), 7 per cent higher than the previous quarter.“We are near to or at 100 per cent utilisation across the board, even for 0.5 microns, which is 13-year-old technology …TSMC's outlook for 2010 is very good,” the company said.The results are a far cry from a year ago, when TSMC posted its biggest profit decline in seven years and placed part of its staff on no-pay leave because it was not getting enough orders for its factories.Mr Chang said, however, that much of the recovery in the worldwide semiconductor industry this year would be driven by memory chipmakers. These companies include South Korea's Samsung, the world's biggest memory chipmaker, and Japan's Elpida, which on Thursday posted its first quarterly net profit in more than two years.Elpida, which makes dynamic random access memory chips, posted a Y21bn ($233m) net profit for the company's third fiscal quarter and said sales were partly driven by consumers upgrading their computers after Microsoft launched Windows 7, its latest operating system.Yasuo Shirai, chief financial officer, said he expected D-ram chip prices to remain relatively stable this year. This is despite a strong recovery in D-ram prices towards the end of last year.Elpida also said it planned to invest $30m to $50m to set up a research and development centre at Rexchip, it's Taiwan subsidiary.
191;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;New Castle founder pleads guilty to insider trading;;Mark Kurland, founder of a former Bear Stearns hedge fund called New Castle, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to insider trading charges, widening the group of conspirators who have acknowledged roles in the Galleon hedge fund case.Mr Kurland pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit insider trading and to securities fraud and could face up to 25 years in prison. He is the eighth person to plead guilty in the case against Raj Rajaratnam’s Galleon fund but does not plan to co-operate with authorities, according to his attorney, Peter Smith.“I received the information and traded on it,” said Mr Kurland.Prosecutors accused Mr Kurland of conspiring to execute trades based on non-public information about AMD, Akamai Technologies and Sun Microsystems. At New Castle, Kurland was the supervisor of Danielle Chiesi. Ms Chiesi and Mr Rajaratnam maintain their innocence.Appearing before Judge Ronald Ellis, Mr Kurland said that between August 2008 and January 2009 he agreed with others to receive confidential information about AMD and make trades based on that information. As part of his plea agreement, Mr Kurland said he will forfeit $900,000, which represents the proceeds from his illegal trades.Authorities have been aggressively pursuing anyone who might have been involved with what has been described as the largest hedge fund insider trading case in history.On Monday, lawyers representing the US attorney’s office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Mr Rajaratnam wrangled over whether the SEC could have access to wiretap transcripts for its civil case that the US attorney is using in the criminal case.Seven defendants were last week formally indicted for allegedly taking part in the insider trading scheme. The case has ensnared top executives at some of the biggest and most prominent companies in the US.Mr Kurland’s plea agreement recommends a prison sentence of 30 to 37 months. He is set to be sentenced in April.

Bank of America was 3.7 per cent lower at $14.90.JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest bank by assets, initially opened higher after analysts at Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”, saying the new regulations would have a limited impact on the bank. However, the shares were later down 3.4 per cent at $39.16. Citigroup itselfonly lost 0.6 per cent to $3.25.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Reaction to moves by the US government to increase regulation in the banking sector has been mixed with regional banks rallying and larger banks under pressure, which suggests that this move could alter the competitive landscape in that sector.”The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to close near its lowest point of the day at 1,091.76, suffering greater losses than Thursday’s session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent to 10,172.98 and the Nasdaq fell 2.7 per cent to 2,205.29. The benchmark index is now showing a loss for 2010, having fallen 2.1 per cent since the start of January.Wall Street also found itself at the mercy of Washington earlier in the week after a shake-up in the Senate prompted a rally among healthcare stocks. Republican Scott Brown’s surprising win in Massachusetts deprived the Democrats of their 60-seat “super-majority”, which could thwart plans to reform the healthcare system.While the Republican victory was widely considered a bullish sign for the market, investors’ attention quickly turned to China.The S&P 500 materials sector had its worst week since October last year after China’s move to tighten monetary policy raised concerns over global demand for commodities. Analysts at Goldman put further pressure on the materials index on Friday after downgrading the US metal and steel sector to “neutral” from “attractive”. United States Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $55 and Alcoa lost 6 per cent to $13.40.Over the week, which was curtailed due to the national holiday on Monday, the S&P 500 was down 3.9 per cent, the Dow had lost 4.1 per cent and the Nasdaq was 3.6 per cent lower. The Vix index, which tracks the market’s volatility via option prices and is known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, surged 25 per cent.The technology sector added to the market’s losses on Friday. Google fell 5.7 per cent to $550.01 after reporting disappointing quarterly revenue growth.Advanced Micro Devices, the second-largest maker of personal computer processors, led the S&P 500 lower for most of the session. Although the company beat both quarterly profit and revenue estimates, analysts feared growth in PC-related stocks was peaking. AMD shares, which had doubled over the past 10 weeks, slid 12.4 per cent to $7.88.Meanwhile, positive signs from corporate America’s heavyweights were largely overshadowed.General Electric edged 0.6 per cent higher to $16.11 after the conglomerate posted a higher quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset weak demand for industrial equipment, it said.McDonald’s also beat quarterly profit estimates, sending shares in the fast-food chain 0.3 per cent higher to $63.39. But demand was still weak in its US home market due to high levels of unemployment. The stock was the only Dow component to finish higher on Thursday as investors dumped their holdings in the wake of Mr Obama’s address.
193;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-01-14T23:28:57Z;Intel results boost technology sector;;Intel gave a boost to the technology sector on Thursday, predicting a better year after fourth-quarter growth in sales of its chips was almost double the norm.The chipmaker beat analysts’ expectations with profits of $2.3bn, 875 per cent higher than a year ago, when Intel made $234m in the teeth of the recession and a failing order book.Intel’s microprocessors are used in four out of every five computers sold and its strong “holiday” quarter augurs well for PC makers, software companies and other chipmakers at the start of the US tech earnings season.“The fourth quarter was a strong ending to a year with a difficult beginning,” said Stacy Smith, chief financial officer.“We have seen a return of consumer demand and replenishment to normal inventory levels after the precipitous demand drop at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009.”Sales worth $10.6bn were up 13 per cent on the third quarter, nearly twice the average seasonal growth and ahead of the analysts’ consensus of $10.2bn by Thomson Reuters.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said the results had been made possible by “unprecedented operating efficiencies”.Intel, which has led other chipmakers in moving to new degrees of miniaturisation, introduced chips with circuit widths narrowing from 45 to 32 billionths of a metre at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week.“The demand picture in the quarter reflected broad-based strength across all regions and all product categories, with notebooks leading the way,” he told analysts.Intel beat analysts’ expectations for the current quarter with its forecasts. It predicted revenues of about $9.7bn compared with a consensus of $9.34bn by Bloomberg. For 2010, it forecast that gross margins would rise to about 61 per cent, five percentage points up on 2009.Last year was marked by a $1.45bn fine levied by the European Commission and a $1.25bn settlement with rival Advanced Micro Devices.
194;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Former McKinsey tipster netted $2.6m;;Former McKinsey director Anil Kumar on Thursday agreed to forfeit $2.6m prosecutors said he received for passing along confidential tips to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon hedge fund founder accused of masterminding a vast insider trading scheme.The agreement came as Mr Kumar became the seventh person to plead guilty in the case. Prosecutors said that he was initially approached by Mr Rajaratnam in late 2003 or early 2004 and offered $500,000 a year to provide information about companies that he had access to through McKinsey.The funds were allegedly paid by Mr Rajaratnam and were deposited for Mr Kumar in a Swiss bank account. Some of the money was reinvested for Mr Kumar through an account with Galleon, prosecutors said. He was paid $1.75m directly and earned a total of $2.6m through his involvement with the alleged Galleon scheme.A visibly emotional Mr Kumar, appearing before Judge Denny Chin, “profusely” apologised to his colleagues and friends for the “shame and embarrassment they suffered”.Mr Kumar, who was accused of passing on information about Advanced Micro Devices, a company he advised while at McKinsey, was part of the first group of people to be charged in the insider trading investigation, which has ensnared top executives across corporate America since the first arrests were made in October.Prosecutors said that one of Mr Kumar’s most profitable tips related to AMD’s 2006 acquisition of ATI Technologies. The information netted Galleon $19m and prosecutors said that after the deal Mr Rajaratnam called Mr Kumar a “hero”.Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer, John Dowd, has denied that his client paid for information relating to that deal, arguing that he had used public information.“Raj Rajaratnam did not make payments to Mr Kumar or anyone else in return for providing inside information,” Mr Dowd said.Mr Rajaratnam has been accused of making $36m in illicit profits through the scheme. A total of 21 people have been accused in the case and the investigation is ongoing. Mr Rajaratnam has maintained his innocence.By pleading guilty to securities fraud and to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, Mr Kumar faces up to 25 years in prison. On Wednesday he signed a plea agreement that he knowingly joined the scheme and did something that was illegal. Under the deal he also agreed to forfeit the $2.6m.Robert Morvillo, Mr Kumar’s attorney, told the court that his client would work with law enforcement officials “in an attempt to rectify the consequences of his conduct”.“He is pained by the fact that he has embarrassed and let down his colleagues at McKinsey, all of whom have always treated him kindly and generously,” Mr Morvillo said. “He apologises to all he has hurt and greatly regrets his lapse of judgment.”
195;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-01-07T08:49:57Z;Kumar to appear in court in Galleon case;;The former McKinsey director accused of passing on confidential information in the extensive Galleon hedge fund insider trading case is expected to appear in federal court on Thursday, less than a week after indicating he may enter a possible guilty plea.Anil Kumar, who allegedly leaked information to Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire founder of Galleon, indicated last week he may waive his right to an indictment, thus enabling prosecutors to file charges against him without presenting evidence to a grand jury.In court filings last week, prosecutors said they would file an “information” document spelling out charges against Mr Kumar upon his waiver of indictment, a move that some legal experts say suggests he may plead guilty and may be co-operating with the government.However, there was no indication on Wednesday of how he may plead or whether there was a co-operation agreement. A “proceeding of interest” for Mr Kumar, who has previously denied all charges, is scheduled for Thursday. Mr Kumar’s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday and the Manhattan US attorney’s office declined to comment.Mr Kumar, who was accused of passing on information about Advanced Micro Devices, a company he advised while at McKinsey, was among the first to be charged in the insider trading investigation, which has ensnared top executives across corporate America since the the first arrests were made in October.Mr Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns employee, were the first to be formally charged last month in a 17-count indictment, including multiple counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. Both of them have pleaded innocent. A total of 21 people have been accused in the case so far. Six of them have pleaded guilty and are co-operating witnesses for the government. The others have denied wrongdoing.The investigation appears to be gathering pace. On Tuesday, US prosecutors said they planned to expand criminal charges against Mr Rajaratnam, alleging he made at least $36m in illicit profits – more than twice the amount originally alleged – and that in 2006, he obtained confidential information about AMD’s acquisition of ATI Technologies and paid for the information.John Dowd, Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer, denied that his client paid a source for information on the ATI deal, adding that information about an acquisition of ATI by AMD was public before the announcement in July.“An analyst’s prediction that AMD would acquire ATI was widely reported in the press more than seven weeks before the acquisition was announced,” he said.
196;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2010-01-06T00:42:51Z;Galleon founder faces more US charges;;US prosecutors said on Tuesday they planned to expand the insider trading charges against Raj Rajaratnam, and accuse the billionaire founder of the Galleon hedge fund group of making at least $36m in illicit profits – more than twice the amount originally alleged.The new claims were made in court documents filed by prosecutors in opposition to Mr Rajaratnam’s second request to reduce his $100m bail bond. Indicted last month in one of the biggest insider trading cases in history, he has denied any wrongdoing.Mr Rajaratnam was previously accused of making about $17m from trading on inside information about high-profile companies such as Google, Hilton, Marvel Technology Group and Advanced Micro Devices. On Tuesday, prosecutors claimed they had new evidence of improper trading.Prosecutors alleged that between March and July 2006, Mr Rajaratnam obtained non-public information about AMD’s acquisition of ATI Technologies “from an inside source to whom Rajaratnam had begun making large payments in exchange for insider information in or about 2004”.Trading by Galleon ahead of ATI’s acquisition allegedly reaped at least $19m. Prosecutors said they planned to file a new indictment that would expand the charges against Mr Rajaratnam to include that acquisition “as well as other instances of illegal insider trading”. His lawyer declined to comment.The new allegations come about two weeks after US prosecutors asked a federal judge to schedule the criminal trial against Mr Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi – a former Bear Stearns employee, who was also indicted last month – for June or July.The parallel civil case brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission is already scheduled for August in front of a different judge.Ms Chiesi and Mr Rajaratnam, who have both pleaded not guilty, are the only individuals to be formally indicted so far. US prosecutors have not yet filed indictments against four other people who were originally accused in the case along with them.Last week, prosecutors revealed that they planned to file an “information” document spelling out charges against Anil Kumar – a former McKinsey director accused of passing inside information on AMD, a company he advised, to Mr Rajaratnam – once they had obtained a “waiver of indictment” from him.This would enable charges to be filed without prosecutors presenting evidence to a grand jury and some legal experts say it could indicate a deal with prosecutors.Mr Kumar’s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment. Mr Kumar has previously emphatically denied all charges.A hearing about Mr Rajaratnam’s bail is scheduled to take place on Friday this week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned negative, losing 0.1 per cent to 10,441.12 and the Nasdaq was up 0.3 per cent to 2,206.91.“We were struck by the fact that they acknowledged we’re moving towards improvement and their emphasis on the short-term facilities that are going to expire,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “The message for the markets seems to be that the easiest of times are over.”The European Commission ended a decade-long battle with Microsoft, accepting the software maker’s offer to allow European computer users to choose rival internet browsers. Microsoft edged 0.3 per cent higher to $30.10.Intel dropped 2.1 per cent to $19.38 after the US Federal Trade Commission said it would sue the world’s largest computer chip maker for abusing its market position for a decade. Intel futures had risen before the announcement because Citigroup had added the Dow component to its top picks list.AMD, one of Intel’s key rivals, rose on the news, gaining 3.7 per cent to $9.15.Meanwhile, Citigroup shareholders’ losses deepened in spite of a broad-based rally among financials. The shares fell 3.1 per cent to $3.44 after the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority filed an arbitration claim against the bank, accusing it of misleading it over a $7.5bn investment in Citi. The stock is already down 12.7 per cent this week after news of its capital raising.Elsewhere in the sector, Charles Schwab pushed 4.2 per cent higher to $18.07 after the brokerage was raised from “hold” to “buy” at Deutsche Bank and rated “overweight” at Morgan Stanley.Keybanc raised its rating on United States Steel from “hold” to “buy”, lifting the shares 2.9 per cent to $49.67. The optimism did not significantly boost the rest of the industry, however, and AK Steel was only up 0.5 per cent to $20.74.AAR, the aircraft parts and maintenance group, added to the market’s early optimism. The shares, which have risen about 35 per cent this year, were up 18.2 per cent to $24.85. The group reported a higher profit for the second quarter than analysts had been expecting, mainly due to cost cuts.Carnival, the biggest cruise-line operator, was raised from “neutral” to “overweight” by JPMorgan Chase, sending the group’s shares up in early trading. However, they were later down 0.2 per cent to $33.82.The bank also upgraded Royal Caribbean Cruises, the industry’s second-biggest player, from “neutral” to “overweight”, lifting the shares 3.7 per cent to $26.89. Analysts said that they believed consumer confidence would continue to improve next year, prompting more people to head to sea for their holidays.Adobe Systems provided further evidence that consumer demand was increasing. The world’s largest maker of graphic-design programs gained 4.1 per cent to $37.86 after reporting a higher profit than had been expected. But job cuts were also one of the main reasons for the company’s improved bottom line.Borders Group announced it would team up with Kobo to sell digital versions of its books online. The move by the loss-making group follows similar forays by Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble into the digital books market. Borders shares were down 3.3 at $1.19.Playboy slid 9.9 per cent to $3.46, after plunging more than 20 per cent, following a Bloomberg report that Iconix Brand Group had broken off takeover talks with the company.
198;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-12-16T19:50:30Z;US trade body sues Intel over alleged abuses;;The US Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sued Intel, accusing the world’s biggest chipmaker of abusing its dominant market position over the past decade.The FTC’s action follows similar complaints by regulators in Europe, Japan and Korea. But the US regulator’s allegations against Intel are broader – it also alleges more recent anti-competitive behaviour in the graphics chip market.“Intel has engaged in a deliberate campaign to hamstring competitive threats to its monopoly,” said Richard Feinstein, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. The FTC said it would it was bringing the case to force Intel to modify its conduct and was not seeking monetary damages.“The FTC’s case is misguided. It is based largely on claims that the FTC added at the last minute and has not investigated,” Intel said.Doug Melamed, Intel general counsel, added: “This case could have, and should have, been settled. Settlement talks had progressed very far but stalled when the FTC insisted on unprecedented remedies – including the restrictions on lawful price competition.”“The FTC’s rush to file this case will cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars to litigate issues that the FTC has not fully investigated.”The FTC’s complaint comes a month after Andrew Cuomo, New York’s attorney-general sued Intel alleging it used “bribery and coercion” to maintain its dominant market position.The FTC said its case was likely to be heard before an administrative law judge in September 2010. It said it was seeking an order that would prevent Intel from using “threats, bundled prices or other offers to . . . hamper competition”.The FTC complaint mirrors those of other regulators around the world, alleging that Intel used “threats and rewards” aimed at PC makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM to coerce them not to buy PC microprocessors (CPUs) from its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices.It also alleges Intel secretly redesigned key software so as to stunt the performance of rivals’ chips that were licensing its “x86” microprocessor design.Last week, Intel settled a civil action brought by AMD over the same issue by paying its rival $1.25bn. AMD said a new five-year cross-licensing deal with Intel would allow it to compete on a level playing field.But the FTC complaint also alleges that Intel is repeating in graphics processing units (GPUs) its tactic of slowing down competitors so it can catch up.“There also is a dangerous probability that Intel’s unfair methods of competition could allow it to extend its monopoly into the GPU chip markets,” the FTC said. The complaint mentions graphics chipmaker Nvidia, which has accused Intel of unfair pricing policies. “We applaud today’s action by the US Federal Trade Commission,” Nvidia said in a statement.“We are particularly pleased to see scrutiny being placed on Intel’s behaviour toward GPUs, which have become an increasingly important part of the PC industry.”Intel appealed in September against a record €1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine imposed by the European Commission for abusing its dominant market position. The South Korean FTC has also fined the chipmaker while an investigation by its Japanese counterpart was settled without a fine.

It is the only one to be returned so far in the case, which widened in recent weeks to include 21 people. US prosecutors have until Wednesday to decide whether to obtain indictments for at least four other people accused in the case or ask a judge for a 30-day postponement.“Mr Rajaratnam is innocent and looks forward to his day in court when a jury of his fellow citizens will examine and evaluate all of the evidence,” said Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer, John Dowd. Ms Chiesi “intends to plead not guilty and fight the case vigorously”, said her lawyer, Alan Kaufman.Tuesday’s indictment contained 17 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy against Mr Rajaratnam and Ms Chiesi. It seeks to recover at least $20.8m in profits allegedly made in the scheme.Prosecutors used court-authorised wiretaps of telephone conversations and co-operating witnesses to build their case, the biggest insider trading case involving hedge funds. Six of the people who have been charged have pleaded guilty and are co-operating witnesses for the government. All the others accused have denied wrongdoing.Roomy Khan, a former employee at Intel and a co-operating witnesses, appears to be a central figure in the case against Mr Rajaratnam, based on court documents. In exchange for inside information Mr Rajaratnam allegedly received from Ms Khan, he allegedly provided her with inside information on a number of companies.Tuesday’s indictment contained details about an instant message Ms Khan allegedly sent to Mr Rajaratnam regarding shares in Polycom. On January 9 2006, she wrote: “donot [sic] buy plcm till i het [sic] guidance; want to make sure guidance OK,” according to the indictment, which alleged that Mr Rajaratnam directed his hedge fund to buy about 60,000 shares in the company three days later.Additional reporting by Stacy-Marie Ishmael in New York"
200;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-12-07T01:45:47Z;Intel abandons graphics card launch;;Intel has suffered a major setback in its attempt to expand its world-leading chipmaking business into high-end graphics.The semiconductor maker has announced it is abandoning its efforts to launch a graphics card based on a new multi-core chip codenamed Larrabee.The Silicon Valley company said Larrabee would be relegated to being used as a software development platform for internal and external use.This represents a rare failure for Intel, which has maintained relentless progress in development of microprocessors at the heart of four out of every five PCs sold.It has maintained the pace of its “tick-tock” two-year road map for CPUs (central processing units) for most of the decade – a “tick” year where it shrinks the size of its chips is followed by a “tock” year where it redesigns their architecture.But in GPUs (graphics processing units), Intel has failed to match rivals AMD and Nvidia in producing high-end chips.It is the traditional leader in producing basic graphics chips integrated into PC motherboards, but has failed to master parallel processing in order to produce the more powerful “discrete” plug-in cards of its competitors.“Project Larrabee” was announced in April 2007 as a multi-core chip that would be capable of super-fast teraflop performance – a trillion floating point operations per second.But it has been constantly delayed and executives had been vague in comments about its progress.On Friday, Intel spokesman Nick Knupfler said: “Larrabee silicon and software development are behind where we hoped to be at this point in the project.“As a result, our first Larrabee product will not be launched as a standalone discrete graphics product. We remain committed to delivering world-class many-core graphics products to our customers.”The news will be welcomed by the smaller Silicon Valley competitors Nvidia and AMD.AMD burdened itself with debt in buying the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI in 2006 for $5.4bn in order to specialise in the technology.It will now feel it has a significant lead over Intel in the eventual goal of chipmakers to fuse CPUs and GPUs into one multi-core processor.

Semiconductor groups have rapidly replenished their inventories as the economy recovers but sales of computers, which fuel 40 per cent of the industry’s production, are still sluggish.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s largest rival, fell 3.7 per cent to $7.05 and ON Semiconductor lost 4.7 per cent to $7.86.Lower commodity prices also dragged down energy and materials stocks. US Steel lost 3.4 per cent to $41.28 and Peabody Energy was down 1.6 per cent at $45.96.The S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 1,094.90 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to 10,332.44. The Nasdaq dropped 1.7 per cent – its biggest daily fall for over two weeks – to 2,156.82.The Mortgage Bankers Association also knocked investor confidence after it revealed that mortgage delinquency rates during the third quarter were at the highest level since records began more than three decades ago.Shares in KB Home, the Los Angeles homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, dropped 1.8 per cent to $14.62, while Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, lost 0.7 per cent to $20.51.Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “You get a couple of disappointing numbers like this and it’s very easy for the weak hands to use it as an opportunity to lock in some profits and move to the sidelines until they get some more direction.”Higher commodity prices pushed US stocks to 13-month highs at the beginning of the week. “From a psychological viewpoint the downgrades are not helpful and we’ve also had some disappointing economic data over the last few days,” he said.Cautious outlooks from retailers also weighed on the market.Hot Topic, the clothing and music chain that caters to teenagers, slumped 13 per cent to $5.80 after its fourth-quarter profit forecast missed analyst estimates. The retailer said it expected a “high single-digit decline” in like-for-like sales over the fourth quarter, which includes the crucial holiday season. Sales only fell 5 per cent over the third quarter.Dick’s Sporting Goods posted third-quarter results above estimates. But the chain, which sells items such as cheerleader outfits and golf clubs, said it had seen an early rush for cold weather products in the third quarter. As a result, Dick’s said its fourth quarter sales would suffer and would be lower than estimates, sending the shares down 9.3 per cent to $22.52.Shares in Gymboree, the children’s clothing retailer, fell in early trading after the company forecast fourth-quarter profits below estimates but closed 0.9 per cent higher at $41.34.Sears, the third-largest US retailer, reported a smaller third-quarter loss than expected. Greater demand for toys, shoes and goods for the home prompted the first sales rise at Kmart, its discount chain, since 2005. But sales still fell across the group and the retailer said the improvement in its operating results was mainly a result of cost-cutting. It fell 3.7 per cent to $72.95.Williams-Sonoma, which sells goods for the home, beat third-quarter estimates after cost-cutting measures paid off. Its shares rose
5 per cent to $22.08.A series of deals did nothing to lift market confidence. JPMorgan Chase announced a $3.4bn deal to buy Cazenove, the UK stockbroker with which it has had a joint venture for the past five years. Shares in JPMorgan, the second-largest US bank by assets, lost 1.9 per cent to $42.55.Pinnacle Foods Group, which is owned by Blackstone Group, agreed to buy Birds Eye Foods, the largest US frozen-vegetable company, for $1.3bn. Blackstone lost 1.7 per cent to $15.28."
202;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:58:28+0000;Ombudsman raps EU probe after Intel claim;;European competition officials have been rapped for failing to properly record a meeting with an executive of computer maker Dell during the course of their long investigation into antitrust abuses by Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker.But the European Ombudsman, who has been looking into the way the case was handled following a complaint from Intel last year, did not make any finding as to whether the European Commission’s conduct had infringed Intel’s rights of defence.The ombudsman, Nikiforos Diamandouros, also dismissed Intel’s second allegation – namely that there was maladministration in the way the commission encouraged Dell to enter into an information exchange agreement with Advanced Micro Devices.AMD competes with Intel and had originally complained to the commission about its larger rival’s business practices.After a 10-year investigation, the commission found, in May this year, that Intel had abused its dominant market position and encouraged computer manufacturers to reject AMD products. It imposed a record-breaking €1.06bn ($1.58bn) fine on Intel.Intel is now appealing that decision and maintains it did not behave illegally. However, as other international regulators continued to probe the same matter, Intel agreed last week to pay AMD $1.25bn to settle a private damages claim which the smaller company had brought against it.Intel had submitted its complaint about the European Commission’s investigation to the European Ombudsman in July 2008. Its first claim was that officials had failed to take minutes of a meeting with a senior Dell executive two years earlier, which dealt with the Intel investigation.The ombudsman’s report, published on Wednesday, agreed that the commission did not make a proper note of the meeting and that its investigation file did not contain an agenda for the meeting.He concluded that this did amount to maladministration, but did not make any finding over whether Intel’s defence rights were infringed.He rejected Intel’s second charge of maladministration over the Dell-AMD information exchange agreement, which, Intel alleged, gave AMD accress to information in the commission’s investigation file.He did, however, find that the commission had failed to make a proper note of a telephone conversation with Dell, in which the information exchange agreement was discussed and recommended that, in future, proper notes should be made of any meetings or telephone calls with third parties concerning “important procedural issues”.
203;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-11-12T22:01:34Z;Sagging oil price drags on Wall Street;;Sinking oil prices dragged US stocks lower in choppy trading on Thursday, overshadowing a rush of deals and higher profit at Walmart.Investors also remained cautious after the previous session’s rally when Wall Street closed at its highest level since October last year. Data showing a steeper drop in claims for unemployment benefits for unemployment benefits than had been expected lifted confidence.But crude oil inventory readings, revealing a surprise increase in stockpiles, weighed on the market.After dipping in and out of the red in early trading, the S&P 500 declined steadily towards the end of the session, closing 1 per cent lower at 1,087.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to 10,197.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,149.02.“Every time the S&P has approached 1,100, it seems to hit a wall but one of these days it’s going to blow right through that number and may not look back for a while,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco Growth Fund. “There’s so much cash on the sidelines that people who have been missing the rally are beginning to panic.”Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, reported quarterly profit above expectations due to aggressive cost-cutting.The group also said it had gained market share in the US, the UK and Mexico.However, its forecast for the fourth quarter was at the lower end of analyst estimates. Its shares gained 0.5 per cent to $53.24.Kohl’s, the fourth-largest department store chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, lifting the company’s shares just 0.1 per cent to $54.64.Like Walmart, the retailer also gave a more cautious outlook for the imminent holiday period than Wall Street had been expecting.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, shares in Green Mountain Coffee fell 10 per cent to $68.35 after the Vermont-based roaster forecast first-quarter earnings below analyst estimates. However, the shares were still up more than 160 per cent from last year due, in part, to Walmart’s agreement to stock the brand and the continued appeal of premium coffee in the downturn.The technology sector gave one of the day’s best performances after a spurt of deal activity.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard announced that it had struck a deal to buy 3Com for $2.7bn in cash, presenting a significant challenge to its rival Cisco Systems.The acquisition is set to make HP, already the largest personal computer maker, a stronger player in Cisco’s core market of networking gear.HP shares lost 0.6 per cent to $49.70 while 3Com surged 31.1 per cent to $7.46. Meanwhile, Cisco slipped 2.2 per cent to $23.40.Reports had previously suggested HP would buy Brocade Communication Systems, another manufacturer of networking gear.News of the deal with 3Com prompted analysts to cut their ratings on Brocade, causing the shares to drop 12.7 per cent to $8.08.Chipmakers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to settle their long-running dispute over competitive and licensing issues.AMD shares surged 21.8 per cent to $6.48 and Intel was down 0.8 per cent at $19.68.Applied Materials, the largest company in the chipmaker industry, reported its first quarterly profit in a year due to an increase in orders. However, the group also said it plans to shed 1,500 jobs in a further effort to cut costs.The restructuring plan is expected to achieve total annualised cost savings of about $450m. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $12.82.Churchill Downs, owner of the horse racing track that hosts the Kentucky Derby, announced it would buy the online betting company Youbet.com in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $127m. Churchill shares lost 2.6 per cent to $30.76 while Youbet gained 11.6 per cent to $2.69.Shares in United Technologies lost 0.4 per cent to $66.70 after it said it would acquire General Electric’s security business for $1.82bn. General Electric shares edged 0.5 per cent lower to $15.75.
204;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-11-12T21:18:18Z;Intel and AMD settle antitrust dispute;;"Intel sought to quell a rising tide of complaints over its business practices as it agreed on Thursday to pay $1.25bn to settle a private antitrust lawsuit from rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.The settlement of the dispute between the two chip companies ends one of the longest-
running and most heated disagreements in US business.AMD, which is virtually Intel’s only rival in making the microprocessors used in PCs and many low-cost servers, has long complained that its much bigger rival uses unfair methods to prevent computer makers buying its chips.Those complaints, which Intel denies, have already led to regulatory action against the company in Japan, South Korea and the European Union, and last week brought a lawsuit from Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney-general. The new Federal Trade Commission, which has promised a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement than its predecessor, has also begun an investigation of its own.Legal experts warned that the settlement would do little to stop spreading regulatory action against Intel, the world’s biggest maker of microprocessors. Europe this year imposed a record €1.06bn ($1.57bn) fine on the company.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic signalled that, while they would look at the AMD settlement, the agreement would not change their own scrutiny of Intel’s behaviour.As part of the settlement, Intel said that it had undertaken not to engage in some of the practices it has been accused of by AMD and regulators. These include promising discounts to PC makers only if they refuse to buy chips from AMD or hold back the launch of machines carrying AMD products.Intel denied on Thursday that it had bullied AMD in this way, and said that it had only given the undertakings as a way to resolve the legal dispute. Paul Otellini, chief executive, also said it had agreed to the massive payment to reduce the risk of the court case, which might have led to a much bigger judgment, and said that Intel maintained it had done nothing wrong.Jon Leibowitz, the FTC’s chairman, said that while the agency would review the “private litigation”, he could not comment further given his own agency’s “ongoing independent investigation”.John Briggs, a Washington antitrust lawyer who formerly represented Intel, said: “The FTC has an incentive to go ahead and file a complaint if they were going to do so anyway – they are not going to settle their case because AMD is no longer a complaining party.”AMD shares rose 21.2 per cent to $6.45 by late afternoon in New York, while Intel stock was down 0.9 per cent at $19.66."
205;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Intel in trouble;;"When corporate giants wield their pricing power as a weapon to smash pygmies, consumers win – but only for a while. That is why regulators must be vigilant. This week, Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney general, filed an anti-trust complaint against Intel, following a case that has already led to regulatory action in Europe and Asia.The pricing discounts that suppliers like Intel give to large volume customers are welcome, even when those discounts reinforce the inherent advantages of a market leader in an industry which, like semiconductors, relies heavily on scale economies. But if price discounts are used as a predatory weapon, prompt action is essential.It is for the courts to draw that line, based on the facts of the case. But there are some obvious pointers. If volume discounts are made dependent on conditions that extend beyond the pure volume that a customer buys, that should raise a red flag. Mr Cuomo claims that, in Intel’s case, discounts were tied to the condition that PC makers did not buy chips from its smaller rival AMD.The court should examine the alleged all-or-nothing nature of Intel’s volume discounts; economic logic suggests that smaller discounts should be available on smaller volumes. According to Mr Cuomo, Intel cut off all discounts to those who turned to AMD. Intel has said it will defend itself against the allegations.Other factors will help to decide the case, such as whether Intel offered the same discounts to all customers, or used them selectively. If a court determines that it has crossed the line, heavy fines are the best deterrent. Persistent wrongdoing should result in closer regulatory supervision – for instance, requiring more transparency through the publishing of volume discounts. With Intel, matters have not reached that point yet.Some have argued for tighter restrictions, such as absolute limits to the discounts that a dominant company like Intel can apply. Price regulation, however, is a last resort justified only in cases of total market failure.If anything, the AMD example argues the opposite. It lacked its rival’s massive financial strength, but beat Intel in the race to the first generation of multi-core chips. Indeed, it was the desire of Dell and others to buy these more advanced chips that led Intel to wield its power in a way that watchdogs argue was too extreme. AMD’s experience is a reminder that tech innovators can flourish even against dominant rivals – but only if regulators remain alert."
206;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-11-05T09:09:51Z;Intel;;"The cause of plodding European bureaucrats has been joined by the fiery New York attorney-general Andrew Cuomo. On Wednesday he filed an antitrust lawsuit, which Intel will defend, alleging a systematic campaign of illegal conduct designed to protect the chipmaker’s dominance of the PC microprocessor market. Following a €1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine in May from the European Commission (which Intel is appealing against), and previous rulings in Japan and Korea, the company faces fresh scrutiny of its market power.Share prices for Intel and competitor Advanced Micro Devices barely reacted. The problem for AMD, which is set to face Intel in a Delaware courtroom in March, is that legal victories offer only consolation, and perhaps the chance of a pay-out to help pay down debt. The period when the company had a clear technological advantage and opportunity to make a dent in Intel’s market share of about 70 per cent has passed.Intel, which has $11bn of net cash sitting on its balance sheet, and outspends AMD on research by a factor of more than four, may be embarrassed by Mr Cuomo’s claims. But even if, as alleged, it is shown to have forced customers to guarantee market share levels in return for cash rebates, the structure of the industry will probably remain unchanged.Greater regulatory assertiveness, however, may prompt a subtle shift in the tech world. The expectation has traditionally been that size brings a persistent advantage that gradually moves each area of the industry toward one or two big companies. But Brussels may block Oracle’s takeover of Sun Microsystems; meanwhile Google’s deal with book authors has prompted scrutiny of the search company. As with the rest of the business world, tech must come to terms with ever more official meddling.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter"
207;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Legal challenges mount for Intel;;Years after first flaring up in Europe and Asia, the global antitrust cases against Intel are finally threatening to spiral out of control in its own back yard.New York attorney-general Andrew Cuomo’s complaint against the chipmaker, filed on Wednesday, follows a private antitrust suit brought by arch-rival AMD.But it could well be only the prelude to a much bigger battle, according to former regulators and legal experts: a full-blown federal government case against the world’s biggest chipmaker, in what would be the most significant case of its kind since the US took on Microsoft a decade ago.Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission, newly constituted by the Obama administration, announced an important change in its approach to antitrust enforcement, promising to take a more stringent line in its application of the Sherman Act, one of the principal planks of antitrust legislation.The fact that New York State has moved first against Intel may simply reflect the fact that there will be a lag before this new, tougher stance results in a federal case, according to observers.Mr Cuomo’s investigation began “in the days of the last US administration, which was reluctant to bring cases like these”, said Nicholas Economides, professor of economics at the New York University’s Stern School of Business, who worked on the New York investigation. “It’s very possible the FTC will want to bring a case.”The cases against Intel, both in New York and around the world, in many ways echo the earlier, successful US complaint against Microsoft. As in the Microsoft case, they accuse a dominant technology supplier of using its power over PC makers to prevent smaller rivals from gaining a foothold.“It’s vitally important for the FTC to bring its own case,” said David Balto, a former policy director at the agency.If the federal regulators decide to take on the case, they could open a new front in the global challenge to Intel that goes beyond the issues considered by regulators in other jurisdictions, Mr Balto said. So far, the cases have centred on distribution issues: Intel’s ability to use large discounts and other means to discourage its customers from buying chips from AMD.The FTC would be more likely to look at broader issues, such as whether Intel’s dominance limits innovation in the chip industry, he added. For instance, Intel faces a complaint from Nvidia, a maker of graphics chips, that its refusal to licence some of its technology has blocked potential rivals from moving into its market.The timing of Mr Cuomo’s move could also complicate Intel’s defence strategy, both at home and abroad. It has been preparing for its first public defence in court in Delaware next year, when the AMD case is due to be heard.With a new, high-profile case to defend, it could now find it far harder to prevail in Delaware, said Mr Balto.
208;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Intel faces bribery allegation in NY suit;;New York’s attorney-general on Wednesday alleged Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, had used ”bribery and coercion” to maintain its dominant market position after an investigation into the Silicon Valley company lasting nearly two years.Intel is already under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and has been censured by the FTC’s counterparts in Europe, Japan and Korea over similar practices.But Andrew Cuomo’s action, filed in a federal court, is the most detailed and strongly worded to date.”Rather than compete fairly, Intel used bribery and coercion to maintain a stranglehold on the market,” the attorney-general alleged in a statement.”Intel’s actions not only unfairly restricted potential competitors, but also hurt average consumers who were robbed of better products and lower prices. These illegal tactics must stop and competition must be restored to this vital marketplace.”Mr Cuomo’s suit seeks to bar further anticompetitive acts, restore lost competition, collect penalties and recover damages he says were suffered by New York and consumers.The lawsuit alleges that Intel paid billions of dollars to PC makers for their exclusive use of its microprocessors, including $2bn in ”rebates” to Dell in 2006. It says Intel also threatened and punished PC makers that worked too closely with its competitor Advanced Micro Devices.It is alleged that retaliatory threats included cutting off payments in the form of rebates to PC makers, directly funding a competitor and ending joint development ventures.New York served a wide-ranging subpoena in January last year seeking documents and information on Intel’s potentially monopolistic practices.One internal Dell email unearthed says Intel was ”prepared for jihad if Dell joins the AMD exodus”.”We [will] get ZERO [rebates] for at least one quarter while Intel ‘investigates the details’ - there’s no legal/moral/threatening means for us to apply and avoid this.”Intel appealed in September against a record E1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine imposed by the European Commission for abusing its dominant market position. The South Korean FTC has also fined the chipmaker.The attorney-general’s case is similar to a lawsuit brought in Delaware in 2005 by AMD, which is set to go to trial next March. Intel is also facing more than 80 class-action lawsuits in the US.”We disagree with the New York attorney-general,” Intel said in a statement.”Neither consumers, who have consistently benefited from lower prices and increased innovation, nor justice are being served by the decision to file a case now. Intel will defend itself.”
209;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Former AMD chief quits amid Galleon case;;Hector Ruiz, chairman of Globalfoundries, the chipmaker, has become the highest-profile executive to step down in the aftermath of the Galleon insider trading allegations.The former chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices is taking an immediate voluntary leave of absence, according to a company statement.It said that Mr Ruiz had already been planning to quit the company and had submitted his resignation in September with an effective date of January 4 2010.Mr Ruiz had been instrumental in AMD’s spin-off of its manufacturing arm last year into a new company, Globalfoundries, with an investment of up to $8.4bn from Abu Dhabi.Mr Ruiz is believed to be the executive who is alleged to have passed on non-public information about the transaction to Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund manager. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing in the case and there have been no allegations that he profited from insider trading.Government legal filings state an unnamed AMD executive told Ms Chiesi that it was 99 per cent certain that the spin-off would take place before AMD’s third-quarter earnings were announced in mid-October last year. “You know, we’re gonna shock the hell out of everybody,” the executive said.A spokesman for Mr Ruiz has declined to comment.The formation of Globalfoundries was announced on October 7 and AMD’s shares rose more than 8 per cent that day.Mr Ruiz had become AMD chief executive in 2002 and enjoyed success as the company’s microprocessors gained market share from its bigger rival Intel.He had campaigned against corporate abuses, launching an antitrust lawsuit against Intel in the US.However, his company’s fortunes went into decline after it stretched itself with the 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI.Mr Ruiz was replaced as chief executive in July last year as AMD reported its seventh successive quarter of losses, but he remained chairman until moving across to take the role on Globalfoundries’ board.Mr Ruiz was born in the Mexico border town of Piedro Negras and was educated in Texas. He worked for Texas Instruments and Motorola before joining AMD in 2000.
210;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-28T16:51:30Z;Sovereign wealth funds: Super-sized investment vehicles accelerate purchases;;As the economic crisis sent stock markets crashing into prolonged downward spirals, Abu Dhabi’s burgeoning pool of state investment vehicles endured a mix of pain and a sense of opportunity.For the behemoth, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia), it was a time to take the hits – with estimates of losses of 25 per cent to 30 per cent – and be cautious. Normally, Adia would hold between 40 and 60 per cent of its portfolio in equities, but as the crisis took hold it allowed its weighting to move to the lower end. Generally considered to be the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, it was believed to increase the cash holding of its assets to 10 per cent.Aida’s circumspect approach – particularly after its $7.5bn investment in Citigroup in November 2007 – should be no surprise: it was set up in 1976 with a mandate to invest Abu Dhabi’s surpluses for future generations, acting in a similar fashion to a pension fund. While seeking out opportunities as markets recover, the fund is still thought to be erring on the side of caution.Other funds investing on behalf of the emirate also suffered losses, with Mubadala, the most transparent of the entities, reporting a $3.2bn loss in 2008, although it reported comprehensive income of $735m for the first half of this year.Yet Abu Dhabi’s new generation of investment vehicles, which have a more interventionist approach, also saw a period of rare opportunity as asset prices plummeted. This meant that for funds such as Mubadala there was a chance to beef up portfolios at knock-down prices.While sensitive to appear not to be taking advantage of the woes of the western world, the funds have invested billions of dollars over the past 18 months.They differ from Adia because they have mandates not only to seek financial returns, but also to bring new businesses to Abu Dhabi to help diversify the economy.Yet the flurry of activity and the variety of deals have prompted questions among some about the dangers of overlap between the entities.Khaldoon al-Mubarak, Mubadala’s chief executive, insists there is a clear understanding. “You have to bear in mind that the chairmen and chief executives of these companies talk very closely and we meet on a regular basis,” he says.“When we meet, if there are areas that we feel makes sense to consider, that discussion happens.” He says that in the future there could “be situations in which some consolidation will need to happen”, but adds that at this stage it is too early to judge what form that might take.Mubadala’s range of deals include plans to become a top 10 investor in General Electric and an $8bn joint venture with the American giant to set up an Abu Dhabi-based commercial finance entity modelled on GE Capital. It also has agreements with Rolls-Royce and EADS with hopes to develop the aerospace industry in Abu Dhabi.However, some of the biggest headlines have been garnered by two of the newest kids on the block: the Advanced Technology Investment Company (Atic) and Aabar.The latter was until recently a smallish energy company that has been transformed since it sold its core assets to Mubadala and was taken over by the International Petroleum Investment Company (Ipic), an older state investment vehicle.Atic, meanwhile, came out of nowhere when it was announced last October that it would be setting up a US-headquartered semiconductor manufacturing company with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) – in which Mubadala already had a stake – called GlobalFoundries. Atic invested $2.1bn for its stake in GlobalFoundries and is spending up to $6bn building fabrication plants in New York and Germany. It created more waves last month when the fledgling fund announced it was acquiring Singapore’s Chartered, a leading semiconductor manufacturing company, in a deal worth $3.9bn.Aabar has also been on a rapid and diverse spending spree that has seen it buy stakes in Daimler, Tesla (the California-based electronic car manufacturer), Virgin Galactic (the commercial space venture of entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson), and most recently Banco Santander’s Brazilian arm. “I like to use the companies I’m investing in to the maximum – if I can do other things with Virgin I will do it,” Khadem al-Qubaisi, the chairman of Aabar told the FT earlier this year. “All the companies which we are invested in, we are developing a minimum of two or three ideas with.”Mubadala, meanwhile, has reached the point where its key focus is implementation of its array of projects over the next 18 months, a reason it has been less active this year, Mr Mubarak says. “We have to deliver – it’s a very important year for us. We have a lot of projects coming on stream …we had reached a very critical size,” he says. “At the same time we recognised the global situation – we weren’t necessarily fishing proactively for deals outside of our scope.”
211;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-28T06:29:21Z;Ex-AMD head drawn into Galleon probe;;Hector Ruiz, former chief executive officer of chipmaker AMD, has become the most senior technology industry executive to be drawn into the insider-trading scandal that has engulfed US hedge fund Galleon.A complaint filed by the US attorney in Manhattan earlier this month alleged that an unnamed AMD executive had passed inside information about the company to Danielle Chiesi, a former analyst at another hedge fund, New Castle Partners. Ms Chiesi was charged with trading on non-public information but, through her lawyer, has denied acting illegally.The complaint did not allege that the unnamed executive had acted illegally or had passed on the information for financial gain.Mr Ruiz, who retired from AMD last year, was the executive mentioned in the complaint, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr Ruiz could not be contacted and a spokesman declined to comment.AMD would not confirm that its former chief executive was the executive referred to in the US attorney’s complaint, but said: “We are continuing to evaluate the matter and we are not aware of any allegation of criminal misconduct on the part of AMD or any current or former employees.”A Mexican immigrant, Mr Ruiz rose to become one of the highest-ranking executives in the global semiconductor industry. He moved to AMD in 2000, after two decades at Motorola that included a stint as head of its semiconductor arm.After becoming chief executive in 2002, Mr Ruiz led a successful early push into multi-core processors – chips with more than one computing “brain” – that gave AMD a rare lead over its bigger rival and nemesis, Intel. But AMD fell behind again after failing to keep pace with the latest generation of server chips.According to the insider trading complaint filed against Ms Chiesi, she was passed inside information about AMD’s plans to spin off its chip manufacturing arm by an unnamed executive at the company. “You know, we’re gonna shock the hell out of everybody,” the executive is alleged to have said of the plan.A month after that comment, in October last year, AMD announced its intention to spin-off the business with financial backing from Abu Dhabi.Mr Ruiz is now non-executive chairman of Globalfoundries, the company created by the spin-off. A spokesman said the company would not comment on the matter “as the allegations pre-date the launch of Globalfoundries”.
212;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-23T19:38:22Z;Galleon’s reach;Case causes shock far beyond the financial world;Raj can mean king or princely in Sanskrit and, until last week, Raj Rajaratnam lived up to his name on Wall Street.Sent as a child from his native Sri Lanka to be educated in Britain and America, Mr Rajaratnam was among the most successful of a wave of US immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. At 52, the burly financier ran a hedge fund that had made him a billionaire and was admired for his intelligence and drive, in spite of a large ego.But his reign ended abruptly last Friday when agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation drove up to his apartment on Sutton Place, a street on New York’s affluent Upper East Side, at 6am and led him away in handcuffs. Later, he was charged with running an insider trading ring, the biggest since the arbitrageur Ivan Boesky was jailed in 1988.Mr Rajaratnam, founder and chief executive of the Galleon group of funds, has denied the charges and told his 150 employees he would defend himself “ with the same intensity and focus” that he brought to running his financial empire. But a man declared by Forbes magazine to be one of the richest 400 people in the US is in personal and financial turmoil.He is winding up his US funds and returning $3.7bn (€2.5bn, £2.3bn) to investors – an action that has won praise on Wall Street, since other fund managers facing legal investigation have clung obstinately on to investors’ money – so he can concentrate on defending himself against the extraordinary charges.The fact that Mr Rajaratnam, and not a junior banker or fund manager, has been bailed for $100m is striking enough. Even more shocking is the status of the five other defendants who are accused of being part of his insider trading ring. They include a partner of McKinsey, the blue-chip consulting firm, as well as a high-ranking IBM executive and an executive at Intel.The FBI and officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who are basking in the arrests after their failure to catch Bernard Madoff, the fraudulent financier, tapped the mobile phones of Mr Rajaratnam and others for more than two years. They gained extensive evidence of alleged insider trading involving technology companies including Google and IBM.Although the defendants assert their innocence, the charges have thrown a light on how hundreds of hedge funds in New York and London fight to get an edge over rivals – and gain millions of dollars for investors and themselves – by using private information to trade in shares.Some of this information gathering – for which Mr Rajaratnam and Galleon were renowned – is legal and above board. Indeed, it is the mark of the best analysts that they penetrate the fronts companies put up.But prosecutors allege that Mr Rajaratnam went beyond this, pressing his team of 45 analysts and others to produce tips from employees, consultants and the like – even one ratings analyst at Moody’s was allegedly involved – on how companies were faring financially. He would then trade in the shares to make money, or limit Galleon’s losses, before the companies made public announcements.The scandal threatens further to tarnish the hedge fund industry, which is just starting to recover from the double blows inflicted by last year’s financial crisis and the Madoff affair. Stories of insider trading by hedge funds have circulated for years but these arrests are by far the biggest crackdown on suspected misbehaviour.“We need a better definition of what insider trading means,” says one investor who places money from wealthy families and pension funds into hedge funds. “It is tough legally, because there are a lot of grey areas, and it is tough for the industry because it is one more cloud.”US law says that not only company executives but also management consultants, stock analysts, public relations advisers, ratings analysts, lawyers, bankers and all others in possession of such data have a duty of confidentiality. If people who worked for such organisations were no longer trusted by companies with figures, it would be disastrous for how equity markets function. None of McKinsey’s 400 partners has faced such an accusation before – and when the California-based Anil Kumar was arrested in connection with the case, he fainted with shock.Dominic Barton, McKinsey’s new managing director, has spent this week reassuring the firm’s corporate clients. Meanwhile, Google suspended its dealings with Market Street Partners, an investor relations firm, after an employee of the latter allegedly disclosed information about the group’s results in 2007. The employee no longer works for the company.Mr Rajaratnam is a Tamil who attended school in the UK before studying engineering at the University of Sussex and then finance at Wharton business school in Philadelphia. He joined Needham & Co, a boutique Wall Street investment bank, as a semiconductor analyst, and was eventually appointed its president and chief operating officer.He started a fund for Needham that invested in technology companies and, in 1997, spun off this fund as Galleon and left Needham in order to run it. From early on, Galleon’s style was heavily research-oriented and Mr Rajaratnam pushed his team of analysts to prepare long, detailed reports on companies and to hunt for information about their finances.The culture at Galleon was intense and hard-driving. The fund even had a rap track commissioned – “It’s the good ship Galleon, when Wall Street has a rally on” runs one line. Another passage speaks to its prescience: “When the market flopped, they knew it would dip, that’s why they call it the good ship.”Analysts who failed to generate information to use in trading were squeezed out, say people who worked there. A presentation to investors last year described the team as its “eyes and ears on portfolio companies”.Mr Rajaratnam dominated. He ran the morning meeting of its traders and analysts, and alienated some Galleon portfolio managers by countermanding them. He was known as a relentless networker and, as his firm grew, struck some other hedge fund managers as bombastic and self-satisfied. “Investors can confuse wealth with intelligence,” says one.As he became richer, he took more interest in Sri Lanka, contributing $5m to rebuilding homes after the 2004 tsunami. The Sri Lankan government regarded him with suspicion and accused him of providing cash to the rebel Tamil Tigers through front organisations, which he denied, saying he had merely funded legitimate charities.No one, however, contested his expertise on the technology companies of Silicon Valley, in which he invested for Galleon’s $350m technology fund. In late 2005, according to prosecutors, Roomy Khan, a former Galleon analyst who lives in California, called to ask for a job. He allegedly responded by asking her in what companies she had an “edge”.Prosecutors allege that Ms Khan, who later co-operated with the inquiry and is identified in the SEC complaint only as “Tipper A”, went on to supply inside information about Polycom, Hilton and Google, which Mr Rajaratnam used to make trades. But after suspicious trading was picked up by the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, she let her conversations with him be recorded.That led investigators to other people with whom he allegedly shared inside information, including Danielle Chiesi, a former analyst for a hedge fund called New Castle Partners. Ms Chiesi and Mark Kurland, who ran New Castle, were among those arrested and charged last week. Both deny wrongdoing. The complaint did not allege Ms Chiesi gave anything of value, her attorney has pointed out.She allegedly gleaned information from technology executives including Robert Moffat, a senior IBM official who is a confidant of Sam Palmisano, its chief executive. Mr Moffat, a friend of Ms Chiesi, is accused of giving her inside information about Sun Microsystems and AMD. He and Intel’s Rajiv Goel also deny the charges.Ms Chiesi provided some of the most colourful quotes in the tapped phone conversations that are cited in the court documents filed by the SEC. During one, she is quoted as saying to a “co-conspirator” that “I’m dead if this leaks. I really am and my career is over. I’ll be like Martha [expletive] Stewart.”The case is unusual not only for the seniority of the people involved but for the sheer amount of evidence gathered through tapping phone conversations over two years. The SEC and prosecutors hope this will be enough to obtain convictions and to deter others on Wall Street.But winning such cases, even when the alleged perpetrators are identified, is not easy. Mark Cuban, a billionaire technology entrepreneur, was recently cleared of insider trading despite having sold his stake in a company after being told by its chief executive of a planned share offering. Mr Cuban had argued he had no agreement with the company or fiduciary duty not to sell the stock.“Tracking down insider trading is tricky and then you must prove intent, that someone knew they had illegal inside information and went ahead and traded with it,” says Utpal Bhattacharya, professor of finance at the Kelley School of business at Indiana University.Even by getting this far, the SEC has impressed many people who believed that bringing charges for insider dealing at the highest levels was too hard. After two years of monitoring, the authorities swung into action when they found Mr Rajaratnam planned to leave the country.He had booked tickets to fly to London and then Switzerland rather than home to Sri Lanka, where he feared kidnap or assassination, according to a friend there. “He loved this place but he realised it was becoming too dangerous for him – he was dead scared they were going to kill him.”Mr Rajaratnam is safely out on bail in New York and visited his office this week to reassure his employees and to reiterate his innocence. But whatever happens now, his Wall Street reign is over.Additional reporting by Henny Sender, Sam Jones and Joanna Chung in New York, Brooke Masters in London and James Fontanella-Khan in Colombo
213;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;McKinsey partner’s arrest casts shadow;;When federal officers arrived at the home of Anil Kumar, a McKinsey partner, to arrest him on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud, he fainted and had to be briefly hospitalised.That left his fellow partners at the elite consulting firm completely in the dark for several critical hours about the actual charges he was facing.Initially, they did not know whether he had a problem with “security” or, as turned out to be the case, “securities,” Dominic Barton, McKinsey’s worldwide managing director, told the Financial Times.When US prosecutors released the court documents, McKinsey learned that Mr Kumar was accused of passing inside information to Raj Rajaratnam about a planned Middle Eastern investor in Advanced Micro Devices, a McKinsey client.Mr Kumar, 51, said he was shocked by the complaint and emphatically denied all charges. US court documents claim he was a direct or indirect investor in Mr Rajaratnam’s Galleon hedge funds. Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer has said his client is innocent.The news of his arrest stunned both McKinsey and the broader management consulting industry, which is valued above all in executive suites throughout the world for discreet counsel on matters often central to corporate strategy.Unlike law firms and investment banks, top consulting firms have not previously been hit by investment trading scandals.While McKinsey has always required employees to keep client matters confidential, for the past three years partners have been required to sign something annually acknowledging the rules.“This issue is completely virgin territory for us. We have very clear policies that you do not invest in clients or situations even where it is legal,” said Mr Barton, who spent much of last weekend talking to dozens of clients and to a special firm committee that handles emergency situations.The firm has put Mr Kumar on leave and asked an outside law firm to do an investigation, he said.At McKinsey and in Mr Kumar’s Silicon Valley community, friends called him a careful, bright man who valued his family and his network of connections“This is a shock – Anil is extremely discreet, he never talks about work,” said Venktesh Shukla, a family friend and chief executive of Nusym, a Silicon Valley start-up that does verification technology.Born in India, Mr Kumar was the man sent by McKinsey to set up its India Knowledge Centre in New Delhi in 1998, which produces data Wall Street uses to take crucial decisions.He maintained a close relationship with Rajat Gupta, who headed McKinsey from 1994 to 2003. They worked together to found the Indian School of Business, the country’s top-ranked school according to the Financial Times.“Mr Kumar had been involved from the start of the school and was a very active and supportive member of the board,” said Ajit Ranjnekar, dean of the ISB. Mr Kumar has taken a leave of absence pending the case.Vish Mishtra, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and head of TiE, a networking group for the Valley’s large Indian community said Mr Kumar “was very close to [Mr] Gupta, they were hand in glove”.After Mr Kumar returned to California, the powerful Confederation of Indian Industries, a business lobby, asked him to co-chair the Indian American Council, formed to draw business and philanthropic ties between the US and India.However, as much as Mr Kumar was admired for his business ability and sharpness, he also drew fire for what was seen as his arrogance, according to many people who worked closely with him during his days in India.“He had that ‘I know it all’ kind of attitude,” said one IT executive. “He always wanted things his way and the fact he had worked in the US made him think he didn’t need advice from Indian executives.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan in Mumbai and Richard Waters in San Francisco
214;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-20T22:53:08Z;Nvidia cloud graphics offer reality check;;Nvidia today launched a “GPU computing in the cloud” service that will allow designers to manipulate and check photo-realistic environments in a fraction of the normal time it takes on a PC workstation.The graphics chipmaker is combining “iray” rendering technology, from its mental images acquisition, with its high-end Tesla chips in a new RealityServer platform. It expects cloud computing providers to offer services based on the platform to designers of cars, aircraft, clothes, homes and office buildings.In a demonstration on the fringes of the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, Nvidia showed how a photo-realistic design for an office floor (pictured) could be manipulated in a web browser in 3D, with the effects of changing lighting shown and the new views taking seconds to render rather than over more than three hours on a regular workstation.The company said the images could be accessed over the internet on any device that could run a browser, with an iPhone demonstration included in the presentation.The software will be released on November 30 and Nvidia said it would help cloud computing providers to configure their servers with the Tesla GPUs (graphics processing units).Both Nvidia and its main rival AMD have been pushing into graphics markets beyond the cards they make for PC gamers. They see a role in industries that can make use of the power of parallel processing, carried out in GPUs with hundreds of computing cores.Nvidia has led with its Tesla GPUs and will follow up with its forthcoming Fermi ones, while cards based on AMD’s latest RV870 chip have 1,600 processing cores.
215;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-19T20:03:11Z;Q&A: Hedge fund insider trading case;;Why is this case seen as a potential watershed in aggressive law enforcement?The seniority of the people involved and the sheer breadth of institutions where betrayals are alleged to have taken place make this case highly unusual. Prior cases have tended to involve relatively junior bankers at one or two institutions who passed on information about deals or ratings changes, or an insider at a single company.In this case, court documents described alleged incidents where insiders at ratings firms, consultancies and half a dozen US public companies including IBM, Intel and Akamai are accused of sharing inside information about forthcoming deals or earnings announcements with top hedge fund personnel at either Galleon or New Castle.How do the allegations in this case compare to ordinary practices on Wall Street or in the City?Traders and investors routinely call up their contacts at public companies to pump them for information about sales and earnings. There is also strong evidence that many proposed acquisitions and merger deals leak before they are announced. An annual UK market cleanliness study found that 29 per cent of takeovers were preceded by suspicious trading.Some of the information sharing described in the SEC and criminal complaints is not all that different from ordinary gossip. But the SEC claims the defendants crossed the line when they received and traded on very specific information about pending announcements, such as when Rajiv Goel allegedly told Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam that Clearwire would be receiving $1bn from Intel in exchange for a 10 per cent stake, or the SEC’s informant allegedly told Mr Rajaratnam that Hilton was going private the next day at a price in the mid-$40s per share. Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer says he is innocent of the charges and will fight them in court.Why were the wiretaps so critical in this case?The FBI got a judge’s permission to tap Mr Rajaratnam’s mobile phone and then used the specific conversations to allege that trades Galleon made were based on information he received. Ordinarily, identifying suspicious trades by large institutional investors is quite difficult because they are involved in so many transactions every day, and most previous insider trading cases have involved individuals or very small hedge funds.Indeed Mr Rajaratnam was allegedly taped advising New Castle portfolio manager Danielle Chiesi that she should “buy and sell, buy and sell” AMD stock so that particular AMD transactions would not attract scrutiny. Ms Chiesi’s lawyer says people should not rush to judgment about the case.What will happen next?Mr Rajaratnam’s alleged musings that a government witness might be wearing a wire and his purchase of plane tickets to London led the the US government to pull the plug on their wiretaps and arrest him. He and several other defendants have proclaimed their innocence and could well force the government to prove its case at trial.But the government investigation is far from complete. The SEC and criminal complaints include details of a number of unnamed corporate consultants and executives who allegedly tipped Galleon and New Castle. Those people could now be at risk of prosecution and some will probably chose to co-operate with authorities, perhaps by passing on the names of other people and other hedge funds they may have shared information with. Those people in turn could find themselves under investigation.
216;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-19T20:03:11Z;‘Unusual activity’ in Hilton shares led to Rajaratnam charges;;"Unusual trading in shares of Hilton Hotels detected by the New York Stock Exchange in 2007 contributed to the investigation that led to billionaire investor Raj Rajaratnam and five other individuals being charged with insider trading last week.After detecting “unusual activity and after investigating we referred them to the SEC,” said NYSE Regulation on Monday.The NYSE, which is overseen by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, monitors intra-day trading and is in the front line of defence against illegal activity.It also emerged on Monday that some of the largest investors in hedge funds had for years harboured concerns about Galleon Group, founded by Mr Rajaratnam, according to the content of due diligence reports disclosed to the Financial Times.Inconsistencies and red flags over the “source of alpha” – industry parlance for market-beating profits – were noted in reports commissioned by several large investors. Each passed up the opportunity to invest in Galleon as a result, in spite of the fund’s reputation and stellar record.Mr Rajaratnam allegedly made a $4m profit in July 2007 by buying 400,000 shares in Hilton after receiving non-public information about the impending purchase of the hotel chain by Blackstone, the private equity group, according to criminal documents filed last week by prosecutors.The information allegedly came from a Moody’s Investors Service analyst and was passed to Mr Rajaratnam by an individual who became a government informant four months later. The criminal case was built largely on information provided by that informant and wire taps of phone conversations.The Hilton trade was followed about two weeks later by trading in Google stock, another one of the transactions highlighted in the criminal complaints.The NYSE said it detected and referred unusual trading in shares of Advanced Micro Devices to the SEC a year later. Danielle Chiesi, an employee of New Castle, a hedge fund set up by Bear Stearns, allegedly conspired with Mr Rajaratnam on the AMD trades.Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer said his client was innocent and would fight charges in court.
He has posted $100m bail and surrendered his passport."
217;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-16T23:16:00Z;Tapes lift lid on high pressure world of dealers;;The insider trading case filed on Friday by US federal prosecutors offers a unique glimpse into the secretive – and sometimes paranoid – world of Wall Street wheeler-dealers.The criminal complaints filed on Friday contain transcripts of telephone conversations of hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam and others who held top positions in prominent companies across corporate America as they allegedly took part in an insider trading scheme that went on for several years until early this year.The recordings – the first court-authorised wire taps in a significant insider trading case, according to prosecutors – mark a contrast with other recent white-collar cases, which have often relied on e-mail communications, recorded int­ernal business messages and paper documents for evidence of potential wrongdoing. Authorities hope to use wire taps in future white-collar investigations.The transcripts not only include detailed discussions of earnings announcements, acquisitions and joint venture deals, involving companies such as Google, Hilton and IBM, but also indicate that some of the defendants were becoming ever more worried about their activities over time.Mr Rajaratnam once called Danielle Chiesi, an employee of New Castle, a hedge fund set up by Bear Stearns, on a land line in August last year and allegedly emphasised the importance of keeping quiet. “On Akamai or IBM, anything, be radio silent. Like, you know, I get shit on lots of companies . . . ”Ms Chiesi replied: “I’m radio silent.”Ms Chiesi was charged criminally along with Mr Rajaratnam and four ­others.In one conversation, Ms Chiesi called an unnamed “co-conspirator” allegedly to provide information regarding the re-organisation of Advanced Micro Devices, and said: “I swear to you in front of God . . . You put me in jail if you talk.” Later, she said: “I’m dead if this leaks. I really am . . . . and my career is over. I’ll be like Martha [expletive] Stewart.”In another telephone conversation with Mark Kurland, a New Castle executive who formerly served as head of research and asset management at Bear Stearns, she said she was going to “get a new cell phone and talk to [AMD executive] from there . . . I know I’m paranoid.”Mr Kurland replied: “All right, well don’t keep talking about it on the phone. I’ll take care of it all right.”In a September 2008 conversation, Mr Rajaratnam and Ms Chiesi discussed whether Robert Moffat, a senior vice-president at IBM, who allegedly provided inside information, could potentially be moved from IBM to another technology company.“Put him in some company where we can trade well.” She replied: “I know, I know. I’m thinking that too. Or just keep him at IBM, you know, because this guy is giving me more information.”The defendants operated in a “cosy world” of “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch your back”, said Preet Bharara, US attorney in Manhattan, adding that while a number of the individuals engaged in the alleged activity for financial gain, others did so partly to gain inside knowledge.Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which also brought civil charges in the case, said: “Raj Rajaratnam is not a master of the universe but rather a master of the Rolodex.“He cultivated a network of high-ranking corporate executives and insiders, and then tapped into this ring to obtain confidential details about quarterly earnings and takeover activity.”Mr Khuzami said that authorities would be “pulling back the curtain on hedge funds” and looking closely at their activities.Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately return requests for comment or could not be reached on Friday.
218;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-16T20:36:15Z;Earnings shift Wall Street sentiment;;US equities rose to fresh 12-month highs this week, only to trim gains on Friday as the third-quarter earnings season sparked a shift in sentiment.Figures released early in the week were better received than those towards the end of it, pushing the S&P 500 to a 12-month peak of 1,096.56 on Thursday.With the broad benchmark near 1,100, some analysts warn that the market’s rise of 60 per cent from its March nadir could run out of steam.“The sheer magnitude of the gains in seven months relative to average market rebounds off of recession lows, and stretched upward earnings estimate revision trends suggest some caution in our view,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “With a major change in sentiment and valuation from March 2009 levels, the rally argument gets more difficult, though not unprecedented.”Investor reticence abounded as US equity funds recorded outflows for the seventh time in the past nine weeks, led by large cap funds, according to data released on Friday by EPFR Global.As earnings flowed on Friday, there was evidence of investors cashing in recent gains and the S&P closed down 0.8 per cent at 1,087.68, clipping its rise this week to 1.5 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8 per cent to close at 2,156.80, for a gain of 0.8 per cent on the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 per cent to 9,995.91, cutting its weekly rise to 1.3 per cent.Financials were one of the big stories this week. Good earnings from JPMorgan on Wednesday helped propel the Dow through 10,000 for the first time since October 2008. JPMorgan rose 0.5 per cent to $46.06 this week, but other banking results subsequently weighed on the market.Investors recoiled on Friday as Bank of America reported a $1bn loss for the third quarter, while General Electric posted a 47 per cent decline to $2.4bn and its overall revenue fell 20 per cent to $37.8bn. At the close, shares in BofA were 4.6 per cent lower at $17.26, while GE was down 4.2 per cent at $16.08.That followed slightly disappointing results from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs on Thursday. Goldman reported better than expected third-quarter earnings, but the results were below the “whisper” number. Earlier in the week sentiment for Goldman was knocked when Meredith Whitney, the banking analyst, downgraded the stock.For the week, Goldman dropped 2.6 per cent to $184.37, but it remains up 118 per cent this year.At Citigroup, investors frowned at a third-quarter loss of 27 cents per share, which was better than estimates of 38 cents, as credit losses continued to weigh on its results. The stock slid 3.4 per cent to $4.59 on Friday, and fell 0.9 per cent on the week.Also weighing on sentiment was IBM and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies reported earnings late on Thursday. IBM’s third-quarter net profit rose to $3.2bn, or $2.40 a share, but the stock dropped 5 per cent to $121.64 on Friday. Shares in IBM have risen more than 20 per cent in the past three months and hit a 52-week high of $128.61 on Wednesday.Shares in AMD slipped 7.3 per cent to $5.74 after the chipmaker posted a loss of 18 cents per share versus an estimated 42 cent decline. AMD’s revenues for the third quarter of $1.4bn beat an expected $1.25bn and reinforced the good results posted by Intel earlier this week.Intel dropped 2.4 per cent to $20.18 on Friday after it hit a post-earnings high of $21.27 on Wednesday.One bright spot on Friday was Google, whose stock rose 3.8 per cent to $549.85, for a weekly gain of 6.5 per cent. The internet group reported $5.89 earnings per share, which beat analyst forecasts of $5.42 per share.Halliburton reported a 61 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings, but the company beat estimates and its stock gained 1.8 per cent to $30.40.Mattel saw its net profit fall 3 per cent for the third quarter to $229.8m or 63 cents a share, which met estimates. Net sales fell 8 per cent to $1.79bn, which was less than forecast and shares in the toymaker rose 4.5 per cent to $20.46.Meanwhile, Allegheny Technologies, dropped 5.4 per cent to $36.87, after the specialty-metals producer was downgraded to underweight from neutral by JPMorgan Chase.Earlier this week in deals, Cisco Systems agreed to buy Starent Networks for $2.9bn in cash. Shares in Cisco dropped 0.4 per cent to $24.02 this week, while Starent jumped 16.3 per cent to $33.86, near Cisco’s $35 per share offer.
219;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD results echo tech optimism;;Advanced Micro Devices displayed similar optimism to its processor rival Intel on Thursday, reporting that strong demand for its chips in the third quarter led to an 18 per cent sequential rise in sales.Intel beat Wall Street expectations and boosted the tech sector on Tuesday, saying it had enjoyed its strongest second-to-third quarter growth in more than 30 years.AMD said growth in shipments of its microprocessors and graphics chips, busier factories, higher average selling prices and an increase in shipments of more cost-effective chips had increased its gross margins by 5 percentage points to 42 per cent, compared to the second quarter.Intel’s smaller rival has struggled through 12 quarters of losses as it acquired Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI and then spun off its manufacturing arm in an effort to remain competitive.It reported sales of $1.4bn, beating analyst estimates of $1.26bn, and a loss of 18 cents a share, compared to Street expectations of 42 cents.
220;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-15T20:59:15Z;Tech and oil gains put Wall St back on track;;US equity markets got a late boost from stronger oil and strength in the energy sector, with the S&P 500 again setting a fresh high for 2009 despite a rather drab trading session.After the market closed, Google beat expectations with its third-quarter results. It reported $5.89 earnings per share, beating average analyst forecasts of $5.42 per share, and shares rose in after-hours trading.Google shares closed down 1.01 per cent at $529.91 but rose to $541 in after-hours trading. IBM shares ended 0.29 per cent lower at $127.98 but fell to $123.25.IBM, closely watched for signs of spending on technology, also released results after the bell, reporting $2.40 per share. AMD also beat expectations, further showing growth is returning to technology companies.Though IBM’s results were slightly better than forecast, IBM’s shares fell in after-market trading, reflecting the growing trend that requires a big improvement from companies on expectations for shares to get a lift.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was in the spotlight after it breached the psychologically important 10,000 level on Wednesday for the first time in over a year.On Thursday, it traded below that level for much of the day after Goldman Sachsand Citigroup reported earnings. However, there was a late improvement after crude oil rallied on a drop in oil inventories.As a result, the energy sector made strong gains and pulled sentiment up across the board.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.47 per cent at 10,062.9. The S&P 500 was 0.42 per cent higher at 1,096.6, setting another 2009 high. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.05 per cent at 2,173.3.“After a week of mostly better-than-expected results and upside celebrations, today’s rather lacklustre performance could be a sign that the recent preponderance of good news has very simply raised the bar to what the market will reward,” said John Stoltzfus at Ticonderoga Securities.Goldman Sachs reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, but the results nevertheless dented sentiment as traders had whispered of even better numbers than the $5.25 earnings per share that the bank delivered.Goldman Sachs has been the strongest performer among the biggest US banks this year, with its shares notching up gains of nearly 125 per cent. On Thursday, Goldman shares closed 1.9 per cent lower at $188.63.Citigroup also reported earnings, making a third-quarter loss of 27 cents per share as credit losses continued to weigh on its results. Average forecasts from analysts were for a loss of 38 cents per share. Vikram Pandit, chief executive, said: “The US consumer credit environment remains challenging.”Citigroup shares, which are down 29 per cent on the year, fell 5 per cent to $4.75.The earnings from the two financial giants come after JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday injected renewed confidence into the sector as its biggest profit for more than two years helped push the Dow through the 10,000 barrier. Yesterday, JPMorgan’s shares held up better than some rivals and closed unchanged at $47.16. Among other financial losers amid concerns of consumer credit weakness was Capital One Financial whose shares fell 3.13 per cent to $38.12.It reported an increase in the number of customers behind on credit card payments in September.In technology, Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, announced a surprise third-quarter loss due to a €908m ($1.35bn) writedown by its struggling networks joint venture.Shares in Motorola, the biggest US mobile phone group, fell 3.33 per cent to $8.13.The newspaper industry also took on a more glum tone, after McClatchy reported a 28 per cent drop in quarterly advertising revenue and forecast further declines through the end of the year. Its shares fell 12.94 per cent to $3.5.There was a more positive tone in the retail sector, after Safeway, the third-largest US grocery chain, released profits that beat expectations. Shares in the retailer were up 6.53 per cent at $22.83.
221;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-14T21:15:37Z;Wall St hits fresh 2009 highs;;US stock markets hit fresh 2009 highs on Wednesday, with Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the 10,000 mark, after a smaller-than-expected decline in retail sales and strong earnings at a leading bank.Financial, industrial and materials stocks boosted the market while the telecoms sector was a laggard.The S&P 500 stock index closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,092.02, a new 2009 high. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 2,172.23.The Dow gained 1.5 per cent to 10,015.86, the first five-digit close since October 3, 2008.“It’s a landmark,” said Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “It makes for good headlines and positive feelings, which is very important at this time of year. The consumer has to feel things are on the mend if they are going to go out and shop.”The Dow first broke through 10,000 in March 1999, and after the bear market earlier this decade, rose back above 10,000 in December 2003. But it still remains 29 per cent below its record closing high of 14,164.53 set in October 2007.The Dow has rallied more than 50 per cent from its March low, but its performance has lagged behind other US equity benchmarks so far this year.In the year to date, the Dow is up 14.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 has risen 20.9 per cent and the Nasdaq is up 37.7 per cent. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks has gained 24.9 per cent.U, stung by a slump in motor vehicle purchases as government-sponsored incentives ended. But the 1.5 per cent decline, the biggest since December, was less than the 2.1 per cent analysts had expected.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said conventional Wall Street wisdom held that the market was “way ahead” of the economic recovery. “What is really going on is exactly the opposite: the reason this thing keeps going up is economic fundamentals are improving far more rapidly than Wall Street’s perceptions.”Analysts at Capital Economics said the sales data will likely allow consumption to contribute to growth in the third quarter, but warned rising unemployment, falling incomes and tight credit “mean that a renewed period of weak consumption growth will undermine the sustainability of the economic recovery”.The market also reacted to a strong set of third-quarter earnings reports. JPMorgan on Wednesday said that profits surged in the quarter on the strength of its investment banking business, but cautioned recent signs of consumer credit stability might be fleeting.Net income climbed to $3.6bn, or 82 cents a share, from $527m, or 9 cents, in the same period a year ago.

The week is rounded off with earnings from Bank of America, General Electric, Halliburton and Mattel.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter at minus 24.6 per cent. The estimated rate has been revised lower from 2.6 per cent at the start of the year, then minus 17.2 per cent at the beginning of April, and minus 20.9 per cent at the start of July.“The Financials sector (+58 per cent) is anticipating the highest earnings growth rate for the quarter, while the materials (-65 per cent), energy (-65 per cent), and industrials (-45 per cent) sectors are expecting the lowest,” say analysts at ThomsonReuters.While a negative quarter would extend Corporate America’s current run to nine consecutive quarterly profit declines, much attention will focus on an expected rebound in earnings next year.As a result, guidance from companies looms as being the key driver of sentiment for equities.“The most critical news is likely to be centred on initial guidance to next year’s business activity and its impact on the bottom line,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“With Street consensus bottom-up earnings growth projected to climb 26 per cent to 27 per cent year over year in 2010, there is not that much room for conservative outlook statements which may be deemed disappointing,” said Mr Levkovich.ThomsonReuters estimates earnings growth rates for the S&P 500 of 192 per cent for the fourth quarter, which benefits from an easy comparison with the fourth quarter of 2008. That is followed by a 34 per cent rise in earnings for the first quarter of 2010.The positive start for equities on Monday was also a function of various brokerage upgrades.Shares in MasterCard rose 0.7 per cent to $216, and Visa gained 1 per cent to $73.70, after they were upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” by Credit Suisse.

223;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-10-01T02:27:06Z;Brussels promises to support chip industry;;Europe’s chip companies were celebrating on Wednesday after the European Commission pledged to support the semiconductor industry as crucial to the development of the region. Chip companies say it could be a first step for the EU relaxing state aid rules for the sector.The semiconductor industry has been lobbying the European Commission for more aid, saying that they face an uneven playing field, with countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Israel providing substantial state support for semiconductor plants.Günter Verheugen, commissioner for enterprise and industry said technologies such as semiconductors, advanced materials, biotechnology and photonics were key to securing Europe’s future. He promised “concrete actions” on increasing Europe’s competitiveness in these fields, although did not specify what these would be.Possible actions could include challenging other countries’ subsidies to the semiconductor industries through the World Trade Organisation, or relaxing the limits on subsidies that are allowed for European companies, industry executives said. Current EU rules limit state aid to 11 per cent of the cost of a semiconductor plant, compared with up to 60 per cent in some other regions.“This is very significant. We have been waiting for years for to have such a declaration from the EU,” said Heinz Kundert, president of SEMI Europe, the industry association.“It is the first time such a high-ranking official within the European Union has recognised the semiconductor industry as fundamental to Europe. I am not a fan of subsidies, but as long as other regions are supporting strongly their semiconductor industries and Europe is different, we have a competitive disadvantage,” said Volker Braetsch, corporate vice president of Siltronic, the silicon wafer manufacturer, and advisory board member for SEMI Europe.Europe now manufactures 9 per cent of the world’s silicon chips, compared with 11 per cent historically, said Malcolm Penn, semiconductor analyst at Future Horizons.“That decline is accelerating, because European companies are reluctant to build new factories here,” he said.Qimonda, the memory chip company spun out of Germany’s Infineon, for example, filed for insolvency last January. AMD recently sold off its semiconductor fabrication facilities in Dresden and ST Microelectronics is considering moving more manufacturing to Singapore. Mr Braetsch said that while Siltronic considered building its latest factory in Europe, it opted for Singapore because it offered incentives such as tax breaks.“There is no question of building any more factories in Europe until the region is fully competitive,” he said.
224;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;EU produces evidence for €1.1bn Intel fine;;Internal e-mails at Dell purported to warn of “severe and prolonged” repercussions if the computer manufacturer switched business away from Intel and in favour of the chipmaker’s main rival, according to evidence made public by Europe’s top competition regulator on Monday.Internal documents from other Intel customers, including Lenovo, NEC, Hewlett-Packard and retailer Media Saturn Holding, also showed rebates were linked to tight restrictions on the amount of chips that could be purchased from rival AMD, according to the European Commission.The competition watchdog on Monday published a non-confidential version of its May decision, which accused Intel of breaching EU antitrust rules and imposed a €1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine. This was the largest single penalty imposed on any company for competition breaches in the EU.The Commission says that decision, and the evidence contained in it, show how Intel broke the law through the conditional rebates and so-called “naked restrictions” that aimed to prevent or delay the launch of computers based on competing products. The decision details why it believes Intel tried to conceal its practices.Publication of the decision was quickly welcomed by AMD, which said: “The facts are clear …Finally, the world can see the evidence that Intel has tried to hide for so long.”Intel quickly hit back, stressing that it was appealing against the Commission’s decision and was “convinced that the commission’s conclusions …are wrong, both factually and legally”.It claims “the commission relied heavily on speculation found in e-mails from lower-level employees that did not participate in the negotiation of the relevant agreements if they favoured the commission’s case”.It also maintains: “At the same time, they [Commission officials] ignored or minimised hard evidence of what actually happened, including highly authoritative documents, written declarations, and testimony given under oath by senior individuals who negotiated the transactions at issue”.The chipmaker also accuses the Commission of “consistently construing ambiguous documents in a manner adverse to Intel”.The Commission decision is likely to make interesting reading for other regulatory authorities. In addition to the appeal to the EU courts, the company is engaged in damages litigation with AMD in the US and its behaviour is being reviewed by regulators in the US.
225;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel sets out case against record EU fine;;"Europe’s top competition watchdog failed to evaluate the evidence properly and “materially infringed” Intel’s rights of defence in an investigation that led to a record fine of €1.1bn ($1.6bn), lawyers for the US chipmaker have argued.The fine was imposed by the European Commission in May after a long-running probe concluded that Intel had abused its dominant market position and used illegal sales practices to encourage computer manufacturers to carry its products.Intel said in July it intended to appeal against the decision. The grounds of appeal, published in the European Union’s official journal, show that the company’s lawyers plan to focus on how Commission officials assessed the evidence.The chipmaker claims the Commission failed to “meet the required standard of proof” in its analysis; failed to address evidence that showed a competitor substantially increasing market share at one stage; failed to establish a causal link between Intel’s so-called “conditional discounts” and the decisions of customers not to purchase chips from AMD, Intel’s main competitor; and failed to analyse how those discounts affected consumers.Intel is also raising a series of legal arguments. These centre on a challenge to the Commission’s finding that its discounts were abusive in themselves because they were conditional – without assessing whether they had the capacity to reduce competition.It also contends that procedural developments towards the end of the inquiry infringed its defence rights and that the fine was “manifestly disproportionate”.The fine was the largest single penalty imposed on a company for antitrust breaches in Europe. At the time, Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said: “Given that Intel has harmed millions of consumers …the size of the fine should come as no surprise.”Appeals to the top EU courts in Luxembourg can take several years.AMD said it was confident that when evidence of antitrust regulators in Europe and Asia – where there have also been findings against the chipmaker – was independently reviewed, there would be “no doubt that Intel illegally abused its monopoly power and harmed consumers”."
226;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-09-15T04:35:39Z;Intel grounds for EU appeal revealed;;Intel is to argue that the European Commission provided insufficient proof of wrongdoing when it appeals the record antitrust fine imposed by commissioners in May.The details of Intel’s appeal asking for an annulment of the decision or a reduction of the €1.06bn ($1.5bn) fine have been revealed in the official journal of the European Union.Intel’s lawyers will argue that the EC failed to establish that Intel’s discounts to its customers shut out competition, namely from its rival AMD.They will also say that there was insufficient proof that Intel’s rebates were conditional upon its customers buying all or nearly all of their microprocessors from Intel. The commission had also failed to establish a link between the discounts and customers’ decisions not to buy from a competitor, they allege.Further, they argue the Commission failed to prove that Intel engaged in a long-term strategy to shut out competitors. Procedural flaws are also alleged.On the fine, Intel’s lawyers say it is “manifestly disproportionate given that the Commission fails to establish any consumer harm or foreclosure of the competitors.”There is no date set for the appeal and, in the meantime, Intel will be looking for a replacement for its general counsel, Bruce Sewell. In a statement on Monday, Intel said Mr Sewell had decided to leave the company “to pursue other opportunities”.
227;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Abu Dhabi to buy Chartered for $1.8bn;;Abu Dhabi launched an attempt to rival Taiwanese dominance of the semiconductor industry on Monday with a $1.8bn offer for Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, the loss-making Singaporean foundry chipmaker.In a deal likely to herald further consolidation in a troubled sector, the emirate’s Advanced Technology Investment Company plans to merge the Singaporean company into Globalfoundries, its joint venture with Advanced Micro Devices of the US. The move would create the world’s fourth-biggest foundry chipmaker.Atic has offered S$2.68 a share for Chartered, slightly above its Friday close of S$2.66.Temasek, the Singaporean state-owned investment agency, has agreed to sell its 62 per cent stake to Atic. That values the company at S$2.5bn (US$1.8bn), rising to S$5.6bn, including debt and convertible redeemable preference shares.Steven Pelayo, technology analyst at HSBC in Hong Kong, said the deal had the potential to create a “formidable” competitor to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics, the two biggest manufacturers.He said: “It is a very complementary idea to put these two companies [Chartered and Globalfoundries] together”.However, Brayan Lai, credit analyst at Crédit Agricole in Hong Kong, said he was “sceptical on the turnround of the merged entity”, although it would have abundant financial resources. The deal provides an exit for Temasek from a troublesome long-term investment.A senior executive at Temasek, which in August unveiled a revised charter focusing on long-term sustainable returns, said the company was happy with the deal’s terms.Rohit Sipahimalani, managing director for investments, said “In our view, the valuation is fair and the proposed acquisition will give us the opportunity to realise a fair value for our investment”.Atic’s offer, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, represents a premium of 14.2 per cent to Chartered’s 30 trading-day volume-weighted average price on the Singapore Stock Exchange.Jim Norling, chairman of Chartered, said the deal reflected the company’s requirement for long-term development capital, as well as the need to provide a return for Temasek.He said: “Given the importance of scale and the need for substantial, continued capital investment, and having carefully assessed all strategic options available to Chartered, we believe this transaction provides Chartered shareholders the opportunity to realise their investment”.Waleed Al Mokarrab, Atic chairman, said the acquisition would give Chartered “access to Atic’s long-term capital and related assets”.Chartered is advised by Morgan Stanley Asia and Citigroup Global Markets, and on Monday appointed Deutsche Bank as an independent financial adviser to shareholders on the fairness of the offer. Atic is being advised by Credit Suisse.Electronics is Singapore biggest industrial sector, employing about 100,000 people and accounting for 40 per cent of the city-state’s non-oil exports. However, its position is declining amid falling exports and growing job losses.In a separate development, shares in Toshiba of Japan were up 3.9 per cent at Y484 in morning trading on speculation that the group, one of the world’s biggest makers of Nand flash memory chips, was in talks with Chartered and Globalfoundries about outsourcing production of some of its next-generation system chips to help cut costs.
228;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-09-07T18:35:01Z;Abu Dhabi to take on Taiwan’s chipmakers;;"Semiconductor manufacturing, with its multibillion-dollar factories and recurring need to upgrade technology, has never been an industry for the light-pocketed.Abu Dhabi’s state-owned Advanced Technology Investment Company, the latest entrant in the $20bn contract chipmaking industry, is proving it has the capital to back its ambition of making Abu Dhabi a chip industry heavyweight through Monday’s $1.8bn deal to buy a majority stake in Singapore’s Chartered Semiconductor.The Chartered acquisition gives Atic a shot at breaking Taiwanese chipmakers’ dominance of the market.Chartered was the third-biggest contract chipmaker until Atic invested $1.4bn to help AMD spin off its manufacturing arm into a new company named Globalfoundries last October.Chartered and Globalfoundries combined would have a 30 per cent market share of the contract chipmaking industry, roughly the size of number two United Microelectronics Corp of Taiwan, this year, says Tan Kay-yang, principal research analyst at Gartner.While this is short of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 50 per cent market share, Atic is expected to overtake UMC next year as Globalfoundries’ capacity increases, Mr Tan says.He says “TSMC is taking Globalfoundries very seriously. Abu Dhabi is committed and they have a deep pocket”.Buying Chartered gives Atic exposure to growth in Asia, which Globalfoundries lacked given it only had factories in Europe and the US, and “helps expand their customer network”, Mr Tan adds.Abu Dhabi’s big bet, however, comes as its Taiwan rivals are busy looking to diversify after the industry recorded declining profit margins over the past few years.Both TSMC and UMC have established new business development units to help move into sectors such as green energy.TSMC’s board has approved spending $50m on potential investments in solar energy after Morris Chang, its chairman who is credited for establishing the contract manufacturing model for semiconductors, said the era of rapid growth for the chip industry had ended in 2000 because of intense competition and rising costs of factory upgrades.Ibrahim Ajami, Atic chief executive, who said he “wouldn’t rule out further acquisitions” after absorbing Chartered into Globalfoundries, remained positive about the industry's prospects.He said om Monday: “It continues to be a scale game. TSMC has done very well, and we have a lot of respect for them. They continue to be the market leader, but we believe there is space for another major player”.In spite of a sharp drop in sales since the financial crisis, contract chipmakers are becoming an unlikely long-term beneficiary of the downturn, as many vertically integrated chipmakers become open to the idea of outsourcing their production and focusing on branding and chip design.Japan’s Fujitsu earlier this year outsourced production of its most advanced semiconductors to TSMC in what amounted to a gradual exit from chipmaking.Rival Toshiba said on Monday it was also considering outsourcing some of its chipmaking business, but declined to comment on a report in Japan’s Nikkei newspaper that it could choose Chartered Semiconductor or Globalfoundries.Gartner’s Mr Tan says because of this trend “there are opportunities in high-end manufacturing”.Douglas Grose, Globalfoundries’ chief executive, said in an earlier interview that he was keen to focus on a handful of potential clients that demand cutting-edge technology.Bhavtosh Vajpayee, head of technology research at CLSA, says this means Globalfoundries was unlikely to become a serious competitor to TSMC until its new factory in New York became operational in 2012.he wrote in a research note: “Chartered meanwhile shall fill in the generic mid end capacity”.However, analysts expect Atic’s acquisition to increase pressure for consolidation on other contract chipmakers, such as UMC or China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.The acquisition means “existing players in the second tier are left to play all by themselves,” Mr Tan says.UMC has already said it wants fully to acquire Chinese chipmaker He
Jian, in which it has a 15 per cent stake, but is barred from doing so by Taiwanese law.“Consolidation is afoot in the foundry industry,” Mr Vajpayee says."
229;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-30T15:33:39Z;Taiwan’s TSMC sees rebound in demand;;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reported an 87.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in revenue for the three months to June on Thursday, underscoring the speed with which the technology sector has rebounded from its worst crisis in recent years.TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, commands half of the contract chip market.It is seen as a bellwether for the high-tech industry because its chips go into products from computers to mobile phones to machinery for companies such as Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices.The company suffered one of its worst drops in revenue in the first quarter as the impact of the slowdown moved up the complex technology supply chain.Chipmakers such as TSMC, which sit at the head of that chain, suffered outsized losses as customers chose to run down their inventory stock rather than continue to place orders.With high-tech brands and manufacturers restocking and with rising Chinese demand for electronics from Beijing’s stimulus measures, TSMC and United Microelectronics, its smaller rival, saw an influx of new orders in the second quarter.The company said the “second quarter saw a sharp rebound in the demand for semiconductors across all applications”, which helped boost revenue to T$74bn (US$2.25bn) and profits to T$24.4bn.This was 15 times more than the first-quarter profit but short of the T$28.8bn recorded a year ago.Morris Chang, the TSMC chairman and chief executive who returned to run the company in June, said that he expected the improvement in conditions to last through the third quarter but expressed concern that the fourth might be slightly worse than the third.Bill Lu, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said doubts remained about whether the recovery could be sustained.“We believe investors are waiting for data on back-to-school demand to determine whether growth can be sustained post 3Q,” Mr Lu wrote.TSMC’s results come a day after Taiwan’s UMC, the second biggest contract chipmaker, reported greatly improved results.UMC returned to profitability for the first time in a year as revenue more than doubled in the second quarter compared with the first.Semiconductor Manufacturing International, China’s biggest chipmaker, this week said second-quarter revenues had risen 82 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but remained in the red.Infineon, Europe’s second largest chipmaker, this week forecast sales growth after reporting a smaller loss than expected.
230;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-22T23:05:43Z;Qualcomm sales surge hints at sector recovery;;Qualcomm, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, reported a surge in demand in its June quarter amid growth in the 3G market.The San Diego company raised its guidance for its fiscal year in another sign that the chip industry was recovering from a slump in demand.Intel, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and now Qualcomm have all reported in the past 10 days that customers have begun replenishing their stocks after running them down in the recession.“Things have pretty much come back on the chipset side,” said Paul Jacobs, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.“The lowest part of the trough was 63m [chipset sales] a couple of quarters ago. Now we shipped 94m this quarter, so it’s a pretty substantial recovery.”However, Qualcomm predicted lower shipments for its fourth quarter of 88m to 92m chipsets. The company said there had been a couple of significant operator launches in the June quarter and it still expected growth in the second half of the calendar year.It predicted full fiscal year revenues of $10.25bn to $10.45bn, up $200m to $400m on its previous estimate, and operating income of $3.3bn to $3.4bn, an increase of $250m to $350m on its earlier prediction.“Smartphone demand is still strong and the other trend we see is that 3G continues to be strong – we are looking at 3G passing 2G next year in terms of shipments,” said Mr Jacobs.Qualcomm also signalled it was nearing the end of extensive legal battles over its business practices, patent issues and the royalties it charges for use of its CDMA technology for mobile phones.It said it had been advised that the Fair Trade Commission in South Korea would issue a decision shortly over its alleged anticompetitive practices there.“We are also anticipating that the KFTC will impose a fine . . . we expect it will be substantial and could have a material impact on our results,” it said.Qualcomm has already settled with Nokia, the handset maker, and Broadcom, a rival wireless chipmaker, with both withdrawing complaints made to the authorities in the US, Europe and the KFTC.The company reported revenues of $2.74bn, compared to $2.76bn a year earlier. Profits of $903m, down from $915m a year ago, were an improvement on a $46m loss in the previous quarter. Its shares fell 5 per cent in extended trading, after rising about 9 per cent over the past week.

Its shares ended down 3.6 per cent at $24.45.Bank of New York Mellon also lost ground after reporting earnings slightly below expectations, falling 6.2 per cent to $27.32.The markets followed several banks and bounced back during the day.“Even if you have a few people hitting the “sell” button on results, there are others underneath willing to buy the dips,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The markets were also helped by optimism on housing after figures showed an unexpected rise in home prices in May.Mr Bernanke told the Senate he saw a “levelling-off” in house prices, although he added that foreclosures could yet pressure them again.KB Home gained 6.1 per cent to $15.03 while Lennarrose 7.7 per cent to $10.62 and DR Horton climbed 5.6 per cent to $10.38.Starbucks led the consumer sector higher after cost cuts helped it swing to a profit and beat analysts’ forecasts. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $17.39.Resilience in consumer spending helped Applereport much better earnings than expected, with sales and profit margins both beating expectations. The stock picked up 3.5 per cent to $156.74.“The consumer is responding to Apple’s product introductions as well as price cuts, which is a good sign for the rest of the market,” said Bill Shope, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 954.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 8,881.26. But the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 1,926.38.Newspaper stocks performed well after Media General reported a quarterly profit and said declines in advertising revenue were beginning to ease. The company’s shares rose 84.3 per cent to $4.33.Of the blue-chip newspaper publishers, the New York Times Company, which reports results today, rose 3.1 per cent to $6.62.PepsiCo slipped as its quarterly revenues disappointed. Even though the company topped earnings expectations, the shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $55.89.In the technology sector, the shine from Apple’s results was dulled by disappointment over results from AMD, the microchip maker.Sliding sales saw the company miss estimates, and the shares gave up 13 per cent to $3.55.But Yahoo was able to overcome weak advertising revenues and beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings. Its shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $17.37.Boeing was the latest Dow component to beat its earnings estimates as it saw growth in its defence programs, but the shares fell 2.4 per cent to $42.Eli Lilly and Pfizersaw mixed fortunes even after both drugmakers reported better earnings than expected and raised their full-year forecasts.Eli Lilly fell 1.9 per cent to $33.79 while Pfizer picked up 1.1 per cent to $15.87.
232;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-22T16:46:56Z;Intel launches appeal over €1bn fine;;Intel on Wednesday launched a legal appeal against the record-breaking €1.06bn ($1.5bn) fine handed down by Europe’s competition authorities.The European Commission accused the world’s largest chipmaker of abusing its dominant market position and using illegal sales practices to encourage computer manufacturers to carry its micro-processor chips.The fine, which was announced in May after a decade-long investigation by the European Commission, was the largest single penalty imposed on a company for antitrust breaches in Europe.The Commission ordered Intel to “cease illegal practices immediately” and said it would monitor future conduct.The US company confirmed on Wednesday that it was filing a formal appeal against the penalty with the Court of First Instance, one of the leading European courts in Luxembourg.Intel, which last week included the impact of the fine in its second quarter results on a GAAP basis, is not believed to have asked for any so-called “interim measures” – that is, some form of court stay.Interim measures are only granted by the European courts in very rare cases.In its results last week, the US company made a better than expected profit per share of 18 cents, but on a GAAP basis and after the fine, this became a loss of 7 cents a share.The company has not detailed the grounds on which it is appealing, but these are thought to include some of its earlier arguments that officials at the European Commission either misinterpreted or ignored evidence that the company believes reflects a more favourable light on its conduct.When the Commission handed down the fine, Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said he believed the decision was “wrong” and had ignored “the reality of a highly-competitive microprocessor marketplace”.In its decision, the Commission claimed that illegal practices by Intel, which involved conditional rebates to computer makers such as Acer and Dell, had the effect of pushing out competitors and took place between late 2002 and the end of 2007.They also included illegal payments to German retailer Media Markt on condition that it sold exclusively Intel-based personal computers.The size of the fine was a reflection of the scale of Intel’s sales into Europe during that period, and the length of time the abuse continued.The company faces ongoing investigations into the same issue in the US, by both the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney-general’s office, as well as a damages action brought by AMD, Intel’s main rival, and the source of the original complaint to the competition authorities.

234;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-20T18:33:39Z;Moore’s Law reaches its economic limits;Costs push chipmakers towards ‘fabless’ model;A leading chip manufacturing company will break ground on a 200-acre site in upstate New York this week, starting construction on a $4.2bn state-of-the-art factory.But these days, new chip “fabs” are as rare as the April 1965 issue of Electronics Magazine.Intel paid $10,000 for a single copy of the magazine in 2005. This was the issue which featured an article by the company’s co-founder Gordon Moore, in which he predicted transistor densities on chips would continue to double, about every two years.In accordance with what we now know as Moore’s Law, we have moved from pieces of silicon with 16 transistors on them in the 1960s to ones with 600m today. More than 1m could fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence.Globalfoundries’ “Fab 2” in New York will achieve another level of miniaturisation when it begins volume production in 2012, making chips with circuitry just 28 billionths of a metre wide.But its construction is a rarity because of another aspect of Moore’s Law. We have yet to reach a scientific limit to further miniaturisation, but an economic one is fast approaching, according to some experts.“The high cost of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is making continued chipmaking advancements too expensive to use for volume production, relegating Moore’s Law to the laboratory and altering the fundamental economics of the industry,” wrote Len Jelinek, chief analyst for semiconductor manufacturing at the iSuppli research firm, last month.Mr Jelinek predicted that Moore’s Law would no longer drive volume chip production from 2014, sparking intense debate in Silicon Valley.His reasoning is that circuitry widths will dip to 20nm (nanometres or billionths of a metre) or below by that date. But the tools to make them would be too expensive for companies to recover their costs over the lifetime of production.The costs and risks involved in building new fabs have already driven many makers of logic chips (processor or controller chips) towards a “fabless” chip model, where they outsource much of their production to chip “foundries” in the Far East.The 14 chipmakers who were in the game at the 90nm level have been reduced to nine at the current 45nm level. Only two of them – Intel and Samsung – have firm plans for 22nm factories.Intel argues that only companies with about $9bn in annual revenues can afford to be in the business of building new fabs, given the costs of building and operating the factories and earning a decent 50 per cent margin. That leaves just Intel, Samsung, Toshiba, Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics.Andy Bryant, Intel’s chief administrative officer, says Gordon Moore’s original article was an economics paper rather than a technical treatise.“Moore’s Law is really not about the science, it’s about the business model that the science drives,” he says. “What Gordon said was the model is driven by the cost reductions that are allowed – the science takes the technology into more and more devices and the volume will explode because the cost comes down, so it is an economic model.”So as long as demand can be maintained by consumers and businesses wanting the latest gadgets and features, Moore’s Law, and the huge investments it entails, will continue to make economic sense for fab builders.“You see a lot of companies, who can no longer afford to be in manufacturing, wanting to declare the end of Moore’s Law, but it’s not in the near future,” he says.However, with fewer companies to whom they can sell factory equipment and tools, these are tough times for big suppliers such as Applied Materials.Hans Stork, Applied’s chief technology officer, says there will have to be consolidation among chip equipment suppliers. But he sees opportunities in other segments of a chip market split three ways into logic chips, D-Ram memory and Nand flash storage.“We still see considerable upside on the storage side, there’s a lot of innovative work being done on solid-state drives to make them mainstream – that could be a big lever for us,” he says.Those chip companies priced out of the market for the next level of miniaturisation are expected to extend the life of current technology with fresh innovation and marketing ploys.Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices chose to split the company, with AMD becoming a fabless chipmaker and the new Globalfoundries spun off as a fab owner to make chips for AMD and others. Globalfoundries is working with IBM and has been bankrolled by the Abu Dhabi government. Business alliances and government support are other ways that companies can compete with Intel and Samsung.“No one company or country is really going to drive this forever, I think it’s going to be collaborative in many forms that we are yet to see,” says Doug Grose, Globalfoundries chief executive.This is the second in a series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry.

235;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-19T18:10:22Z;Makers of chips seek a wider audience;;The financial downturn has hit the semiconductor industry hard.Orders for microchips came to an almost complete standstill at the end of 2008 as computers and mobile phones languished unsold on shop shelves.Global semiconductor sales fell 2.8 per cent last year and are expected to fall a further 21.5 per cent to $195.6bn in 2009, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, last week reported a sales revival driven by consumers buying cheaper, smaller netbooks but revenues fell in Europe and there were weaker sales recorded with business customers.The semiconductor industry is used to severe cyclical swings. It has seen six significant cycles since the 1970s, caused by global recessions and oversupply.The last one – in 2001 when the dotcom bubble burst – was worse than the current downturn with sales falling 45 per cent.But this time around, strategic issues – including soaring development costs and the intensifying need to innovate – have combined with the effects of the downturn to unleash forces that are threatening to reshape the industry completely.Crucially, the computer industry – one of the driving forces of the semiconductor sector – has been slowing, forcing companies to look elsewhere for growth.PC shipments are expected to decline 6 per cent in 2009, according to analysts at Gartner, the research company.But even without the recession, markets were growing saturated. In developed countries, 80 per cent of computers sold are replacements.In the past, Moore’s Law (see Q&A box) – the idea that the chips double their performance power roughly every two years while cutting costs in half – has driven the semiconductor industry forward.Since the invention of the silicon chip in the late-1950s, faster, cheaper chips have spurred the creation of more sophisticated computers. But as consumers become more reluctant to upgrade, Moore’s Law has become a problem.“If you can get twice as many chips from the same amount of silicon every two years, you need to double the number of computers sold every two years, or find new markets,” said Richard Doherty, research director at Envisioneering, the technology assessment and research consultancy.Intel, which has dominated the market for computer chips, has been eyeing the mobile and netbook markets as potential areas for growth.It is easy to see the temptation. Netbooks were the fastest growing segment of the computer market last year and about 1bn mobile phones are sold each year, dwarfing the 250m computers sold in the same period.Chipmakers are also looking at embedding chips into a range of devices from fridges to blood pressure monitors and television sets that could benefit from being connected to the internet.However, a switch will not be easy as the market for mobile phone chips is highly competitive and requires far smaller, more power-efficient chips than those used in the computer industry.Development costs are also becoming a burden as chips become smaller and smaller.The tiny transistors that make up chips have shrunk from 130 nanometers in 2000 to 45nm, and even 32nm, today.At 45nm, 2,000 transistors can be packed into the width of a single human hair and the cost of developing a chip using these is $20m to $50m. With 32nm technology, the costs can leap to $75m.Three European chip companies recently merged their mobile phone operations into a single group – ST Ericsson – saying they needed scale to keep up with huge research and development costs.Shane Rau, analyst at IDC said: “The manufacture of chips has become very capital-intensive .“Only companies like Intel and Samsung are able to maintain their own fabrication facilities because they have scale.”Many chip companies have closed their manufacturing units and have their chips made by specialist foundries in Asia, such as TSMC, UMC and Chartered Semiconductor.Texas Instruments is gradually leaving manufacturing, especially at the high end, and AMD, Intel’s rival on computer chips, spun out its factories into a separate company last year.Many companies may also be forced to look at a new technology roadmap beyond Moore’s Law.Some may focus on different types of chips – such as radio receivers, power control or sensors – where shrinking sizes are not the key driver.ST Microelectronics, for example, has a small but thriving part of its business making accelerometers.Or they may need to experiment with new materials and work at nano-scale – manipulating chips at the atomic level – in order to continue. Only the very biggest companies will be able to afford the investment this requires.George Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said: “We are now facing the research dilemma. Will the semiconductor industry lead the transition to the era of nanotechnology – or will we go the way of the vacuum tube manufacturers?”None of the companies that made vacuum tubes for the first computers in the 1940s and 1950s survived the switch to silicon. It is a sobering thought for the sector.This is the first in a FT series on the challenges facing the semiconductor industry
236;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-15T21:32:35Z;Intel triggers Wall Street rally;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying its best day since early April, as strong earnings from chipmaker Intel encouraged investors to buy riskier assets.Stocks in material, industrial, energy and financial companies, which are sensitive to growth, all did well.But technology kicked off the rally after Intel reported better revenues and profits than expected and its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $18.05.The microchip sector was given a further boost by better-than-expected results from Altera, which beat revenues and profit estimates and, like Intel, said profit margins would rise this year. Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses. The shares soared 28.9 per cent to $4.50.
237;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-07-14T23:06:40Z;Intel signals revival in chip demand;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, reported its strongest pick-up in business in more than 20 years on Tuesday, giving a major lift to the PC industry and technology sector.Intel reported second-quarter revenues of $8bn, up 12 per cent on the first quarter and well ahead of analyst expectations of $7.23bn. Its profit of $0.18 a share also easily exceeded a consensus of $0.8.The chipmaker was the first big technology company to report earnings this season, providing a boost to the sector and the wider market.Intel shares rose 7 per cent to $18.05 in after-hours trading in New York, with the S&P 500 stock index futures rising 1 per cent and the dollar extending gains over the yen.“Intel’s second quarter results reflect improving conditions in the PC market segment with our strongest first- to second-quarter growth since 1988 and a clear expectation for a seasonally stronger second half,” Paul Otellini, chief executive, said in a statement.Intel’s outlook also exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts. It predicted sales of $8.5bn, plus or minus $400m, in the current quarter, compared with average analyst estimates of $7.86bn.The Silicon Valley company’s non-GAAP results did not reflect the $1.45bn fine imposed by the European Commission in May, which was included on a GAAP basis to drive Intel to a loss of $398m or $0.07 a share.Intel is appealing the decision by the commission that it abused its dominant market position – its processors are in four out of every five computers – with practices that discouraged PC makers from using chips by its rival, AMD.Mr Otellini told an analyst conference call that its second-quarter performance was clearly better than the group’s expectations and demand had strengthened throughout the quarter.“Our customers signalled increased confidence for a seasonal second half with their ordering patterns. I believe this reflects how critical personal and enterprise computing has become to the world.”Stacy Smith, chief financial officer, said customers had been replenishing their inventories after letting them run down in the first quarter to deal with the effects of the global recession.As a result, sales of its Atom microprocessor, used in small mobile computing devices, rose 65 per cent on the previous quarter.However, while there had been a strong rebound in mobile chip shipments, demand for its enterprise microprocessors remained weak.Mr Otellini reported strength in the US and Asia-Pacific markets, particularly China, helped there by a government stimulus programme. Europe trailed the growth in other regions, he said.Gross margins were higher than the company expected at 50.8 per cent and it predicted margins rising to 53 per cent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, for the third quarter.
238;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Carry small, thin and light, live large;;What’s next in personal computing after netbooks? The answer, it seems, depends very much on what directions the makers of microprocessors are taking.If you were to ask Intel – at its Research Day this week - the answer would be Mids (mobile internet devices). AMD said in a briefing it was “thin and light” or “ultrathin”, while Freescale came up with some interesting-looking “smartbook” concept machines (pictured) at this month’s Computex trade show in Taiwan.Via is pushing cheaper “thin and light” notebooks for its Nano processor, while Nvidia’s Tegra processor is for machines hot on playing multimedia and displaying long battery life. Qualcomm also talks about “smartbooks” for its Snapdragon processor.Intel sees several new markets for its energy-efficient Atom processor, including netbooks, Mids and embedded applications, such as in the automotive industry. It sees all these markets being unified by the Intel Architecture and this was clearly displayed at its Research Day as its “rockstar” boffins showed applications in cars, classrooms, the living room and the office.The emphasis was on how different devices such as notebooks, Mids, set-top boxes and in-car systems could work together using Intel processors, and an office environment showed collaboration on different interfaces including a tabletop display similar to Microsoft’s Surface computer. More in the audioBoo below.Intel Labs’ vision and slogan is “Carry Small, Live Large” and includes using wireless connectivity to locate and use nearby resources such as remote displays and storage devices.Meanwhile, AMD has been briefing on its second-generation “ultrathins”. It does not have a competitive processor to compete with Intel in netbooks so it came up with this “thin and light” concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.The idea is that consumers are becoming dissatisfied with the limitations of netbooks and want something more powerful, but still light and affordable.“We’ve blazed the trail for a whole new category,” Patrick Moorhead, a vice president in AMD’s Worldwide Marketing Group, told me.“We saw there was a spot between these very expensive ultra portables like the Macbook Air and Dell Adamo and the netbooks. This market is taking off and even our competitor [Intel] has just acknowledged at Computex that it’s all about ultrathins.”Two years ago at Computex, the buzz was about ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), last year it was netbooks, this year it was ultrathins. “Thin is in,” he said.AMD had just one design win – for an HP ultrathin – at the beginning of the year, but it says 11 manufacturers are bringing out 24 machines for the holiday season, using AMD dual-core rather than single-core processors and better graphics chips. Prices will be $600-$900.That sounds impressive, but Qualcomm, Freescale and the other chipmakers are all touting forthcoming machines that show off the attributes of their processors and give another take on these mobile categories.As Richard Waters points out in his analysis of these attempts to redefine personal computing, there may end up being a big winner out there, but there are certain to be some equally big losers.
239;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;The European Commission strikes again;;"On May 13, 2009, the European Commission fined Intel just over €1bn for its supposed abuse of its dominant market position in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty. That decision marks yet another effort by commissioner Neelie Kroes to ratchet up the enforcement of EC competition policy, all in the name of preventing consumer harm. Yet the devil lies in this one detail. The aggrieved “consumer” of Intel is its long-time junior rival, AMD, which filed three separate complaints against Intel between 2000 and 2006.It is not just happenstance that one American company decided to pursue another American company in Europe. During those years, the Bush administration kept — wisely in my view — a tight lid on monopolisation cases brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the parallel provision to Article 82. Yet recently, that commendable restraint has gone by the boards, as the new US Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, Christine Varney, unceremoniously dumped the Bush 2008 Report on Single Firm Conduct in a speech given two days before the Intel decision came down, which I have already criticised elsewhere.We now face the grim possibility that disappointed competitors will be able to wage routinely a two-front war against any dominant firm. But for what purpose? Defining consumer harm in Article 82 cases is always elusive. In this instance, the EC wisely refrains from asserting that offering low prices themselves constitute an illegal competitive practice. Indeed, these low prices count as an immediate and unambiguous consumer benefit, which at the very least has to be set off against any alleged harm by Intel. Indeed it would be catastrophic if a dominant firm could avoid legal sanctions only by ceding market share to its rivals.So, if the dominant firm may compete on price, what additional ingredient is needed to make its unilateral conduct illegal? One suspect practice is to keep its rebates secret. But secrecy has its economic virtues. Large chip manufacturers, like large drug companies, face a daunting challenge in bringing new products to market. A new chip design costs billions. Any effort therefore to charge only the marginal cost for each unit has to fail, because it would not allow any firm, dominant or otherwise, to recoup its initial costs over the life of the new product.Each producer, therefore, has to figure out how to price its goods to various customers in ways that will allow it, bit by bit, to recover those high fixed costs before the chip is obsolete. Making public the price to any individual customer will spur its rivals to clamour for the same deal, so that in the end Intel, or any other firm, will be reluctant to make a concessions on one account if it knows it has to give the same break to everyone else. Secrecy allows a firm to cut different deals with different firms in different market niches. Prices therefore trend lower. The absence of parity across the deals simply reflects the relative bargaining position of the various firms. It does not indicate an abuse of market power.If secrecy doesn’t do it, then what about exclusivity? Here the EC denounced Intel for conditioning its sales on the willingness of buyers to purchase anywhere from 80 to 100 percent of its products from Intel. The EC makes the odd observation that this practice will inhibit new firms from coming into the market. Trouble is, no matter what pricing policies Intel adopts, for the foreseeable future its only rival is AMD.What really matters therefore is how these exclusives operate in a duopoly. In this context, one immediate consumer benefit is that Intel will have to pay its customers to gain an exclusive, which again translates into lower short-term prices. In addition, Intel is likely to experience some real pushback from key customers, precisely because they want to play off Intel against AMD. Indeed some customers might give AMD an exclusive to stay out of Intel’s clutches. After all, AMD as the nondominant firm is free to offer whatever deal it likes.The overall mix of gains and losses therefore is highly complex. Yet the EC has offered no global analysis of the Intel / AMD dispute that explains why it should initiate costly proceedings that don’t produce any clear social gain. From this vantage point, it looks as though its latest regulatory caper has a negative expected return. Let’s just hope that Ms Varney does not try to outdo Ms Kroes in her misguided crusade. On competition policy, populist outcries are usually harmful to consumer welfare, on both sides of the Atlantic.Richard A.

240;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-05-27T21:15:31Z;US regulators run to catch up with EU;If markets are failing, it takes the long arm of government to protect the invisible hand, says Irwin Stelzer;"For once, America is running at top speed to catch up with the European Union. In levying a record fine against Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, the EU competition authorities have let it be known that a dominant company’s efforts to crush rivals by threatening customers or rigging a price schedule will not be tolerated. President Barack Obama’s new team is in the early stages of saying “we agree”. After years in which the Bush administration allowed dominant companies to just about do as they pleased, Christine Varney, the president’s new antitrust cop, is running around Washington telling business groups that the enforcement hiatus is over.Which is of special importance to high-tech industries. The new shift “will be bad news for heavyweights in the tech industries – companies like Google and Microsoft”, says Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at University of Iowa College. He might be right. If he is, any believer in the ability of free, competitive markets to produce a rapid rate of innovation and prices that do not include monopoly profits can only add: “Good thing.”I studied and wrote about the benefits to society of vigorous competition for decades before I became a consultant to Advanced Micro Devices; and I was not directly involved in that company’s legal challenges to Intel. Consumers benefit from fair prices and unimpeded innovation, and society benefits from the social mobility provided by rags-to-riches entrepreneurs who often gamble their personal savings on a new idea. But in recent years, the high-technology industries have persuaded US enforcement officials that they are different – that all that antitrust stuff is fine for “smokestack industries” but not for them.Leave aside the question of just how to define a high-tech industry. After all, the robots and software in any auto plant hardly cause smoke to come out of the stack. Concentrate instead on what society needs from enterprises of the kind found in Silicon Valley. It needs rapid innovation. That comes from newcomers, either directly when they enter a market, or indirectly from the pressure they put on incumbents to innovate, surrender market share or, worse still, pass from the scene.Surely, the need to keep entry open, to prevent coercion of customers, to penalise anticompetitive pricing and other practices is as great, or perhaps even greater, when we deal with the innovative sector of the economy. The venture capitalists who often provide backing for new entrepreneurs know this – without some assurance that the newcomer will not be unfairly squashed, they will zip their wallets.This is why the Obama administration’s new tack, in effect a repudiation of the soft settlement that the Bush administration negotiated with Microsoft, is so welcome. Nervous executives and their lawyers are saying that all of this is nothing more than a response to whingeing competitors that, unable to compete in the marketplace, try to win in the courtroom. There are, of course, such instances. But surely Ms Varney can winnow the wheat from the chaff and pursue only those complaints that appear to her to be based on legitimate concerns about anti-competitive practices. The fact that a complaint comes from a non-dominant company is no reason to dismiss it out of hand.So this frequent critic of the EU bureaucracy, its tendency to regulate when markets are best left to work their efficiencies, has to raise two cheers to Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. But only two. She may have erred in claiming that Intel’s fine will benefit EU taxpayers. That has given critics reason to complain that she is, in effect, taxing an American company to ease the plight of over-taxed Europeans. Ms Kroes should, instead, have found a way to distribute any funds she might obtain to the consumers injured by the practices she has found illegal – perhaps making payments to consumers in proportion to their purchase of Intel chips. Not administratively easy, but helpful in winning support in the US for more vigorous antitrust enforcement.Take it from a conservative economist who prefers less to more government: if markets are not competitive, or if they are otherwise failing to function properly, it takes the long arm of government to protect the invisible hand. Let us hope that this view is shared by Mr Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Sonia Sotomayor– and that she is prepared to take on the formidable and otherwise estimable Justice Antonin Scalia, who has little use for the antitrust laws.The writer is director of economic policy studies at the Hudson Institute"
241;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-05-21T02:37:21Z;BofA capital raising lifts mood on Wall Street;;US stocks rebounded on Wednesday morning following moderate losses during the previous session as investors welcomed the news that Bank of America has successfully raised $13.5bn in recent days through issuing new stock.The bank’s shares fell overnight on reports that it was offering an extra 825m shares at $10 each, but rose again in early trade after the company said it had been successful in selling a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last Friday. This will go towards making up the $33.9bn in extra capital the government has asked the company to raise following the stress tests on bank balance sheets. After half an hour of trade, the stock was up 8 per cent at $12.15.Other banking stocks also performed well. Citigroup climbed 4 per cent to $3.92 while JPMorgan advanced 1.7 per cent to $36.40.PNC, meanwhile, rose 0.4 per cent to $43.44 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money, but would do so “over the next couple of years”. This came in contrast to moves from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days to pay back the government as soon as possible.But Wall Street was less encouraged by the news that Regions Financial wanted to raise $1.25bn through offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s tests. Investors worried about stock dilution and the shares fell 3.8 per cent to $5.04.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global warned the stellar rises seen in financial stocks since the rally began in March might not last. “The bank shares have lost a catalyst to rally near term as news on TARP repayment may not be known until June 8, and the credit card bill of rights is likely to become law and create a headwind to profits,” he wrote.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.6 per cent to 92251 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,576.56 points and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.5 per cent to 1,760.7 points.The markets were also supported by energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel. In early trade, US crude was $1.61 higher at $61.26 per barrel. Shares in Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.80 while Exxon Mobil picked up 0.9 per cent to $71.12.Hewlett Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after it reported earnings that were in line with analysts’ estimates. Its shares fell in early trade, losing 3.7 per cent to $35.22 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below what Wall Street is currently expecting.Its rival Dell also suffered the effect of the negative outlook for the computer sales industry, and its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $11.51.But chip manufacturers lent strength to technology stocks after Analog Devices beat Wall Street’s estimates with its quarterly profits, and said it would also make more profit for the full year than currently predicted. The company said there had been strength in sales to telecoms infrastructure customers, and its shares jumped 13.5 per cent to $23.35.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 9.2 per cent to $13.55 and 7.9 per cent to $4.74 respectively.Wall Street was also watching for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJ’s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits.Target’s shares gained 4.6 per cent to $43.85 after it made $0.69 in earnings per share on the back of tight cost controls and a profitabkle credit card business. Consensus estimates were for $0.60.BJ’s beat analysts’ predictions with its profits and raised its full-year profit outlook as consumers looked to cut costs by buying staples at wholesale prices. But the shares slipped 1 per cent to $37.70 as the company said it expected second quarter sales to fall.Procter & Gamble added to confidence over future consumer behaviour after Barclays upgraded the company, saying its sales stood to recover as and when the economy improved. The shares rose 2.4 per cent to $54.23.This gave some relief to the sector after figures released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell last week.Meanwhile Deere & Co, which makes agricultural equipment, lost ground despite beating analysts’ expectations with its second quarter profits, after the company was forced to lower its full-year profit outlook as construction sales continue to drop. The shares were 4.9 per cent down at $45.96.European stocks were up early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was edged 0.1 per cent higher to 872.63 points.

242;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."

The non-essential consumer sector, which has fallen over the week as investors position themselves more defensively, continued to drop, losing ??? per cent in early trade.This spoiled what might otherwise have been a good morning for consumer stocks after two major companies reported better than expected earnings.Macy’s, the department store chain, made a first quarter loss, but it was narrower than estimates had suggested. Its shares were up in early pre-market trade, but fell back after the release of the retail sales data. After half an hour of trading, its shares were 5.7 per cent lower at $11.65.Fellow retail giants Target and Loweâ€™s also fell, losing 3.6 per cent to $41.01 and 2.8 per cent to $18.70 respectively.Dr Pepper Snapple managed to hold on to early gains however after it made much more than the market had expected, despite net sales falling. It also raised its outlook for 2009 earnings, helping to send its shares up 5.3 per cent to $22.38.The economic gloom weighed on the market as a whole. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent to 892.05 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 8322.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1.8 per cent to 1684.63 points.“April’s US retail sales figures are yet another illustration that, although the worst is now over, there is still no evidence of an actual recovery. The 0.4 per cent month-on-month fall in sales confirms our view that the rises in January and February were due to the one-off boost to incomes that has now run its course,” wrote Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.The banking sector was another early faller after BB&T became the latest company to complete a stock sale following the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets.The bank sold 75m shares at $20 each, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of $22.50. It was not one of those named as needing more capital by the government, but followed several of its rivals in going to the market to take advantage of the relatively bullish mood on Wall Street. Its shares lost 8.4 per cent to $20.61.Other banks also slipped in early trade as investors continued to take profits following their recent run up. Fifth Third lost 8.4 per cent to $7.54 while Bank of America gave up 4.8 per cent to $11.67.The financial sector also felt the impact of figures showing that mortgage applications fell more than 8 per cent during the week ending May 8. There were some encouraging signs however in the rising number of new mortgage applications as compared with refinancing activity, as well as in words from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secrtary, who said he saw “welcome signs” in the housing market.Chip manufacturers rose overnight after Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said that orders and billing patterns were “slightly better than expected” so far during the second quarter. The company’s shares picked up 0.2 per cent to $15.24.This helped the company’s shares overcome the effect of a record $1.5bn fine imposed by the EU on the company for abusing its dominant market position. Advanced Micro Devices, the company Intel was accused of squeezing out of the market, gained 2.5 per cent to $4.46.But other rivals lost the ground initially gained on the back of Mr Otellini’s words after the retail data showed sales of electronic goods and appliances fared worse than most sectors, falling 2.8 per cent lat month.Applied Materials had seen gains despite reporting a heavier first quarter loss than expected as sales dropped to their lowest levels in seven years, with one unnamed buyer had slashed its order from $1.9bn to $250m. But after the data, the shares fell in pre-market trade, and continued to do so after the opening bell, dropping 4.1 per cent to $11.01.Healthcare stocks were rare winners during the morning, continuing recent gains as investors positioned themselves more defensively, reflecting the likelihood that the recession will continue for some time. Pfizer rose 3.4 per cent to $15.44 while Merck and Schering-Plough, prospective merger partners, gained 4.4 per cent to $26.08 and 2.5 per cent to $23.63 respectively.Frontier Communications, which specialises in delivering telephone services to rural communities, fell after agreeing to buy a chunk of Verizon’s wireline business for $8.6bn, which would triple its business. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $7.55, while Verizon climbed 0.5 per cent to $30.54.MGM, the casino operator, became the latest company to go to the equity markets for funding as it seeks to restructure $14bn worth of debt. The company said it would sell $2.5bn in stocks and bonds, and its shares slumped 17.9 per cent to $10.18.But Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global said the recent equity raising activity was actually a good sign for the market. “Corporate issuance is heavy which is favourable for balance sheet health and the investment grade and high yield markets are holding firm,” he wrote.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 100 index was down 2 per cent to 835.55 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by the Shanghai Composite index, which rose 1.7 per cent to a nine-month high of 2,663.766 points.Bond yields were down, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling 1 basis point to 0.875 per cent and that on the 10-year note dropping 5bp to 3.125 per cent.The dollar was firmer against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.51.Gold was trading $0.44 higher at $927.34 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York.

They closed 6.7 per cent lower at $11.52.Fellow retail giants Target and Lowe’s also dropped, losing 4.8 per cent to $40.47 and 1.6 per cent to $18.92 respectively.Office Depot was a particularly heavy faller, affected also by a downgrade of its debt by Moody’s. The shares slumped 15 per cent to $3.06.Dr Pepper Snapple held on to early gains after it made much more than the market had expected, in spite of net sales falling.The company also raised its outlook for 2009 earnings, helping to send its shares up 3.8 per cent to $22.07.The economic gloom weighed on the market as a whole.

The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3 per cent to 1,664.19 points.“January and February’s good consumer figures came after a boost from the one-off rises in income from Social Security rebates,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.“The downward pressure on consumers is enough to make retail sales continue to fall in the next few months, although not as sharply as at the end of last year.”The banking sector was another faller after BB&T became the latest bank to complete a stock sale following the results of the US government’s stress tests.The bank sold 75m shares at $20 each, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of $22.50.

Fifth Third lost 14.7 per cent to $7.02 while Bank of America gave up 10.2 per cent to $11.01.“I can’t see any reason to hold financial stocks right now,” said Harry Rady, chief executive of Rady Asset Management. “There’s no way to know what is on the banks’ balance sheets yet.”The financial sector also felt the impact of figures showing that mortgage applications fell more than 8 per cent during the week ending May 8.There were some encouraging signs, however, in the rising number of new mortgage applications as compared with refinancing activity, as well as in comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, who said he saw “welcome signs” in the housing market.Chip manufacturers rose overnight after Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said that orders and billing patterns were “slightly better than expected” so far during the second quarter.This helped the company overcome the effect of being given a record $1.5bn fine by the European Union for abusing its dominant market position, and its shares avoided the worst of the selling, falling a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to $15.13.Advanced Micro Devices, the company Intel was accused of squeezing out of the market, gained 0.7 per cent to $4.38.Rival chip manufacturer Applied Materials had seen overnight gains on Mr Otellini’s comments despite reporting a heavier first-quarter loss than expected as sales dropped to their lowest levels in seven years. But the shares fell 4.3 per cent to $10.99 after the retail data, which showed that sales of electronic goods and appliances fared worse than most sectors, falling 2.8 per cent last month.Healthcare stocks were rare winners, maintaining recent momentum as investors positioned themselves defensively on signs the recession would continue for some time.Pfizer gained 2.3 per cent to $15.27, while Merckand Schering-Plough, which are due to merge, rose 2.8 per cent to $25.67 and 1.5 per cent to $23.40 respectively.
245;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
246;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-05-13T19:22:24Z;Intel’s fine;Do the opinions of bureaucrats matter?;"The wheels of justice turn slowly indeed. Almost a full decade after Advanced Micro Devices first complained about its larger competitor, Intel, the European Commission on Wednesday handed down its largest ever fine for abuse of a dominant market position, ordering Intel to pay €1.1bn. The decision follows a 2005 ruling in Japan, and another in Korea last year, that found abuse by Intel. But do the opinions of bureaucrats matter?Shareholders don’t think so. The share price of Intel, which had sales last year of $38bn, not to mention a market capitalisation of $85bn and $10bn of cash, barely moved on the news. The company disputes the finding and will appeal, further lengthening the process. European attempts at intervention with Microsoft, including then-record fines, trundle along, with little effect on the company’s behaviour. Investors are far more interested in Intel’s attempts to cut costs, improve margins and control inventories, the main subject of its analyst day on Tuesday.The ruling may give some help to AMD. Favourable precedent could help the company’s civil suit against Intel set for trial in Delaware next March. Separate investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney-general’s office are ongoing, and any form of settlement would help relieve AMD’s debt load.In terms of the market for microprocessors, however, little will change. The practice in question is allegedly restrictions attached to volume rebates, not the principle of rebates themselves. With about 70 per cent of the market for microprocessors – the central engine of every computer – Intel benefits from a self-reinforcing scale advantage that allows it to outspend AMD on research and development by more than four to one. In technology, trends in market share are rarely reversed. Plodding regulators can do little to change that fact.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

247;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:58:28+0000;Intel looks beyond EU litigation;;Intel gave an annual briefing on its business to scores of analysts at its Silicon Valley headquarters this week, but a record fine from the European Union was never on the agenda.Hours before Wednesday’s decision in Brussels, Paul Otellini, chief executive, told a question-and-answer session that rumours of a fine were just that, and he would not discuss them.Instead, analysts were shown charts, including one showing Intel’s healthy cash balance of $10bn.“Solid cash, solid returns, enough to pay the dividends and to handle any kinds of issues we may have, even in tough times,” Mr Otellini said. The implication seemed to be that a fine of €1.06bn ($1.45bn) would not trouble the world’s biggest chipmaker and, whatever Europe decided, it would be business as usual.But this third regulatory decision against Intel may give it pause for thought. Its practices have been condemned in a judgment of more than 500 pages and with a fine that dwarfs the $25m levied by Korea’s Fair Trade Commission last year, as well as the penalty-free wrist slapping meted out by Japan’s FTC in 2005, over similar concerns to the EU’s.“I think Intel would be wise to seriously reconsider its conduct before these penalties begin to mount up,” said David Balto, former policy director of the US Federal Trade Commission, which, along with certain US states, is investigating similar allegations.“What this decision does is substantially raise the likelihood that you are going to see the FTC and the state attorneys-general bringing enforcement action challenging these anti-competitive practices.”On a conference call, Mr Otellini admitted that the investigations and legal action, which also include class action lawsuits consolidated in a civil case brought by its rival AMD in Delaware, had become both costly and time-consuming.“I haven’t found a low-priced lawyer yet that’s any good …and rather than our senior managers spending their time working on new products and out trying to win business, they are spending an awful lot of time in depositions and in courtrooms,” he said. “So to me, that’s counter-productive to the interests of our shareholders.”But there seems little indication Intel will try quickly to settle its disputes, in a move similar to rival Qualcomm. That chipmaker made peace in its major disputes with Nokia and Broadcom over the past year.Intel’s date in court with AMD is in 2010. Meanwhile, US regulatory inquiries rumble on. Intel has pledged to appeal against the EU decision, despite its grounds for doing so being weak, according to Mr Balto.“This case is much more straightforward than the [much-appealed] Microsoft case in Europe,” Mr Balto said. “It’s simply a form of strong-arm tactics to coerce manufacturers and retailers only to use Intel, so I don’t think its chances on appeal are very promising.”In Brussels, commission officials were at pains to stress that their objection was not to rebates offered by Intel – which tend to drive prices down – but to the conditions which Intel attached to them.In particular, officials claimed that, under Intel’s pricing policy, a computer manufacturer which took AMD processors for part of its needs could lose the rebate – or a large part of it – which Intel provided on the rest of its supply.However, the commission did not pursue one charge which it had outlined in its initial statement of objections – namely, that Intel engaged in below-cost pricing against AMD-based products to strategic customers.There was widespread debate in Brussels over what immediate impact the commission’s measures might have on the market, with many observers cautious about predicting any rapid changes.Intel itself sees no change. Mr Otellini said it would continue with its normal practice of offering discounts on volume purchases and had not engaged in the alleged rebates with strings attached.The company still holds about 80 per cent of the market and has taken a decisive lead over AMD in the technology that follows Moore’s Law – Gordon Moore, Intel’s co-founder, predicted accurately that the number of transistors on chips would double every few years. This means cheaper processors, a big price advantage over AMD, and lower cost or more powerful PCs for consumers.“There’s nothing in this ruling that reverses Moore’s Law,” said Mr Otellini.
248;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-05-10T22:43:50Z;Intel braced for competition fine;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by sales, is bracing itself for one of the heaviest penalties levied in Europe for anti-competitive behaviour. The European Union is expected formally to approve action against Intel at its weekly meeting of commissioners on Wednesday.It will be the climax of a near-decade-long investigation into the group’s marketing practices. Lawyers say the fine could top those heaped on Microsoft, which, combined, exceeded €1bn ($1.36bn).The Intel investigation dates back to 2000, when its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, filed a complaint that it was being driven out of the market by Intel’s practices.Four years later, the case gathered steam and, after a series of raids, Intel was formally charged in July 2007. It had allegedly abused its dominant market position and offered illegal rebates to computer manufacturers, which had shut AMD out of the market.After further raids last year, the European Commission accused Intel of using rebates to persuade a leading European retailer to sell only Intel-based personal computers. Intel has consistently denied behaving illegally. “Our business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and good for consumers,” it says.In deciding how to shape and enforce a “cease-and-desist” order, the EU regulator will confront a web of incentives and rebates offered by Intel to customers that have helped it dominate the market for PC microprocessor chips.Opinions are divided on how specific the Commission will be. In theory, if its final decision goes against the company, the fine could be as much as 10 per cent of Intel’s annual worldwide revenues. These totalled $37.6bn in 2008, meaning the maximum level could approach $4bn. However, that 10 per cent level is rarely reached.Intel has refused to discuss whether it would appeal against an adverse decision.After Japan’s fair trade commission ruled in 2005 that Intel had abused its monopoly power, the company heeded a cease-and-desist order, but did not accept guilt or pay a fine.Last June, South Korea’s fair trade commission fined Intel Won26bn ($21m) for abusing its dominant market position there and offering discounts to two Korean PC makers to drive AMD out of the market. This decision is under appeal. Intel had $10.3bn in cash and securities at the end of the first quarter.

250;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-04-28T23:22:29Z;Intel sees green chips of recovery;;Intel, which believes in investing during a downturn to the tune of spending $7bn on new manufacturing facilities over the next two years, is trying to persuade its customers to think the same way.It released a survey and statistics on Tuesday that suggested investing in upgrading three or four-year-old computers will quickly pay for itself.The study, carried out by consultants Wipro involving 106 US and European companies, said that two-thirds of them were continuing to upgrade their computers during the recession.Their reasons were that new PCs were more secure and cheaper to run, to the extent that they paid for themselves with energy and other savings in a matter of months – as low as 10 months for those using Intel’s vPro technology.“Yes, it’s tough economic times but those IT departments who can, are continuing to refresh because they are worried about security, and newer PCs can reduce their operational costs,” Rob Crooke, head of Intel’s Business Client Group, told a press briefing.Mr Crooke avoided comment on whether many businesses were awaiting Windows 7, Microsoft’s next operating system, before upgrading. He speculated that the one-third that were not upgrading as usual either “had no cash, or the industry, including ourselves, had not had the chance to explain to them the benefits.”Figures released by Mercury Reseach on Monday night, on microprocessors sold in the first quarter, suggested conditions were bottoming out for Intel and its rival AMD.Units declined 8.3 per cent on the fourth quarter and 9.1 per cent compared to a year ago, but this compared to an 18 per cent sequential decline in the fourth quarter.Intel lost nearly 4 percentage points of market share to AMD – down to 78.2 per cent from 82.1 per cent in Q4, as enterprise spending was weak and AMD performed better in the consumer PC segment.Notebook sales were also weak and units of Intel’s Atom processor, which has powered the netbook category, were down 33 per cent from the fourth quarter, at 5.6m units.
251;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-04-20T21:23:29Z;Oracle in $7.4bn swoop on Sun;;Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison unveiled a surprise $7.4bn offer for Sun Microsystems on Monday, turning Sun’s collection of widely-used but undervalued software properties into the next targets for his wholesale consolidation of the software industry.The agreed offer, which followed closely on the heels of a failed IBM bid for Sun, threw the spotlight squarely onto Sun’s Java, a programming language developed in the mid-1990s to counter Microsoft’s growing dominance of the software industry.While Sun’s failure to make money from Java has long been a frustration for its shareholders, Mr Ellison declared it “the single most important software asset we have ever acquired” – and at a price, after deducting Sun’s net cash, that is only around half the amount that he paid for PeopleSoft, Oracle’s most famous software acquisition.News that Sun was being bought mainly for its software assets also confirmed the long decline of the server and storage hardware business for which it is better known. A former star of the technology industry, Sun’s value soared above $100bn at the height of the tech boom as its servers became the workhorses of the early internet years. its shares collapsed, however, as a new generation of lower priced technology took hold, and Sun struggled in recent years to justify its continued high cost base and heavy research and development spending.Oracle executives, while saying that the combination of hardware and software represented a new step in the database company’s evolution, left little doubt that they would severely cut back Sun’s hardware business after an acquisition, and analysts speculated that parts of the business would eventually be sold off to other tech companies.Sun’s agreed deal with Oracle, at $9.50 a share in cash, comes two weeks after negotiations for an acquisition by IBM at the same price fell apart.The deal follows a last-minute intervention by Oracle after IBM was once again in discussions with Sun about a deal of its own, according to a person close to the software maker. Oracle first approached Sun late on Thursday about the possibility of a deal, and signed an accord late on Sunday, according to this person.The swiftness is in stark contrast to IBM, which hesitated and dropped its offer price after taking a closer look at Sun’s business in recent weeks. This uncovered issues that reduced the attractions of a deal, including a bonus plan that would hand Sun executives a $600m windfall in the event of an acquisition, according to one person close to IBM.The IBM offer also caused a rift in the Sun camp, as the company debated whether to sell itself to an old rival. Oracle, by contrast, is an old Silicon Valley ally. Along with Netscape and America Online, Sun and Oracle were part of the Gang of Four that stood up to Microsoft at the end of the 1990s, lobbying for the US Justice Department inquiry and long-running lawsuit against what they called the Beast from Redmond.The deal will accelerate Oracle’s transformation from a database software company into an all-round IT systems supplier. Mr Ellison said the company would now be able to sell “completely integrated systems, hardware and software, [which] should be popular and very profitable.”The deal caps a series of big software acquisitions by Oracle, the latest of which, for BEA Systems, made it a big competitor to IBM in the market for “middleware”, the software used to stitch together applications that run over multiple computer systems.Previously, Oracle’s purchases had focused on applications, an area of the software business IBM has chosen not to play in, with the purchases of companies like PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems.The Sun purchase will be worth more to Oracle financially than the PeopleSoft, Siebel and BEA acquisitions combined, said Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-president. It will add 15 cents to its earnings per share in the first year after the deal, and will lift pro forma operating profits by $1.5bn in the first year and $2bn the year after that, she added.Oracle gave no other details for how it expected to achieve these profit targets. Instead, its executives on Monday focused squarely on the long-term strategic advantage to Oracle of owning Sun’s leading software assets, principally Java and the Solaris operating system.Java has become a key part of the software foundation for a generation of IT systems created by companies like Oracle and IBM. Yet even though it is in use on hundreds of millions of PCs, mobile phones and other digital gadgets, Sun has failed to make much money from the software. Licensed cheaply and operated as an open standard, it has become a shared resource for many of the software companies that exist outside the Microsoft camp.Along with Solaris, Sun’s Unix computer operating system, Java is the overriding reason for Oracle’s decision to swoop in at 11th hour and make an offer of more than $7bn for the company, Mr Ellison and other Oracle executives said.The central position of Sun’s software points to how the value has shifted in its wide portfolio of technologies as its core hardware business has crumbled. Though known mainly as a maker of servers, Sun has struggled as its customers have turned to cheaper, standardised machines based on chips made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.Oracle made little effort on Monday to disguise the fact that it sees Sun’s hardware business as merely an afterthought. Publicly, its executives said only that they would make sure hardware became a profitable division within Oracle.According to one person close to the company, that is likely to mean forcing through the sort of aggressive cost-cutting that Sun itself had resisted as an independent company, and narrowing the range of products to focus only on the sort of high-end, complex systems that demand the highest prices.Oracle has already taken one step into hardware, “bundling” its database software into a machine from Hewlett-Packard so that it can sell a complete system. Likewise, with Sun hardware it will be able to sell servers along with sector-specific software aimed at retailers or banks that amount to an “industry in a box,” said Charles Phillips, co-president.Yet this ability to combine hardware and software to build complete integrated IT systems, though loudly trumpeted by Oracle executives on Monday, is not the driving force behind the deal.Rather, Oracle has its eyes set firmly on the Sun software – and combining this with Oracle’s own software throws up a “wildly profitable” opportunity that should make the Sun acquisition much more valuable than any of other deals the acquisitive company has pulled off in recent years, according to the person close to Oracle.Part of the reason, this person says, is that Oracle believes it can make far more from Java than Sun ever did. That is because Sun decided a decade ago virtually to give the software away to make sure it got wide adoption. Many of the Java licenses – including one that Sun granted to Nokia – were for ten years and come up for renewal next year, implying that in future, Oracle will look to extract a higher price for the technology.That message will not be lost on IBM, which itself relies heavily on Java for its own highly profitable portfolio of “middleware”. An IBM spokesperson declined to comment on the strategic implications.However, the person close to Oracle denied that the company would greatly increase the licence fees for Java, or weaken its position as an industry standard by tying it more closely to Oracle’s own software. It was clearly in Oracle’s interest to encourage Java’s continued widespread adoption, so such moves would not make sense, this person said.Likewise, Oracle is likely to find it hard simply to extract a price for Solaris, the operating system which Sun was forced to turn into an open-source product to try to hold its own against Linux. Yet the fate of Solaris is central to Oracle’s future: the company sells more database software licenses running on Solaris than on any other operating system, Mr Ellison said.As a result, keeping Java and Solaris out of arch-rival IBM’s hands was likely to have figured high on Mr Ellison’s list of reasons when deciding to mount his own bid for Sun.
252;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-04-20T17:36:04Z;Java looked upon as the hottest prospect;;The Java programming language, developed by James Gosling, the Sun Microsystems engineer, in the 1990s as an industry standard to counter the growing influence of Microsoft, has since become a key part of the software foundation for a generation of IT systems.Sun, though, failed to make much of a business out of Java, even though it is used on hundreds of millions of PCs, mobile phones and other digital gadgets. Licensed cheaply and operated as an open standard, it has become a shared resource for many of the software companies that exist outside the Microsoft camp.Yet that history belies Java’s true significance, at least according to Oracle. Larry Ellison, the software company’s chief executive, on Monday declared Java “the single most important software asset we have ever acquired” – and at a price, after deducting Sun’s net cash, that is only around half the amount Mr Ellison paid for PeopleSoft, his most famous software acquisition.Along with Solaris, Sun’s Unix computer operating system, Java is the overriding reason for Oracle’s decision to swoop in at the 11th hour and make an offer of more than $7bn for the company, Mr Ellison and other Oracle executives said.The central position of Sun’s software points to how the value has shifted in its wide portfolio of technologies as its core hardware business has crumbled.

253;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-03-30T23:46:19Z;Intel rolls out ‘data centre’ processor;;Intel on Monday introduced a next-generation server chip that it says will let data centres be run more efficiently, with fewer servers needed and less power consumed.The Xeon 5500, codenamed Nehalem, is expected to boost the trend towards cloud computing – where programs are run remotely from data centres – and appeal to companies looking for savings during the recession.Equipment providers such as Cisco, which announced it was entering the server market this month, Dell and Rackable Systems have already announced products using the microprocessor, which went into production in December.Other customers, including Hewlett-Packard, Sun and IBM also announced products on Monday aimed at cost-conscious IT departments and data centre managers running out of room for servers or the power to supply them.“For power-starved data centres, perhaps the biggest advantage the Xeon 5500 brings is dramatically better power efficiency,” said James Staten, analyst with Forrester Research, in a blog note.“This is the big one,” said Pat Gelsinger, head of Intel’s Digital Enterprise Group, at a launch event at its Santa Clara headquarters.“This is the most spectacular piece of engineering, the most intelligent processor and platform that we’ve ever brought forward in key areas like performance, energy efficiency and virtualisation.”It was the most significant launch since Intel made its name in servers with the Pentium Pro, almost 15 years earlier, Mr Gelsinger said.The Xeon 5500 enables virtualisation techniques that use spare capacity on servers to create more “virtual machines” inside them, consolidating the number of servers needed.Mr Gelsinger said around 40 per cent of installed Intel-based servers today were fitted with single-brain chips. An upgrade to the quad-core – four brain – Xeon 5500 would pay for itself in eight months in energy savings, he said.One Xeon 5500 could replace nine four-year-old single-core server chips and offer a 20 per cent energy reduction.Intel’s main rival, Advanced Micro Devices, is competing with Intel with its “Shanghai” server microprocessor.Mr Gelsinger, in an interview with the Financial Times, said the new 5500 outperformed double the number of Shanghai processors in tests.
254;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-03-30T10:59:28Z;Option repricing;;"Pity the humble technology worker. While they were working away at the next modern marvel, the world economy tripped over a pile of foreclosed American houses. The Nasdaq Composite index is now 45 per cent below its peak, and stock options gurgle underwater. So, technology companies, in a list that so far includes Google, Intel, Ebay, AMD and Motorola, have proposed granting new incentives to their staff.Long a favourite form of Silicon Valley compensation, giving employees the right to buy shares in the future at a fixed price has a chequered history. It is an excellent way to motivate staff when starting a risky business with limited cash, as all concerned share in any success. Yet companies have only been forced to recognise the cost of issuing options on their profit and loss accounts since 2005, and during the technology boom they were sprinkled on workers like confetti. In too many cases, issue dates were illegally backdated to more favourable share prices. And, after the bust, options were merrily repriced with little regard for investor losses.This time round, tech companies are not rewarding failure in the same way as, say, a banker retiring richly pensioned. Even so, there are more and less shareholder-friendly ways to proceed. For instance, Intel proposed a value-neutral option exchange last week – staff must surrender a handful of old options to get one at the current price. The move also comes in the context of a company-wide pay freeze, and cutbacks to pension contributions.Contrast that with Google, which in January simply announced that options would be repriced on March 3, at a cost of $460m. Google no doubt has to keep talented staff, but from a company that still refuses to publish much detail about its business, the impression remains of a management that considers its shareholders lucky to be on board.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

255;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-03-27T00:30:09Z;Globalfoundries targets cutting edge;;The head of Globalfoundries, the new US-based contract chipmaker, said he would target a handful of potential clients rather than try to replicate the network of “hundreds of customers” of its bigger Taiwan rivals.Doug Grose, chief executive of the company that was launched this week as a joint venture between microprocessor maker Advanced Micro Devices and Abu Dhabi investors, said Globalfoundries’ competitive advantage lay in only making chips using the latest technologies.“Not everyone is going to want 45 nanometer chips. There’s probably a handful of companies that we’ll want to partner closely with …we’re not looking for hundreds of customers,” Mr Grose told the Financial Times in an interview.Globalfoundries was created when AMD decided to spin off its manufacturing capacity this month amid mounting debt and nine consecutive quarters of losses as it tries to keep up with Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker.The Silicon Valley company has one factory in Dresden, Germany, with a second plant in New York State expected to begin production in 2012. AMD is Globalfoundries’ only customer, but Mr Grose is focusing on sales and marketing efforts to attract others.The company, which claims to be the world’s third-biggest contract chipmaker behind Taiwan’s Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) and United Microelectronics, is being established at a time when chipmakers are suffering from the global economic downturn.Mr Grose said he remains upbeat about the sector because of Globalfoundries’ focus on the part of the market that requires particularly advanced technology.“We are not adding capacity to the broad base …I think this is a great time to invest and we like our odds,” he said.Mr Grose said China “would undoubtedly be an important market” and identified opportunities there in providing low-power solutions for mobile phones and chips used in network switching products.He also hit back at Intel, which this month issued a warning to AMD over licensing technology to Globalfoundries.Intel argued that AMD was not allowed to license the technology to make “x86” microprocessors, which the two companies jointly developed, to Globalfoundries because the new company was no longer an AMD subsidiary.“This is just classic Intel diversionary tactics,” said Mr Grose. “I wish I had a dollar for every lawyer working on this who said that …we are a subsidiary.”
256;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Abu Dhabi’s goals;;News that an Abu Dhabi-based investment fund is to take a strategic stake in Daimler will excite envy among other carmakers scrabbling for capital, along with the familiar sneers about Arab investors with more money than sense.But we should look closer at what the oil-rich city-state is buying. Sitting on 8 per cent of the world’s crude reserves and the senior partner in the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is clear if not always transparent about its ambitions.This is more than a portfolio investment. It is more than a strategic bet on the long-term success of one of the world’s top carmakers. And it is more even than a policy of mere diversification into activities other than oil. A lot more.Like Dubai, its brasher UAE partner, Abu Dhabi does things like tourism and sports events, airlines and finance. It has some gaudy hotels, but wants also to be a film-making and media hub, and attract higher-end visitors with showpiece new Louvre and Guggenheim museums. It paid top dollar for a stake in Ferrari to reach the “added value” of a new Grand Prix slot this year on the Formula 1 circuit.Unlike Dubai, it has the richest sovereign wealth fund in the world, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as smaller strategic funds, including the public-private Aabar Investments, which has just bought 9.1 per cent of Daimler.But what makes Abu Dhabi unlike not just its sister and competitor emirates but pretty much everywhere in the Arab world is its peculiar devotion to manufacturing.Much of its oil wealth is being used to start industries from scratch: in cars and aerospace, components and chips. As well as Daimler, it has invested in companies such as GE, Rolls-Royce, EADS and Advanced Micro Devices. This may look quixotic, yet invariably these stakes come with local training and manufacturing commitments.Along with reform of local education, the goal is to use manufacturing to create skills and a culture of innovation – much more than to establish new branches of old industries. This at least tries to offer an alternative to the usual model in the Gulf – where the public sector employs the bulk of nationals – or the trading company model common in most other Arab countries.Some 40 years ago, the Syrian philosopher Sadek al-Azm wrote a famous critique of the mind-set underlying serial Arab defeats. Arabs, he said, have become removed from the social and economic processes that make innovation and scientific breakthroughs possible. Abu Dhabi, it seems, wants to create, not just consume.
257;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-03-05T00:58:57Z;Globalfoundries to take on Taiwan chipmakers;;The head of a new US-based chip foundry company that is set to launch on Thursday said it would take on Taiwan’s traditional dominance of the industry.Doug Grose, chief executive of Globalfoundries, said its plants in Europe and the US would give it an edge over its Asian rivals.”We think we have an advantage in being able to tap into the best talent in the world [in Europe and the US] and having this diversity of supply,” he said.But the creation of Globalfoundries, a joint venture between the microprocessor maker Advanced Micro Devices and Abu Dhabi investors, has been born more out of necessity than ambition.AMD has reported nine consecutive quarterly losses and amassed more than $4bn in debt as it tries to keep up with the manufacturing advances of its much bigger rival Intel.The spinning off of its manufacturing capacity with an immediate cash injection of $1.4bn from an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government is aimed at giving AMD a fresh start as a “fab-less” chip designer and Globalfoundries a fighting chance of competing with other contract manufacturers.Mr Grose, former head of manufacturing operations at AMD, said the new company would become the number three contract manufacturer behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and UMC of Taiwan.The company will be based next to AMD’s headquarters in Silicon Valley but has no production facilities there. It employs 2,800 people, mainly at its plant in Dresden, Germany, which is being renamed Fab 1. Another 1,400 jobs are expected to be created by the building of Fab 2, due to break ground in New York state in the summer and begin production in 2012.Globalfoundries will depend on AMD as a customer initially, but Mr Grose, in an FT interview, said it planned to expand its customer base and products. He said the company would benefit from other chip companies also quitting their own manufacturing and turning to foundries.Intel has warned that only a handful of manufacturers will be able to afford to take the next re-tooling step of moving up from silicon wafers of 300mm in diameter to 450mm. It reached an agreement with Samsung and TSMC last year on managing that transition.“Today there’s so much more to get out of 300mm …[450mm] is not in our critical path for the next three to five years,” responded Mr Grose.AMD last spun off a company in order to focus on its core competencies in 2005, when its flash memory joint venture with Fujitsu was renamed Spansion and floated in New York.Spansion filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, a victim of falling prices and a sharp decline in demand for memory chips.“I think [Globalfoundries] is quite different from Spansion,” said Mr Grose. “It was in a flash memory market which had huge, multiple competitors and I don’t think Spansion had the investor backing and commitment that we have.”

259;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-03-03T00:13:23Z;Intel tie-up seeks to reinvent Atom;;Intel announced an unprecedented partnership with the largest chip foundry on Monday, as the world’s biggest semiconductor maker sought to ride out the downturn by finding new markets.Intel’s agreement with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) to help it make its Atom microprocessor came as the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) revealed global chip sales plunged 29 per cent in January.Intel’s deal marks the first time it has outsourced manufacturing of its microprocessors, but the company was at pains to deny that its marriage with TSMC had been forced on it by dire economic circumstances.“This is about our long-term strategy. We’ve been in discussions with TSMC for more than two years,” said Chuck Mulloy, Intel spokesman.The Silicon Valley company, which dominates the PC market, is going into uncharted territory with its Atom processor, seeking to embed it in devices such as smart phones and consumer electronics boxes.TSMC, as the world’s biggest contract manufacturer of chips, deals with the customers that Intel hopes to win in these new markets.By allowing its designs to be used in TSMC’s manufacturing processes, Intel hopes it will be able to gain quicker access to and adoption by those using TSMC’s services.“We believe this effort will make it easier for customers with significant design expertise to take advantage of benefits of the Intel architecture,” said Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive.Intel has already seen strong demand for its low-power Atom processor from manufacturers of mini-laptops, known as netbooks, but wants to expand its use to other non-PC devices.Earlier this year, the company announced it would close older plants and shed 6,000 jobs, while spending $7bn over two years on next-generation fabrication facilities.The SIA said on Monday that worldwide chip sales of $15.3bn in January were down 29 per cent on the figure of $21.5bn a year earlier and down 12 per cent on December’s figures.“Sales declined across the entire range of semiconductor products, as sales of important demand drivers such as personal computers, cell phones, automobiles and consumer items remained under pressure,” said George Scalise, SIA president.He added more positively that inventory levels were very low and there were signs of visibility improving on future demand.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival, announced on Monday it had relieved itself of some of its financial pressure by completing a transaction that would spin off its manufacturing arm into an Abu Dhabi-backed entity, tentatively called the Foundry Company.News also emerged that Spansion, the memory chip company that AMD spun off in 2005, filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on Sunday, a victim of sliding demand and prices for its NOR Flash memory.

261;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-02-11T00:04:45Z;Heading for Silicon Gulch;;If the daily bad news about semiconductors continues much longer, Silicon Valley may shrink to a gulch.The headlines were unrelentingly dismal on Tuesday as the industry reeled from collapsing demand.Consider these lowlights:The only apparently positive news of the day came from Intel, which said it would use its financial clout as the world’s biggest chipmaker to invest $7bn in four US manufacturing plants to upgrade them to the next level of miniaturisation – circuit widths of 32 billionths of a metre.Of course, this is profoundly negative for Intel’s rivals, who can afford to do no such thing right now and face being undercut by Intel’s cheaper processes.
262;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-02-10T18:32:27Z;Spansion division files for bankruptcy;;Spansion, the US memory-chip maker, on Tuesday filed for bankruptcy protection for its unit in Japan as it sought to restructure in the face of a sharp slowdown in demand that is affecting all parts of the semiconductor industry.California-based Spansion, part-owned by Japan’s Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices of the US, is the biggest producer of Nor flash memory chips – a technology that has been losing ground to Nand memory chips, which store data faster.Spansion has been cutting jobs and selling assets in an effort to reduce its $1.5bn of long-term debt. The Japanese unit, which employs 14 per cent of Spansion’s global workforce, will continue to operate while it reorganises total liabilities of Y74bn ($811m).Earlier this month, Spansion announced that Bertrand Cambou, its president and chief executive, had left the company as part of its plans to restructure and explore a sale or merger.The market for Nor flash memory shrank 16 per cent last year to $6.4bn, according to the research firm iSuppli. It is likely to contract more swiftly this year as the global slowdown saps demand for mobile phones and other chip-based devices.Spansion’s Japan filing followed the bankruptcy last month of Qimonda, the German maker of dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips, which have also been hit by the slump.Tuesday’s news from Spansion came as Taiwan’s big contract chipmakers unveiled disappointing figures, highlighting how much the semiconductor industry has been hit by the slump in demand for products from mobile phones to computers.United Microelectronics Corp, the world’s second-largest contract chip manufacturer after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, on Tuesday reported a record fourth-quarter loss of T$23.5bn (US$692m).This was partly due to stock investment losses, but UMC’s core business also saw a loss as wafer shipments in the fourth quarter fell by more than a third compared to just three months earlier.Liu Chitung, UMC’s chief financial officer, said the company could not “possibly see a turnround in the first quarter”, as orders shrank rapidly at the end of last year and only 30 per cent of UMC’s production capabilities were being used.TSMC, which reported its fourth-quarter results last month, is expecting its first quarterly loss since 1990 for the first three months of this year. On Tuesday, TSMC released figures for last month that showed revenue fell 58 per cent to T$13.1bn in January compared to a year ago. UMC said its revenue in January fell 62 per cent to T$3.15bn.However, Sun Shih-wei, UMC’s chief executive, offered hope, saying that the worst would likely be over by the end of next month.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall in San Francisco
263;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Timing is everything for Intel chief;;When it comes to timing, Craig Barrett’s announcement of his retirement was hardly propitious.Late last month, the Intel boss announced that he was stepping down after 35 years with the world’s biggest chipmaker and almost a decade as its chief executive or chairman.Recession has started to take its toll on the technology sector. With computer makers cutting back on inventory and chip demand falling, Intel recently announced it was shuttering several plants with the loss of about 6,000 jobs out of 84,000.Meanwhile, just yards from the company’s Brussels office where Mr Barrett is sitting, European Union competition officials are back at work on the long-running probe into Intel’s business practices after being held up by a procedural legal skirmish.At stake are allegations that Intel used illegal marketing practices to push its main competitor, AMD, out of the market. In the absence of any further hurdles, it seems likely that Brussels could decide on the matter before the EU’s tough-minded competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, leaves office at the end of this year.Japan and South Korea have already delivered antitrust findings against the company, and the US Federal Trade Commission is also conducting its own investigation. So Ms Kroes’ conclusions will be crucial.With all that on Intel’s plate, why did the company break from its normal succession pattern for its top jobs, under which the chief executive usually moves up to the chairman’s role, when it announced Mr Barrett’s departure? And how does the long-time executive feel about leaving Intel at such a critical juncture ?“We’re a company which has legislated senility,” is Mr Barrett’s response. “We have mandatory retirement ages, although for a board member it’s 72 and I’ll be 70 this year – so I’m retiring slightly ahead. But Paul [Otellini] probably has more than two years left as chief executive so this was going to happen at sometime.”“You can look at it as we’ve changed [the succession structure], or that we’re consistent. We’re consistent in that we believe that church and state, CEO and chairman should be different people. And we’re keeping the chairmanship separate from the CEO’s job. The fact that we’ll have an outsider who is chairman is the way the company started.” Jane Shaw, an independent board director, will take over as chairman.As for the economic challenges: “I’ve been through 10 recessions and this is another one,” Mr Barrett says, evenly.In the last one – after the dotcom bubble burst – Mr Barrett eventually won plaudits for maintaining Intel’s research investment, allowing it to emerge with an enhanced market position. It is an approach which the retiring chairman believes is now ingrained in the company – even if commentators don’t always treat it kindly.“The one observation we’ve always made…is that technology moves forward in both good times and bad…That means we never really slow our R&D spending down. If we’re going to cut back – and we had to cut recently – we focus on capacity not on new technology. We closed down some older factories, but that doesn’t impact our new product development or our new manufacturing technology.”.For Mr Barrett, this is a broader message that badly needs airing. “I think the biggest concern for countries and businesses is that they use the poor economy as an excuse to cut back on the funding for new products,” he says, with conviction.“Any company which announces they’re having a big layoff or big decrease in spending gets rewarded in the financial media or on Wall Street. But if what you’re cutting back is in R&D or new products, it’s exactly the wrong thing to do.”As for dealing with decisions on the antitrust front: “That’s something I get away with,” says the outgoing chairman, before adding that “having been senior executive through that time period, I’m still involved.”Like all Intel executives, he insists that the company did nothing wrong: “The microprocessor market is an anti-inflationary business, it’s terribly competitive, the consumer benefits from great technology – and we contend, and I think the facts will bear us out, that we have obeyed the law.“We’ll just let our lawyers go through the process of presenting the facts – all of the facts. I think when all the facts are on the table, we’ll prevail, but it’s a long legal process.”Whether that will convince Ms Kroes and her officials is another matter. They beefed up the charges against Intel last year, and seem to have been unimpressed by the legalistic nature of the latest court battle over whether certain documents should form part of the file - a fight which Brussels won. AMD, meanwhile, has been blunter, accusing its opponent of “simply attempting to delay the Commission’s decision-making process”.
264;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Fall in chip sales hits Texas Instruments;;Texas Instruments, the world’s third largest chipmaker, reported lower sales and announced layoffs on Monday as demand in all its key markets continued to weaken.Fourth-quarter sales fell to $2.49bn, or 8 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 11 cents. Quarterly profit fell to $107m from $756m a year ago.However, the profit decrease was smaller than expected and shares were up 5 per cent in after-hours trading. Annual income fell 10 per cent to $12.5bn, primarily because of falling sales in the wireless segment.TI announced a 12 per cent reduction in its workforce, with 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 voluntary retirements. The company will take a $300m charge for the cuts but the move, with other measures, will save about $700m a year.“We are realigning our expenses with a global economy that continues to weaken,” Rich Templeton, chief executive, said in a statement.TI had anticipated poor results. In December, the Dallas-based company issued reduced forecasts for the fourth quarter, predicting sales of about $2.4bn – down from initial expectations of $2.9bn.“The current environment is not simply an inventory correction that will work itself out in three quarters,” said Ron Slaymaker, vice-president of investor relations.Other chipmakers, including Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, have already reported slumping sales as demand continues to weaken.TI warned it could post losses for the current quarter as demand, especially for its mobile phone chips, remains weak.“We are not anticipating an upturn any time on the horizon,” said Kevin March, chief financial officer.TI’s dominance in the mobile phone chip market is under threat. Last year Nokia, its largest customer, shifted to a multi-supplier strategy and began sourcing from TI’s rivals Broadcom and STMicroelectronics.

The market for mainframes – the heavy-duty, monolithic machines that dominate the high-end of the computing market – once attracted the attention of companies including General Electric to Honeywell.As recently as the 1990s, the mainframe industry attracted competitors such as Hitachi and the Fujitsu-owned Amdahl.Today, though, it is once again the almost exclusive preserve of IBM, with whose name it has become almost synonymous.That is now set to come under renewed scrutiny, with European regulators preparing to blow the dust off a case history that dates back almost as far as the computing industry itself. Armed with its big 2007 legal victory over Microsoft, the European Commission now believes it has the precedent to dig further into some of the tech world’s most entrenched markets.Ironically, the renewed attention to IBM’s historic mainframe monopoly comes at a time of rampant innovation in the type of high-powered computing that powers corporate and government data centres.New technologies such as multi-core processors (chips that can run several instructions simultaneously) and virtualisation (software that turns a single computer into a number of independent “virtual” machines) have given customers new, lower-cost choices in how to handle their most intensive computing tasks.“IBM’s [profit] margin is nowhere near where it used to be – they’ve had a lot of competition” from these new computing architectures, said John Phelps, an analyst at Gartner. “People do have the options of moving off the mainframe, and they are doing it.”However, legacy computing systems such as the IBM mainframe often have a surprisingly long life. With its biggest customers having written billions of lines of software code over the years to run on the machines, the cost of switching to new systems can be substantial. That is particularly true for governments, banks, retailers, healthcare companies and others in transaction-intensive industries with large numbers of customers.To get around this barrier, companies such as T3 have come up with techniques to “trick” software applications into thinking they are running on a mainframe when in fact they are actually installed on lower-cost standardised servers based on chips from Intel or AMD. This technique, known as “emulation”, relies on software that can only be produced with the approval of IBM, since it uses some of Big Blue’s patented mainframe technology.This touches on the central issue at stake in the latest complaint against IBM in Europe. Though it used to license an earlier generation of the necessary technology, the computing giant has dropped that practice with its latest generation of 64-bit mainframe software, leaving potential rivals with no way to produce machines that are compatible with IBM’s.IBM has accused rivals of infringing its patents by trying to produce their own mainframes, and maintains that mainframes are not a monopoly since it faces competition from many other high-end computing systems.Yet one sign of the significant potential in the mainframe market was the powerful list of backers that lined up behind Platform Solutions Inc, a Silicon Valley start-up launched by several former Amdahl engineers to take on IBM (Amdahl, along with Hitachi, backed out of the market in 2000 after deciding they could not sustain the investment needed to follow IBM into the new phase of 64-bit computing.)Microsoft, Intel and Goldman Sachs all put money into PSI. However, after fighting a legal battle with Big Blue and lodging a formal complaint with European regulators a year ago, PSI agreed to be bought by its giant rival, effectively putting an end to the case.The support that PSI won from some of IBM’s biggest rivals suggests that the T3 case now before Europe will become the centerpiece for a duel between industry heavyweights.Had PSI been successful in pushing through its case against IBM, it could have been of particular benefit to Hewlett-Packard, according to Gartner. HP has been the main supporter of Intel’s Itanium chip, a processor that was once seen as a significant rival to IBM’s mainframe business but which has largely remained a computing backwater.Microsoft’s interest in fostering an IBM rival also points to potential opportunities for its own software in high-end computing.

Other GE divisions – from aviation to healthcare – are also cutting staff as GE seeks $5bn in total savings. The final job cut tally is expected to exceed 20,000, out of GE’s 315,000 people globally, including 75,000 at GE Capital.GE’s actions capped a brutal week for US workers. Companies from a range of sectors – including computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, retailer Circuit City, car rental group Hertz and Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals giant – announced more than 40,000 job losses.The Bush administration’s economists said on Friday that unemployment would reach 7.7 per cent this year, amid weak US growth. Data also showed prices rising at the slowest pace since 1954.In the annual Economic Report of the President, the Council of Economic Advisors cut forecasts and predicted the US economy would grow by just 0.6 per cent in 2009, before rebounding to 5 per cent growth in 2010. Inflation would hold at 1.7 per cent during the next two years.Figures released by the US labour department on Friday showed the recession bringing the headline measure of price growth close to deflation in December.The consumer price index increased 0.1 per cent in the year to December and rose just 0.7 per cent on the month, more than many forecasters expected. The results capped a year when prices rose just 0.1 per cent as energy prices plummeted. In 2007 consumer prices increased 4.1 per cent.The gloomy figures emerged as Barack Obama stepped up efforts to win support for his proposed economic stimulus plans before taking office on Tuesday.“We’ve started this year in the midst of a crisis unlike any we’ve seen in our lifetime,” he said in Ohio.“It’s not too late to change course – but only if we take dramatic action as soon as possible.”His remarks marked the start of what is expected to be a nationwide tour by Mr Obama promoting emergency measures to revive the economy, amid resistance from some fiscal conservatives.
267;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-01-16T20:57:29Z;AMD to cut 900 jobs as it moves to cut costs;;"Advanced Micro Devices, the second largest maker of PC microprocessors, on Friday said it would cut 9 per cent of its workforce as it took steps to reduce costs in worsening economic conditions.AMD said it would cut 900 jobs, which, combined with natural attrition and the sale of its handheld business, would take the cuts to its global workforce to 9 per cent or 1,100 positions in the current quarter.The cuts are the latest in a series of moves by the company to try to regain profitability in the face of stiff competition from its larger rival Intel.AMD said yesterday its chairman and chief executive, Hector Ruiz and Dirk Meyer, would take a temporary 20 per cent pay cut. Vice-presidents in the US and Canada would suffer 15 per cent salary reductions and other employees 10 per cent or 5 per cent, depending on whether they were eligible for overtime. Pay cuts would also be brought in for overseas workers, it said.The company said it was also suspending matching payments to its employees’ retirement plans.AMD will ask shareholders next month to approve a deal struck last October that will give Abu Dhabi investment companies a bigger stake in AMD and enable the spinning off of its manufacturing operations into a separate company.The new “Foundry Company” will take on $1.2bn
of AMD’s debt and the
Abu Dhabi government’s Advanced Technology Investment Company will have a 66 per cent ownership stake.AMD sold its loss-making digital TV chip business to Broadcom for $193m in August.The company announced its eighth consecutive quarterly loss in October, but said it was on target for break-even in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of restructuring.It reports fourth-quarter results next week, but warned in December
that sales would be around 25 per cent lower than the previous quarter, blaming “weaker than expected demand across all geographies and businesses, particularly in the consumer market”.Intel reported on Thursday a 19 per cent fall in fourth-quarter sales compared with the third quarter. It complained of reduced demand for microprocessors and said inventories of its chips were being reduced across the supply chain.AMD shares were flat in midday trading in New York on Friday at $2.27. They are up 5 per cent so far this month, but are down 65 per cent over one year and 93 per cent over three years."
268;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2009-01-07T22:27:29Z;Computer makers set to launch Netbook 2.0;;When is a netbook not a netbook? With versions of the ultra-portable laptop pioneered by Asustek proving a disappointment in spite of their general success, PC makers are set to unleash hybrid models that combine the price of the low-cost machines with the performance of a notebook.At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, the Asus Eee PC and Apple’s more expensive wafer-thin Macbook Air notebook are proving to be the influences that are shaping manufacturers’ plans for this year.The Consumer Electronics Association estimates that, as a percentage of total consumer electronics sale revenue in 2008, notebooks – including netbooks – accounted for double that of their desktop counterparts, with 10.9 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. The CEA also expects the gap to widen considerably over the next four years.Netbook sales have grown from about 350,000 units in 2007, when Taiwan’s Asus introduced its first models, to 10m in 2008. The CEA predicts unit sales will rise 80 per cent to 18m in 2009, in spite of the global downturn.However, some netbook buyers, in spite of being attracted by the light and affordable models, have been disappointed with the small screen sizes, cramped keyboards and poor processing and graphics performance.“When netbooks first came out, there was a high degree of returns at stores, because people were expecting the experience that they got on their traditional notebook or desktop and did not receive it,” says Bahr Mahoney, director of mobile marketing at Advanced Micro Devices, a PC processor maker.So, with netbooks proving unpopular with consumers and the Macbook Air being too expensive for most – with models starting at $1,800 – rivals feel they can improve on the originals by undercutting them on price and creating new categories that combine the best elements of both.AMD has now teamed up with Hewlett-Packard, the world’s leading laptop maker, to unveil a product aimed at dissatisfied buyers. The DV2 is a fully-featured “thin and light” laptop that will cost $700 when it goes on sale in March.HP executives say the DV2 could be compared with the Macbook Air, but they did not want to address a niche market by putting too high a price on the product.“This is a great opportunity for both of us to penetrate a brand new market segment that is not serviced today by any other processor or notebook manufacturer,” says Mr Mahoney.However, this gap in the market will not exist for much longer, according to the CEA.“There is a segment being created between netbooks and traditional notebooks that is now open ground and you are going to see manufacturers gunning for that space,” Shawn DuBravac, CEA economist, told a news briefing in Las Vegas on Tuesday.The X-Slim Series X320, to be launched by Taiwan’s MSI in April, will cost between $700 and $900. It bears a close resemblance in its sleekness to the Macbook Air.Also on show at CES is the Dr Mobile FreeStyle 1300n, a thin notebook with a large display that costs about $500 and is powered by a processor from Taiwan’s Via.“We don’t really describe it as a netbook, it’s a thin and light notebook,” says Richard Brown, Via’s vice-president of corporate marketing.“When is a netbook not a netbook? This category is going to get more interesting and more confusing,” he adds.Mr Mahoney says “thin and light” is designed to appeal to consumers who bought a heavy, big-screen notebook and now want a second or third affordable laptop that is more portable.However, the netbook concept still has great appeal and sales potential, to the extent that companies are entering the fray to drive costs down and extend battery life.The chipmaker Freescale has announced at CES an energy-efficient processor with a core designed by the UK’s ARM, which it says will furnish netbooks that cost less than $200 – about half the current price levels – with eight-hour battery lives.“I see it as a missing link between a cellphone and a road warrior’s notebook,” says Henri Richard, Freescale’s head of sales and marketing.Mr Richard says he also knows of manufacturers working on hybrid versions containing both ARM and Intel processors. The ARM processor is used when the netbook is used in a limited way to check e-mail or browse the web, with Intel’s kicking in when more powerful functionality is needed.
269;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-12-21T19:02:52Z;Christmas shut-down in Silicon Valley;;Workers at some of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies will find themselves spending an uncommonly long time with their families this Christmas as the technology industry responds to the downturn with office and factory closures and enforced holidays.Usually limited to traditional manufacturing industries such as the ailing carmakers, the year-end shut-down is this year sweeping through the office suites and research and development labs of information-age companies.Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instruments, Dell, Adobe and CSC are among the tech industry heavyweights to be taking a break, with some closed from December 22 until January 5.HP said: “The only workers left to keep the lights on will be those involved in “critical customer support”.The shut-down has been forced by belt-tightening across the sector as corporate and individual customers cut back on spending.The wider cost-cutting has hit even Google, the latest emblem of Silicon Valley prosperity. The internet seach engine has trimmed spending on its famed perks with steps such as cutting the number of restaurants on its campus open in the evening.In spite of the enforced leisure, workers will be hit directly by the closures, with most required to use up part of their holiday entitlement or, if they do not have the days to spare, take unpaid leave.Given that many US workers receive only 10 days of vacation a year, the effect will be biggest there, although most of the companies to close say they will be halting operations worldwide.HP said six days of its two-week shutdown would count against workers’ annual vacation entitlement, while technology services company CSC said employees would be docked seven days’ holiday.One Valley executive said: “Man, is it ugly out there”.He said the pain had spread from the wider economy in recent weeks. “It was nice to see record earnings for high-tech companies in the first three quarters during a so-called recession, and then the wheels fell off in October.”Chip companies and other component makers have taken the brunt of the initial downturn in tech demand, as makers of hardware such as computers and routers have reduced orders in anticipation of deeper problems next year.The iSuppli research company warned last week that excess semiconductor stockpiles in the global electronics supply chain were likely to nearly triple in the fourth quarter.Advanced Micro Devices, the microprocessor maker based in Silicon Valley, said its workforce had been told to take five days’ mandatory vacation in the fourth quarter.Elsewhere, Texas Instruments is temporarily closing many of its factories to run down its inventories. With its manufacturing operation running at only about 45 per cent of capacity, the Dallas-based company says such levels had not been seen since the second half of 2001.
270;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Chips are down;;"A climber descending into a darkened cave wants to reach the bottom before he runs out of rope. It is the same for semiconductor companies. Texas Instruments has joined the roll-call of chipmakers that have again had to downgrade expectations. It indicated that fourth quarter revenues will be 26-32 per cent lower than those of the previous quarter. Similar in magnitude to revised forecasts from peers such as AMD and TSMC, it makes guidance from Intel, released just weeks ago, look optimistic.The problems are twofold. First, consumer spending has collapsed. Taiwanese computer makers are bracing themselves for desktop sales down by a quarter in the final three months of the year, reckons Bank of America. So, as they adjust along with other manufacturers of consumer electronics, this creates the second effect – shrinking inventories. Texas Instruments is shipping chips at a rate below that of underlying demand.As such crunches occur about every two years, semiconductor investors are swift to slash forecasts. Consensus earnings for the US chipmakers are expected to fall by about 25 per cent in 2009, compared with a 0.3 per cent drop for the S&P 500, excluding financials. The darkest hours for chipmakers have tended to be the best moment to buy their shares. That could come early next year, since inventory levels were not that high going into this downturn.So if the global recession ends before 2010, bombed out semi stocks are a great bargain. The problem will come if consumption takes longer to recover. This time round the credit crunch is hitting both distributors and buyers of electronics in the developing world, just as the strength of the dollar is making components more expensive. Until it becomes clear that demand has stabilised, chipmakers will continue to find their feet dangling in the blackness.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

271;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-12-08T21:59:30Z;Abu Dhabi chips away at AMD deal;;Advanced Micro Devices has had to settle for less in its spin-off of its manufacturing business.Just two months after it announced Abu Dhabi investors would take an increased share in the company and enable it to create “The Foundry Company”, AMD announced on Monday that the terms of the agreement had been amended.The rapid economic deterioration is being blamed but, more to the point, AMD’s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the deal was announced on October 7.Mubadala Development Company will now purchase its 58m shares of AMD at a revised price of the average price between November 17 and December 12, or in the 20 trading days before the deal closes at the beginning of 2009, whichever is the lower.AMD will issue an additional 5m warrants on top of the 30m already promised to Mubadala.The Silicon Valley chipmaker will also have a reduced stake in The Foundry Company – 34.2 per cent rather than the 44.4 per cent originally quoted.AMD was in danger of being unable to compete with its bigger rival Intel in investing in new multi-billion dollar manufacturing facilities.The spin-off should still put it on a much better footing, with Abu Dhabi maintaining its initial $1.4bn investment, but AMD will now have less say in how it is run.
272;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-12-05T22:10:41Z;US indices stage last-minute rally;;Spectacular gains among insurers helped Wall Street stocks shrug off dire US employment figures and end a volatile week with a strong rally.Metlife and Prudential jumped 22.5 per cent to $30.76 and 34.7 per cent to $28.52, respectively, ahead of a state insurance regulator meeting this weekend, which could result in more relaxed capital requirements.A UBS note that said regulatory changes could come as soon as next Tuesday also provided support to the sector.Hartford Financial Services topped the leader board in reaction to its well received investor day presentation. The battered stock soared 102.4 per cent to $14.59 after the company said it was well capitalised.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 3.7 per cent at 876.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.1 per cent higher at 8,635.42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 4.4 per cent stronger at 1,509.31.The rally – albeit in light volume – came in spite of closely-watched Labor Department payroll figures that were much worse than even the most dire predictions.In reaction to the figures, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped as much as 3.2 per cent earlier in the session to test a weekly low of 815 that had been hit during a heavy sell-off on Monday.But traders appeared to be encouraged when the market failed to break through the key technical level, and the market subsequently rallied into the close.“There’s a lot of things you can use to predict a bottom. One of them is when the market stops reacting adversely to negative news,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.The reaction to the steepest job losses since 1974 was the latest example this week of a rally despite bleak news.Retailers gave bulls a faint glimmer of hope when traders shrugged off the worst monthly sales performance this decade. The S&P Retail index was up 6 cent for the week in spite of the release of November sales figures that were nevertheless not quite as dire as the most pessimistic predictions.Wal-Mart helped the sector with well received sales and shares in the discounter were up 4.2 per cent to $58.21 for the week.Macy’s which disclosed a sharp drop in like-for-like sales, finished the week up 16 per cent at $8.61.Friday’s rally helped the S&P pare its losses for the five-day period to 2.3 per cent, the Dow was down 2.2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.7 per cent lower.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up 7.8 per cent over the week and at 59.57 it indicated elevated signs of distress. The energy sector led weekly declines as it fell 11.3 per cent on a sharp slide in oil prices.The future of the ailing US car industry was among primary investor concerns as executives returned to Capitol Hill to plead for a $34bn bailout. General Motors finished the week down 22.1 per cent to $4.08 although Ford, which said it expected to at least break even by 2011, was up 1.1 per cent to $2.72.Defensive stocks failed to offer investors a haven – Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble fell 1.9 per cent to $45.98 and 2.7 per cent to $62.63, respectively – but there were bright spots elsewhere.Homebuilders finished the week 19.5 per cent higher amid reports that the Treasury Department was working on a plan to reduce mortgage rates on new home loans.Also helping the sector were data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing that its measure of mortgage application volumes had jumped the most last week since the index was created in 1990.On Friday, the financial sector rallied 8.6 per cent to lead the gains and took in Goldman Sachs, which jumped 4.7 per figures cent to $70.72 even after Morgan Stanley widened its fourth-quarter loss forecast from $1.09 to $4.45 a share.
273;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-12-02T15:58:31Z;Supercomputers: Speed within reach at affordable prices;;This has been a milestone year in supercomputing. These high-performance machines, engineered to cope with the most mathematically intensive tasks, have hit new heights of power and performance, while becoming more widely available to businesses.Twice yearly, in June and November, the 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world are ranked by Top500.org, a group of supercomputing experts from the Universities of Mannheim and Tennessee and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.In June, IBM’s Roadrunner supercomputer, based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, became the first machine to achieve the long-coveted goal of breaking the “petaflop” barrier, processing more than one million billion calculations per second.In November, Cray’s Jaguar supercomputer, installed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, also passed that milestone. In the most recent rankings, Roadrunner and Jaguar notched up performances of 1.105 petaflops and 1.059 petaflops, respectively.These are giant leaps. “When I started out in the supercomputer industry 25 years ago, we were all talking about the megaflop barrier – millions of operations per second,” says Margaret “Peg” Williams, senior vice-president of engineering at Cray, an established supplier in the field. “These days, that’s just dull and we’ve broken the gigaflop and teraflop barriers along the way to today’s petaflop performance.”Today, even the cheapest PC runs at gigaflop rates yet it is only 11 years since the US government spent about $33m to build ASCI Red, one of the first supercomputers to achieve one teraflop.The rate of progress equates to a 1,000-fold increase in processing power roughly every 10 years, says Dave Turek, vice president of IBM’s Deep Computing group, and that in turn has led to “enhanced fidelity”, or more refined analysis, in terms of output.“We’re now getting to the point where a supercomputer isn’t just used to model the behaviour of a single component in a jet engine, for example, but whole collections of components, working together in an integrated system.“Or we can model different processes on a much smaller or larger scale, from the effect of a new drug on a disease at a molecular level, to the impact of human behaviour on climate change over hundreds of years. And we can perform these tasks far faster, too.”This ability, he says, is largely down to parallel processing – breaking a large computing task into logical components and processing them simultaneously on a vast pool of multiple processors.The more chips added to a machine, the quicker they can process large tasks, as long as the application is engineered to run in parallel, rather than sequentially.Since parallel processing became available to commercial organisations in the early 1990s, the line has blurred between traditional supercomputing, geared to solving complex scientific problems, and high performance computing (HPC), which aims to deliver bulk processing power.Indeed IDC, the consultancy, has redefined its supercomputer category to include HPC systems costing more than $500,000.Sales of such systems, it estimates, grew by 24 per cent in 2007, to reach $3.2bn.But as the technology takes on an increasingly important role in industry and government, as well as academic research, it is increasingly the low end of the market, for HPC systems costing less than $250,000, that is the real engine of growth.The road to such growth began in the 1990s, when high-end computing systems started using standard components in place of proprietary technology.“Twenty years ago, a supercomputer was built from exotic components that made it blindingly fast and blindingly expensive as well,” says John Barr, an analyst with the 451 Group, an industry research company.Today’s supercomputers, he says, use commodity chipsets from Intel and AMD and interconnect technologies based on the widely used Ethernet and Infiniband standards. Prices have dropped and smaller organisations are now able to take advantage of the processing power.Arguably the most striking example of this came in September with the announcement of a partnership between Cray and Microsoft, which has made rapid advances in the sector with its HPC Server operating system.The two companies launched the Cray CX1, touted as ”the most affordable supercomputer Cray has ever offered”, with prices starting at $25,000.Vince Mendillo, director of HPC for Microsoft, says the CX1 is aimed at organisations in industries such as life sciences and financial services that are exploring supercomputing and do not have the in-house expertise or resources to run a fully fledged supercomputer.The partners also hope to lure scientists, and researchers with discretionary IT budgets, to use the system to run workloads locally, creating ”supercomputing on the desktop”, rather than on huge, centralised machines.A similar model is offered by chip maker Nvidia, which in November announced a “Personal Supercomputer” design, that will enable other manufacturers to build high-performance computers that look like traditional workstations.Already, a number of PC vendors, including Dell and Lenovo, have signed up to offer workstations based on this design, at prices starting below $10,000, according to Andy Keane, general manager of GPU computing at Nvidia.These machines, he says, will enable researchers to conduct at least some of their research at their desks.“Now, researchers tend to write the code on a standard notebook and then take it to the supercomputer in order to deploy it,” he says.Carrying out research at a workstation will reduce the time it takes to work on problems and crunch data, he adds.The growing availability of HPC capabilities, however, raises questions about environmental impact: they consume enormous amounts of energy.Mr Turek of IBM points out: “Energy efficiency has become as important as raw performance for the modern supercomputer. Now, it’s all about how much computing you can get out of each megawatt consumed.”
274;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Qimonda facing liquidity crisis;;German chipmaker Qimonda on Monday warned that it might run out of money at the start of next year if it fails to secure financial help.The company, majority-owned by Infineon, said in a statement it was in talks with possible strategic and financial investors and that it could announce a deal “in the next few weeks”.Central to these options, according to people familiar with talks, is a loan guarantee of up to €500m from the federal government and the Saxony state government, which has backed the development of state capital Dresden into a centre for computer chip production.Qimonda employs 13,500 people worldwide.The company has suffered from ruinous competition in the market for memory chips. This has been made worse by the credit crunch, which has sharply put the brakes on global economic growth, especially in the past few weeks.The Munich-based company said it was postponing the release of its 2008 results, original due on Tuesday, until mid-December. It signalled its operating loss would nudge €2bn in the 12 months ending September 30.While sales in the last quarter of that period rose 24 per cent in annual comparison to €476m, Qimonda said operating loss would be larger than the €386m seen in the third quarter, further enlarging a nine-month deficit of €1.4bn.Qimonda warned it would “face liquidity shortfalls in portions of its operations” between January and March of next year, should it fail to find new investors and should the situation in the chip market remain poor and attempts to cut costs fail.Its woes are weighing on its parent, chipmaker Infineon, which holds a 77.5 per cent stake. Infineon wants to reduce its stake to below 50 per cent, in order to avoid having to incorporate Qimonda’s results into its consolidated numbers.Infineon, which makes specialised chips for cars and other machines, has declined to help Qimonda financially, although it has helped the company in negotiating with governments in Berlin and Dresden, according to people familiar with the events.Saxony’s trade and industry minister Thomas Jurk in recent days signalled his intention to help maintain the chip production facilities in Dresden – Qimonda, Infineon and AMD all have factories there – although the European Union would have to sign off any state aid offered.

276;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-11-19T10:50:14Z;IT going green: Delicate game of data centre metrics;;IT vendor, HP, is about to introduce technology that will allow IT managers to cap the amount of electricity used in their data centres.The tool – known as Dynamic Power Capping – will allow companies to “reclaim” wasted power and cooling by capping the amount of electricity used by servers. Capping electricity use, in turn, reduces energy lost to heat, cutting the need for cooling.HP’s development is just the latest in a series of moves by the IT industry to reduce its own energy use generally – and in data centres in particular – before governments force it to act.The UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, for example, estimates that 4 per cent of the UK’s CO2 emissions come from IT. Recently, the UK government announced plans, under the Carbon Reduction Commitment, that would lay down strict rules for data centre managers, if their facilities use more than 6,000MW per year of power.Globally, IT is believed to use about 2 per cent of all energy. That figure is expected to rise to between 4 and 6 per cent by the end of the decade, based on current trends. And although data centres are certainly not the only reason for the increase, they are a significant part of it.They are also one of the few areas of IT where measuring energy use is practicable: data centres are large, they are often discrete facilities or buildings, and they already have management and diagnostic systems in place that can be used to measure energy use.But if CIOs can measure the energy used by their data centres, opinions are split on how to bring about reductions. Some experts advocate building entire new facilities designed, from the ground up, to cut energy use. Some suggest the answer lies in less power-hungry servers and other hardware.Others say there are remedial steps any business can take, such as dividing data centres into “hot” and “cold” aisles and using newer cooling techniques to cut power use. Others still believe that how equipment and even software is run is most important. With some common enterprise IT platforms typically only 18 to 20 per cent utilised, techniques such as virtualisation, which involves running several “virtual” servers on one physical server, will bring green benefits without the need for new hardware.These approaches are certainly not mutually exclusive, but businesses can be forgiven for not knowing which way to turn. The situation is not helped by the lack of a clear industry definition of what constitutes a green data centre.“The problem is an onion,” says Bob Tarzey, service director for industry analysts Quocirca.“There are so many aspects to this: how the data centre is powered, the equipment itself, how efficiently it’s used and the applications it’s used for.” This has led to a confusion of measures and standards.In the US, there is the LEED standard for buildings, which would cover a centre’s construction. Energy Star and other ratings measure the performance of IT equipment, and there are measures such as The Green Grid’s PUE (power usage effectiveness) to gauge the overall efficiency of data centre design, in terms of computing power produced for each megawatt of electricity used. But each of these measures give, at best, a partial picture.“At the data centre level there is no equivalent standard to LEED,” says Jose Iglesias, vice president for global solutions at software vendor Symantec.“The Department of Energy in the US is working with The Green Grid to develop a standard for data centres and we have reached out to the EU. We are hopeful that rather than have a standard for the EU and for the US we will have one for both.”But a significant amount of work remains to be done, if such standards are to be of practical value to companies looking to reduce their carbon footprints.Standardised measures for the energy used by different pieces of equipment are, for example, necessary if companies are to have information they can act on – rather than simply measuring the power going in to the data centre as a whole.“We would like standards for measuring the energy consumption or carbon footprint for different kinds of hardware,” says Mr Iglesias. “If today you build a large HP, IBM or Dell server and embed third party hardware in it, there is no way an IT manager can figure out the energy footprint of the revised machine.”“Metrics are a delicate game,” agrees Larry Vertal, a senior strategist for AMD and a director of The Green Grid. “The approach of the Grid is pragmatic: our number one goal is to figure out how to measure these things properly, and then develop standards and best practice”.For now, though, the idea of a standard certification for a data centre – equivalent perhaps to the EnergyStar ratings on a PC or the EU’s energy labels on white goods – is some way off. For CIOs buying services, and for corporate social responsibility departments, this means either taking the supplier or vendor’s green credentials at face value, or using audit and due diligence techniques to check their numbers.Such techniques can be time consuming and expensive, and might be best justified for very large buyers of IT, such as financial services firms or public sector bodies.And, even if a data centre has some form of green certification, or due diligence finds it is designed according to best practice, that does not guarantee that it is, in fact, green in day-to-day use. There is nothing to stop someone building a green data centre and running it badly, for example, through poor levels of hardware utilisation.That should not prevent CIOs from acting, however, but the emphasis should be on energy efficiency first and foremost.“In the next three to five years we won’t see the green data centre, but we’ll see the energy-optimised data centre,” says Rakesh Kumar, research vice president at analysts Gartner. “Our advice to CIOs is don’t hold off, but push harder.”
277;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD launches Shanghai, expects profitability;;Despite the ringing of a major-warning bell by its stronger microprocessor rival Intel, Advanced Micro Devices is maintaining its commitment to returning to profitability in 2009.AMD, which reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss last month and softening sales, says it is cutting costs and focusing on core products to lower its break-even point.“We are going to structure the company to a point where we can start making money while retaining core investments in research and development and products,” Dirk Meyer, chief executive, told the company’s analyst day in Silicon Valley today.AMD also launched a key product today – a processor codenamed Shanghai for servers, which offers major performance improvements and is its first based on a more cost-effective 45-nanometre manufacturing technology.Last month, it announced it would spin-off its manufacturing capabilities into a new company, with the help of an investment of up to $8.4bn from Abu Dhabi investors.It is also shedding the consumer electronics business it inherited from its acquisition of the Canadian graphics chip maker, ATI.Mr Meyer, who took over from Hector Ruiz as chief executive in the summer, said AMD was one of only two companies, with Intel, that could produced leading-edge x86 microprocessors in volume and one of only two leading graphics chip makers, with Nvidia. It was the only company that had both capabilities under one roof.AMD’s ambitious plans for “Fusion” of the two has led to losses, a large debt burden and a share price that has fallen 69 per cent this year and was down 9 per cent at $2.33 in trading today.But Mr Meyer said AMD has a shot at a $46.5bn market – $8.5bn for servers, $4bn for graphics cards and $34bn for client PC microprocessors.Shanghai should give it a lift in the server category – compared to its “Barcelona” predecessor, it is on time and performing above expectations. The quad-core processor offers 35 per cent better performance with up to a 35 per cent decrease in power consumption.“I think it will have a big impact in the data centre around virtualisation,” Sally Stevens, director of platform marketing at Dell, told me.“What’s nice is that there’s no change of the motherboard, so it’s a simple drop-in of the new processor.”Dell, HP, IBM and Sun are among the first customers for the new Opteron-brand processor.Intel is hot on AMD’s heels with a new processor design called Nehalem, which will first appear in high-end desktop PCs from Monday and in servers next year.“I think Shanghai puts AMD back in the game, but it is not going to have a whole lot of unblocked sunlight,” says Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies .“It does not make it a clear winner, with Intel breathing down its neck.”
278;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-11-04T16:17:32Z;Digital inclusion: Initiatives to provide the new necessities;;In 1995, in his best-selling book Being Digital, author and technologist Nicholas Negroponte proclaimed that digital technology could be “a natural force drawing people into greater world harmony”.It was a bold statement in a bold book, but statistics on the extent and scope of digital exclusion globally continue to make gloomy reading.Even today, fewer than a quarter of the world’s 6bn people have access to the educational, social and economic opportunities the internet can provide. Some that do, meanwhile, find local information in their own language is lacking.But Mr Negroponte remains optimistic that many of these limitations can be overcome for a vast swathe of people in developing nations. As chairman of non-profit organisation One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), he is working to create educational opportunities for the world’s poorest children by providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power laptop.These computers, developed by OLPC and manufactured by Taiwanese manufacturer Quanta Computer, are typically sold – in some cases, donated – to governments and distributed through ministries of education, currently for $187 per laptop. Mr Negroponte hopes this will fall to $75, in line with OLPC’s initial promise of a sub-$100 laptop.Does he feel overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge? “Yes, always,” he says, bluntly. “Fifty per cent of the children in the world do not have electricity at home or at school.”Like OLPC itself, the issue of digital inclusion is riddled with controversy: it is widely accepted that government initiatives and public philanthropy alone are not enough to tackle the problem. But when the world’s largest suppliers of IT become involved, they leave themselves open to accusations of self-interest.At the 2008 World Economic Forum in Davos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates called for a new system of “creative capitalism” that would match business expertise with needs in the developing world to find markets that are, as yet, untapped.“There are billions of people who need the great inventions of the computer age and many more basic needs as well. But they have no way of expressing their needs in ways that matter to markets, so they go without. If we are going to have a serious chance of changing their lives, we will need another level of innovation.”Microsoft aims to deliver that “level of innovation” through its Unlimited Potential (UP) programme, launched in February 2007.This aims to bring together the company’s business strategy with its corporate citizenship goals, by partnering worldwide with influential community stakeholders – businesses, governments, educators and voluntary organisations – to create economic solutions for social ills such as illiteracy and deficient healthcare.In Pakistan, for example, garment makers who serve global markets tapped UP’s Karachi-based Innovation Center to co-develop product lifecycle management technologies. In Nigeria, UP is helping government workers pay for new computers, using their pay cheques as collateral.Other companies have similar initiatives that look to balance philanthropy with the creation of new markets. It is a necessary force for good, argues John Davies, vice-president and general manager of Intel’s World Ahead Programme. “Government policy can only set a direction. Industry co-operation is vital for governments, just as government co-operation is vital for us,” he says.To date, the World Ahead Programme has worked with 160 programmes, providing 40m people with PCs. In the process, the semiconductor giant has made donations of more than $100m.Rival chip company AMD has set itself and its partners in the 50x15 Foundation the ambitious goal of connecting half the world’s population to the internet by 2015.“According to the average percentage growth of worldwide internet adoption, access won’t reach 50 per cent of the world’s population until 2030,” admits Dan Shine, president of the Foundation. “But we felt that if we could inspire the right people and organisations to join us, we could help create the right conditions for some massive positive changes.”The impact of digital inclusion programmes on the lives of people should not be underestimated. Andile Ngcaba is chairman of South Africa-based systems integration company Dimension Data in the Middle East and Africa. Before that he was director general of the South African Department of Communications (DOC).“People have spoken about Africa as an ‘unfortunate continent’ in terms of digital exclusion, but the pace of change has taken many by surprise,” he says. “Through Dimension Data’s schools programme, for example, I regularly see how interested in technology kids in Africa are and how quickly they get to grips with a keyboard and mouse.“I also see this interest in technology as a way of delivering education that they find more engaging than simply having a teacher speaking to them. This stuff is life-changing and I see that every day,” he says.Digital inclusion is a concern elsewhere, too. In Europe, for example, between 30 and 40 per cent of people are not able to participate in, or benefit from, the information society, according to Paul Timmers, head of unit for the European Commission’s ICT for Inclusion programme.“Our position is clear: e-inclusion is an economic opportunity and a social necessity,” he says. “Age, disability, living in a remote or rural area, cultural background, income, skills or motivation shouldn’t present barriers to participation in a modern economy – but they do. We’re working hard with national governments and IT suppliers to break down those barriers.”The commission has established the e-Inclusion Awards to raise awareness and to recognise excellence in areas such as encouraging digital participation among senior citizens and marginalised young people and opening e-government to EU citizens.In the UK, a government post of Minister for Digital Inclusion was created in April, in spite of the fact that about two-thirds of the population have internet access. It is part of an effort to include the remaining third.For example, Land Securities, the developer, has a project at Ebsfleet Valley in Kent, where consulting firm Arup is ensuring the 10,000 homes planned over the next 20 years are part of an overall “urban information architecture” that also takes into account the needs of businesses and government organisations.“By connecting people to the information they need, modern technology has the ability to improve a city’s environment and economy, making it a more desirable place to live and work,” explains Léan Doody, a principal consultant at Arup.“That includes fibre optic cables running up to individual houses, so residents benefit from the best internet access. Increasingly, I believe, this will be seen not as a luxury, but as a necessity of life, just like electricity and water.”
279;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;What IT means to me: ‘Games need to be taken seriously’;;"Spending time with Jen-Hsun Huang is like taking an intensive refresher course in computer science, physics and mathematics.Mr Huang moves quickly from molecular biological simulation and CT scan image reconstruction, through protein folding, to wind-tunnel simulations and crash tests in the car industry. In between, he covers mathematical models for financial services, supercomputers, and creating a new platform for parallel computing.Mr Huang, then, is not one to stand still. Born in Taiwan, he lived in Thailand as a child, then moved with his uncle and aunt to the US. He went to a boarding school in Kentucky before moving to Oregon, where he went to high school in the suburbs of Portland. He followed that with a degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University.After periods at LSI Logic and AMD, Mr Huang headed to Stanford University to take a masters degree, also in electrical engineering. Just one year on from leaving Stanford, he set about founding the graphics chip company, Nvidia.Fifteen years on, Nvidia is the last remaining independent, large-scale maker of graphics chips for computers. But Mr Huang wants Nvidia to be more than that. The reason for his rapid-fire tour of the sciences – not to mention the arts – is that he believes we are about to reach a tipping point in computing.“We saw an opportunity to move 3D graphics beyond its then-conventional markets in million dollar supercomputers and into consumer applications, primarily video games,” he says of the decision to set up the business in the early 1990s. “It’s ironic that Nvidia is now taking the technology we developed for those applications back to its scientific and industrial roots.”Originally, Nvidia set out to produce graphics chips and cards that added better display capabilities to computers, and Windows computers in particular. These subsystems became progressively more powerful, adding support for 3D graphics and programmable shading. The company added more processing cores to the chip sets, and also made them easier to program, through languages such as Open GL, mostly in order to satisfy the needs of the computer gaming industry.But six years ago, executives at Nvidia noticed that academic researchers were putting their products – also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, to an unexpected use: parallel computing, which involves multiple instructions being carried out simultaneously.“The GPU was mathematically intensive, but it was designed to display colours on a screen,” recalls Mr Huang.“We noticed that students were programming in languages such as Open GL on our GPUs to generate numbers instead of colours. On their own they had discovered the ‘general purpose’ GPU. But using a graphics language and receiving colours to re-interpret as numbers was such an arcane way of programming that it ruled out the mass market.”As a result, Nvidia adapted its GPUs to run a modified version of the C programming language, which the company calls CUDA.“That made it possible for these processors to become general purpose,” says Mr Huang. “These hundreds of processors are now collaborating to run a C program and to output numbers.“So scientists can use the GPU as a resource for general purpose computing. That is a big innovation.” CUDA is now taught as a system for parallel computing at more than 50 universities, Mr Huang adds with evident pride.An example of how powerful the GPU can be is Stanford University’s Folding@home protein analysis application, which studies the mysterious way proteins assemble themselves. Nearly half the program’s computing power, 1.25 petaflops, comes from just over 11,000 Nvidia GPUs. Some protein folding applications are 140 times quicker running on a graphics processor rather than a CPU, Mr Huang points out.But valuable though Standford’s Folding@home application undoubtedly is, CIOs might fail to see the relevance, and fail to see why they should specify what is a relatively expensive additional component, in the form of a dedicated graphics processor, rather than use the CPU maker’s integrated graphics.Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Huang says they should not, at least not for mainstream enterprise desktops. “Partially, I care about desktop applications, and, partially, I don’t,” he says.“We are not interested in being a generic computing company, where we solve everyone’s problems. We seek out challenging problems for specific groups of people. It was gamers and design professionals; now it is 40m to 50m creative professionals. These are people who have a challenging, visual computing problem, and we can be helpful to them.”For others, hosted computing in some form is the best option. “If you are a gamer or a designer, put a GeForce or Quadro in your system. If you are a secretary, or data entry person, or someone running a basic enterprise desktop, you should put your computing into the cloud.”Mr Huang is, however, enthusiastic about the company’s collaboration with Adobe – the software vendor’s products can talk directly to Nvidia GPUs – and sees an interesting opportunity to move the technology from specialist applications such as Adobe’s Photoshop or Premiere video-editing package, to more general business software, such as Acrobat.“We are seeing accidental innovation, which could be revolutionary,” he says. “Acrobat is an interactive document: where does text end and 3D begin? That will be very subtle. If I see an object I can give it a twirl. I can twirl a teapot or open a car door. That innovation comes from us innovating at the extremes, and then one day a smart company such as Adobe picks it up, because it has become so pervasive.”Technologies such as 3D rendering have become pervasive, Mr Huang says, because of computer gaming. CIOs might not like gaming much, at least not on company computers in company time. But it is gaming that created the market for Nvidia, and gaming that has enabled scientists, doctors and engineers to push the boundaries of computing with low-cost hardware.Mr Huang points out that IBM’s Roadrunner, a massive supercomputer built to model how nuclear weapons age, is built partly around the same Cell processor found in Sony’s PS3 games console. The GPU would not originally have attracted the interest of university researchers, if it were not for the economies of scale brought by sales to the computer games market.Mr Huang believes the gaming community is misunderstood, and not just by CIOs. But then it was gaming that drew him to the IT industry in the first place.“I always loved video games and that started me on the path to technology as a career,” he recalls. “We were the first generation to have access to computers at home and at school. My classmates and I would spend hours creating programs in Basic and coding the machines in the labs. After that I went on to study electrical engineering.”The older generation – Mr Huang is 45 – has not accepted gaming as a worthwhile pastime, he suggests. “Bill Gates says he played a lot of games. It creates puzzle-solvers, people who are good at multi-dimensional problem solving. Research suggests surgeons are more effective if they are gamers too. Kyle Bush, the Nascar [motor racing] driver, uses video gaming to train.”Mr Huang admits that Nvidia’s association with video games has “tarnished” the company’s image. “Because we have our origins in technology for gaming and this still continues to be a significant source of our revenues, we aren’t seen as a ‘serious’ company,” he says.But despite this, technology continues to amaze him. The personal computer industry, he suggests “is having a mid-life crisis”. But developments in parallel computing, and in areas such as the embedded market, for example in cars, or in mobile devices, offer the potential to be as inspiring as the PCs Mr Huang used at college in the 1980s.“Video cameras in your car mirrors will distort and re-distort images so you can see around bends,” he predicts. “You could have a sky view of your car for parallel parking. You would see your car in the third person – that is possible with graphics processors.”If drivers could practise parking using a video game, you suspect Mr Huang would be a very happy man indeed."
280;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-10-21T14:26:25Z;IT going green: Software maximises power of the wind;;"For a growing number of companies, reducing their environmental footprint means looking at the energy used by their IT systems.But some other businesses, especially utilities and those involved in infrastructure or transport, have to look at the problem the other way round. They are increasing their investments in IT, in order to meet their environmental targets.In the case of Spanish power distribution company Red Eléctrica de España (REE), the investment in new software technology amounted to €300,000 ($400,125).The company’s international division manages the power supply systems in non-peninsular Spain: the Canary and Balearic Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla. REE International (REI) does not generate electricity, but has an obligation to buy energy at the lowest cost, while meeting environmental targets.In mainland Spain, electricity generators compete by way of a national market, with prices set daily. Off the mainland, however, local markets are too small for this approach to work. Instead, REE manages the electricity networks through the “unit commitment”.Unit commitment systems are used in other electricity markets, particularly in North America. Under its rules, the distributor must buy power from the generators as cheaply as it can, while maintaining safe and consistent supplies.The system for non-peninsular Spain, however, has another criterion built in: managing the environmental impact. The company has a target to reduce emissions by 2.5 per cent or 100,000 tonnes of CO2 annually.Furthermore, REI has to distribute all available renewable energy before buying from other sources. In the Canary Islands, for example, this means ensuring that all the abundant wind energy is dispatched.Meeting the unit commitment – and ensuring a constant supply of power – requires advanced planning techniques.Because levels of power from renewable sources, especially from wind, vary with the weather, REI has to calculate likely supplies from renewables, based on operators’ predictions, and also know what other capacity will be available, should these supplies fall short.It also has to know how quickly this capacity can come on stream, and its cost.Javier Revuelta, senior consultant operation planning expert at REI , says calculating the unit commitment requires complex algorithms. Managing these meant using a tool developed and programmed in the Fortran computer language.“We see quite a few changes in legislation and in technology in the electricity system, so we often have to make modifications to the software. That was quite complicated to do in the tool. We wanted a more exact method [of calculating the unit commitment] in order to reduce costs, and software we could modify easily to model the constraints.”Mr Revuelta expects to need to make constant changes to the mathematical models over the next few years – new wind generation capacity, for example, is expected to come on line every six months.The company will also need to accommodate other changes, such as rising demand, environmental regulations, and an under-sea interconnector between the Balearic Islands and mainland Spain, which will give access to a broader range of electricity generators.As a result, REI decided to introduce a new, more flexible method for modelling the unit commitment system, based on optimisation software rather than handwritten code.The new system is based on three tools from ILOG, the software vendor: CPLEX®, OPL and ODM. CPLEX® provides a library for the algorithms; OPL allows developers to program the application; and ODM – the optimisation decision manager – enables REI to deploy the optimisation application and, if need be, for staff to customise it.While hardly an off-the-shelf solution, the software enabled a prototype to be developed in just two months. And REI’s modelling staff, who are experts in their field but not necessarily IT experts, can now make changes directly without having to call in Fortran programmers.REI is currently running both the Fortran and ILOG-based systems side by side, but expects to move entirely to ODM over the next few months. One reason is that the more accurate models are saving the company up to €100,000 a day in more efficient energy purchasing.It is also bringing significant environmental improvements, by allowing REE to balance supply from renewable and conventional energy sources better.“We are not generators, but system operators,” Mr Revuelta explains. “We program the generators’ capacity with our algorithms. We decide which [plants] have to be started up or shut down, at what times of the day. We don’t, for example, decide to build more, or less, wind generation capacity, but we have to use, in the best possible way, the renewable capacity other people own.”This is why REI’s initial investment in a new modelling system will pay environmental, as well as financial, dividends.Planned expansion of wind farms in the Canary Islands, in particular, is likely to lead to all the islands’ off-peak, or night time, power demand being met by wind energy, and up to 50 per cent of peak demand. Because weather changes, REI’s modelling will need to be all the more precise, as well as updated to reflect new capacity.“Currently, in extra-peninsular Spain, renewables supply less than 10 per cent of energy,” says Mr Revuelta. “But by 2012 that will rise to 20 per cent …Our mandate is to program in as much [renewable energy] as producers tell us they can provide. Every time a new wind farm is installed, and that happens at least once or twice a year, we will need to update our models.”"

DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.

Wednesday had seen the worst sell-off since 1987.The benchmark index closed up 4.3 per cent at 946.43, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 8,979.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 5.5 per cent higher at 1,717.71.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up as much as 17.2 per cent to pass yet another grim milestone, reaching above 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. It finished down 2.9 per cent at 67.25.Stocks were pushed lower by economic data that showed industrial production had endured the worst monthly decline since 1974, and factory activity in parts of the country had crashed to an 18-year low.Consumer stocks were among the winners from the late-afternoon rally as some traders bet that oil’s slide below $70 could offer hard- pressed Americans at least some relief.Macy’s closed up 16.1 per cent at $10.05 having fallen as much as 11.7 per cent. Oil’s slide to an intraday low of $68.57 a barrel, while a symptom of global slowdown could nonetheless put “cash back into people’s pockets”, said Bill Stone, investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.Yet the energy sector, down as much as 8.1 per cent after data showed crude and gasoline inventories rose sharply last week, also rebounded and was up 7.8 per cent by the close.Financials were the laggards of the day, but still up 1.7 per cent, following a raft of heavy writedowns and losses from banks.Citigroup rose as much as 4 per cent but later tumbled to stand 2 per cent lower at $15.90 as investors weighed cost-cutting progress with writedowns of $4.4bn in the securities and banking division and weak revenues from its credit card unit.Merrill Lynch rose 0.6 per cent to $18.35. The bank, which is being taken over by Bank of America, reported a worse-than-expected net loss of $7.5bn, mostly due to write­downs and credit losses on complex debt securities.A host of regional banks also reported losses. Bank of New York Mellon rose 6.3 per cent to $31.08 even after costs to bail out funds hurt by Lehman Brothers’s bankruptcy dented third-quarter profits, which fell more than expected.Huntington and BB&T, which also reported downbeat figures, added 10.2 per cent to $9.48 and gained 3.4 per cent to $33.26, respectively.Insurers endured sharp declines after Fitch warned it may cut ratings on some. Hartford Financial Services dropped 11.9 per cent to $28.86, respectively.The falls came even though the rate at which banks lend to each other, measured by overnight dollar Libor, fell sharply.Elsewhere, airlines managed gains even after Southwest Airlines reported its first quarterly net loss since 1991, as oil slid below $70 a barrel.Southwest climbed 8 per cent to $12.49, while Delta Air Lines advanced 18.8 per cent to $8.64. “The leverage from the plunge in fuel prices is huge,” Credit Suisse said.Peabody Energy was a stand-out winner in the energy sector, up 18.3 per cent to $28.68 on the back of well-received third-quarter figures.Technology was up 4.8 per cent overall. Ebay fell 2.4 per cent to $14.97 after the online retailer forecast its first quarterly sales decline after the bell on Wednesday.Google, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.1 per cent to $353.02, 3.7 per cent to $91.52 and 5.4 per cent to $4.12 respectively.After the bell, the trio reported better than expected results and the shares bounced 8.2 per cent, 0.7 per cent and fell 2.9 per cent, respectively, in after- hours trade.Food groups were mixed after Hershey’s results. The chocolate group, which rose 6.9 per cent to $35.24, boosted third-quarter profits but warned of slowing sales growth next year.

But Waleed al-Morkarrab al-Muhairi, the chairman of ATIC, told the Financial Times that the company, which is wholly owned by the Abu Dhabi government, would look to expand once it has “digested” the new project.“Over time, absolutely, you are going to see us growing and it’s not just going to be confined to semi-conductors, it could be in anything as technologically diverse as composite manufacturing to biotech and life sciences,” Mr Muhairi said.Mr Muhairi is also chief operating officer of Mubadala, which announced it would increase its stake in AMD from 8.1 per cent to 19.3 per cent.Mubadala is one of the more visible and active members of Abu Dhabi’s growing stable of state investment entities, which includes the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the region’s largest sovereign wealth fund, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, which bought a majority stake in New York’s Chrysler building earlier this year.
284;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-10-07T21:00:31Z;AMD future is Fusion not fabs;;Keeping pace with a giant entails taking large steps and AMD’s hiving off of its manufacturing plants is its second major bound in two years. It is far less risky than its last one.AMD is being outspent 10 to one by Intel this year on increasing the sophistication of the manufacturing process for semiconductors.Intel has forged ahead of AMD in reducing the circuit widths of chips from 65 to 45 and next 32 billionths of a metre. Equally significant, AMD was on the verge of being left behind in the move up from wafers 300mm in diameter to 450mm from 2012.Intel, Samsung and TSMC announced in May that they had reached agreement on managing the transition to the larger wafers from which chips are cut, creating savings of as much as 40 per cent.In July, Intel senior vice president Pat Gelsinger predicted that the cost of retooling to 450mm would force consolidation and reduce the number of chip manufacturers to less than 10. Anyone spending less than $1bn a year on capital expenditure – AMD is expected to spend $900m in 2008 – would fall off the pace, he warned.AMD’s spinning off and recapitalisation of its manufacturing arm puts it back in the game, while allowing it to focus on its core business of designing the processing “cores” of computers.Its earlier bold step of buying Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI in 2006 with the idea of creating a “Fusion” product, combining the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), has yet to bear fruit, bringing nothing but writedowns and losses.It sold ATI’s digital TV chip business to Broadcom in August to further narrow its focus and has just launched a major branding campaign around the Fusion concept.“The Future is Fusion” was both a message to its customers and an urgent memo to itself.
285;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-10-07T20:07:29Z;AMD splits;;Where once it was the quick and the dead, it is now size rather than speed that discriminates the living (at least for technology companies). Hence the need for US chipmaker AMD to seek out the deep pockets of Abu Dhabi. The Emirate’s sovereign wealth fund is to buy a majority stake in the chip manufacturing business to be spun out of AMD for $700m and then contribute another $3bn-$6bn to build foundries for the new group.The need for help is the result of the harsh reality faced by all but the largest manufacturers and designers of hardware: once a lead is established in terms of scale and technology, it is very rarely reversed.AMD created a debt burden that threatened to overwhelm it by trying to stay competitive against dominant competitor Intel. In 2006 AMD bought graphics chip designer ATI for $5.7bn, betting that the technology would converge with the computer processors that it makes. That may ultimately pay off, but after losses of $1.6bn on revenues of just $2.8bn in the first half of this year, time was running out.Meanwhile, the largest processor, digital memory and chip manufacturers – Intel, Samsung and TSMC – have announced plans to build the next generation of chip manufacturing processes, due to come online between 2010 and 2015. With an annual capital spending budget of $1bn, compared with more than $11bn at Intel, AMD would not be able to compete.So, by following the path of outsourcing – graphics chipmaker Nvida, Qualcomm and Broadcomm are all similarly without foundaries – AMD should at least survive. The group’s bombed-out stock surged by almost a fifth on Tuesday on the news. Prospering, however, will remain a challenge. It no doubt suits Intel to have a small competitor that shows it is being kept honest. But Abu Dhabi’s new partner will be hard pressed to do more than that.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public commentsclick here
286;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-10-07T12:16:40Z;AMD spins off plants in $8.4bn Abu Dhabi deal;;Advanced Micro Devices will spin off its chip plants and receive a lifeline of up to $8.4bn from Abu Dhabi as it struggles to compete with Intel, its larger rival.AMD announced yesterday a long-awaited “asset lite” strategy that will relieve it of the burden of trying to maintain manufacturing parity with its Silicon Valley neighbour.Its shares, coming off 16-year lows, rose 20 per cent in midday trading to $5.10.AMD plans to create an enterprise, initially called The Foundry Company, with Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC). It would absorb its existing production units, or “fabs”, expand a facility in Dresden, Germany, and spend $3.2bn on a new plant in upstate New York, creating more than 1,400 jobs.AMD has lost a manufacturing edge to Intel as it has been unable to maintain the pace and investment of its rival in more efficient processes. It reported its seventh successive quarter of losses in July and replaced Hector Ruiz as chief executive.Mr Ruiz, AMD chairman, will move across to take that role at the new company, with Doug Grose, head of manufacturing, becoming chief executive of The Foundry Company.ATIC will pay AMD $700m in cash for a 55.6 per cent stake in the new company, and will add $1.4bn to fund its operations, with a promise of investment of between $3.6bn and $6bn on new facilities in the next five years.$1.2bn of AMD’s debt will be transferred to the new company and AMD will receive an investment from Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Company to increase a stake that it acquired last year.Mubadala, which paid more than $600m at $12.70 a share last November for an 8.1 per cent stake, has boosted its holding to 19.3 per cent with just a $314m investment, as AMD stock closed on Monday at just $4.23.Dirk Meyer, AMD chief executive, said the move allowed the group to maintain access to leading-edge technologies without having to make the capital-intensive investments of semiconductor manufacturing.AMD plans $900m in capital expenditure this year, compared with $11.2bn in spending by Intel.The two divide up all but a small fraction of the “x86” microprocessor market, with Intel taking a share of more than 80 per cent.Intel has beaten AMD to new levels of miniaturisation of circuits to widths of 45 billionths of a metre.It has questioned whether AMD can put in the investment to move up to the next 450mm size for circular wafers, from which chips are cut.There are no plans to take The Foundry Company public and the deal will be subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States. AMD will transfer about 3,000 employees to The Foundry Company, which will have its headquarters in the US.AMD had $5.3bn in debt by mid-year and wrote down its $5.4bn acquisition of graphics chipmaker ATI in 2006, recording $2.4bn in impairment charges.
287;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-09-16T15:53:30Z;AMD: a newly built campus with with a host of green features;;Old buildings have problems when it comes to technology and helping the environment – after all they were hardly built with the modern day in mind – but newer buildings should cater for both factors.When chip maker AMD started to build a new campus three years ago in Austin, Texas, it set itself the ambitious target of giving the building the “wow factor” while keeping the environmental impact to a minimum.“The campus was designed to fit the needs of its employees and the local environment,” says Craig Garcia, director of corporate services and project manager for Lone Star, as the campus is called.“[We] assembled a diverse team of internationally recognised architects, engineers, ecologists and sustainable design experts.“The team embarked on an intensive design process known as a ‘charrette’ and created a site plan based on three key tenets – limiting site impact, protecting water quality and using innovative sustainable design.”Some $270m later and AMD has signed a 10-year contract with Austin Energy for 100 per cent renewable power for Lone Star.You might be forgiven for thinking that an IT company would want to use as much IT as possible to control such a building – perhaps simply because it has become expected that technology firms will have the latest versions of everything.But AMD appears to have taken sustainable design to heart, using recycled materials, local manufacturing and wood grown in ecologically maintained forests.“Most of the design features integrated into the building were one-time investments, such as bamboo floors or concrete walls, and do not require monitoring and maintenance from IT or any other operations team,” says Mr Garcia.“Green teams help educate employees about integrating environmentally friendly choices into their everyday actions and source new ideas for how employees can minimise their footprints.”But he adds that AMD also uses the latest technology in its products to help the environment: “Besides constantly improving facility operations, AMD designs energy efficiency features into products that result in lower emissions from the generation of electricity consumed during the product’s useful life.“Most recently, we introduced advanced quad-core technology, for energy-hungry data centres. Designed to beat pre-existing benchmarks, it boosts performance of AMD processors up to 70 per cent without any increase in energy-consumption.”Impressive campus features include a 1.1m gallon underground water tank that siphons rainwater from the roof. This is stored and is, in turn, used to irrigate the site’s enormous landscape and to cool the building.Another spokesman adds: “We don’t have what you’d call a data centre. We have a cold room for servers that run business operations. But we have data centres offsite.“There are a number of things in the design of the building that save energy though. The windows are designed to let more daylight in so we don’t need as much lighting.“We have a cooling system that uses less electricity, but the trade-off is that it uses more water. That’s why we’ve got the 1.1m gallon water tank to collect the rain.”
288;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-09-16T15:53:29Z;IT’s going green: Disposal should be put first;;One of the most renowned thinkers on the topic of lifecycle management is an architect called William McDonough, author of Cradle to Cradle. Mr McDonough argues that design needs a radical shake-up to give products extra lifecycles, which could be considered from their start.For example, how many people know what a computer will be recycled into? It is an afterthought. In the cradle-to-cradle ethos, its designer would know what the computer will become after it stops being useful as it is.Lifecycle management haunts the CIO. IT manufacturing is not quite at the cradle-to-cradle stage yet, but picking the right design and working out the best usage and cheapest, most eco-friendly disposal methods all have to be thought about.Total cost of ownership, depreciation, power usage, repair costs, life expectancy and now carbon costs must all be taken into account when managing a fleet of servers. But before you can work out how to make green the whirring, oven-like data centres, you first need to know exactly what you are dealing with.“Many CIOs have no measures around green,” says Mark Nutt, managing director of technology lifecycle for Morse. “They don’t even see the power bills. We know organisations will want to build green strategies, so we give them a collection of short factors that deliver real benefits.“We help companies manage the buying process and the lifecycle. Many of them just don’t join up the dots when it comes to ownership of equipment. We give them additional information so they can measure carbon footprints, operating costs and residual value of infrastructure.“We work with the Carbon Neutral Company and use a register for carbon footprints. It’s based on power consumption and utilisation.”Morse gives companies a broad view of their lifecycle management metrics. For example, it helped a bank conduct a technology audit. The bank then understood where money was being wasted and replaced power-hungry monitors with flat screens (saving one third of previously used power), consolidated old data on to fewer machines, and bought more efficient servers.“We’ve now replaced these with servers about the size of two stacked pizza boxes, which is incredible,” says the bank’s data centre manager. “They can easily handle the workload of many bigger, older servers, while creating substantially less heat and using a fraction of the power.”Mr Nutt says his team is also helping companies to make the most of recycling, too. In Europe, old IT equipment now has to be decommissioned in accordance with a recycling directive from the EU, but Morse is challenging what is labelled “old”, as opposed to “used”.The company’s asset retirement programme looks at the usefulness of old products and parts that could be sold or used as part of a vendor trade-in programme. (Along the lines of used cars and scrap heap cash.)“In the ownership phase of a product, we look at the value of it,” adds Mr Nutt.“For example, a lot of IT companies lease their equipment. At the end of the lease, you can buy it or give it back. If we think it’s a good idea, we might encourage a company to buy it for, say, £60,000 ($108,000). If we do that, we know they could sell it for say £200,000.“Some manufacturers even buy back old machines to use spare parts. If you look at Sun, HP and IBM, they all have good remarketing policies.”………………………………AMD: a newly built campus with a host of green featuresOld buildings have problems when it comes to technology and helping the environment – after all they were hardly built with the modern day in mind – but newer buildings should cater for both factors.When chip maker AMD started to build a new campus three years ago in Austin, Texas, it set itself the ambitious target of giving the building the “wow factor” while keeping the environmental impact to a minimum.“The campus was designed to fit the needs of its employees and the local environment,” says Craig Garcia, director of corporate services and project manager for Lone Star, as the campus is called.“[We] assembled a diverse team of internationally recognised architects, engineers, ecologists and sustainable design experts.“The team embarked on an intensive design process known as a ‘charrette’ and created a site plan based on three key tenets – limiting site impact, protecting water quality and using innovative sustainable design.”Some $270m later and AMD has signed a 10-year contract with Austin Energy for 100 per cent renewable power for Lone Star.You might be forgiven for thinking that an IT company would want to use as much IT as possible to control such a building – perhaps simply because it has become expected that technology firms will have the latest versions of everything.But AMD appears to have taken sustainable design to heart, using recycled materials, local manufacturing and wood grown in ecologically maintained forests.“Most of the design features integrated into the building were one-time investments, such as bamboo floors or concrete walls, and do not require monitoring and maintenance from IT or any other operations team,” says Mr Garcia.“Green teams help educate employees about integrating environmentally friendly choices into their everyday actions and source new ideas for how employees can minimise their footprints.”But he adds that AMD also uses the latest technology in its products to help the environment: “Besides constantly improving facility operations, AMD designs energy efficiency features into products that result in lower emissions from the generation of electricity consumed during the product’s useful life.“Most recently, we introduced advanced quad-core technology, for energy-hungry data centres.

289;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-09-16T15:50:45Z;The interface: Gestures will force the mouse into retirement;;"At almost 30 years old, is the computer mouse ready for retirement? Certainly, a growing band of human-computer interaction (HCI) specialists believe so. The crude language of “point and click”, they argue, seriously limits the “conversations” we have with our computers.Among them is Bruce “Tog” Tognazzini, a veteran HCI expert who joined Apple in 1978 as its 66th employee and founded the company’s Human Interface Group during his 14 years there. These days, after spells at Sun Microsystems and online healthcare company WebMD, Mr Tognazzini is a respected consultant, author and speaker with usability company, the Nielsen Norman Group.“In many ways, our continued reliance on the computer mouse reduces us to little more than cavemen, running around pointing at symbols and ‘grunting’ with each click,” he says. “A revolution is long overdue, because we need more sophisticated tools that will allow us to increase our vocabulary way beyond that caveman grunt.” Plus, the link between the computer mouse and cases of repetitive strain injury (RSI) are hardly an argument in its favour, he adds.Luckily, he says, those “more sophisticated” tools are right in front of our faces and we already know how to use them. They are, in fact, our fingers.“Look at the facts: we’ve typically got 10 of these ‘tools’; they move in a multitude of different ways; and gestural language, which came long before verbal language, is an established and intuitive form of self-expression. Even primates can be trained to express needs and intentions using their fingers,” he points out.What has historically been lacking, is the ability of computers to read and understand our gestures – but that is changing very quickly. In fact, real-time video interpretation and inertial sensors are already being used to recognise facial expression and physical movement in a number of consumer technology devices, says Steven Prentice, an analyst with IT market research company Gartner.He traces the roots of this migration to two recent events: the launch of the Nintendo Wii games console in 2006 and of the Apple iPhone in 2007. Through clever use of accelerometers and optical sensor technology, the Wii Remote (or “wiimote”) is already enabling millions of people to practise their golf swings, play rock guitar or swordfight with imaginary enemies. And since the iPhone was launched, strong sales and high user satisfaction have reinforced just how powerful and intuitive a multitouch interface can be.These early announcements have been followed by a string of others in consumer technology. In recent months, Panasonic, Sony and NEC have all demonstrated applications that use facial and movement recognition. These include, for example, video displays from Panasonic that can identify users from their faces, serve up content choices based on their individual preferences, and that allow screen control by hand gestures.It’s easy for business leaders and chief information officers to dismiss such trends in consumer preference as minimally relevant to enterprise computing – but that’s a “dangerous oversimplification”, warns Mr Prentice. “Not all consumer-targeted technologies find their way directly into enterprise IT environments,” he concedes, “but the growing adoption of these technologies by individuals in their ‘personal infrastructures’ is leading to increasing frustration and dissatisfaction with constraints and restrictions the corporate IT environment often imposes on users.”Fortunately, it’s not just the consumer technology firms that have their eyes on gestural technologies. At Accenture Technology Labs, research director Kelly Dempski has a long track record in exploring how they can be used in business applications, most recently concentrating on building multi-touch, interactive display walls.Accenture has installed such walls, for example, in O’Hare International Airport in Chicago and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Consisting of multiple screens housed in giant custom frames, they use graphics and touch-screen technology to allow passengers to check the weather at their destination, read the latest news from CNN, or find out how their team scored while they were in flight, by simply touching areas on the screen.This technology, says Dempski, could have equally valuable back-office applications, presenting vital internal data from back-end enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to employees in a control room at a utility firm, for example. “The aim is to create a mode of interaction that requires zero training but offers a high degree of interactivity,” says Mr Dempski.At Microsoft, meanwhile, researcher Desney Tan is taking HCI to new levels: muscle-computer interaction. Mr Tan and his colleagues, alongside researchers from the Universities of Washington and Toronto, have developed an armband worn on the forearm that recognises finger movements by monitoring muscle activity. They have called it MUCI, which stands for muscle-computer interface and its aim is to make controlling computers and gadgets easier in situations where the user is otherwise engaged – for example, when driving a car or in a meeting.“The human body is a prolific signal-generator,” he says. “My work is focusing on the potential of tapping into the electromagnetic signals that the brain sends to muscles, which has the potential to harness a whole range of subtler movements than simply a press or a pinch on an interactive screen.”MUCI currently works extremely well in situations where major arm movements are constrained and finger gestures are made on a flat surface, he says. Tests on volunteers have shown that after calibration, the system can recognise the position and pressure of all 10 digits with 95 per cent accuracy.“Where we want to take this research next is to capturing gestures made in three-dimensional space,” he says, adding that the ability to do that and still recognise gestures with a fair degree of accuracy will start to open the door to a huge range of potential applications – even recognising and translating sign language used by deaf people.Naturally, applications based on gestural computing place a huge strain on underlying hardware, which is forced to process a larger volume and wider range of more subtle signals. Among chip manufacturers, this is forcing a shift in focus from traditional central processing units [CPUs] to the graphics processing units [GPUs] that, up to now, have primarily been used in gaming and virtual world environments.In essence, a GPU is a dedicated graphics rendering device for personal computers and games consoles that is very efficient at manipulating and displaying computer graphics.More important, the ability to process information in a highly parallel way makes GPUs far more effective at handling a large range of complex algorithms than CPUs, which process them in a linear, one-at-a-time fashion, explains Richard Huddy, worldwide head of developer relations at chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).“Say you’ve got an application that uses a webcam to capture shots of a human subject and analyse their gestures. It will need to figure out the relationship between each frame and its predecessor in, perhaps, one-sixtieth of a second, and there’s a lot of maths involved in doing that in a smooth and uninterrupted way. A GPU will do that much, much better,” he says.In order to get its slice of the gestural computing market, AMD is already locked in a pitched battle with rivals Intel and Nvidia to deliver advanced GPU capabilities to hardware manufacturers as soon as possible, with a slew of new product announcements planned for 2009.All this means that businesses need to be prepared. No one is predicting the instant demise of the computer mouse, and certainly not of the keyboard as a text-entry tool. “Despite the many disadvantages of a design nearing its centenary, nothing else currently comes close to the functionality of the conventional tactile keyboard,” says Mr Prentice of Gartner.But there will be a “strong and unstoppable” trend towards a control interface for technology that is based on simple human gestures, rather than on indirect manipulation via physical objects such as a mouse, he predicts.He says that revolution is three to five years off for mainstream business, but it’s not too soon for business leaders to “suspend their natural scepticism” and start to think about how gestural computing might be used to address their organisations’ most intractable user interface issues.“The phrase ‘paradigm shift’ is an overused one, but it’s not often that such fundamental elements of the computer interface change, and the opportunities for enterprises able to capitalise on these changes will be substantial,” he says."

It said it would focus on its core business – the PC microprocessor market – where Intel and itself have more than 95 per cent of the market.The Silicon Valley company announced it would sell off the digital TV and handheld chip businesses, acquired when it bought Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI in 2006.Analysts welcomed the move as helping AMD’s financial position and boosting Broadcom’s prospects in the DTV market.Avi Cohen, head of research at Avian Securities, said Broadcom was the most logical buyer of the business as it had become one of the leading players in DTV.“For AMD, this will allow [it] to raise cash to improve its balance sheet position and realign its core business. At the same time, it will give it a way to exit a business that has become very competitive.”The US authorities have been demanding basic solutions for the switchover from analogue to digital television taking place on February 17 and the chip business has seen commoditisation and major price erosion.Broadcom said the acquisition meant it could “immediately scale its DTV business and …offer a complete product line that covers all segments”.Around 530 AMD employees in six design centres around the world will join Broadcom as part of the deal, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.Broadcom shares fell nearly 4 per cent to $26.36 in midday trading in New York, while those of AMD rose 3 per cent to $5.99.
291;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-08-19T23:00:03Z;Intel bullish over Atom processor for ‘netbooks’;;Intel has offered a bullish forecast for its new Atom processor for low-end “netbooks” and other mobile computing devices, although executives conceded that the product could eat into sales of more profitable notebook chips.The comments came on Tuesday as the US chipmaker also confirmed plans to roll out microprocessors based on its new “Nehalem” architecture, which analysts said would allow Intel to emulate a hardware architecture already used by AMD and cement its lead over its smaller rival. The aggressive plans for both Atom and the Nehalem chip came at the Intel developer forum in San Francisco, the company’s main event for announcing its detailed product plans.Although only representing a small part of its output at present, the Atom processors attracted much of the attention given the unexpectedly high consumer demand this year for “netbooks”.Intel originally believed these low-cost laptops would sell only in emerging markets, but has since discovered a strong market in the developed world for families looking for a second, third or fourth machine, said Dadi Perlmutter, head of its mobile computing efforts.While the company did not give specific numbers, a chart presented by Intel at the forum suggested that machines based on the low-power Atom chip, which was launched this year, would account for nearly 40 per cent of mobile devices powered by Intel chips in 2012, with the rest based on regular notebook processors.Mr Perlmutter conceded that the low-priced chips could reduce sales of more profitable products. However, he added that “sometimes cannibalisation is not such a bad thing”, since the low-end notebooks that were likely to be affected were more marginal products for Intel.Also, while Atom-based machines would be good for simple tasks such as internet browsing, watching video or playing simple games, they would be impractical for the multiple simultaneous processing tasks that users of more powerful machines require.Intel confirmed plans to put Atom processors into smartphones and other smaller form-factor devices next year, and predicted a wide range of other uses for the chip in “embedded” consumer electronics products.

By the close, the stock was down 18.1 per cent to $23.84.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Although we would be surprised to see large writedowns of the same magnitude over the next two quarters, we believe that the risk of additional impairment remains, adding to investor concerns about capital deficiency. In addition, we believe that further downgrades could be on the cards.”Meanwhile, Citigroup said it would buy back more than $7bn worth of auction rate securities and take a $100m fine as part of an agreement to settle claims that it mis-sold the instruments to clients. Citigroup lost 4.3 per cent to $18.85.The sell-off in financials gathered pace in mid-afternoon after Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade American Express’s debt rating and the sector closed down 5 per cent.JPMorgan Chase slipped 3.8 per cent to $39.81, Bank of America dipped 5.8 per cent to $31.52 and American Express slid 4.2 per cent to $36.40.Consumer-facing stocks faced headwinds from volatile oil prices and some poor sales data from retailers.Wal-Mart said same-store sales grew less than expected last month and forecast slower sales growth in August, which suggested that the temporary fillip from tax rebates was beginning to fade.The shares slid 6.3 per cent, the most in six years, to $56.96 on that bleak prospect.Meanwhile, Whole Foods and Kimberly-Clark dipped 5.9 per cent to $18.88 and 3.5 per cent to $58.48 respectively.That overshadowed better-than-expected July sales for Costco Wholesale and an improved outlook from JC Penney. Costco shares rose 0.2 per cent to $65.82 while JC Penney added 6.1 per cent to $33.53.The consumer discretionary sector fell 2 per cent as Target and Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 4.7 per cent to $45.76 and 10.6 per cent to $49.80 respectively after they posted disappointing same store sales in July.Markets took another leg down after the release of the latest batch of numbers on employment.The number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose 7,000 to 455,000 from 448,000 a week earlier.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.9 per cent to 11,431.43 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,355.73On Wednesday stocks climbed to their highest levels since the end of June, shrugging off morning worries about wider-than-expected losses at Freddie Mac as oil prices dropped and positive results buoyed the technology sector.So far this earnings season, more than 400 S&P 500 companies have reported results and, on average, profit has declined by about 21 per cent.Information technology companies have posted some of the best performances. Their profits have grown by an average of 18 per cent this quarter.On Thursday, Teradata led the sector higher. The data storage software provider reported second-quarter profits that beat analysts’ estimates and its shares rose 6.6 per cent to $24.40.The sector was among the best performers, giving up only 0.1 per cent.Semiconductor stocks also made ground after Citigroup analysts suggested Intel was on course to meet “aggressive” third-quarter revenue growth targets thanks to the popularity of its Atom chip.Intel climbed 3.8 per cent to $23.67, Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.8 per cent to $5.03 while SanDisk added 6.1 per cent to $16.17.Markets also took a measure of solace from the most recent housing data, which showed an unexpected bounce in pending home sales, although homebuilder stocks themselves were largely unmoved.
293;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-07-18T20:57:54Z;Poor tech sector profits weigh on Wall St;;US stocks were mixed on Friday but were set to break their longest run of weekly losses in four years after Citigroup posted better-than-expected earnings, offsetting some poor results from Google, Microsoft and Merrill Lynch.Citigroup, the biggest US bank by assets, said it lost $2.5bn in the second quarter after about $7.2bn of writedowns. That was a smaller loss than the $3.67bn analysts were expecting. Citigroup shares jumped 7.7 per cent to $19.35.The results follow a series of surprisingly healthy earnings reports from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services Group which helped financial stocks to rally sharply over the last two sessions.But poor second-quarter results from Merrill Lynch, which included writedowns of $9.4bn, showed that the fallout from the credit crunch was far from over and continued to eat away at confidence and bank capital.Merrill rose 0.6 per cent to $30.91 and the S&P 500 financials index rose 1.1 per cent.Over the week the financial sector advanced 10.9 per cent, setting the S&P 500 up for a gain of 1.3 per cent, after Washington unveiled dramatic moves to shore up mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.When those moves failed to turn sentiment, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced emergency rules limiting certain types of short-selling in the government-sponsored entities and brokerage stocks.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford financial services group, said: “By doing that they triggered a huge wave of short covering that led to a sharp rally.“Overall, it was a volatile week, packed with input from Washington, the financials, tech and oil prices coming down, all coming together to move markets in a way we haven’t seen in some time.”On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 fluctuated between gains and losses but closed the session roughly flat at 1,260.64 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 11,495.84 points, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent to 2,282.78 points.On Friday, reports suggested that Freddie might raise up to $10bn by selling new shares. Freddie rose 10.2 per cent to $9.18 while Fannie added 22.6 per cent to $13.40.Over the past week the pair’s shares have lost and gained as much as 30 per cent on single days but are now ahead 22.5 per cent and 30.2 per cent respectively.Some deal news also lifted markets. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the Israeli generic drug maker, agreed to buy rival Barr Pharmaceuticals for $7.46bn. Barr rose 11 per cent to $63.43 while Teva, which is listed on Nasdaq, rose 4.4 per cent to $42.87.In the background, oil ticked lower but some gains for oil service companies boosted energy stocks 1.5 per cent and broke a three-day losing streak for the sector.Schlumberger was a gainer, adding 3.9 per cent to $100.55 after the company posted a 13 per cent jump in profits. Still the sector lost 6.1 per cent over the week.Conversely, the consumer discretionary sectors struggled to hold its ground on Friday, falling 0.2 per cent, but gained 6.5 per cent over the week as oil prices dropped below $130 a barrel.Some technology bell-wethers also missed ambitious earnings estimates, chilling markets with the idea that the sector may not escape the current economic slowdown unscathed.Google, for example, noted that growth in the number of consumers clicking on web ads had slowed, while Microsoft also said its Office programs missed sales targets for a second straight quarter. Meanwhile, a seventh straight quarterly loss at Advanced Micro Devices prompted the company to replace its chief executive.However, strong numbers from IBM helped steady nerves somewhat.Google fell 9.8 per cent to $481.32, Microsoft lost 6 per cent to $25.86, AMD slid 12.3 per cent to $4.65 while IBM rose 2.7 per cent to $129.89.
294;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-07-11T17:57:52Z;AMD shares fall over $1bn charge;;Shares in Advanced Micro Devices fell to a 16-year low as $1bn in second-quarter charges highlighted its struggle to slim down operations and return to profitability.AMD announced the second writedown from its 2006 acquisition of the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI. It said it was taking an impairment charge of $880m, following on from a charge of about $1.5bn last year. It paid $5.4bn for ATI.The microprocessor rival to Intel also announced a $32m restructuring charge as it made severance payments to laid-off employees, along with $36m in other charges. The bulk of these related to its shareholding in Spansion, the memory chip maker it spun off in 2005.AMD shares fell to levels not seen since July 1992, falling to as low as $4.60 in trading in New York. This meant a 69 per cent fall in value over the past year.AMD’s acquisition of ATI represented a bold attempt to seize the initiative in a new semiconductor trend called visual computing. It envisages a blurring of the lines between linear central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors made by Intel and AMD and the parallel-processing graphics processing units (GPUs) that have been made by ATI and its rival Nvidia.AMD’s strategy has been hampered by the debt burden it has taken on, initial underperformance by ATI and Intel’s ability to massively outspend it on manufacturing plant and introducing new and more efficient processes.AMD said on Friday its impairment charge related to ATI’s handheld and DTV units within its consumer electronics division. These have been determined as non-core and analysts believe they may be sold off if they continue to underperform.AMD has suffered six consecutive quarters of losses and will report second-quarter earnings next Thursday. Analysts expect a further loss of 51 cents a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Hector Ruiz, chief executive, may provide details of an ”asset-light” strategy AMD is pursuing. It has been falling behind Intel in investment in new plant and is expected to outsource much of its production and become more reliant on ”foundry” chipmakers.AMD said on Friday the sale of older chip wafer fabrication tools would boost its gross margins by about $190m.
295;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-07-01T22:58:53Z;Intel sees leadership in a shrinking world;;Intel celebrates its 40th anniversary this month, but in Moore’s Law fashion it is doubling down on its future more than looking back at its past.Pat Gelsinger, senior vice president and a 29-year veteran, said yesterday he had planted a few trees to mark the occasion but he preferred to look ahead to how the world’s biggest chipmaker could maintain its dominance and technological momentum.In a briefing for the semiconductor press, he talked about how, like a foggy road with 100-yard visibility, there was always 10 years of visibility opening up ahead on how Moore’s Law and miniaturisation could be extended.Chip circuit widths were currently moving from 65 to 45 billionths of a metre and there was a clear path to 32, 22, 14-15 and even below 10 nanometres, he said. “Beyond that, we’re not sure yet.”The size of the circular wafers that chips are cut from will actually grow from 300mm in diameter to 450mm between 2010 to 2015, in order to provide greater economies in manufacturing, giving savings of up to 40 per cent.But the cost of the retooling will force consolidation and reduce the number of chip manufacturers to less than 10, he predicted.“We used to have 100s of companies that built fabs, today we have tens of companies and, as we make this move, you will see single-digits of [manufacturers].”There had been only three successful business models – large-scale production of a commoditised memory product as typified by Samsung, the foundry model of companies such as Taiwan’s TSMC and the vertically integrated model of Intel, he said.It is no coincidence that those three companies announced in May that they were collaborating on leading the industry transition to 450mm wafers.Mr Gelsinger said Intel spent more than $7bn on plant and equipment when it switched from 200mm to larger 300mm wafers in 2001 and it would cost more to go to 450mm.Everybody investing less than $1bn a year in new fabs was falling off the rate needed to maintain the pace of Moore’s Law in shrinking transistors and growing wafer sizes, he said, hinting that Intel’s biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, would not be able to make the step up to 450mm.AMD said in April it planned $900m in capital expenditure this year.Silicon, the material that the semiconductor industry has built its success on, will be used more as scaffolding in the future, Mr Gelsinger said.Only six elements of the periodic table were used when Intel made its first chips in the 60s, but Mr Gelsinger said more than half the periodic table ( of 117 elements) was now being used and this number would grow.Germanium was being used to bend silicon and high-k metal gates using hafnium had been developed, with carbon nanotubes a possible material for the future.But silicon would still remain, he said.“This will all evolve on top of that silicon scaffolding and that will continue for as far as we can see into the future.”
296;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-26T21:54:51Z;Nasa simulates the stars with 128-screen hyperwall;;I like the extra desktop space of having two monitors on my desk, but I am suffering screen-envy at what Nasa scientists can now feast their eyes on at Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.The 128-screen hyperwall-2, unveiled on Wednesday, is capable of rendering 250m-pixel graphics and is “the world’s highest resolution scientific visualisation and data exploration environment.”The liquid crystal display wall is 23 feet wide and 10 feet tall. It allows high-resolution examination of simulations such as global weather and black-hole collisions.The set up is 100 times more powerful than the first version of the hyperwall installed in 2002, with 49 screens. Nasa says it has “128 graphics processing units and 1,024 processor cores, with 74 teraflops (one teraflop equals one trillion floating point operations per second) of peak processing power and a data storage capacity of 475 terabytes (one terabyte equals one trillion bytes).”That equates to the graphics power of 600 video game consoles.Presumably, Advanced Micro Devices had a hand in this as a partner of Colfax International, the installer. I find this much more impressive than its Cinema 2.0 demonstration last week, where AMD dubiously claimed a new milestone in cinema with its latest graphics cards.The Nasa hyperwall seems a supernova in comparison.
297;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-25T20:47:02Z;Strong gains for S&P as Fed holds rates;;US stocks rose the most in two weeks on Wednesday, as a rally in financials and falling oil prices cheered investors while the Federal Reserve did nothing to spook markets, keeping interest rates on hold in a widely expected decision.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,321.97 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat at 11,811.83. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.4 per cent to 2,401.26.The day began on a strong note. Darden Restaurants, the operator behind the Olive Garden restaurant chain, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and also increased its dividend 11 per cent.Those results and a $2 drop in oil prices helped consumer discretionary stocks advance 1.5 per cent. Darden rose 7.1 per cent to $33.83 while Macy’s and Family Dollar Storesadded 3.4 per cent to $20.06 and 3.9 per cent to $19.90 respectively.Meanwhile, Dean Foods, the dairy processor, said second-quarter earnings would be higher than forecast thanks to the strength in its milk business. Dean Foods rose 9.4 per cent to $20.12, helping the consumer staples sector to a 1.2 per cent gain.Still, analysts warned that shares in consumer-facing companies were likely to struggle as the second-quarter earnings season gets under way.Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Citigroup, said: “We believe there could be another round of downward earnings per share revisions in the near-term, as Street consensus does not appear to fully reflect an appropriate outlook on consumer spending amid current macro headwinds.”Equity markets held onto their gains after the Fed kept a key interest rate on hold at 2 per cent and noted increasing risks of inflation.Matt King, chief investment strategist for Bell Investment Advisors, said: “The market didn’t have much of a reaction as it was all pretty much as expected…The Fed has been preparing the market for interest rate hikes but I will believe it when I see it.”On Tuesday, stocks fell after a report showed slumping consumer confidence and a profit warning from industrial bellwether UPS. Financials had rallied despite that data and they continued to gain on Wednesday, rising as much as 3.4 per cent as investors bought back into heavily sold regional banking stocks before falling back to close up 0.4 per cent.Zions Bancorp was among the biggest gainers, adding 5.3 per cent to $32.64 after the Salt Lake City-based lender said it would not cut its dividend or raise dilutive capital. The bank added that credit quality for loans in California had “begun to stabilise”.Mastercard also made ground after it agreed to pay up to $1.8bn to settle claims that it blocked banks from issuing American Express cards. Mastercard added 3.4 per cent to $289.79 but American Express fell 2.8 per cent to $40.94 after commenting that credit indicators were deteriorating faster than expected.The technology sector received a boost from analyst upgrades and the pull-back in oil. Overnight, forecasts from Jabil Circuit topped estimates and the outlook prompted analysts at Merrill Lynch to advise buying shares in the mobile phone maker.Jabil Circuit led the gainers, jumping 15.6 per cent to $16.57 and it was followed higher by Advanced Micro Devices and Symantec which added 3 per cent to $6.43 and 2.6 per cent to $19.98 respectively.In other earnings news, Monsanto beat estimates as farmers spent more on fertiliser to take advantage of record prices for agricultural commodities. Monsanto also raised its full-year earnings guidance, but the shares, which have doubled in the past year, fell 3 per cent to $131.52.In the background, housing data showing that sales of new homes fell 2.5 per cent in May were largely offset by news that Congress was on the verge of approving legislation to overhaul mortgage financing and potentially rescue hundreds of thousands of homeowners from foreclosure. Homebuilders rose 0.2 per cent.By the close, eight of the 10 major industry groups on the S&P 500 were in the black. Only energy and industrial stocks were down, falling 0.5 per cent each after oil lost ground and Goldman Sachs recommended selling shares in Boeing arguing that a slowing economy would dent orders.Boeing slumped 6.9 per cent to $69.64 dragging aerospace stocks down 3.1 per cent.

299;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-16T19:30:48Z;Vision different from reality in new graphics cards;;AMD and Nvidia unveiled next-generation graphics chips today, with both claiming their uses would reach well beyond the traditional gaming audience.AMD aimed high and fell short with its Cinema 2.0 event. It claimed its technology was responsible for a defining moment in graphics when films would extend seamlessly into interactive gaming experiences and games and their characters would achieve true photo-realism.Video of movie industry figures including Robert Rodriguez, director of Sin City, talking about Cinema 2.0 was shown, along with the filmed opinions of gamers and top developers about when photorealism would make characters in games lose their “uncanny valley” appearance.The estimates ranged from three to 10 years, but presenters at the Cinema 2.0 event said it was only months away with the new technology. However, a demo supposedly updating the AMD demonstration model Ruby to photorealism fell flat when she appeared in an earlier unlifelike incarnation superimposed on a photorealistic street scene.“We’re still in the process of updating her,” was the rather lame explanation.I was more impressed when a presenter delivered “a teraflop for 200 bucks” line – the price the basic ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics card will go on sale for in about a week’s time.This is more likely to appeal to the mass-market consumer – a trillion floating operations per second made possible by a chip around a centimeter square. Twelve years ago, a whole roomful of computers fitted with 10,000 Intel Pentium Pro processors were needed to create the world’s first teraflop supercomputer.Nvidia announced its graphics had evolved “beyond gaming” but more sensibly talked about how this level of computing power would simplify day-to-day tasks, like running Windows Vista or converting movies to show on an iPod. Instead of taking five hours, movies could be transcoded in 35 minutes, it said.Its new GeForce GTX 260 and 280 cards are priced at $399 and $649.Both companies also see scientific and industrial applications for the increased parallel processing powers of their graphics processing units (GPUs).In games, it seems certain that these newer chips will allow PCs to regain a graphics edge over the fixed-specification next-generation consoles, but proclaiming them as an advance equivalent to the introduction of sound in movies is a little far-fetched.
300;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-11T20:40:57Z;Wall St falls led by financials;;Wall Street fell sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under heavy selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semi­conductors.In the background, oil prices jumped more than $5 a barrel, taking the momentum out of Tuesday’s shallow rally in consumer-facing shares. The consumer discretionary sector fell 2.2 per cent while the homebuilder sub-sector fell 8 per cent to within touching distance of a seven-year low.The leading fallers, however, were financial stocks, which dropped 3.3 per cent, giving up recent fragile gains and suggesting that the sector has yet to find a solid bottom amid a steady trickle of bad news.Technology stocks followed close behind, slipping 2.4 per cent after the Semiconductor Industry Association said sales will grow less rapidly than expected this year as competition drives down prices, particularly for memory chips.Nine of the 10 leading industry sectors were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 index down 1.7 per cent to 1,335.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7 per cent to 12,083.69. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2 per cent to 2,394.01.The tone on Wall Street has perceptibly darkened over the past few weeks as investors cope with bad news from financials and look ahead to rising inflation, weak consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed earnings.While the S&P 500 posted monthly gains of 1.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent in April and May, so far in June the benchmark index is down 4.6 per cent.Scott Armiger, a vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “We were thinking that you would see some signs of expansion in the second half, and now it seems that it is going to be a long, hot summer and perhaps we won’t start to recover until next year.”Financials reprised their role as the villains of the piece on Wednesday and have fallen in all but two sessions in June. The sector is down 23.8 per cent this year.Washington Mutual, First Horizon and Huntington Bancshares fell 9.3 per cent to $6.06, 6 per cent to $8.27 and 6.5 per cent to $6.92 respectively. The banks have some of the highest exposures to home equity loans, which some analysts see as the next front in the ongoing credit crisis.Investment banks also took a beating as Lehman Brothers fell a 13.6 per cent to $23.75, dragging the sector down 5.3 per cent. It was followed by Merrill Lynch, down 6.6 per cent to $35.46. Matthew Albrecht, an equity analyst with S&P, said: “Preliminary results from Lehman Brothers should remind investors that this group is not out of the woods regarding mortgage and bridge loan exposure, and risk governance remains in focus.”Industrials came under pressure after UBS rated Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railway company, a “short-term sell”, suggesting rising fuel prices may impact second-quarter earnings. Burlington dropped 7 per cent to $103.77, dragging down peers Union Pacific and CSX, which slipped 5.7 per cent to $74.10 and 4 per cent to $63.60 respectively. CSX is in the middle of a messy proxy battle with British hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund.Energy stocks were the sole gainers amid the broader malaise, following oil prices higher. ExxonÂ­Mobil rose 0.8 per cent to $88.61 and ConocoPhillips added 1.3 per cent to $94.08.Materials stocks fell in spite of some positive momentum for gold focused shares. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, for example, rose 0.6 per cent to $120.09.Gains for the broader sector were swamped, however, after JPMorgan downgraded Alcoa from “overweight” to “neutral”, suggesting that the aluminium producer would likely not be a take­over target. Alcoa dropped 8 per cent to $39.32.In technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel were among the leading fallers, losing 6.3 per cent to $6.96 and 3.8 per cent to $21.81 respectively.Amerigroup, the managed healthcare provider, fell 14.1 per cent to $23.36. It suspended its annual profit forecast as higher-than-expected claims forced it to renegotiate rates with the state of Tennessee.Meanwhile, Staples succeeded in its efforts to buy Corporate Express, a Dutch peer, with a revised $2.7bn offer. Staples shares rose 5.3 per cent to $24.38.
301;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-06T21:47:52Z;US regulator launches antitrust probe of Intel;;Intel’s business practices are coming under intense scrutiny as US regulators adopt a more aggressive stance towards the world’s biggest chip maker.The US Federal Trade Commission launched a formal antitrust investigation on Friday, following a similar move by the New York attorney general in January and a pending 2005 civil case brought by Intel’s rival, Advanced Micro Devices in a Delaware court.The European Commission announced antitrust charges last July and the Fair Trade Commissions in Korea and Japan have already censured Intel.David Balto, a former FTC policy director, said the commission’s entry would have the effect of ”a neutron bomb”.”The FTC can compel Intel to turn over documents in a much more timely fashion and the FTC’s process will move much more quickly than private litigation,” he said.He added that William Kovacic, who took over as FTC chairman in March, was bent on an ”activist enforcement agenda” where consumers faced harm.An FTC spokesman on Friday declined to give details of the investigation, but it is expected to follow the lines of inquiries abroad and the antitrust investigation launched by Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general.He said he was investigating whether Intel had violated state and federal antitrust laws by coercing customers to exclude its rival, Advanced Micro Devices, from the worldwide market for the dominant ”x86” family of microprocessors used in computers. Intel’s processors are in four out of every five of the world’s PCs.Intel said on Friday it had been working closely with the FTC since 2006 in providing it with ”a considerable amount of information and thousands of documents.In an FT interview, Bruce Sewell, general counsel, described a formal subpoena it received on Wednesday as a ”natural extension” allowing broader access to documents from third parties.Intel added in a statement that it believed its business practices were well within US law.”The evidence that this industry is fiercely competitive and working is compelling. For example, prices for microprocessors declined by 42.4 per cent from 2000 to end of 2007,” it said.On Thursday, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission fined Intel Won26bn ($25.4m) for abusing its dominant market position in the country and offering discounts to two Korean PC makers in an attempt to drive rival AMD out of the market.Tom McCoy, AMD executive vice president, commented on Friday: ”Intel must now answer to the Federal Trade Commission, which is the appropriate way to determine the impact of Intel practices on US consumers and technology businesses.”In every country around the world where Intel’s business practices have been investigated, including the decision by South Korea this week, antitrust regulators have taken action.”Intel shares closed 4.1 per cent lower, compared to a 2.9 per cent fall in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index.
302;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-05T16:12:52Z;Intel fined in S Korea for antitrust breach;;South Korea’s antitrust watchdog fined Intel, the world’s largest maker of semiconductors, Won26bn ($25m) for abusing its dominant market position in the country and offering discounts to two Korean PC makers in a bid to drive rival Advanced Micro Devices out of the market.Thursday’s ruling by Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, which followed a three-year investigation, is being closely watched by regulators conducting similar antitrust probes against Intel in the US and Europe.The Korean regulator said it found that the US chip giant offered a combined $370m to Samsung Electronics and Trigem Computer between 2001 and 2005 on condition that the local PC makers did not buy microprocessors from AMD.“We took appropriate steps based on facts,” Baek Yong-ho, chairman at the Korean Fair Trade Commission. “Intel stifled competition, using its dominant position.”The Korean regulator said AMD could not possibly win the price war with Intel, even if its central processing unit chips were offered free, given the scale of Intel’s rebates. It added that limited competition forced Korean consumers to buy PCs at higher prices.Intel had a market share of more than 90 per cent in the country in 2001-2005, higher than its global share of 80 per cent, the regulator said.Intel said it was “disappointed” with the regulator’s ruling and could appeal.“We feel the commission has overlooked or ignored key evidence that demonstrates Intel's business practices have been lawful and pro-competitive,” it said. ”Once we've reviewed the findings in detail, it is possible that Intel will request a further review and, if necessary, an appeal which will permit a court to review the case independently.”AMD said: “The KFTC’s decision . . . continues a stark pattern: in every country around the world where Intel’s business practices have been investigated, antitrust regulators have taken action against Intel to protect consumers and the computer companies who serve them.”New York’s attorney-general launched an antitrust probe into Intel’s activities in January following similar inquiries in the European Union and Japan. The European Commission alleged in July that Intel had offered chips below cost price and given substantial rebates to PC makers to encourage them to buy its chips.Japan’s competition watchdog issued a cease-and-desist order against Intel in 2005 for violating antitrust laws as Intel offered discounts to five Japanese PC makers.Thursday’s ruling against Intel underlines the South Korean regulator’s closer scrutiny of global technology companies.The Korean Fair Trade Commission has previously fined Microsoft Won33bn for abusing its dominant market position and ordered the US company to unbundled its operating system. It is now looking into the business practices of Qualcomm to see if the US wireless chipmaker abused its market dominance to charge excessive royalties.Mr Baek said: “Whether it is a multinational company or a Korean company, we will sternly punish them for unfair practices. We want to create a market environment to foster competition so that consumers can get the benefits.”
303;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-06-04T20:48:06Z;Wall St falls after Bernanke’s inflation remarks;;US stock markets fell slightly for a third straight session on Wednesday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that inflation was higher than the central bank would like, while a ratings review for one of the troubled bond insurers snuffed out an early rally in financials.Stocks began the day in positive mood after reports showed that private sector employers added staff unexpectedly last month while the services sector also continued to expand.The ADP National Employment Report showed a surprise gain of 40,000 jobs in May, suggesting that the employment outlook while poor, is not deteriorating. Analysts had expected a decline of 60,000.The latest Institute for Supply Management report on the US service industry kept broader equity indices moving forward. The ISM non-manufacturing index showed faster expansion than had been forecast, boosting service sector stocks.But by mid-afternoon a rally in the financial sector had petered out however, after Moody’s placed Ambac, the embattled bond insurer, on review for possible downgrade.The S&P 500 banking index, gave up gains of as much as 1.1 per cent to close down 0.8 per cent.A speech by Ben Bernanke in Harvard, swung the broader markets into losses near the close, raising the spectre of higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates going forward.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up gains of as much as 0.8 per cent to close roughly flat at 1,377.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also swung from gains to losses, ending the day down 0.1 per cent at 12,389.99. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,503.14.On Tuesday, the travails of Lehman Brothers dragged down the banking sector and broader equity indices. A drop in oil prices also weighed on energy stocks.Financials have been the laggards by a wide margin for much of the year and the trend continued in the early part of the week, after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the credit ratings of a number of major institutions.Still, American Express helped lift the mood, if only briefly, saying it expects full-year profit to increase in spite of mounting credit losses. The credit card company rose 3 per cent to $45.64.Lehman climbed, for the first time in four days, adding 2.6 per cent to $31.40. An upgrade for Morgan Stanley from Wachovia helped the brokerage gain 1.7 per cent to $43.36.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill, which owns S&P, also made ground after reports that the credit rating agencies were near to a deal to end an investigation by the New York Attorney General into their role in the subprime crisis.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill rose 3.1 per cent to $39.63 and 6.5 per cent to $43.88 respectively.Ambac however, slumped 17 per cent to $2.49, while MBIA fell 15.8 per cent to $5.63, knocking sentiment and stock prices in the financial sector.Nonetheless, a further decline in oil prices offered some respite for consumer-related stocks hit hard by fears that record energy prices will curb household spending. Consumer staple and discretionary stocks rose 0.5 per cent each.Whole Foods Market was among the leading gainers in the consumer staples sector, rising 4.4 per cent to $29.34 after an analyst at FTN Midwest Securities recommended buying the stock.In the discretionary sector, Guess rallied 13.8 per cent to $43.11. The jeans retailer reported estimate-beating first-quarter profits and raised its full year earnings forecasts.Starbucks and Hasbro also made gains, advancing 2.1 per cent to $18.12 and 4.7 per cent to $38.80 respectively. Walt Disney rose 3.5 per cent to $34.35 on speculation that its ABC network will receive higher advertising rates than expected.Conversely, falling commodity prices weighed on energy and material stocks for a second day. The sectors lost 1.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.Sunoco slumped 9.1 per cent to $44.22 while Titanium Metals fell 4 per cent to $16.12.Technology was the only sector to find any significant positive momentum, driven by the ISM data.AMD rose 5.6 per cent to $7.19, Ebay gained 2.1 per cent to $29.89 and the sector as whole rose 1 per cent.
304;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-05-08T17:36:22Z;AMD turns away from Intel fight;;Advanced Micro Devices’s annual meeting today was a surprisingly placid affair, considering its share price has nearly halved in value over the past year.Existing directors were re-elected without a murmur and there was only one question from the floor: a stockholder asking if AMD would consider sponsoring golf tournaments.Hector Ruiz, chief executive, is under more pressure from analysts, questioning whether AMD can continue in its present form and whether it can return to profitability this year after six consecutive quarters of losses.The stock is up 13 per cent in the past week on analyst speculation that AMD could be split into two – a manufacturing business and a chip design and development one.Mr Ruiz said progress was being made towards an “an asset-smart strategy” and he would give an update on this “complex undertaking…in the very near future.”He said AMD would spend only $900m in capital expenditure in 2008, it was cutting its workforce by 10 per cent and this reduction in expenses would bring down the break-even point by hundreds of millions of dollars, making him confident of a return to profitability in the second half.AMD would do fewer things better, he said, and get out of non-core businesses that did not have “a clear path to profitability.”Production problems with its quad-core “Barcelona” family of processors were now behind it, he added, and AMD was on course to begin quad-core production on chips with more economic 45-nanometre circuit widths in the second half – about a year behind Intel.His most intriguing comment on the battle with Intel was: “We are re-architecting the business so that our financial success is not invariably dependent on continued component performance leadership over a rich and dominant competitor.”That is as close as AMD is likely to come to admitting defeat, having gone toe-to-toe in recent years with Intel, exchanging processor-advance punches.Intel now appears to have a decisive lead in the x86 processor market that the two dominate. Mr Ruiz is suggesting his company will focus on expanding in other areas such as graphics chips or targeting specific segments such as processors for small businesses, in order to grow its own business in the future.
305;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-05-06T20:45:16Z;Wall St rebound led by energy stocks;;Wall Street stock markets bounced back from early losses on Tuesday to hit their highest levels since the start of the year as record oil prices boosted energy companies and investors focused on the positive in a mixed batch of results from the financial sector.With oil climbing to $122 a barrel on Tuesday and analysts predicting that the $200 barrier could be breached within the next 6 to 24 months, shares in energy companies powered ahead. An index of the sector climbed 2.2 per cent.But it was the volatile fortunes of financials that drove markets. Dismal results from Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored enterprise, initially weighed on stocks, only for investors to find a silver lining amid the bad news as the day progressed.The benchmark S&P 500 recovered from early losses and closed 0.8 per cent higher at 1,418.40, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.4 per cent at 13,024.01. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 2,483.31.The day began in downbeat fashion with news of yet more writedowns and job cuts at UBS, the Swiss bank that has been battered by the subprime crisis.Meanwhile, Legg Mason, the fund manager, posted its first loss in 25 years and said it planned to raise $1bn by selling 20 million equity units. Its shares slid 10.3 per cent to $56.30.However, the S&P 500 financials index swung into the black after positive comments by executives of Fannie Mae helped cushion news of $2.2bn first-quarter loss at the largest buyer of mortgages in the US.Shares in Fannie Mae, and its peer Freddie Mac, overturned losses of as much as 6 per cent after the company’s regulator said it would reduce Fannie Mae’s capital requirements. The move should allow Fannie to buy more mortgages.Fannie closed 8.9 per cent higher at $30.81 while Freddie was up 7.1 per cent at $27.33.NYSE Euronext, the stock exchange operator, also made ground, adding 7.2 per cent to $72.95 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled on record volumes of trading. An index of financial stocks added 1 per cent.In energy, ConocoPhillips rose 1.8 per cent to $88.74 while Chevron added 1.3 per cent to $96.87.Oil and gas exploration and production company Anadarko Petroleum made the biggest gain in the sector, climbing 9.4 per cent to $74.53 after reporting estimate-beating earnings.Technology stocks also buoyed markets, led by AMD which climbed for a second session, adding 9 per cent to $7.12 on speculation that the chip maker could break itself up.Nonetheless, results from DR Horton underscored the scale of the problems facing the housing sector and the wider US economy. The largest US home builder lost $1.3bn in the second quarter after it wrote down the value of its land holdings and backlog of unsold homes.DR Horton shares fell as much as 3.8 per cent before recovering, popping 5.5 per cent to $16.85.In other earnings news, Qwest Communications, a local phone service provider, said first-quarter profit slid as customers abandoned their home lines. Qwest shares, which have lost 47 per cent of their value in the last year, fell 6 per cent, to $5.04.Also among the day’s leading fallers was food products manufacturer Sara Lee, which dropped 6.1 per cent to $13.86 in spite of posting an 82 per cent increase in third-quarter profits.The company, which makes Sara Lee cakes and Jimmy Dean sausages, fell short of expectations and said full-year 2008 earnings and revenues would also undershoot Wall Street’s estimates.Those earnings misses came as a raft of new evidence suggested the housing crisis and credit crunch were spilling over to the real economy.US business bankruptcy filings in April increased 49 per cent compared with a year earlier, as the slowing economy forced more companies to shut down.Moreover, according to the Federal Reserve, banks are tightening lending standards, making it more difficult for consumers and businesses alike to borrow.Tobias Levkovich, chief US strategist at Citigroup, said: “Given the tougher credit environment..it would seem very realistic to assume that more cyclical earnings estimates [will] face substantive downward guidance with equity market implications.”
306;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-05-01T20:45:37Z;Wall St rises as tech stocks rally;;Wall Street stocks powered ahead on Thursday driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average, above 13,000 for the first time since early January after a rally in financial and technology stocks offset an earnings disappointment from ExxonMobil and a sagging energy sector.Analysts said that the vices of commodities rather than the virtues of the banking and technology sectors were behind the unlikely surge.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “It seems that money is rotating from the previous leaders – commodity stocks, gold, agricultural stocks – into the laggards.”“ExxonMobil’s ‘poor’ earnings hurt oil stocks, and oil prices have also come off highs, so money moved out of the sector into financials and tech stocks.”An index of financial stocks added 3.9, its best one-day gain in a month, taking the sector to its highest level since February.The energy sector suffered however retreating 2.2 per cent as the dollar rallied and commodities prices slipped.A broad upswing carried eight out of 10 key sectors into positive territory and lifted the S&P 500 1.7 per cent to 1,409.33, its biggest gain in almost two weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 13,010, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8 per cent to 2,465.76.On Wednesday the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate but an equivocal accompanying statement knocked equity markets.On Thursday began in similarly downbeat fashion after Exxon and weak employment data showing soaring first-time benefit claims initially weighed on the market. Still, an Institute for Supply Management index showing that manufacturing activity was weak but steady in April, helped calm nerves.Merrill Lynch was one of the leading beneficiaries from the volte face, jumping 5.1 per cent to $52.39 after the head of a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund said it may increase its holding in the investment bank.Comments overnight by Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, who said that the credit crisis was closer to the end than the beginning, supported the rally. Lehman Brothers rose 6.1 per cent to $46.93, Citigroup added 4.2 per cent to $25.99 and Bank of America gained 4.9 per cent to $39.39.CIT Group jumped 10.1 per cent to $11.99 on speculation that the independent finance company, which has been badly hit by credit market turmoil, would be sold.MBIA jumped 12.9 per cent to $11.74 after Jay Brown, its chief executive, told shareholders that the the embattled bond insurer, has enough capital to retain its triple A rating.Technology stocks were particularly strong last month after a number of industry heavyweights reported better-than-expected results and that trend continued on Thursday.The sector rose 3.2 per cent, thanks in part to Symantec. The maker of security software jumped 12.3 per cent to $19.34 after it said fourth-quarter profit tripled. Semiconductor companies also contributed to the rally after new data showed chip sales rose in March and a handful of decent earnings reports boosted sentiment. Intel rose 4.6 per cent to $23.29 while AMD added 4.4 per cent to $6.22.ExxonMobil took some of the shine of equity markets after it reported massive profits but undershot expectations super-charged by record high oil prices. Shares in the energy group fell 3.6 per cent to $89.70, while Chevron slipped 1.3 per cent to $94.94.Materials stocks also performed poorly. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold slumped 5.1 per cent to $107.96 while Nucor fell 2.2 per cent to $73.82.Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer of Third Wave Global Investors, said: “We may be seeing the end of the commodity bull run. There has been a lot of speculative money, some of it from hedge funds, chasing up prices. When prices stop going up that money will go away and we could see a big reversal.”Energy’s discomfort proved a boon for consumer discretionary stocks, which rose 3.3 per cent – their best showing in a month.Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, was among the top performers, cheering investors with on-target first-quarter results. Comcast shares rose 8.6 per cent to $22.31.
307;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-04-28T15:37:22Z;Intel and AMD’s different classes of business;;Intel is taking the high road and its rival Advanced Micro Devices the low one in search of market share in different business segments, according to announcements on Monday.Intel unveiled a partnership with the Cray supercomputing company. In an industry first, their engineers will work together on creating a new supercomputer for release around 2012.They aim to reduce dramatically processing times for intensive applications such as medical imaging, cell modelling in genome research and hurricane forecasting. The high-performance computing market was worth $11.5bn last year, according to the IDC research firm.Kirk Skaugen (pictured left), head of Intel’s Server Platforms group, and Peter Ungaro (right), Cray chief executive, told me that synergies between the two companies’ research teams would help them solve problems where components interconnected. This was key to keeping processors fed with data and operating at maximum performance.They would also work on how to take advantage of what is expected to be a grouping of as many as 1m processing cores in a single supercomputing system.The two companies say they will work with academic institutions and government bodies to test their products.Meanwhile, AMD introduced its AMD Business Class, aimed at small and medium-sized businesses. This is a new platform of chips designed to help PC makers target this segment with products. Both dual, triple and quad-core processors are featured combined with AMD and non-AMD graphics and chipsets.Acer, Dell, Fujitsu Siemens and Lenovo all announced their support for the initiative.
308;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-04-17T23:05:58Z;AMD registers another net loss;;Stale product lines and a tough consumer market contributed to a weak first quarter performance at Advanced Micro Devices, the struggling microchip maker, which Thursday reported its sixth consecutive quarterly loss.The results came as AMD tried to reassure investors that it was on track to deliver on a recovery plan put into place after a disastrous 2007, in which bruising competition with Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, led to big losses in market share.Robert Rivet, AMD’s chief financial officer, said the company remained “committed to achieve operational profitability in the second half of the year” as its turnround effort gains steam and customers are drawn to new and improved technologies.AMD said its seasonally weak first quarter had been further hampered by “a challenging economic environment for consumers”. It said that lower-than-expected revenues from some older products had contributed to lower-than-expected sales across all business segments.The comments came as the struggling chipmaker reported net loss of $305m in the first quarter – or 59 cents a share – on sales of $1.5bn.The performance was an improvement over the $611m the company lost in the first quarter of 2007 and matched most analysts’ already dim expectations.AMD’s report of a net loss came just days after Intel and IBM, two of the technology industry’s biggest bellwethers, reassured investors by with better-than-expected results, as strong growth overseas helped offset economic weakness in the US.Shares of AMD bounced almost 2 per cent in after-hours trading as the company told investors its turnround plan was on track and gave an outlook for the current quarter that was not as bad as some had feared.AMD cautioned that its second-quarter revenues were set to fall but said that they would decline in line with “seasonal trends”.The AMD results came less than a month after the company warned of a sales shortfall and announced that it would cut 10 per cent of its workforce to reduce costs.Shares in the company had fallen more than 60 per cent since July last year. They rose 1.9 per cent after the closing bell Thursday to $6.19.
309;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-04-11T18:21:59Z;Investors’ nerves take toll in Europe;;A nervous week for Europe’s stock markets ended badly after US conglomerate General Electric revealed a sharp drop in profits, exacerbating investors’ fears that the impending earnings season will be bleak.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.4 per cent Friday to 1,284.71, its fourth successive decline and its worst one-day drop since mid-March.The index shed 2.6 per cent over the week.Patrik Schowitz, European equities strategist at HSBC, said investors were preoccupied with the impending first-quarter earnings season, which gathers pace in the US next week when major banks report results.“If the earnings are okay, then the market is very attractively valued,” he said.“But it’s hard to know how earnings will pan out, especially with financials, which is where everyone’s looking.”European banks and insurers had another choppy week but slammed into negative territory after GE said the primary reason for results missing expectations was its financial services businesses.Commerzbank fell 6.9 per cent to €20.54, Allied Irish Banks shed 5.6 per cent to €13.17 and Credit Suisse lost 3.9 per cent to SFr54.10.Several other US bellwethers reported disappointing results this week and their impact rippled quickly across the Atlantic.Postal companies Deutsche Post and TNT fell after UPS, their US competitor, cut its quarterly earnings outlook, citing worsening economic conditions and high fuel costs.Deutsche Post lost 1.5 per cent to €20.05 while Dutch group TNT shed 2.9 per cent to €24.13.Europe’s tech stocks fell foul of the same phenomenon after a set of grim results from Advanced Micro Devices in the US.Infineon fell 5.6 per cent to €4.73, also hampered by a downgrade from Credit Suisse.STMicroelectronics fell 6.5 per cent to €6.82. The chipmaker said on Thursday it would merge its wireless chip business with its Dutch rival NXP, “creating scale in a market with too many players”. But rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch put STM on watch for possible downgrade afterthe company said it would pay NXP $1.55bn to own 80 per cent of the new venture.Oil stocks surged in mid-week after the price of crude oil spiked above $112 dollars a barrel. In spite of it tailing off Friday afternoon, Galp Energia added 2.1 per cent to €15.56 and Statoil Hydro gained 4.6 per cent to NKr164.60.Investors have begun to see the stocks as a temporary haven ahead of the earnings season, analysts said, because their earnings are expected to grow 25 per cent.The energy sector enjoyed a week in the spotlight as Europe’s big energy companies stalked British Energy, sparking hopes of a bidding war.RWE, Centrica and EDF Energy were all looking at buying the company, with RWE proposing an offer of just under 700p a share.British Energy’s shares were the main beneficiary, while RWE was driven down 4.1 per cent to €77.90 and EDF ended the week 0.1 per cent lower at €60.50.The retail sector had a difficult week. Carrefour’s shares were hit after Jose Luis Duran, chief executive, said retailers were facing their “most significant challenge in a generation”.Carrefour shares fell 7.6 per cent to €45.87, although the company reiterated its target to grow sales by between 6 and 8 per cent.
310;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-04-08T20:42:02Z;Wall St falls as results season starts;;US stocks ended a three session winning streak on Tuesday, falling after Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season with a downbeat set of results and Washington Mutual said it had secured a $7bn capital infusion to shore up its capital base.The largest savings and loan company in the US sold shares, at a sizeable discount, to a group of investors including TPG, the private equity firm, and said it would use the proceeds to keep its capital ratios well above required levels.The company also said it expected to report far bigger first-quarter losses than had been expected, would dramatically increase its provisions for bad loans and slash its dividend and 3,000 jobs for good measure.Washington Mutual shares, which jumped almost 30 per cent on Monday on speculation about the deal, fell back sharply on the news. The shares dropped 10.2 per cent to $11.81.That, and a striking report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that financial losses from the US mortgage crisis could hit about $1,000bn, dragged financials lower.The S&P 500 Financials index fell 1.7 per cent, led by Citigroup, which fell 3.4 per cent to $23.76, and Federated Investors, which slid 6.9 per cent to $34.80, hit by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs analysts.The IMF report undercut nascent optimism about the downtrodden sector. Earlier in the day, analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded brokers and asset managers from “neutral” to “attractive”, arguing that mortgage writedowns might “significantly exceed” actual losses.Goldman reiterated its recommendation to “buy” Lehman Brothers shares and upgraded Franklin Resources, Bank of New York Mellon, MetLife, American Express, and Janus Capital.Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $43.67 while Bank of New York dropped 0.9 per cent to $42.98 and American Express slipped 0.2 per cent to $46.47.Still, investors found enough resilience to absorb the gloomy minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee which showed some officials were concerned about “a prolonged and severe economic downturn,” as they cut interest rates last month.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “The quite negative view of the economic outlook…seems likely, in our view, to trump inflation as a concern and bolsters our view of a 50 basis point rate cut at the end of the month.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,365.54 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,348.76.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3 per cent to 12,576.44.After the close on Monday, Alcoa reported declines in both sales and profits for the first quarter as the company was hit by slowing demand in its home market and rising energy and raw materials costs.The stock slipped a further 0.7 per cent to $37.18, adding to Monday’s 4 per cent decline.Industrial conglomerates also came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their profit estimates and target prices for the sector, arguing that orderswould fall as the economy weakened.Morgan Stanley analysts cut their 2009 profit forecasts for 16 companies, including General Electric, Emerson Electric and Honeywell, reduced their industry rating to “cautious” and encouraged investors to take profits ahead of potentially disappointing earnings towards the end of 2008.GE fell 0.8 per cent to $36.95 while Emerson dropped 2.4 per cent to $52.10 and Honeywell lost 1.6 per cent to $57.19.A sales warning overnight from AMD, the second largest microprocessor maker, also weighed on the market.The company said it would cut about 10 per cent of its workforce in response but AMD shares fell 4.9 per cent to $6.03.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel dropped 3.1 per cent to $21.08 while Novellus lost 8. per cent to $21.88.Homebuilders fell back after the latest data showed pending home sales fell more than expected in February.Lennar dropped 8.3 per cent to $20 and Pulte Homes lost 5.8 per cent to $14.94.Energy stocks helped cushion falls. Coal companies, Consol Energy and Peabody Energy climbed 4.9 per cent to $78.21 and 5.1 per cent to $59.92 respectively.

TomTom shares fell 13.8 per cent to €22.78 – their lowest level since 2005.Petercam analyst Eric de Graaf said that market leaders Garmin and TomTom had been able to gain market share in the satellite navigation market by dropping prices of handheld devices.“Previously there were sharp declines in component costs so prices could be reduced without significant effects on margins. That may no longer be the case, so you will see a lot of pain in the industry, “ he added.TomTom’s CEO reiterated that the company was committed to buying out digital mapmaker Tele Atlas, which dropped 2.3 per cent to €24.34.“Everything points to TomTom’s willingness to close the Tele Atlas deal at almost any price, but that still doesn’t mean that it will close and that is reflected in the Tele Atlas share price,” said de Graaf.Also in Amsterdam, chip maker ASML fell 6.3 per cent to €15.70 after Credit Suisse downgraded its price target from €23 to €20. The brokerage said ASML was the only quality name in the European semiconductor industry because it had no US dollar exposure.European technology stocks were dealt a blow by Advanced Micro Devices of the US, the second-largest maker of computer processors, which said it would cut 10 per cent of its workforce after first-quarter sales fell more sharply than expected.The news drove investors to cash in profits on chipmakers across the Atlantic. German peer Infineon dropped 6.7 per cent to €4.74 after Credit Suisse downgraded it to “neutral” from “outperform, while in France ST Microelectronics fell 1.8 per cent to €7.22.“The level of the US dollar versus the euro will impact operating margins significantly in 2008/9 for European companies within the sector, whose revenues are largely US dollars denominated with a cost base in euros,” said Adrien Bommelaer at Credit Suisse.“We expect this will lead to more earnings downgrades,” he added.Banking stocks put in a mixed performance with Swiss giant UBS extending its gains, edging up 0.7 per cent to SFr35.64. Rival Credit Suisse fell 0.4 per cent to SFr57.60 while Julius Baer retreated 1.5 per cent to SFr74.50.In Germany, Deutsche Postbank, fell 3.7 per cent to €58.69 after the chief executive of parent company Deutsche Post’s said he may put off the sale of the bank. Postbank has long been seen as a takeover target for rival German banks hoping for a slice of the lucrative German retail banking market.Across the border in France, BNP Paribas fell 0.8 per cent to €69.68 after management said worsening market volatility would make it difficult for the company to fulfil its promise matching last year’s investment banking revenues difficult.Fears that the credit crissis would continue to bite weigh on the sector, dealers said.France’s Natixis fell 2.2 per cent to €10.36 and Dexia slid 2.8 per cent to €18.25, while Anglo Irish Bank fell 3.9 per cent to €8.050

It had predicted a seasonal fall of 5 to 10 per cent during its fourth-quarter earnings call, but it said there had been lower than expected sales across all of its businesses.The company has about 16,500 employees, meaning some 1,650 jobs will be cut by the end of the third quarter. AMD said it expected to record a restructuring charge in the second quarter, but had not been able to finalise the details yet.AMD shares fell 5 per cent to $6 on the news in extended trading in New York. It shares have fallen 15 per cent so far this year and are down 50 per cent over the past 12 months as losses have mounted in the face of brutal competition with its rival Intel.AMD has reported five consecutive quarterly losses but has said it plans a return to profitability in the second half, powered by the release of new microprocessors and graphics chips.The Silicon Valley company has recently introduced a range of processor and graphics products.However, its comments that sales have been lower than expected across all product ranges suggests either the products have not matched those of rivals on price or performance or that AMD is beginning to suffer from a larger economic downturn.The Semiconductor Industry Association reported last week that global semiconductor sales fell seasonally in February, down 5 per cent compared with the previous month.AMD will report its first-quarter earnings on April 17.
314;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-04-06T18:18:01Z;Techs buck the trend on debt;;With the US economy turning down and some corners of the debt markets in turmoil, financial leverage has been going out of fashion fast. But that has done little to slow a sea-change in the balance sheets of some of the technology industry’s leading lights.Last week, Dell said it would become the latest to relax its traditionally conservative financial structure. Don Carty, the computer-maker’s chief financial officer, said: “We do expect to access capital markets to increase our leverage.”On the same day Oracle tapped bond markets for $5bn, the biggest debt offering by a tech company in 18 months, to finance its purchase of BEA Systems.Meanwhile, bond investors are preparing for the debut of the industry’s biggest cash machine: Microsoft. The software company has said it will turn to the market for the first time if it pulls off its cash-and-stocks offer for Yahoo, worth $42bn.The willingness of tech companies to contemplate greater leverage reflects a historic shift in capital structure, whatever the shorter-term cycles in the economy or the financial markets. Some companies that once believed they needed big financial cushions have become willing to increase financial risk to increase shareholder returns or make acquisitions.Brent Thill, software analyst at Citigroup, said the annual maintenance fees charged by mature software companies amounted to a “really reliable, high-margin part of the business that generates a lot of cash to support higher debt”.You’re seeing an increasing trend [for using debt],” he said.The willingness to contemplate big debt-financed acquisitions is a sign of the change in outlook.A borrowing binge by chip companies pushed debt-raising by tech companies to a previous peak in 2006, before a cyclical downturn.Not all these moves paid off. AMD’s assumption of debt to buy graphic chipmaker ATI in 2006 weakened the semiconductor company as it came under a new competitive assault from Intel. It eventually turned to sovereign investor Abu Dhabi to rebuild its finances.But this year the tech industry’s borrowing is back on track to hit new records.Additional reporting by Kevin Allison
315;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-04-02T01:23:03Z;What’s new: Oracle executes enterprise move for mobiles;;"A trio of announcements comes from Oracle, designed to make it easier to deploy enterprise applications on mobile devices.
The software giant has validated Nokia’s Intellisync Device Management solution for Siebel CRM, which Oracle acquired in 2005, while the Siebel Wireless version of its flagship CRM product is now available for the Nokia E90 communicator.
Finally, Oracle has announced that Oracle Database Lite, its new client database for mobile devices, supports Symbian 9, the leading smartphone operating system.• Investment banks have more pressing concerns at present than optimising office space. But should the bull roar again, AMD of the US has a hardware solution that allows institutions to squeeze in more traders and workstations.
The ATI FireMV 2260 graphics card allows multiple large screens to be crammed into tight desk space, boosting “trader density” and reducing energy consumption.
AMD acquired ATI, a specialist in graphics cards, in 2006.• Dell claims to have edged ahead of arch-rival Hewlett-Packard in the server price/performance race with two new servers aimed at smaller businesses.
The US computer giant says its rack-mounted PowerEdge R300, based on the quad-core Intel Xeon x5460 chip, achieves up to 26 per cent better performance than a comparable system from HP, while the T300, which adopts the traditional tower format, has a claimed 31 per cent performance advantage over HP.
Prices are $1,249 and $999 respectively.• We have heard of mash-ups, but how about smash-ups? IBM has announced Smash, which is designed to overcome security concerns about using mash-ups (which for the uninitiated are web-based applications that draw data from various internet sources).
IBM’s secure mash-up technology allows different web-based sources to talk to each other, but keeps them separate, so malicious code cannot creep into enterprise systems. In true glasnost spirit, IBM is contributing Smash to the OpenAjax Alliance.• Business Objects, now owned by SAP, has announced Xcelsius Engage 2008, the latest version of its data presentation tool that can be used by anyone familiar with a spreadsheet, or so BO claims.
Improvements include a redesigned interface based on Adobe Flash technology and full integration with Microsoft Excel.• Zoho, the US software-as-a-service specialist, has unveiled Zoho People, a human resources application aimed at SMEs with more than 50 employees.
It is available as a beta release and comprises modules for organisation definition, recruitment, forms, checklists and employee self-service. It can be customised and link to other Zoho Saas offerings.• It took 20 years but HP has finally produced an inkjet printer that can cancel print jobs in mid-stream.
Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the Deskjet range, HP has unveiled the Deskjet D2500, which has a one-touch print cancel button to stop the printing of unwanted pages and so save ink.
In 20 years, the price of the Deskjet printer has tumbled from $995 to $49 for the new D2500.
The same cannot be said for the price of ink, which today is almost as expensive as the printers themselves."
316;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-03-27T23:01:57Z;AMD’s triple play;;The maths for guessing the future of computer processing power is no longer “Think of a number and then double it.”It should be getting easier in this multi-core world. We’ve gone from single brains to two brains and now quad-core microprocessors, so eight should be next, right?Actually, the answer is three.Advanced Micro Devices came out with the industry’s first triple-core chip today and it signals that cores are being viewed more flexibly than pure performance drivers. Instead, they are providing different price points and functionality for users.“We’ve really started a debate in the industry with this,” Pat Moorhead, vice president of AMD’s advanced platform marketing, told me.“Just like there’s a spot for $20,000, $30,000 and $40,000 cars, there’s room for two, three or four cores in the market. I see our competitor [Intel] now agrees – it’s announced a six-core server processor.”Mr Moorhead says there are plenty of PC makers ready to support triple-core. It’s an in-between solution – for basic capabilities go for dual-core, for top performance, it’s quad-core, for something perhaps 30 per cent better than dual-core, triple-core will fill an important niche, he says.The big shift is that Moore’s Law – the doubling of transistors on chips around every 18 months – is being de-emphasised by the two major processor makers in favour of “visual computing” – combining microprocessors with graphics processors to provide 3D interfaces and high-definition video.“It’s going to become all about video, you get this incredible high-definition playback at 1080p with triple-core combined with our graphics,” says the marketing man, hammering home the message.
317;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-03-18T23:52:41Z;Valley view: Vista case lifts curtain on ‘Wintel’;;"Examine any PC and the chances are that, four times out of five, it will feature a “designed for Windows” logo alongside an Intel one on its casing.Such is the dominance of the most popular operating system running on microprocessors that enjoy 80 per cent market share.However, one particular logo – Windows Vista Capable – has become a source of embarrassment for both Microsoft and Intel.Two consumers filed a suit complaining computers they bought could not fully run Microsoft’s latest operating system, despite their Vista Capable logo.A judge has granted the complaint class-action status and made public internal Microsoft e-mails about Vista. They give a rare insight into power struggles in the PC industry.Both Microsoft and Intel were in a predicament at the start of 2006.Microsoft was talking optimistically of making Vista broadly available that year, a deadline Bill Gates set in 2004. But it had already shorn it of some features to try to get the product out the door. By March, it had to announce retail sales would be put back till January 2007.Intel was having one of the worst years in its history. Revenues fell 9 per cent in 2006 after three years of double-digit growth. It had lost market share to rival AMD, launched a restructuring programme and slashed prices to clear out old inventory.Less than stellar performers in Intel’s product line were its graphics chipsets. It had become the leading supplier for PC graphics by integrating its chips on the motherboard along with its ubiquitous microprocessors.With Vista promising a revolution in the graphical user interface, with its glass-like “Aero” design and 3D features, more powerful graphics chips would be de rigueur to run it.However, Intel’s existing 915 chipset was clearly not up to this task, according to the Microsoft e-mails, and the company was having problems producing adequate supplies of its successor, the 945 chipset.“Intel has the biggest challenge,” wrote senior executive Steven Sinofsky in an e-mail.“Their 945 chipset, which is the baseline Vista set, ‘barely’ works right now and is very broadly used. The 915 chipset which is not Aero capable is in a huge number of laptops and was tagged as ‘Vista Capable’ but not Vista Premium. I don’t know if this was a good call.”The original plan for the Vista Capable programme, as put together in 2005, was for it to signify a full capability to run Vista. Eventually introduced in April 2006, the logo on new PCs was meant to maintain the sales momentum of Windows XP PCs while escalating the “buzz” for the forthcoming operating system.However, at some point between August 2005 and January 2006, Microsoft was persuaded to lower its standards for the logo so that graphics chips needed to be capable of running only the limited version of Vista known as Home Basic, which did not include the whizzy Aero interface.The e-mails suggest Intel put pressure on Microsoft to lower the standard. The move was to the detriment of companies such as Hewlett-Packard, which had planned their product lines so they would all meet the advanced standard.“In the end, we lowered the requirement [for Vista capability] to help Intel make their quarterly earnings so they could continue to sell motherboards with the 915 graphics embedded,” wrote John Kalkman, a general manager handling relations with PC makers.Intel has declined to comment on any specifics under its policy of not commenting on litigation in which it is not involved.But it has denied that Mr Kalkman could have known anything about its quarterly earnings forecasts.Microsoft, the defendant, says it believes “the facts will show that Microsoft offered different versions of Windows Vista … to meet the varied needs of our customers purchasing computers at different price points”.Comments from its executives in the e-mails, however, emphasise that there was a perception of having given in to Intel. “We are caving to Intel … we are really burning HP … we are allowing Intel to drive our consumer experience,” wrote one.Microsoft’s decision may have helped Intel, but it angered partners such as HP, caused concern among retailers such as Wal-Mart and confusion among consumers, who were not sure to what kind of Vista experience their Windows XP PCs could be upgraded.All of this ought to have been history by now. Vista has sold more than 100m licences in its first year; Intel has announced a major upgrade for its graphics chips, improving their performance by a factor of 10 by 2010.But the lawsuit is raising fresh questions about the “Wintel” relationship.Microsoft and Intel have individually suffered their fair share of regulatory scrutiny over whether they have abused their dominant market positions.Now, the Vista Capable e-mails are highlighting the effect of their close interaction and showing companies and consumers may have suffered."
318;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-02-12T20:37:56Z;EU regulators raid Intel offices;;Competition regulators on Tuesday raided the offices of Intel and top European electrical goods retailers, in a sign that the antitrust probe against the world’s largest chipmaker is expanding.European Commission officials visited Intel’s Munich offices, as well as Europe’s biggest electronic chain, Media Markt, its second biggest, DSG International, operator of PC World, and French retailer PPR.“The Commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated EC treaty rules on restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position,” the regulator said.It stressed that the raids did not pre-judge the outcome of the investigation.Intel, Media Markt, PPR and DSG all confirmed the visits and said they were co-operating with the investigation.The Commission’s move comes at an unusual stage in its long-running probe into Intel, which began nearly seven years ago after a complaint from the US company’s smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices.Having carried out raids in 2005, the Commission formally accused Intel six months ago of trying to do deals with computer makers to push AMD out of the central processing unit business.The latest raids appear to be focused primarily on Intel’s relationships with retailers, rather than computer makers, suggesting that the Commission may be enlarging the scope of its probe.Commission officials declined to comment on Tuesday. However, it is not unknown for the European antitrust regulator to file additional charges against suspected offenders as investigations proceed.In a short statement, Giuliano Meroni, AMD’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “This is an important expansion of the Commission’s investigation.”In its earlier complaint in July last year, the Commission accused Intel of offering rebates to manufacturers if they agreed to obtain most of their CPU chips from Intel, and inducing makers to delay or cancel the start-up of products using AMD chips.Intel submitted a confidential response to those charges and said it believed the microprocessor market was “functioning normally to the benefit of consumers”, but declined to elaborate on its reply.Intel and AMD make virtually all the chips at the processing heart of the world’s computers and servers, but Intel has the lion’s share of the business.
319;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
320;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-29T18:07:49Z;Perspectives: Will we be able to tell reality from artificial imagery?;;There is one cast-iron certainty in what is becoming a hazy technological future: the image – and the screen on which it is displayed – will increasingly become king.On television screens, on personal computers, on digital organisers, on games consoles, telephones and music players, computer generated images of startling realism – animated and in three dimensions – will increasingly become the norm.By comparison, today’s images – excellent though they can be – will appear as dated as the daguerreotypes of the 19th century.On the one hand, this is progress. A picture may be worth a thousand words – indeed it certainly is worth a thousand words when you are trying to work out how to insert a new ink cartridge into a printer.On the other hand, this level of photorealism will bring with it a slew of problems with which governments will be forced to deal.The rate of progress in rendering realistic three dimensional computer generated images over the past few years is remarkable.The technologies have found application both in feature films, such as the recent release, Bee Movie, and in advertising. “Naturally Juicy”, a “strangely saucy” (their words, not mine) advert for Orangina involving a bear and a deer in a forest is the latest creation by The Mill, a London-based post production house which has been making a habit of picking up awards.For one minute and 45 seconds of screen time, The Mill’s 30 animators took three months to bring a galaxy of characters including a flamingo pole-dancer, a bikini-clad rabbit and an octopus waitress to life.Tellingly, the greatest challenge the animators faced was rendering fur and feathers realistically. Ten years or so ago, it would not have been possible to create such life-like imagesThe pace has been forced, however, by a couple of critical developments. First, graphics processing units (GPUs) have become incomparably more powerful.GPUs are processor chips which work in conjunction with the central processor but are designed wholly to carry out the complex mathematics required, for example, accurately to convey the texture of skin, hair or moving water. The market for GPUs is currently dominated by Nvidia, which fabricates the GeForce graphics chip family, and by AMD which makes the ATI Radeon chip line.A second innovation, pioneered by Nvidia but quickly followed by AMD, was programmable pixel shading, which made it possible to process each individual picture element. This enables the animator to treat each pixel separately and to come closer to mimicking reality. A moving, bumpy, reflective surface can be rendered by pixel shaders in ways which would have been impossible using earlier technology.There have been other, startling, developments. Henrik Wann Jensen of the University of California at San Diego is an expert in developing images in which light interacts with other materials – the patterns of light and shade created as sunlight filters through a glass of brandy, for example.Now, he has built a mathematical model based on the absorption and reflection of light which can create the image of a material when given its constituents. And it works in reverse: given an image, the software will work out what it is made of.There are, nevertheless, a number of constraints on the development of three dimensional computer generated imagery, not the least of which is the limited number of skilled craftspeople capable of working with these advanced tools.The Mill and its London competitors, the US post production world and the GPU manufacturers are all in competition for these individuals. They are often freelance, travelling the world and selling their services when an interesting project presents itself.The fact that it took about 2,000 hours to produce two minutes of final product for the Orangina advert is another hurdle. The new tools seem to have vastly increased the quality of the final image but have not significantly reduced the time taken to create it.The upside, therefore, is computer-generated movies indistinguishable from conventionally shot films and computer games where there seems to be no line between real life and fantasy.The downside is whether we are ready for this degree of photorealism on the screens that will increasingly dominate our lives. A computer game today, however violent, is still clearly a game. The advent of shoot-’em-ups indistinguishable from real life could keep researchers working on the effects of computer games on social behaviour busy for years.Second Life and other metaverses are again, today, obviously crude imitations of the real thing. What would be the consequences of a Second Life that seemed as real as real life – or at least as real as the television images that we take for granted as representing reality.One senior figure in the games industry suggested to me in all seriousness that at some date in the future, news events would no longer be filmed live – they would be created wholly in the computer.The consequences for society are difficult to predict. But it may be necessary for governments at some stage, and using technologies as yet undiscovered, to limit the extent to which computer-generated images can be presented as reality on our many screens.
321;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-28T21:17:14Z;Graphics card makers to duel over dual chips;;Graphics chipmakers are fond of making a case these days that their graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming as important or more so than the central processing units (CPUs) of the PC microprocessor makers.As bigger displays in high-definition dazzle consumers, most of the horsepower that drives them comes from the GPU.Fourth-quarter numbers for the graphics market will begin to leak out after the market closes today. Ashok Kumar, CRT Capital analyst, expects Silicon Valley’s Nvidia to pick up a point or two of market share, to the detriment of its rival, Advanced Micro Devices (incorporating the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI).He says 2007 was a memorable year for graphics, with the release of richer interfaces in the Windows Vista and Apple Leopard operating systems, a series of new graphics-intensive PC games, the new DX10 graphics standard from Microsoft and a complete refresh of Nvidia and AMD’s line-ups.Nvidia released its next-generation graphics chips and cards ahead of AMD, gaining market share.“AMD had their low point pretty much the middle of last year,” says Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, who releases the fourth-quarter figures today.He says they recovered in the third quarter as new products were released and describes the latest versions launched over the past week as “process-shrinks essentially” that offer improved performance and have reduced costs.The ATI Radeon HD 3450, 3650 and 3870X2 boards are based on chips with circuit widths of 55 billionths of a metre, compared to 80 billionths in the previous generation. This allows a smaller die size, greater transistor density and lower costs.The 3450 and 3650, available this month, are low-power sub-$150 boards, while the 3870X2, announced today, features two GPUs and, at $450, is being priced around $150 below Nvidia’s competing card.Multi-GPU boards are likely to become a trend, as are hybrid graphics.The graphics capabilities of low-cost PCs can easily be upgraded by adding a new board. But, in the past, this has meant switching off the integrated graphics chip already included on the motherboard.With hybrid graphics, the integrated chip stays on and is boosted by the addition of the board. AMD says it is introducing this feature with its new boards, Nvidia says it already has the capability.
322;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-26T00:46:35Z;Via’s Isaiah offers biblical performance;;"Intel, which has been engaged in a battle royal with Advanced Micro Devices over whose chips go in high-end servers, is beginning to encounter a similar level of competition from a smaller rival at the other end of the scale.VIA, based in Taiwan, is often forgotten as a player in the dominant ""x86"" market for PC microprocessors. It has never had more than 5 per cent market-share and is normally in the 1 to 2 per cent range, with Intel taking around 80 per cent and AMD the rest.However, it seems to be a match for Intel in the niche segment largely ignored by AMD for low-powered computing.Samsung has tried both VIA and Intel microprocessors in its Q1 ultra-mobile PC. VIA is preferred in the 02 by Silicon Valley’s OQO, which pioneered the category. A VIA processor is also powering the Everex CloudBook, which created a stir at the Consumer Electronics Show this month.Intel is pushing a new category called Mobile Internet Devices or Mids and is expected to become more competitive when it introduces its low-power Silverthorne chip. More details of its capabilities are expected next month.This week, VIA announced its next-generation Isaiah architecture, which it believes will keep it ahead of Intel, even after Silverthorne appears in the second quarter.While Intel has switched from increasing speeds to decreasing power demands in its chip designs, VIA is going the other way.Its strength has always been the extended battery life it permits through the low wattage of its microprocessors. With Isaiah, it says the power demands will be the same, but the Isaiah chip will perform two to four times better than its predecessor.""Our chips are the best in the market for performance per watt, but the level of performance we can achieve with Isaiah means we can be more competitive in other segments,"" says Glenn Henry, president of Centaur Technology, a VIA subsidiary that designed the chip.The performance boost could even make VIA a competitor for the microprocessor slot in full-sized PCs, he says, a move that would certainly get the attention of both Intel and AMD."
323;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-20T16:56:01Z;Business drives funds’ investment strategy;;When it comes to M&A, the Americans seem to have a misconception that the Arabs and Chinese are about to start acting like the Japanese during the 1980s.Back then, Japanese companies descended into the US, spending lavish amounts of cash on trophy assets such as Columbia Pictures, the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores and the Rockefeller Center.The hue and cry from US legislators was almost identical to the one they are experiencing today about the possibility of sovereign wealth funds controlling their assets.But this is where the similarity ends.Unlike the Japanese companies, which wanted full control, the Arabs and Chinese are content to hand over their cash and let the Americans keep running the show.So, whereas in the 1980s the Americans feared that the Japanese semiconductor makers were plotting some sinister takeover of the memory chip business, they didn’t even blink when Mubadala, the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, took an 8.1 per cent passive stake in Advanced Micro Devices in December.The Japanese did eventually work out the best strategy for buying into America and, during the 1990s, they returned to the US to form alliances, such as the one struck between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Caterpillar.Their new-found circumspection paid off.In 2006, Toshiba managed to buy Westinghouse, the US power plant company – without so much as a squeak from politicians or shareholders – and even promised to keep it as a separate business for a few years, making only minimal changes among employees and senior executives.The Arab and Chinese funds are not in the midst of a stealthy takeover of Wall Street or America Inc.It is less a political move and more of a shrewd business move by the Arab and Chinese state investment funds to deploy their wealth of reserves by buying passive stakes on the cheap.Also, although they are highly sophisticated investors, they are not in a position to transfer large numbers of staff to a new acquisition, monitor the performance, regulate its activities, sign off the annual reports and do all the day-to-day micro managing required.Apart from anything else, when an investment goes wrong, they can blame the Americans.
324;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-18T22:34:36Z;Wall St slumps amid worries over economy;;Wall Street stocks slumped again on Friday as worries that the US economy is heading for a recession served up the worst week for equities in more than five years.President Bush outlined a $140bn package of tax cuts and other measures designed to provide a boost to the US economy on Friday but the plan failed to imbue the market with any confidence.A downgrade of Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, threatened further credit market turmoil, while Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone company, added to worries about growth prospects in telecoms after subscriber numbers wilted.The sell-off in telecoms added another member to a growing list of industry groups now in a bear market – a fall of more than 20 per cent from a market peak – joining transports, retailers, semiconductors, homebuilders and financials.The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,325.19 on Friday and lost 5.4 per cent for the week, its worst weekly performance since markets were buffeted by the collapse of WorldCom in 2002. The sell-off left the index reeling at at its lowest level in almost 16 months.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 4 per cent for this week to 12,099.30. The Nasdaq Composite surrendered 4.1 per cent to 2,340.02 and now stands on the verge of a bear market, a threshold already crossed this week by the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which fell 4.7 per cent to 673.16.Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, said the stock market might now be suggesting a greater than 50 per cent chance of recession with “favourite sons” such as energy, commodity and industrial stocks witnessing sharp pullbacks.Telecoms stocks slumped on Friday after Sprint Nextel confirmed it was cutting 4,000 jobs and closing 125 stores after it lost more subscribers than expected last quarter. It fell 29 per cent to $8.70 for the week.Telecoms shares held up fairly well at the end of last year but AT&T’s chief executive undermined confidence last week by cautioning of weakness in its consumer business.Technology stocks avoided the worst of the selling on Friday after IBM’s earnings outlook alleviated some concerns that growth in the sector could suffer if companies cut back on tech spending. IBM’s shares rose 5.9 per cent to $103.40 over the week after it forecast of earnings growth of 15-16 per cent for 2008.Also enjoying better fortune was Advanced Micro Devices which gained 13.1 per cent to $7.07 after it posted a narrower loss than many analysts had feared. However, elsewhere in the tech sector the picture was less rosy with Intel falling 13.6 per cent to $19 this week after its quarterly earnings disappointed analysts.Oil companies and other commodity producers fared poorly this week as crude oil prices drifted back towards $90 amid expectations of waning US demand. These companies were previously a favourite with investors because they were considered less exposed to the US economy, but the potential for a broader global slowdown shook confidence.Schlumberger was among the leading fallers, down 15.4 per cent at $79.52 this week, after its fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations because of weakness in the US.Agribusinesses were also among last year’s standout performers but the sector endured a difficult week. Monsanto fell 12.4 per cent to $105.75 after UBS issued a a short-term “sell” rating.Financials were again a focus for investors as three leading Wall Street investment banks turned in their quarterly report cards. Although JPMorgan managed to avoid severe subprime-related losses, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch both plummeted to near $10bn fourth-quarter losses as writedowns on credit assets soared.Citi fell 14.4 per cent to $24.45 after it slashed its dividend and dramatically increased its consumer loan loss reserves. Merrill, down 5.2 per cent at $51.87, sparked worries by taking a $3.1bn writedown on hedges made with bond insurers.Bond insurers Ambac Financial and MBIA, were among the worst performing stocks this week, falling 71.5 per cent to $6.20 and 48.5 per cent to $8.55. Fitch Ratings on Friday cut Ambac’s “AAA” credit rating to “AA”.Industrials were also sold after a sharp contraction in the Philadelphia Fed regional factory index warned of a slowdown in manufacturing.General Electric, outperformed the sector, slipping only 2.5 per cent to $34.31 for the week after the conglomerate’s quarterly results met analysts’ expectations.
325;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-16T19:42:42Z;Intel’s cautious 2008 outlook hits shares;;Shares in Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, plunged more more than 10 per cent on Wednesday after its cautious outlook for 2008 fuelled Wall Street’s fears of a recession.Intel forecast first-quarter revenues in a range of $9.4bn to $10bn, with a midpoint of $9.7bn – below analysts’ expectations of $10bn. Its shares were down 11.7 per cent at $20.04 in midday trading in New York.“Based on what we see and economic indicators, we think it’s right to be a little bit cautious as we go into the year,” Stacy Smith, chief financial officer, toldanalysts in a conference call.Intel’s fourth-quarter profits and sales, reported late on Tuesday, were also below expectations. The company blamed problems in its non-core memory chip business.It reported $2.3bn profit, or earnings per share of 38 cents on revenues of $10.7bn. The consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts surveyed by Reuters were for earnings of 40 cents and revenues of $10.84bn. For the full year, Intel improved on its 2006 annus horribilis, when it lost market share and launched a price war with rival AMD, while restructuring the company.In 2007, revenues rose 8 per cent to $38.3bn after falling 9 per cent in 2006. Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to $1.18.Revenues for its main microprocessor and chipset business were as expected in the fourth quarter. Gross margins of 58.1 per cent were up nearly 7 percentage points on the third quarter.But revenues for its non-core Nand flash memory chips were lower than forecast due to lower average selling prices in the competitive market.Intel said restructuring and asset impairment charges of $234m were higher than its previous estimates of $130m due to an impairment of its Nor flash assets related to a spin-off of the business into a joint venture with STMicroelectronics.
326;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-16T18:52:07Z;Intel gets punished;;"This is no time to disappoint. With investor nerves already stretched to the limit by recession fears, it is no surprise that Intel got soundly beaten for falling short on earnings. In spite of increasing net profit by 50 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter the chipmaker fell a tad short of expectations. Its shares fell by 11 per cent yesterday and semiconductor peers across the world got hit too.Given fears that the technology sector, where profits have been fuelled by the weak dollar and strong overseas growth, could yet succumb to the US slowdown, the negative reaction is understandable. It also appears excessive, given the size of the miss and the fact that the revenue shortfall came from the non-core Nand memory business.The trouble is that the outlook overall is getting worse. As recently as October, Intel was forecasting sales as high as $11.1bn for the fourth quarter, way above the $10.7bn it achieved. In addition, the top of the $9.4bn to $10bn range given by Intel for the first quarter is below analyst estimates according to Bloomberg.For Intel, slowing revenues can cause serious profits setbacks. If end demand is not strong enough, whether because of the economic slowdown in the US or elsewhere, chip prices can fall rapidly, hammering margins. Intel’s smaller rival AMD looks particularly vulnerable on that score, given that its short moment in the sun has ended with it falling behind its larger rival on chip technology again. AMD’s shares have fallen
85 per cent in two years.Such a fate does not await Intel. But as investors beef up their defences against a possible recession, the cyclical chipmaker is not the obvious place to hide. Especially given that its shares, even after yesterday’s falls, are trading at about 17-times 2007 earnings.Post and read comments on this Lex"
327;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-15T23:16:53Z;Intel slides as profits and sales miss targets;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday with fourth-quarter profits and sales below expectations and a cautious outlook for 2008.The company blamed problems in its non-core memory chip business for exerting a drag on its results. Its shares fell 14 per cent in after-hours trading to $19.50 – its worse-than expected figures spooking the market a day after IBM had kicked off the reporting season with strong earnings.Intel reported earnings per share of 38 cents on revenues of $10.7bn. The consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts surveyed by Reuters were for earnings of 40 cents and revenues of $10.84bn.For the current quarter, it forecast revenues of $9.4bn to $10bn – the midpoint of $9.7bn being below Wall Street expectations of $10bn.For the full year, Intel improved on its 2006 “annus horribilis”, when it lost market share and launched a price war with rival AMD, while restructuring the company.In 2007, revenues rose 8 per cent to $38.3bn after falling 9 per cent in 2006. Earnings per share rose 37 per cent to $1.18.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said customers had embraced the new Core design for its chips, introduced in mid-2006, “extending our competitive leadership and driving a significant gain in operating results”.“We enter 2008 with the best combination of products, silicon technology and manufacturing leadership in our history,” he said.Revenues for its main microprocessor and chipset business were as expected in the fourth quarter, Intel said, with strong performances in the server, mobile and desktop segments. Gross margins of 58.1 per cent were up nearly 7 percentage points on the third quarter.But revenues for its non-core “Nand” flash memory chips were lower than forecast due to lower average selling prices in the competitive market.Intel said restructuring and asset impairment charges of $234m were higher than its previous estimates of $130m due to an impairment of its “Nor” flash assets related to a spin-off of the business into a joint venture with STMicroelectronics. Intel admitted last month that the credit crunch had delayed the spin-off as terms were renegotiated with lenders.
328;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-10T20:21:32Z;NY starts antitrust inquiry for Intel;;New York’s attorney-general on Thursday launched an antitrust investigation into the activities of Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, following similar inquiries in the European Union, Japan and South Korea.The announcement by attorney-general Andrew Cuomo that he had served a wide-ranging subpoena on Intel marked the first investigation by US authorities of Intel’s tactics in competing with its main rival Advanced Micro Devices.The Federal Trade Commission has thus far shown no indication it will follow its peers in Europe, Japan and South Korea in launching an inquiry. AMD is pursuing its own antitrust complaint against Intel in a court in Delaware.New York said it was investigating whether Intel violated state and federal antitrust laws by coercing customers to exclude AMD from the worldwide market for the dominant “x86” microprocessors used in computers.“After careful preliminary review, we have determined that questions raised about Intel’s potential anticompetitive conduct warrant a full and factual investigation,” said the attorney-general. “Monopolistic practices are a serious concern, particularly for New Yorkers who are navigating an information-intensive economy.”The state attorney-general’s office has been active in investigating alleged corporate malpractice under Mr Cuomo and his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, including an inquiry into price-fixing in the memory chip industry.AMD has also signed a deal with the state that could see it build a major chip production facility there.The subpoena seeks documents and information on Intel’s pricing practices, with the aim of finding out whether it penalised customers for buying AMD microprocessors, made improper payments for them to buy only from Intel or illegally cut off AMD from distribution channels.Intel’s processors are in more than four out of five x86 computers sold, in a global market that is worth $30bn a year.Intel confirmed the company had received the subpoena from the New York attorney-general.“We will work very hard to comply with the requests in the subpoena,” it said. “We believe our business practices are fair and that the microprocessor market is functioning normally as a competitive market should be, and we hope to convince the attorney-general’s office of this.”Intel submitted its response this week to European Commission charges made in July and asked for an oral hearing.In September, Intel was accused of anti-competitive behaviour by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission. In 2005, Intel settled with Japan’s FTC by accepting a “cease and desist” ruling.
329;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-04T18:46:22Z;Acrimony as Intel exits One Laptop project;;An uneasy partnership between Intel and a non-profit project providing cheap laptops for third-world children has ended acrimoniously with the world’s biggest chipmaker being accused of “shameless” behaviour.An Intel spokesman on Thursday described the split between the company and One Laptop Per Child as being caused by a “philosophical impasse”. But OLPC responded on Friday with a 10-point list of complaints, accusing Intel of constantly criticising the project’s XO laptop and promoting instead its own Classmate laptop for developing countries.The two sides temporarily settled their differences last July, after Intel had publicly criticised the OLPC effort and Nicholas Negroponte, OLPC’s founder, had accused Intel of selling the Classmate at below cost to drive the XO out of the market.Intel agreed to help with development and marketing of the XO and join the OLPC board. It joined 11 other companies as partners, including its rival Advanced Micro Devices, provider of the XO’s processor.The XO went into full production in October, costing $185 rather than the $100 initially envisaged. OLPC expects the price to fall and has sold XOs to US buyers for $400, pledging to donate one for free to a child in a developing country for each US sale.OLPC claimed on Friday that Intel was about to be thrown out of the project, but both sides had agreed on a joint statement saying there had been a mutual agreement. Intel had reneged on this by saying it was quitting, it claimed.The Intel spokesman said OLPC had asked it to end its support for the Classmate PC, a request it could not accommodate.“Intel has been shameless,” OLPC said in a statement on Friday. “Intel has violated or not lived up to any part of their written agreement.”“OLPC welcomes, always has, other low-cost laptops. Our goal is to get laptops into the hands of kids, not necessarily XOs.”OLPC accused Intel of disparaging the XO in countries from Peru to Mongolia and said its criticisms had increased in frequency and volume after it joined the board.It said it hoped to introduce an XO based on an Intel microprocessor but “the best Intel could offer in regard to an ‘Intel inside’ XO laptop was one that would be both more expensive and consume more electric power.”The project alleged that Intel had not contributed any engineering effort or even a single line of code during its six months of membership.An Intel spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the OLPC allegations.The unfavourable publicity for Intel came on a day when the company suffered its second analyst downgrade of the week, sending its shares 6.7 per cent lower to $23.02 in midday trading in New York.
330;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2008-01-02T22:14:28Z;Wall St start to new year worst in 25 years;;US blue-chip stocks on Wednesday suffered the worst start to a new year in 25 years after an index of manufacturing fell sharply, raising fears that the US economy is slowing more than expected.Energy stocks were a lone bright spot as crude oil prices touched $100 a barrel, but the spike in crude accentuated selling of a broad range of transport and industrial companies. Technology stocks were particularly weak after an analyst downgraded several semiconductor companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 13,043.96 points, its worst percentage decline on the first trading day of a year since 1983. The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,447.16 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.6 per cent to 2,609.63.The Institute for Supply Management’s survey showed that manufacturing weakened unexpectedly in December. The ISM index fell 3.1 percentage points to 47.7 last month, against expectations it would be little changed. A reading of 50 marks the line between growth and contraction.“Clearly the worries that we finished 2007 with are continuing into 2008, with these ISM numbers coming out so weak,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place trying to fight inflation while dealing with the slowdown in US growth.”Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting emphasised the difficulty of “unusually uncertain” economic conditions and indicated the Fed remained “exceptionally alert” to the possible need for further rate cuts.The futures market fully priced in the likelihood of at least a 25 basis point cut at the end of this month compared with a 68 per cent chance a week ago.Semiconductor stocks were sold after Banc of America Securities downgraded eight companies – three of them to “sell” – saying a cyclical recovery had run its course, while inventories had risen above equilibrium levels.BofA analyst Sumit Dhanda cut Intel to “neutral” and told investors to sell shares in Advanced Micro Devices. The shares fell 4.9 per cent to $25.35 and 4.8 per cent to $7.14 respectively. The PHLX semiconductor sector index lost 2.9 per cent to 396.34.Also in the chip sector Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $38.39 after it said it expected an “immediate short-term impact” from a court ruling that it must halt chip sales that infringe patents belonging to Broadcom. Broadcom gained 1.5 per cent to $26.52.Amazon outperformed after Citigroup told investors to buy the shares citing expectations of strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The shares gained 3.9 per cent to $96.25.Transport groups struggled as oil prices soared and after JPMorgan downgraded FedEx from “overweight” to “neutral” because of weak freight demand and higher fuel costs. The shares fell 3.9 per cent to $86.16.YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell 9.7 per cent to $15.43 after warning it expected to incur charges in the fourth quarter related to previous acquisitions. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 5 per cent to $26.82 after Goldman Sachs said that cost inflation was acting as a large offset to cost savings activity.Investors also sold restaurant chains after Bear Stearns downgraded the sector to “underweight”. Analyst Joseph Buckley cut Starbucks to “peer perform” from “outperform” because he expects less affluent consumers will start to feel economic pressures. The stock fell 5.7 per cent to $19.31.Shares in Industrial companies declined after the ISM report and as Citi downgraded Textron, the industrial conglomerate, to “hold” from “buy”. The shares fell 6.3 per cent to $66.81.Financials fell heavily as National City said it would slash its dividend by almost 50 per cent and that it planned to raise more capital to cope with credit market turmoil. The shares dropped 5.3 per cent to $15.59. The S&P investment bank index shed 3.5 per cent with Morgan Stanley, down 4.1 per cent at $50.95 and Lehman Brothers, 5 per cent weaker at $62.19.Newmont Mining, the world’s second largest gold producer, rose 7.3 per cent to $52.39, the best performer on the S&P, as gold prices surged to a record high.As oil prices rose, energy stocks benefited. Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling company gained 2 per cent to $145.95.
331;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-12-30T20:22:15Z;Intel steps up for ARM wrestling contest;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, will launch a three-pronged assault at the Consumer Electronics Show next week to become a key provider of components for a new generation of mobile internet devices.Analysts have warned it can expect to make little progress in 2008 with its strategy, while industry rivals say the PC microprocessor leader faces major opposition in its attempts to win market share in the cell phone and consumer electronics industries.In a keynote speech at the Las Vegas extravaganza, Paul Otellini, chief executive, will announce a fresh line-up of processors for notebook PCs, as well as partner support for its new platform for mobile internet devices (Mids).He will also cite progress in the deployment of WiMax, the broadband wireless technology Intel is promoting.Intel has been working with Clearwire and Sprint on creating a mobile WiMax network across the US in 2008.WiMax has evolved from Intel’s need to take the next step beyond the Wi-Fi chips it includes in its Centrino platform for notebook PCs, providing localised wireless internet access.It says 2008 will see the creation of “uber hotspots” in cities with WiMax’s ability to cover wide areas.However, Intel’s combined Wi-Fi and WiMax modules appearing in notebook PCs and smaller devices in the second half of 2008 will face competition from “3.5G” cell phone technologies, which are also being integrated into laptops for the first time.HSPA technology running on GSM networks is already capable of download speeds of 7.2 megabits per second.“WiMax will say they can deliver 4 to 5mb/sec, but we can do that now and we already have the networks in place,” says Arun Bhikshesvaran, chief technology officer of Ericsson North America.“By 2011, we expect 50 per cent of new laptops will have HSPA embedded and analysts think this may happen even faster.”Forrester Research estimated last week there will be less than 2m mobile WiMax subscribers in the US by the end of 2008, in spite of a coverage area of a potential 100m subscribers.“New device form factors, such as mobile internet devices, will fail to tell a compelling story that motivates a significant change in consumer behaviour,” it said.Intel will ship its first-generation low-power microprocessor platform, codenamed Menlow, in the first half and is expected to show Menlow-based mobile internet devices from manufacturers including Asus, BenQ, Clarion, Compal, Lenovo and Quanta at CES.Charles Golvin, Forrester analyst, says the success of Mids and WiMax are interdependent.“[Intel’s slogan] ‘the internet in your pocket wherever you go’, depends on WiMax: you can only realise that promise when you really do have a ubiquitous service.”He sees more potential for Mids initially as entertainment or navigation devices.As Intel moves beyond the PC to embedding its processors in these smaller devices, it enters the territory of rivals making embedded low-power processors designed by Britain’s ARM Holdings.“There’s a mid-range product between a PC and a smartphone and they want to be the microprocessor of choice for that product category. This is Intel versus virtually everybody else in the semiconductor industry using ARM. I personally don’t think they’re going to be successful,” says Warren East, ARM chief executive.“We are still an order of magnitude ahead in power consumption,” he adds, pointing out Intel’s previous failure to break into the cell phone market with its processors. He claims an ARM-based chip from Texas Instruments consumes less power in running than an Intel one in ‘sleep mode’.Henri Richard, former head of sales at Intel’s PC rival AMD and now sales chief with ARM partner Freescale, says the ‘x86’ processors Intel and AMD develop for PCs have been reduced enough in size to be competitive in smaller devices.But he says the consumer electronics and cell phone industries would not want to see Intel dominate.“So many customers have watched what happened in the PC business with fear. They are not going to do anything to support that business model,” he says.Intel’s best chance for success in its mobile internet strategy remains in notebook computers, where industry sales are up 30 per cent year-on-year. Notebook sales should overtake those of desktop PCs in 2009, according to the IDC research firm.“People making their second or third purchase of a computer are choosing notebooks,” says Bahr Mahony, head of marketing for AMD’s mobile division.
332;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-12-17T21:10:33Z;Related property group wins $1.4bn injection;;Related Companies, the US real estate business run by billionaire developer Stephen Ross, has taken a $1.4bn capital infusion from a consortium of investors including the Abu Dhabi government, in the latest of a slew of investments by cash rich sovereign wealth funds.Goldman Sachs will take about a 5 per cent stake in the company and MSD Capital, the investment vehicle of computer billionaire Michael Dell, will take a 2.5 per cent stake in the privately-held Related, for a total of $400m, according to people familiar with the matter.Mubadala, an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, The Olayan Group, a Saudi Arabian fund, and another as yet unnamed investor have agreed to buy $1bn of debt from Related.The deal will offer Related a deeper capital base for future developments, as the credit squeeze has forced real estate companies to rely on greater levels of equity.“We saw an opportunity to raise capital when the liquidity in the market is not so great,” said Jeff Blau, president of Related.The cash raising exercise and links with new investors will allow Related to focus on finding new developments, rather than raising capital.Mubadala’s investment is the latest in the US by oil rich middle eastern states, some of which have spurred political concerns.Last month Mubadala bought an 8.1 per cent stake in AMD for $622m, the second biggest maker of microprocessors in the world, and in September it took a 7.5 per cent non-voting stake in Carlyle, the US buy-out firm, for $1.35bn. The government fund has also in the past invested in Ferrari, the Italian car company.Mubadala is pumping cash into Related just as the company is redeveloping one of New York’s major transport hubs, Penn Station. As part of the project it will also build the new Madison Square Garden, the concert and sports venue.Neither Mubadala, nor any of the other investors in the deal will be involved in running the company, Related said.Sovereign wealth fund investors have increasingly invested on US companies without seeking to run them, as they try to ease concerns over foreign governments controlling US businesses.Related, which was founded by Stephen Ross in 1972, builds and manages residential and commercial property. Among its more famous developments is the Time Warner Center overlooking Central Park in New York.Aside from the Penn Station development, Related is also among five group competing to redevelop the West Side railyards along the west side of Manhattan. Goldman Sachs would be its partner in the project. Related said that it expected its five new investors to help fund both projects should they go ahead.Mr Blau said that the company had sought the outside funds because “big, complex” projects such as the new Penn Station and the Hudson yards were “exceeding domestic investors” financing abilities.The company has a $58bn pipeline of projects, according to a person familiar with the matter.
333;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-12-13T20:12:09Z;AMD hit by losses across all divisions;;Advanced Micro Devices, the second largest maker of PC microprocessors, on Thursday admitted to an “ugly” 2007, which saw all of its businesses lose money and the botched launch of a key microprocessor that halved its PC server market share.But Hector Ruiz, chief executive, sought to reassure worried investors on Thursday, promising to return AMD to profitability in 2008 in what he dubbed a “phenomenal transition year”.But the shares fell 4 per cent to $8.61 in midday trading, a level not plumbed since 2003, continuing a poor performance this year, with the stock down 58 per cent. Mr Ruiz reacted with dismay. “How in the hell can anyone conclude that our company is worth 40 per cent less today than it was a few weeks ago?” he asked.In contrast, its rival Intel’s shares are up 33 per cent, boosted by better-performing products and increased market share.Bob Rivet, AMD chief financial officer, tried to paint a brighter picture and characterised the past year as “the good, the bad and the ugly”. On the good side, AMD had gained Toshiba as a customer, improved its distribution, launched an im­pressive graphics product from its ATI acquisition and seen outstanding yields for its latest quad-core Barcelona microprocessor.The bad news was that it was late with both the Barcelona and ATI products and its consumer products division had underperformed.The “ugly” news was the losses in every business, negative cash flow that was “totally unacceptable” and a fall in its share of the market for PC server chips from 26 per cent to 13 per cent.The market-share fall can be partly blamed on the failure of Barcelona to live up to AMD’s lofty claims. The chipmaker said that the “true quad-core” chip would regain performance leadership over Intel’s quad cores, which are two dual-core processors put on the same piece of silicon. Barcelona was launched in September, months late and running at slower speeds than expected. Last week, AMD admitted a design flaw was also affecting performance and had restricted the quantities released in the fourth quarter.On Wednesday, AMD ad­mitted it had overpaid in its $5.4bn acquisition of the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI last year. It said it would take an impairment charge related to the deal, but did not specify the amount. AMD has more than $5bn in debt following the acquisition. Last month, it agreed to sell an 8.1 per cent stake to Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development for an estimated $700m.Mr Rivet said AMD’s re­turn to profitability would be dri­ven by new products, gross margins rising to 46-50 per cent from 41 per cent in the third quarter, and the cutting of research and de­v­­e­l­o­­­pment and administration costs.
334;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-12-05T22:28:09Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday for the first time this week, boosted by a solid gauge of private sector employment hiring in November.The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent at 1,485.01 near its high for the day.Among leading sectors, technology lead with a gain of 2.5 per cent, followed by a 2 per cent rise in financials and a 1.9 per cent rally in energy stocks.Not all the news was good for financials however. Concerns about US bond insurers sparked a dramatic turnaround in that sector.Moody’s issued a statement saying that MBIA “was at greater risk of a capital shortfall than previously communicated, and a shortfall is now considered somewhat likely”. This could threaten its AAA rating.MBIA swiftly surrendered its gains from early trade and the stock fell 15.9 per cent to $27.42. Meanwhile, Ambac dropped 8.9 per cent to $23.52. The cost to insure MBIA and Ambac debt against default also rose.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 2,666.36, while the Nasdaq 100 gained 2 per cent to close at 2,099.31.Blue-chips also rose sharply and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.5 per cent higher at 13,444.96.Shares in AIG led bluechips, as they rose 4.9 per cent to close at $58.15. Another Dow financial, Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $33.69, while a 4.2 per cent rise in Microsoft to $34.15 also boosted the blue-chip barometer.Smaller companies were not ignored by investors and the Russell 2000 index rose 1.8 per cent to 765.64. “The reason for today’s rally is, for the first time in a long time, a good old-fashioned reason – that the economy is doing well and not whether the Fed will cut rates or not,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management.In economic news, the ADP national employment report estimated that 189,000 private sector jobs were created in November. Economists had expected a 50,000 gain, and the news pushed bond yields higher.“As long as people have jobs, consumers will spend money,” said Mr Paulsen.The ADP number suggests that the November employment report, due on Friday, will expand by around 210,000 jobs. Economists, however expect a gain of 70,000 jobs.Other data did little to dissuade investors that the Federal Reserve will ease its stance on rates next week.The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses, slipped more than expected to a reading of 54.1 in November from 55.8 the previous month.Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “This mix of decelerating growth, with higher price indications, tends to play more to the crowd expecting a 25bp cut in the funds rate next week, rather than a 50bp cut.”A bullish note was struck for technology after Thomas Weisel Partners said demand for notebook computers would increase in emerging markets, particularly Brazil, Russia, India and China. The broker upgraded Intel to “overweight”.The Philadelphia Exchange’s semiconductor index gained 2.3 per cent.IBM was up 1.4 per cent at $108.16 on the news but AMD gave up gains closing down 3.7 per cent at $8.91. Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $185.50.Energy was also in favour and the sector held much of its gains in spite of oil prices falling after a surge in early trade.ExxonMobil rose 2 per cent at $89.92 as the American oil index rose 1.6 per cent.Among laggards, cable operator Comcast said 2007 revenue would be lower and expenses higher than previously forecast, citing greater competition and a slowing economy. Shares in the company plunged 8.7 per cent to $18.92.Among gainers in the financial sector, Fannie Mae recovered after initial falls. Its shares added 2.7 per cent to $36.13.The mortgage financier said late on Tuesday that it would issue $7bn in preferred stock and cut its dividend to raise cash.Fellow government-backed mortgage company Freddie Mac made a similar move last week.

335;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-12-02T23:17:24Z;Fujitsu deal to develop WiMax chips in Taiwan;;Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, and the Taiwanese government will on Tuesday announce that they will jointly develop WiMax broadband chips in Taiwan in a significant Asian alliance intended to commercialise the next-generation mobile technology across the region.WiMax is a long-range, high-speed wireless internet access that allows operators to provide signal coverage over areas of up to 50km but has so far gained little traction.Intel, which supplies the microprocessors in four out of five PCs, has been a leading force behind the spread of WiMax and hopes the spread of the technology will lead to a surge in devices, using the technology.Intel will begin bundling its own WiMax chips in PCs from next year, suggesting it will dominate the laptop market with the technology.Fujitsu could supply Intel’s rival Advanced Micro Devices and may find a bigger market in mobile phones or infrastructure equipment as WiMax networks are rolled out.The partnership between Fujitsu and Taiwan is a significant step in spreading the WiMax standard because most PCs and mobile phones are made by Taiwanese companies. Fujitsu is keen to conduct research and development in Taiwan because it would probably generate large orders from the island’s hardware makers, which manufacture most of the world’s networking gear, according to Taiwanese officials.The joint venture will take the form of a joint research facility in Taiwan funded by Fujitsu and the Institute for Information Industry, Shen Jung-chin, a senior official at Taiwan’s Ministry for Economic Affairs, told the FT. The institute is a technology research body jointly funded by government and industry in Taiwan.Taiwan has become one of the world’s earliest adopters of WiMax in an attempt to transform itself from a contract manufacturer and designer of IT and communications equipment into a technology pioneer.The island’s government has awarded six WiMax licences, under which operators are due to start services by the end of 2008, and has invested heavily in infrastructure, testing and research.“The idea behind teaming up with Fujitsu is the same as the one behind the entire WiMax initiative,” said a senior government official.“Currently, we make most of the world’s IT equipment, but others set the standards. By jumping in really early in WiMax, we hope to have a role in setting standards and be able to receive, rather than pay, royalties in the future.”
336;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-11-30T18:35:47Z;US must live with being a bargain basement;;It is the holiday season in New York City. Thanksgiving is over, the decorations are up on Fifth Avenue and the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza has been lit – this year with energy-efficient light-emitting diodes rather than the traditional lightbulbs. All that remains is for New Yorkers to spend money.To shop in New York this year, however, is to hear a rich array of European accents. In Bloomingdale’s the other day, two French women were debating the quality of Ralph Lauren towels. As I crossed Avenue of the Americas this week, I heard a British family complaining about the eggs they had for breakfast.In 1973, Genesis released an album called Selling England by the Pound. It was the time of the oil shock and the album looked back nostalgically over a wealth of English sub-culture. Coincidentally, the Genesis tour of the same name is being recreated in December in New York by the Canadian band The Musical Box, which will perform a multi-media tribute in Tribeca.These days, with oil approaching $100 a barrel and the Middle East once again overflowing with petrodollars while the US frets over the possibility of recession next year, America is being sold by the dollar.The shopping surge is due to the weak dollar, which is approaching $1.50 to the euro and is above two dollars to the pound. It is cheaper for Europeans to take a flight to New York for their Christmas shopping than to do it in their own countries.Rampant European consumption is not confined to Christmas presents. The New York housing market has until recently defied the gloom in other states and carried on rising. But dollar weakness makes New York apartments seem cheap to foreigners: some condominium developers are increasingly relying on foreigners to sustain demand.The effect is a bit insulting: the “Ugly American” of the 1958 novel, who swaggered around the world with a strong dollar and inviolable set of beliefs, has given way to picky French and shirty Brits. But most New Yorkers see the benefits of foreigners keeping their city buzzing.Americans are less sanguine about what is happening to US businesses, which are being snapped up by overseas investors as eagerly as luxury items in Saks Fifth Avenue or Bergdorf Goodman.The investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government this week struck a deal to buy 4.9 per cent of Citigroup, one of the US banks that has been badly hit by the subprime credit crisis. Another Abu Dhabi fund has acquired 8 per cent of AMD, the US chip manufacturer.Dubai, another of the United Arab Emirates, has been on the prowl for US assets, buying 9.9 per cent of the Och-Ziff hedge fund. Others are looking in the US as well. SK Telecom, the South Korean operator, this week made a joint approach with Providence Equity, a private equity firm, to take a $5bn stake in Sprint, the US mobile operator.All of this activity has awakened memories of the period in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Japanese investors bought US trophy assets including the Pebble Beach golf course in California. That coincided with US introspection about whether it was being overtaken as a manufacturing power by Japan and by other Asian countries.Today’s imbalance is less industrial than financial. The US has been running a large trade deficit with the rest of the world, importing manufactured goods from Asia and energy from the Middle East. That has created a savings glut in Asia and boosted sovereign wealth funds set up by states such as Abu Dhabi.The funds are now flowing back in the form of capital investment. In the past, Arab governments mostly put their petrodollars into Treasury bonds but they are now spreading into equity as well. It is a natural financial rebalancing act but it unnerves some politicians and commentators.The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page this week recalled that Sheikh Zayed, father of the current ruler of Abu Dhabi, owned the fraud-ridden Bank of Credit and Commerce International in the 1990s. It warned that “Arab interests will now have inordinate sway over America’s largest bank”, since Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia already holds a 3.9 per cent stake.So far, the latest round of stake-building by Arab investment funds has provoked less furore in Washington than the takeover of P&O by Dubai Ports World last year, which led to the Dubai company having to shed its interests in US ports. The political oversight of foreign acquisitions of US companies was tightened as a result.But what can the US expect if it lives beyond its means in the way it has in recent years? Its consumption patterns and use of energy have turned other countries into its piggy bank. The credit squeeze has left its financial institutions with weakened capital and in need of equity that Arab funds can provide.If US consumers had saved more, spent less, and filled up their SUVs less frequently – and US financial institutions had not embarked on their own credit binge – they might not be in such an embarrassing condition. But they acted as they did and must live with a weak dollar.Perhaps those in Washington and elsewhere should adopt the attitude of New York to foreign money. The city might prefer the dollar to be strong but euros, pounds and UAE dirhams are supporting retailers, property prices, and Wall Street.

337;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-11-29T07:08:40Z;America should be thankful for canny Arab wealth;;If you find yourself in Abu Dhabi, as I did the other day, it is worth driving westwards along the Corniche road to the Emirates Palace hotel, a $3bn edifice of marble and gold leaf, where a musician plays teatime tunes on a Steinway baby grand.Abu Dhabi’s government could buy Steinway & Sons without a blink if it were interested in New York trophy assets, as Japanese investors were in the bubble years and Middle East sheikhs were in the 1970s. But one piano is enough – it has set its sights on altogether bigger things.Here, on the Gulf coast, is the spot where the world’s wealth is most concentrated. Abu Dhabi, the biggest of the United Arab Emirates, has nine per cent of the world’s oil reserves and four per cent of its natural gas. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) is thought to have $1,000bn (€677bn) in funds thanks to $90 oil, with billions more pouring in every month. Perhaps the peace and quiet and the distance from New York – a 14-hour flight away – accounts for the sanguine attitude of the ADIA, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund (SWF), to the US housing slump and credit crisis. As other investors lost their nerve this week, Abu Dhabi injected $7.5bn into Citigroup in return for bonds convertible into a 4.9 per cent equity stake.It helps to be separated from Wall Street just at the moment. We have reached the point in the cycle where fear has definitively taken over from greed. Bad news about the US consumer or the housing market, which increases the risk of a recession, is seized on anxiously. Good news, such as last week’s buoyant Black Friday sales figures, is explained away gloomily.In Abu Dhabi, that noise is less intrusive. The ADIA took the view that a bank with an unmatched global franchise, trading at 1.4 times book value, with a dividend yield of about 7 per cent, was either on the point of cutting its dividend and breaking apart, or was a bargain.Perhaps it is that Abu Dhabi has a lot of cash, which it has to invest somewhere. The SWFs are taking over from private equity and mutual funds as the place for companies to go when they seek large slugs of risk capital. Investors in the Gulf states hold between $1,600bn and $2,000bn of foreign financial assets, according to a McKinsey study, and are no longer content docilely to buy bonds.Given this, it makes sense to buy stakes in western banks such as Citigroup and in private equity and hedge funds. Abu Dhabi has acquired stakes in Leon Black’s Apollo Management and the Carlyle Group this year and Dubai International Capital has taken a 9.9 per cent stake in the hedge fund Och-Ziff.These institutions are conduits through which SWF can make other investments. They get first look at deals in emerging markets in which SWFs can invest, either through or alongside them. McKinsey estimates that the ADIA allocates 50 to 60 per cent of its fund to equities and a further 20 per cent to private equity and other alternative assets, so it is hungry for opportunities.One thing it is not is stupidity, which was the parochial explanation bandied about in New York this week for the willingness of Gulf investors to expose themselves to dollar weakness and US subprime mortgages. Those who want to believe that expertise is confined to the west whisper that “the Arabs” have more money than sense.There is little evidence of that. Domestically, it makes sense for the Gulf governments to invest their financial holdings into a variety of assets and to take risk. Many oil-rich states suffer the “resource curse” – the tendency for oil wealth to lead to corruption and lassitude. Gulf states such as the UAE and Qatar are trying to escape the curse by diversifying their economies and assets.They are doing so in a professional manner. As I wrote last week about Dubai, the Gulf states are buying in expertise in the form of expatriate professionals from consulting and financial firms. According to one banker who has worked with the ADIA, it has hired 1,300 professionals from Wall Street and City firms in the past five years. It does not simply take the word of companies and banks that roll up asking for cash.They are also getting better at navigating the sensitivities raised by Arab governments investing in western companies, after the fiasco of DP World having to shed its management of US ports when it acquired P&O last year. The recent Gulf investments in financial institutions, and in AMD, the US chip company, and Sony of Japan have not raised too many hackles.There is no reason why they should – quite the opposite, in fact. Funds such as the ADIA have a clear rationale for taking stakes in US companies and are content not to insist on board representation or strategic control. If these investments work, it will help them to broaden their economies and to avoid the social instability common in oil-dependent countries.Meanwhile, the money spent on energy by US consumers and businesses is flowing back into the country in the form of capital at a time when it is urgently required. Financial crises call for deep-pocketed investors willing to support institutions in return for the chance of outsize returns and the Gulf states have arrived on cue.If all of this capital were locked up in Swiss bank accounts and houses in Hampstead, or deposited solely in Treasury bonds and driving down yields while US financial institutions were starved of support, that would be a reason for Americans truly to worry. As it is, they have the luxury of working out what to think about an influx of Arab equity. Mainly, they ought to be thankful.john.gapper@ft.com
338;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-11-28T19:12:51Z;Silent sovereign wealth;;Want some money? How about $7.5bn, no questions asked? Abu Dhabi Investment Authority’s capital injection to Citigroup is not quite that straightforward. But ADIA is the latest sovereign wealth fund to write a huge cheque for an American company while keeping a low profile. Och-Ziff and Blackstone Group, the alternative asset managers, and the chipmaker AMD have all recently received similar investments.Why pour money into institutions in the land of “no taxation without representation” without more, well, representation? In ADIA’s case, the 11 per cent coupon and low strike price on the equity units must help. The terms are eerily similar to those Prince Alwaleed bin Talal secured when he helped Citi out in 1991. He he also agreed to minimal influence to prevent political backlash.Apart from coming up against protectionism, deploying the funds’ estimated $2,500bn of assets presents practical challenges. Middle Eastern wealth funds have traditionally placed most of their money with third-party managers. This provides political armour, but may also reflect a relative lack of local expertise, as petrodollar flows have outpaced the development of domestic financial centres. Moreover, the funds are typically value investors with horizons that stretch into decades. There is an incentive to put money to work – particularly in brands with big free floats such as Citi – without demanding boardroom clout.The funds may not need formal influence anyway. When the once quiet Prince Alwaleed publicly criticised Citi over rising costs last year, it added to pressure. Simply by dint of sitting high up on the shareholders’ register, wealth funds – like any big investor – can put a fire under management through a well-timed interview or the threat of selling. Power goes with the territory.

An index of house prices recorded a sharp decline while a measure of consumer confidence hit a two-year low.The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent higher at 1,428.23. The move marked a rebound from the previous day’s rout which saw the index briefly turn negative for the year and fall more than 10 per cent from its record high in October – a technical “correction” in stock-market parlance.“I think it’s a technical bounce from a very oversold market condition,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist Avalon Partners, said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent to 12,958.44 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6 per cent to 2,580.80.Financials, healthcare and industrials led gains while energy stocks were weakest as the price of crude oil retreated. Hess fell 2.9 per cent to $66.39 while National Oilwell Varco declined 3.4 per cent to $64.61.A $7.5bn investment in Citigroup from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority dominated market chatter on Tuesday, underscoring the bank’s efforts to shore up its overstretched balance sheet.“The move represents part of the solution applying excess global liquidity to buy depressed and or illiquid assets although it does not represent a silver bullet for Citi let alone the heavily damaged financial intermediation pipeline,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Citi’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $30.32 but still underperformed many of the other leading banks, However volatility in the trading of Citi options fell, as risk perception declined.A range of banking and other financial stocks posted much stronger gains as traders went bargain-hunting in the heavily shorted sector. Lehman Brothers rose 4.3 cent to $59.90 while Morgan Stanley gained 3.9 per cent to $49.80.However, MBIA, the bond insurer, fell 7.9 per cent to $30.46 after it said it was winding down a structured investment vehicle.The financial sector of the S&P has fallen 22.4 per cent so far this year and as the largest group on the index its demise has weighed on the broader market.In contrast, consumer staples, considered a recession-proof sector, have risen
10.3 per cent in 2007.Goldman Sachs on Tuesday lowered its ratings on several sectors of the US stock market, including software, automobiles and airlines. Goldman said the chances of a US recession had increased to 40-45 per cent from 30 per cent a few months ago.Goldman also said it expected the Fed funds rate to bottom out at 3 per cent in the next six to nine months, revised from a previous forecast of 4 per cent.The futures market continued to price in a December quarter-point easing, even as Charles Plosser, Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, played down the odds of another cut.In economic news, the Case-Shiller index of home prices fell a record 4.5 per cent nationally in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier.The S&P homebuilder index fell 1.3 per cent to 291.55 after plummeting 7.2 per cent the previous day. Pulte Homes declined 0.9 per cent to $9.08 in spite of reaffirming its fourth-quarter outlook.A gauge of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level for two years. Stocks dipped briefly after the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dropped to 87.3 this month, from a revised 95.2 in October, substantially worse than expected.Semiconductor stocks were broadly higher on Tuesday but shares in Advanced Micro Devices hit a four-year low, falling 1.2 per cent to $10.15, after an analyst downgraded the stock. Intel rose 3 per cent to $25.11 after JPMorgan raised its earnings estimates.In earnings news, Talbots, the clothing retailer, swung to a $9.4m loss in the third quarter but the results were better than anticipated and the shares rose 6.4 per cent to $14.02."
340;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-11-16T23:39:49Z;Sovereign Wealth Funds to drive hard bargain;;Talk about a masochistic streak. The world’s bulging sovereign wealth funds are not only willing to brave the Washington publicity circus when they buy into US companies, they also seem to have the stomach for serious losses.China Investment Corporation, which bought 10 per cent of Blackstone, has seen the value of its stake slashed by a quarter since the buy-out company went public. Dubai International Capital has watched its shares in hedge fund Och Ziff lose an impressive 12 per cent in three days since its IPO. Even with those role models, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Company is pumping a cool $622m into Advanced Micro Devices, the struggling chipmaker that is locked in a David and Goliath struggle with bigger rival Intel.As the credit crunch saps liquidity from a number of traditional finance sources, the sovereign funds provide an interesting alternative for some US companies. The idea of deep-pocketed overseas investors, who want to diversify their governments’ holdings, is beguiling. Sovereign funds tend to be stable investors, who should not be too panicked about short-term share price volatility. And, so far, they have not tended to demand active board roles, in contrast to more aggressive hedge funds or private equity firms.Such an arrangement is almost perfect for a group that could use more capital, such as AMD. Rather than having to go cap in hand to the equity market, potentially panicking investors about dilution and the state of its balance sheet, the chip company could present the equity injection as a done deal. Its shares barely moved on Friday’s news.But will the sovereign funds step up to the plate if any of America’s bruised financial groups are forced to top up their capital? Or if banks decide they want more firepower to take advantage of distressed opportunities?Such situations look pretty likely.Financial firms from Countrywide, the mortgage lender, to bond insurer Ambac and mega-bank Citigroup have seen their share prices pummelled during the credit market turmoil. One reason is heavy losses, or potential losses, from mortgages and related instruments that could leave deep scars on their balance sheets.That might get worse. Meanwhile, a broader deterioration in credit conditions, or the need to take assets back onto balance sheets, could squeeze even a big institution such as Citi, whose Tier 1 capital ratio is already below target, due largely to acquisitions.Citi has various options for rebuilding capital, and it is a different animal from 15 years ago. But when it was squeezed in the early 1990s, it sold assets and turned to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal for $590m of new capital. He has since enjoyed a great run and remains a key shareholder.With all of the big financial groups keeping a close eye on their balance sheets, they do not necessarily have the financial flexibility to step in and buy each other in case of problems. And the last thing that a capital-constrained financial institution will want is to go out and try raising money from the public markets in today’s panicked environment. Citi, for example, had to pay a whopping 1.9 percentage points over Treasury yields to issue a 10-year bond this week, compared with a spread of 1.18 percentage points three months ago.For brave, cash-rich investors, financial services valuations are starting to look superficially attractive. Countrywide and Ambac are both worth about half book value. Citi, which insists it will not cut its pay-out, offers a punchy 6.4 per cent dividend yield.Financial stocks could well prove to be a classic value trap for the unwary. But the likelihood of a big firm being forced to raise capital will increase if credit markets remain dislocated. And that could offer the bargain of the decade for sovereign funds, or others, willing to step up at short notice.The trouble is, financial companies should not assume sovereign funds will provide easy cash on demand. The Chinese government, for example, is already red-faced due to the falling value of its Blackstone investment.Earlier this year, it was beguiled by a red-hot company, with investors scrambling for a piece of the action, at the peak of the private equity boom. Now, any sovereign wealth fund tempted to open its wallet for a struggling financial company that actually needs money is likely to drive a much harder bargain.thorold.barker@ft.com

Net acquisition of long term securities by foreigners was $5.8bn in September but total net flows were -$14.7bn. The figure is an improvement on August, when capital outflows were In August outflows were $150.7bn, revised from $163bn.Meanwhile US industrial production fell for the first time in five months, down 0.5 per cent in October. Economists were expecting a small increase.Jan Hatzius, economist at Goldman Sachs said total credit losses linked to the housing slump could reach $400bn which would have a “dramatic” impact on leveraged investors.“If leveraged investors see $200 billion of the $400bn aggregate credit loss, they might need to scale back their lending by $2 trillion,” he said.Treasury bond prices were weaker after a sharp rally on Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was up 2 basis points at 3.34 per cent, after a decline from 3.51 per cent on Thursday.“The looming year-end and the increasing pace and threat of mortgage debt downgrades has the Treasury market on the run again,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS. “It’s becoming more clear that the tentacles of the crushing weight of the housing recession are spreading and gaining a tighter grip on the financial markets globally.”Interest rate futures fully price a cut in the Federal funds rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent in December.But Randall Kroszner, Federal Reserve governor, said on Friday that policy makers were unlikely to cut interest rates further.“The current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year, with growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable rate,’’ he said in a speech in New York.European stocks were lower ahead of the open on Wall Street.

AMD received $608m after paying Mubadala’s expenses.AMD shares initially rose 20 cents to $12.90 before trading flat at $12.70 at midday after analysts and a rating agency said the cash injection would still leave AMD facing challenges.The Silicon Valley company reported its fourth consecutive quarter of losses last month in the face of tough competition from larger rival Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker. Intel has a market capitalisation more than 20 times that of AMD.Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said the sale would not affect its B/Negative ratings or outlook on AMD.“The company has a large debt burden and has had substantial negative free cash flows. We view the transaction as favourable to the business, but not likely to affect the underlying competitive challenges facing the company,” it said.AMD reported a consolidated debt of around $5.3bn at the end of September. Its finances were stretched by its biggest acquisition last year – it bought ATI, the Canadian graphics chip company, for $5.4bn.It netted $1.48bn from a 5.75 per cent convertible debt offering in the third quarter and used the proceeds with additional cash to repay a $1.7bn loan used to acquire ATI.Analysts at Citigroup said AMD needed $500m to comfortably manage its business. Before the Abu Dhabi investment, its cash balance would have fallen below $500m in the September quarter next year.They added that AMD’s competitive position in the microprocessor market had improved little, with its Barcelona chip introduced in September lacking the range of speeds of its rival Intel’s chips.AMD said it would use the proceeds from the stake sale for general corporate purposes, including investing in research and development, product innovations and manufacturing excellence.The new investment is the latest high profile investment a sovereign wealth fund.On Wednesday, the US Treasury Department renewed its call on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to develop a list of best practices for sovereign wealth funds to help ensure investments controlled by foreign governments were transparent and made for economic rather than political reasons.The power of sovereign wealth funds - especially the oil-rich funds within the Middle East - is set to increase, according to the IMF’s latest macroeconomic forecasts released this week.With oil prices touching record levels, the fiscal surpluses in the Middle East region will also significantly increase, diverting increasing amounts of liquidity into the global acquisition trail.With regional growth pegged at 6-7 per cent, the main threat to the oil-rich Gulf states remains inflation, which has risen to almost 10 per cent for the region’s oil exporters, compared with 7 per cent last year.In September, Mubadala bought a 7.5 per cent non-voting stake in Carlyle, the US buy-out firm, for $1.35bn. In an unusual move, Carlyle guaranteed a floor to Mubadala’s investment, pledging to compensate the arm of the oil-rich emirate if Carlyle goes public and the share price drops.Mubadala is being advised by Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley. It was established in 2002 with a mandate to acquire strategic holdings in existing companies, both in the United Arab Emirates and overseas.
343;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-11-11T22:54:17Z;Intel launches 45nm microprocessors;;In its biggest product launch of the year, Intel will on Monday launch 13 new microprocessors, taking the PC industry to the next level of miniaturisation.The family of processors known as Penryn are based on circuits just 45 billionths of a metre wide, reduced from the 65 nanometres of the current generation.Penryn also features what Gordon Moore, Intel’s co-founder, has described as one of the biggest transistor advances in 40 years.His “Moore’s Law” in 1965 predicted the number of transistors on a chip would double every 18 months to two years, but the continuous shrinking of circuits is now causing problems.Standard silicon dioxide insulators become too thin at 45nm to prevent leakage of electrons, so the Penryn chips are using a stronger material based on the metal hafnium for the first time. It allows greater transistor density – Penryn chips will have 820m transistors compared with 580m in the previous 65nm generation and the die size will still be smaller.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival, will adopt a similar technology for its 45nm chips, although a launch is not expected until the middle of next year.AMD introduced a new microarchitecture, codenamed Barcelona, in September that made it more competitive with Intel. The bigger company expects to leap ahead again next year with a new microarchitecture of its own, codenamed Nehalem.Last year, it announced what it called a “tick-tock” process of shrinking transistors one year and introducing new chip designs the next. This will mean 32nm chips in 2009 and a further redesign in 2010.“Penryn looks like it will stay ahead of Barcelona for its lifetime,” said Martin Reynolds, analyst with research firm Gartner. “AMD takes about 50 per cent more silicon area to build a Barcelona than Intel takes to do a quad-core Penryn.”Intel will make savings with the smaller size and is promising performance boosts. It says there is a 38 per cent improvement in performance per watt over previous-generation processors. There will be 12 variations on its quad-core Xeon server chips from today, costing up to $1,279, and one $999 dual-core chip for high-end desktop PCs. Cheaper versions for desktop and notebook PCs will be available in the first quarter of 2008.

Its biggest step so far is the HyperSpace platform announced today, in what amounts to a reinvention of the humble role of the BIOS.HyperSpace enhances the BIOS by adding a mini operating system of its own that should provide almost instant access to web browsers, email programs, instant messaging clients and media players that are written for it.Phoenix is using new virtualisation capabilities being built into Intel and AMD chips, which allow such environments to be compartmentalised for greater security.Applications have yet to be developed for the platform and Phoenix could face competition from other software companies, including Microsoft, by the time of HyperSpace’s full launch on notebook PCs in the second half of 2008.But Rich Arnold, chief strategy officer, expects Phoenix will find enough partners to exploit HyperSpace’s instant-on capabilities for people wanting fast access to standard applications while on the go.“We want to be a Blackberry inside the PC that has all the same functionality,” he says.“This will give access to just the applications you really need and probably give you an hour of extra battery life.”
345;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-10-19T00:40:20Z;AMD reports fourth straight loss;;Advanced Micro Devices, the second largest maker of PC microprocessors, on Thursday reported its fourth consecutive quarter of losses as it faced tough competition from its bigger rival, Intel.AMD reported an operating loss of $226m and a net loss of $396m or 71 cents a share on sales worth $1.632bn. Analysts had expected a loss of 61 cents on revenues of $1.52bn. AMD shares which had closed 3 per cent higher at $14.55, put on another 2.5 per cent in after-hours trading.The figures improved on second-quarter sales of $1.378bn and an operating loss of $457m. Gross margins improved to 41 per cent from 33 per cent.Bob Rivet, chief financial officer, said AMD was encouraged by its progress. “We delivered a strong revenue increase, gained 8 percentage points of gross margin and reduced our operating loss by more than half.”The results compared unfavourably with the year-ago quarter when AMD reported a $134m, or 27 cents a share, profit and gross margins were 51.4 per cent.In the past year, AMD has fallen behind Intel in launches and been embroiled in a price war. It has also had to absorb the $5.4bn acquisition of ATI, the Canadian graphics chipmaker.The company said ATI integration, severance payments and asset-impairment hit third-quarter earnings by $120m or 22 cents a share.AMD’s results benefited from strong sales of laptop PCs. Mobile processor unit shipments were 68 per cent higher than a year earlier.On Tuesday, Intel said notebook computer sales had improved worldwide, with revenues up 20 per cent in its Mobility group on the previous quarter.Mr Rivet aimed to break-even in the fourth quarter, but revenues of around $2bn were needed for profitability.
346;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel hits back over quad-core criticism;;Intel on Tuesday hit back at suggestions by its rival AMD that its latest quad-core chips were failing to gain traction with PC users.In a Financial Times interview, Paul Otellini, chief executive, said its chips with “four brains” were priced as a “super-premium product” for desktop PCs.“I’m very happy with our strategy. Quad core will come down [in price] but there’s really no functional reason to do that in markets that don’t need it right now…you don’t want to get too far ahead of the applications in the mainstream,” he said.Consumer software that can take advantage of four brains to perform multiple tasks is limited at present, prompting Advanced Micro Devices to announce on Monday that it would bring out a three-core version of its desktop PC processor in the first quarter of next year. This would come after the launch of its first quad-core desktop chip – the Phenom - in December.Although quad-core has been a natural upgrade for customers wanting to boost the performance of high-end servers, AMD cited industry statistics showing quad-core has only taken up 2 per cent of the desktop PC market since Intel launched its product last November. This compared to a 12 to 15 per cent market share gained by dual-core processors in the first two quarters after their introduction.At Intel’s annual San Francisco developer forum, Mr Otellini said Intel would introduce a new design for its chips in 2008 codenamed Nehalem that would include the launch of a version with eight cores.However, the modular design would allow different configurations of cores, meaning Intel could also produce a chip with an odd number – breaking from the trend of doubling transistors and performance.Mr Otellini announced Intel would launch its next-generation “Penryn” processors on November 12. These take circuit widths to the next level of miniaturisation – from 65 nanometres, or billionths of a metre, to 45. He also showed the first working chips on 32nm – due in 2009.The chief executive announced a deal with the Japanese mobile operator KDDI to develop WiMAX broadband services in Japan. WiMAX, which offers wi-fi like internet connectivity over long distances, would cover 1.3bn people worldwide by 2012, he predicted.Intel has been promoting and investing heavily in WiMAX technology. Mr Otellini said it would be integrated into notebook PCs from the middle of next year in models from Lenovo, Acer, Asus, Panasonic and Toshiba.
347;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-09-18T01:54:46Z;AMD announces chip with three ‘brains’;;Citing poor uptake of the latest desktop quad-core microprocessors from its rival Intel, Advanced Micro Devices said on Monday it would bring out a chip with ‘three brains’ in the new year.The announcement was a surprise, coming just a week after the major launch by AMD of its four-core processor, code-named “Barcelona.”It also goes against the industry tradition of doubling processing power with each new design. Single-brain microprocessors are giving way to dual-core ones, followed by quad-core, with eight cores due next from Intel.But AMD on Monday quoted industry research that showed quad-core chips had only grabbed two per cent of the market since Intel first introduced them last November. In contrast, dual-core chips took 12 to 15 per cent of the market within the first two quarters of their release.“We believe triple-core is the right product at the right time to serve a broad swathe of the market,” said Bob Brewer, head of marketing and strategy for AMD’s PC platforms.“There’s a space for it, it makes sense, it’s naturally going to resonate with consumers.”AMD is still planning to introduce its “Phenom” quad-core processor for desktop PCs in December, but it will follow up with a triple-core version in the first quarter of next year.“If the choice is say $200 for a dual-core [processor] and $400 for a quad-core, then if you can get $300 for a triple-core, it’s like free money,” said Nathan Brookwood, analyst with the Insight64 research firm.AMD told reporters that the choice of single, dual, triple and quad-cores would simplify its product lines for consumers, who were confused by comparisons between clock speeds and the size of memory caches on the chips.Mr Brewer said a triple-core chip would work well for example on a PC where a user was playing a video game such as Bioshock, which utilised two cores, and where an anti-virus programme ran at the same time using the other core.
348;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Brussels is right to restrict dominant groups;;"With the courts due to rule next week on Microsoft’s appeal against the European Commission’s fine, it is no surprise that its defenders have taken to the pages of the Financial Times to plead the company’s case (Alec Burnside and Lars Liebeler, September 5). Their concern that public policy should not stifle competition is well taken. Competition forces companies to innovate or be consigned to the dustbin of history; it forces companies to pass the benefits of economies of scale and cost-cutting on to consumers; it contributes to social mobility by allowing newcomers to start businesses secure in the know-ledge that they will be able to compete on the merits, and not be crushed by muscular incumbents using tactics that have no relation to efficiency.We are indeed in an age when mater­ial progress depends on a rapid rate of innovation. This puts a premium on what the great economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction”. We need what he called “new men” to challenge incumbents, to push new ways of doing things, new products, new ideas.These challengers cannot match a dominant incumbent’s sheer muscle – its ability to coerce customers into refusing to deal with new suppliers, to price its products in a way that makes it impossible for new entrants to make attractive offers to potential customers, to threaten to cut off supplies to any customer who welcomes the salesmen of a new competitor. Only if competition authorities make sure that the race will go to the efficient can we be certain that the economic and social advantages of dynamic capitalism will not be replaced by an ossified economy, in thrall to companies that can bar the door to progress.Neelie Kroes, European competition commissioner, comes to her job from long experience at the top of the private sector. She harbours no animosity towards successful companies that have garnered large market shares merely by building and marketing the best mousetraps. Like US antitrust authorities, she recognises that success is not a punishable offence – if based on efficiency and managerial ingenuity.But she knows, too, that a dominant company, free to adopt anti-competitive practices, will scare off the venture capitalists on which newcomers often rely, and raise the risks and the cost of capital of companies that might have gained a toe-hold in markets dominated by an entrenched rival. This is not to say that the Commission is infallible: it most definitely is not, and over the years I have been among those criticising it for excessive regulatory zeal. But when it comes to dominant companies, it has painfully developed policies, after wide consultation, allowing it to ask the right questions. Those who criticise its decisions concerning Microsoft would do well to consider just how much leeway a dominant company can be given without destroying the competitive process.This brings me to the Commission’s latest controversial action: its investigation of Intel, one that parallels moves taken by authorities in Japan and under consideration by the South Korean authorities and the US’s Federal Trade Commission. Although I do some consulting for Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s competitor, I have not studied the details of the Commission’s complaint against Intel and therefore am in no position to offer a view on the impending litigation. So I confine myself to this observation, one I have been repeating in classrooms and articles for more than 50 years: it is indeed possible for a company with an 80 per cent market share so to structure its pricing schedule as to make it economically imprudent for its customers to choose among competing products based only on their technical attractiveness and price. It is important for authorities to make certain that such practices are nipped in the bud.Although it might seem difficult to distinguish tough competition on the merits from such predatory and exclusionary behaviour, in the real world it is not: company documents, testimony of customers and solid economic analysis can combine to separate hard from illegal competition, no-holds-barred but lawful competition from innovation-stifling anti-competitive practices.Whatever the outcome of the Microsoft appeal, it is to be hoped that the Commission continues to recognise that the competitive race must go to the swift, not the muscular, and that although big is not bad, and a dominant position can indeed be won fairly, dominant companies are capable of anti-competitive actions – even those in high-technology industries.The writer is director of economic policy studies, Hudson Institute, Washington"
349;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-09-10T20:37:54Z;Volatility reigns on Wall Street;;Wall Street closed on a mixed note after volatile trading on Monday, while investors remained uncertain about the size of an expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week.After a brief rally during the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,451.70. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to close at 2,559.11, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 13,127.85.The yield on the two-year note was lower at 3.85 per cent, implying a series of sharp rate cuts in the 5.25 per cent Fed funds rate starting next week, when the Federal Reserve holds its scheduled policy meeting.Several Fed officials delivered speeches on Monday. Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, said financial turmoil had raised risks for the economy and warned: “Monetary policy should not be used to shield investors from losses.”In spite of the rebound in stocks on Monday, the August jobs report, which revealed the first monthly decline in jobs for four years last week, has raised concern among investors that the housing recession is starting to hurt the broader US economy.Anthony Conroy, managing director at BNYConvergEx, said: “Everyone is talking about recession, the payroll number was terrible”.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange rose 5.2 per cent to 27.58, following a 9.3 per cent jump on Friday.Mr Conroy said: “The rise in Vix is telling you that people expect further bad news.”Financial stocks were in the spotlight on Monday and buyers of investment banks emerged during the afternoon as crowded short positions were cut said traders. Among banks in the news, Bear Stearns rose 2 per cent to $107.50 and traded at a high of $109.56. News that Joseph Lewis, a UK billionaire has accumulated a 7 per cent stake boosted the investment bank which has fallen more than 35 per cent this year as problems in the subprime mortgage market have intensified. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Lewis disclosed the purchase of some $860m in stock.Weakness in the sector early on Monday reflected fear among investors that banks would largely have to fund the commitments of investment vehicles that could no longer raise finance from commercial paper investors.Over the past four weeks, the asset-backed commercial paper has shrunk by nearly 20 per cent and this has pushed money market rates well above their usual levels. Although money rates fell slightly on Monday, they remain at elevated levels when compared with the investors’ expectation of rate cuts.Beyond the shrinking CP market, banks also face a $300bn backlog of unsold high-yield loans and bonds.In the worst case scenario, banks could be left holding this debt on their balance sheets if investors resist their overtures.There was a sign that the expected sale of $14bn in loans that would help fund the $26bn buy-out of First Data, the largest US payment processor, appeared closer to fruition.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buy-out firm behind the deal, has reportedly agreed to the loans having covenants that would provide some protection for buyers of the debt. Shares in FDC rose 0.2 per cent to $33.29, below KKR’s agreed purchase price of $34.Analysts at CreditSights said Citigroup had the greatest exposure in dollar terms among the big three US commercial banks to any markdown in the value of their mortgage-related retained interest and leveraged loans. CreditSights had reduced earnings estimates for Citi, JPMorgan and Bank of America, but said the big banks were more insulated to such exposures than other institutions.CreditSights said it considered the big banks as havens of quality in the financial sector, retaining the longer-term advantages of diversity and sizeable deposit funding.Shares in Citigroup fell 0.4 per cent at $45.30, a fall of 18.7 per cent for the year. JPMorgan gained 0.9 per cent to $43.93, paring its decline in 2007 to 9 per cent, while Bank of America fell 0.1 per cent at $48.96, taking its loss for the year to 8.3 per cent.Traders noted buying of put options on Citigroup on Monday. “It is possible they could be aggressively hedging long stock positions, or speculating on continued weakness over the next month,” said analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group. The options expire a day before the bank releases its third-quarter results on October 19. Countrywide declined 5.5 per cent to $17.21, after a slide of 4 per cent on Friday. The largest US mortgage lender plans to cut upwards of 12,000 jobs over the next three months.The beleagured S&P homebuilder index fell 2.9 per cent and has now fallen two-thirds in value from its peak in 2005. While investors waited for a lower Fed funds rate this month, the dollar came under further pressure.The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, extended Friday’s decline below 80 to a fresh 15-year low. For now, the weak dollar has helped boost the appeal of large multinational companies, such as those in the technology sector, analysts said.The Nasdaq 100 index is up 11.6 per cent this year, well ahead of the S&P’s rise of 2.4 per cent.“There is an increasing sense that the global technology ‘cycle’ has become somewhat disconnected from the wider economic cycle,” Lehman Brothers said. “At the foot of the technology food chain, the semiconductor “space” has begun to experience an improvement in revenue growth, just as other measures of global economic activity have been weakening.”Advanced Micro Devices rose 2.6 per cent to $12.94 after it launched its latest server computer chip.Intel reversed a rise to $26.22 in early trade after boosting its sales outlook. The stock fell 0.5 per cent to close at $25.35.

DaimlerChrysler lost 2.7 per cent to €63.88 in spite of comments from Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of the Mercedes owner, that co-operation between it and BMW made sense. BMW fell 1.4 per cent to €42.76.The list of gainers was populated by defensive stocks, with Italian natural gas distributor Snam Rete Gas the leading gainer on the FTSE Eurofirst 300, up 4.8 per cent to €4.498.Philips Electronics firmed 3.1 per cent to €29.25 as the Netherlands consumer electronics group announced plans to double earnings in the next three years, while Infineon Technologies rose 0.4 per cent to €12.05 on reheated rumours that Advanced Micro Devices of the US was ready to bid for US-listed Qimonda, which is 86 per cent owned by the German chipmaker. Sanford Bernstein upgraded Infineon from “market-perform” to “outperform” with a €12.75 target price.Sanofi-Aventis rose 0.1 per cent to €59.69 as investors looked ahead to the French pharmaceuticals group’s research and development day next week. Morgan Stanley said Sanofi-Aventis “would be looking to convey a message of confidence”, while Dresdner Kleinwort reiterated its “buy” recommendation and said the R&D meeting afforded the company a chance to detail what it said would be a strong flow of pipeline data over the next 12 months.“[The R&D day] is an opportunity for management to increase transparency and beat the low expectations regarding release of pivotal data. Any new data could lead to increased forecasts or re-rating from very low valuation levels,” DrK wrote.Nutreco rose 1.8 per cent to €49.41 as Goldman Sachs upgraded the Dutch animal nutrition and fish feed group from “neutral” to “buy and added it to its “conviction buy” list. “Nutreco is well positioned to benefit from its leadership in the growing aquaculture industry. In addition, its specialty feed business exposes it to increased meat protein demand in developing markets. Trading results have demonstrated the company has better than average pricing power, important given current cost pressures in the industry”, Goldman wrote.Club Mediterranee lost 4.1 per cent to €46.94 as Goldman reiterated its “sell” rating on the stock after weaker revenues than expected from the holiday resort operator.
351;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Intel boosts sales outlook;;Intel raised its third-quarter sales guidance on Monday, citing stronger than expected worldwide demand for its chips.The world’s biggest semiconductor maker said it now expected revenues of between $9.4bn and $9.8bn, compared to the previous range of $9.0bn to $9.6bn.Its gross-margin percentage was expected to be in the upper half of the previous range of 52 per cent, plus or minus a couple of points, it said. All other expectations were unchanged.Intel shares were 1 per cent higher at $25.72 in midday trading in New York.The update was unexpected and appeared timed to coincide with the announcement by its rival, Advanced Micro Devices, of its biggest processor launch in four years.AMD will officially unveil its quad-core processor, codenamed Barcelona, at a presentation at George Lucas’s movie studios in San Francisco this evening.The processor for its Opteron range for servers is expected to restore parity or even superiority over Intel after its bigger rival regained a technological edge with a new “Core” microarchitecture.A rollout of Core that began last June was completed last week when Intel introduced its new Xeon quad-core processors for high-end servers.AMD won significant server market share from Intel when it introduced the Opteron processor in 2003, but this has been eroded in recent months.AMD shares have lost 37 per cent this year, while Intel stocks are up 27 per cent.AMD says its “native quad-core” solution of putting four cores on a single chip will have advantages over Intel’s quad-core processor, which came out earlier but is a combination of two dual-core chips.AMD plans to release a version for desktop PCs, called the Phenom, in December.
352;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-08-30T22:12:20Z;Takeover strips shine from star state;;The banking crisis this month in Saxony, south-eastern Germany, has hit the region’s standing as one of the country’s most dynamic economies, business representatives, politicians and analysts have told the Financial Times.Sachsen LB, Saxony’s troubled publicly owned bank, was this week bought by LBBW (Landesbank Baden-Württemberg), the larger Stuttgart-based public Landesbank, for at least €300m ($409m), after Sachsen LB was unable to handle its exposure to volatile credit markets.A political crisis resulting from the takeover intensified on Thursday, as opposition parties in the Saxon parliament said they would use an emergency session of the regional assembly in Dresden today to force the Land government to provide unpublished financial details on why the deal was necessary. Failure to do so would spark a constitutional complaint that would in turn throw the takeover into doubt, the opposition said.Hundreds of international companies have invested in Saxony since German unity in 1990, including electronics giants AMD, Infineon and Hitachi, carmakers Porsche, Volkswagen and BMW, and internet retailer Amazon, making the state the star performer in the otherwise troubled former communist region.The state’s economy grew by 4.1 per cent last year, compared with German-wide growth of 2.7 per cent.Yet according to Wolfram Schnelle, deputy director of the IHK chamber of commerce in Dresden, Saxony’s state capital, the “management mistakes” at Sachsen LB – coming after earlier scandals at the bank – have undermined the international reputation of Saxony’s regional government.“I’m afraid that if I were in the shoes of a potential foreign investor, this evidence that Saxony is an unreliable partner could effect my investment decision,” says Mr Schnelle, whose chamber represents 90,000 companies in the region. Mr Schnelle agrees with suggestions that LBBW may steer investors towards the south-western state of Baden-Württemberg rather than Saxony.Before the takeover, Sachsen LB was owned jointly by the regional government and savings banks and local authorities in Saxony. The bank’s state-appointed senior managers, its supervisory board – also staffed with political appointees – and Saxony’s finance ministry all ignored repeated warning signals that the bank’s speculative investments through its Ireland-based subsidiary were too risky, banking experts say.Karl Nolle, economics spokesman for the Social Democrats, junior partner in Saxony’s Christian Democrat-led government, says the bank behaved “like in a poker game – and such behaviour will certainly impact on our regional economy”.Most immediately, local authorities that had come to rely on Sachsen LB dividend pay-outs would in future lose “an estimated €40m-€50m annually” in revenues for social projects, André Hahn, leader of the opposition Left party told the FT.The LBBW takeover of Sachsen LB marks the demise of east Germany’s only Landesbank, and the abrupt end to a vision among Saxony’s post-unity political fathers to build an independent financial institution in the east.The crisis is a cruel blow for Georg Milbradt, Saxony’s premier, who helped set up the bank in 1992 when he was the state’s finance minister. “The bank was his baby. He’s very emotional about it,” a close political ally told the FT. A former professor of finance from west Germany, Mr Milbradt had now “completely undermined” his reputation in Germany and beyond as a clever economically minded politician, Mr Nolle said.Mr Milbradt, who refused an FT interview request, told a press conference this week that the LBBW takeover of Sachsen LB was “good for Saxony” – a claim derided by SPD and opposition politicians and local business leaders.In contrast, Silicon Saxony, an alliance of large electronics companies in Saxony, played down the likely impact of the bank crisis. Wolfgang Schmid, chairman of the alliance and managing director of Qimonda, an electronics company with 3,000 staff in Saxony, said LBBW “comes from one of Germany’s strongest regions and evidently sees economic opportunities in Saxony”.Joachim Ragnitz, east Germany expert at the Ifo economics institute in Dresden, was sceptical.The western German Landesbanken with eastern operations “have not been especially interested in supporting the eastern German economy”, he says.All change at the topThe entire management board of Sachsen LB was replaced on Thursday, in the wake of the collapse and subsequent takeover of the Saxony Landesbank. Joachim Hoof takes over from Herbert Süss on September 15, the bank said.Mr Hoof is chief executive of the Ostsächsische Sparkasse in Dresden and has been a supervisory board member of Sachsen LB. Mr Süss was leaving at his own request, according to a Sachsen LB statement.The bank also said Yvette Bellavite-Hövermann and Werner Eckert would leave the management board with immediate effect.Wolf-Dieter Ihle, an executive at LBBW, which agreed to buy Sachsen LB last weekend, will replace Stefan Leusder, head of capital markets at the bank, who resigned last week.
353;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Rambus faces antitrust claim from Brussels;;The European Commission has lodged a formal antitrust complaint against Rambus, adding to pressure on the US company over the way it charges for technology that is widely used in the memory chip industry.The action followed a ruling against the company by the Federal Trade Commission in the US last year over a similar complaint. Rambus is appealing against that decision.According to the Commission’s statement of objections, Rambus “engaged in intentional deceptive conduct” in its dealings in the early 1990s with a technology standards-setting body, the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council.The US company hid its plans to patent part of the technology that was eventually put into an industry standard, says the claim.This “patent ambush” had put it in a position to charge “unreasonable royalties” later on as other companies adopted the standard, the Commission added.While seeking to restrict Rambus’s ability to profit from its widely used memory chip technology, however, the European regulators have not sought to overturn its rights completely.“It appears that the European Commission is not taking the most aggressive position it could,” said Daniel Prywes, an attorney at Bryan Cave, which represents the JEDEC.By proposing that Rambus should be forced to charge “reasonable and non-discriminatory” royalties, it has stopped short of trying to push for the disputed technology to be licensed royalty-free to other chipmakers, he added. In the US, the FTC has already set its own rates for Rambus products.“We are studying the statement of objections and plan to respond in due course,” Rambus said. It added that the events covered in the complaint were “largely the same issues examined by a number of US courts”.
354;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-08-14T17:14:14Z;Outsourcing: Back office for the world;;This year, a rumour swept through the global stock markets that the information technology services outsourcing industry was about to witness the deal of the century. According to the speculation, Infosys Technologies, India’s number two outsourcing group, was contemplating buying France’s Capgemini, a deal that would for the first time combine the back office strengths of India with the front-end firepower of a western IT consulting giant.The rumours turned out apparently to be just that, baseless speculation. But the fact they were taken seriously at all is itself testament to the amazing achievements of India’s IT services outsourcing industry.From virtually zero little more than a decade ago, India has emerged as the global hub of the outsourcing industry. The sector has become in the process the most important driver of the country’s economic emergence.“There may be some people who claim they foresaw this happening,” says Lakshmi Narayanan, vice-chairman of Cognizant, the IT outsourcing company, and chairman of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), the sectoral industry body.“But even when we started Cognizant, in 1994, we never thought that in 10 years we’d become a billion dollar company.”India’s IT outsourcing sector has its roots in the liberalisation of the telecom market in the early 1990s, which ushered in a new era of connectivity. Indian companies began to realise the potential of using the country’s large pool of highly educated English language speakers as a back office for the outside world.But it was not until 1997-1998, when the world began relying on India to prepare its computer systems for the millennium bug, that the industry came into its own.This coincided with the frenzied deal-making of the technology bubble era, when Indian entrepreneurs began to emerge on the global stage, such as Sabeer Bhatia, who together with his partner Jack Smith sold hotmail.com to Microsoft in 1997.Today the industry employs 1.6m people and handles everything from the IT functions of retailers such as J Sainsbury in the UK to the computer systems of chip manufacturers such as AMD. Indian companies now also take care of the back office paperwork of almost any type of foreign business or government department imaginable.But as the industry has matured, so have the challenges, among them the supply of talent. Nasscom calculates the country is facing a shortfall of about 500,000 “skilled knowledge workers” by 2010 unless “remedial action” is taken.The shortage has led to wage inflation of between 10 and 15 per cent and higher for more experienced and specialised professionals.The talent issue is so acute, Infosys, for example, is investing $300m in its own training centre in the southern city of Mysore.“You have to see it in the context of growth,” says Nandan Nilekani, executive chairman of Infosys. “It took 30 years for this industry to go from zero to $30bn, and when you look at all these numbers it implies that what took 30 years in the past, will take three years in the future.”Then there is the physical infrastructure of India’s choked cities, such as Bangalore and Mumbai.“Infrastructure growth, in terms of the roads, power and the telecommunications that we are dependent on, while we are seeing some activity, it is not happening fast enough,” says Cognizant’s Mr Narayanan.More threatening, however, is a growing push by the global IT companies to match the Indian outsourcers at their own game.These operators, such as IBM, Accenture, Capgemini and Electronic Data Systems, are setting up their own centres in India and at other low-cost locations around the world.They possess what their much smaller Indian peers sorely lack – strong capabilities in higher-margin consulting. If they can come up to speed at offshore outsourcing, it could be checkmate for the Indian companies.But even as the western companies are starting to look more Indian, so too the Indian outsourcers have begun to quietly change themselves to look more like the multinationals. India’s biggest outsourcing group, Tata Consultancy Services, now has centres as far afield as China, Mexico and Morocco. Today about 9 per cent of its staff are non-Indian.Mr Naryanan predicts that in the longer run, there will be consolidation, leading to five to 10 industry giants from India, Europe and the US. The common thread will be the importance of India in their operations. “They will have development centres all over the place but with significant headcount in India.”
355;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-08-05T16:31:24Z;Full text: Paul Otellini interview;;The FT’s Chris Nuttall interviewed Paul Otellini, chief executive of Intel, at the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Mr Otellini spoke about his 33-year career with the world’s largest chipmaker and the challenges the company faces as it tries to find new growth areas. Here is an edited transcript of his remarks.FT: Originally, you had a choice after business school of either Intel or Advanced Micro Devices, which is kind of ironic now you are such rivals?Paul Otellini:I wanted to work in technology coming out, and this was 1974 and there was a recession in the US. There weren’t many jobs. And there were a number of jobs in banking and Wall Street and financial centres and so forth, and I want – I was intrigued by technology. And it was also nice that technology companies that were on campus were, you know, within 50 miles of San Francisco. So I gravitated to those, and ended up interviewing with three firms that I ended up taking seriously: Fairchild, AMD, and Intel. And ended up coming to Intel.FT: And so why Intel at that time?Paul Otellini:The people. I really liked the people and the quality of – I mean, everyone I met was just bright and energetic, and I liked – I liked the prospects for the company, and so forth. The fact that they, in the midst of what was a tough time for the industry, and I think Intel had its first significant layoff in July of ’74, which was the month I started. And yet they respected their need to hire from college, despite that, which I thought really set a pattern to this date. You know, we still have a very active college program, college recruiting program, despite the fact that we are churning the employee base of the company, because it’s critical to bring that new talent and new knowledge base in, year after year after year. If – even if you’re not growing head count, you still have attrition to replace. And so replacing – I mean, you know, focusing our replacements on college hires to be the kind of the best and the brightest from the best schools in the world, is what we try to do.FT: You mentioned Fairchild, which people talk about the Fair children, how a lot of engineers came out of that. And there’s AMD and Intel. But at the time you joined, I think there was about 3,000 workers, and now there’s 90,000 at Intel. How is it that Intel has been the one, as it were, of those three, that’s kind of come through, in your experience?Paul Otellini:Not to get too much of cliché here, but many of the things that have been written about Andy and Intel are true, which is that we are exceptional at reinventing our company. And part of that is the genetic makeup of what we build. You know, we don’t build products – I was reading a story this morning on the cover of – front page of The Wall Street Journal about Linear Technology, which is, you know, an extremely profitable billion dollar a year semiconductor company in the analog area. And they’re very proud of the fact that some of the products they designed in the ’80s are still being sold. And some of the equipment in their fabs is made by manufacturers that are no longer in business. And I was thinking about how different that is from our business. Our business is such that in the digital – particularly in the microprocessor side of the house, you must constantly reinvent yourself. And you know, we have a – if we do the math, almost – you know, 90 percent of the revenue that we get in December of any year is from products that we weren’t shipping in January of the same year. So if you don’t have this constant upgrade cycle, replacement cycle, built into your mindset, not planned obsolescence, but improvement to the point of driving a need for or a desire for someone to upgrade their computer, then there’s no future. And people could just – you know, it’s kind of like if we stopped building at the Pentium or something, and that was the last product we ever built, computers would not have gone any farther, and people wouldn’t be buying new computers, because they wouldn’t do anything new. So this desire to make things better, to improve, is really built into the DNA of the company. And I think has allowed us to embrace change in a very aggressive fashion, which I think is why we’re – we’ve been able to thrive.FT: You say you’re doing that now, but I guess people look back over the past few years and say that that wasn’t the case, in 2005, that was a fantastic year for you - double-digit growth. But 2006 was a really tough year, and 2007, you seem to be back on song again, as it were. So something went wrong a little along the way in terms of that renewal process. Is that something you can put your finger on now, or care to explain in terms of what happened?Paul Otellini: Yeah. And we’ve talked about this at length in, you know, numerous analysts’ meetings and conference calls and so forth. I don’t really – prefer not to dwell on it, because we’re over it. But the net result is that we had let, in the desktop and server portions of our business, our micro-architecture was just the – kind of the basic construct of the microprocessor – micro-architecture got too old. It was six years old when we finally replaced it. And we had, prior to that, through multiple generations, you know, 8086, 286, 486, Pentium, I, II, III, IV, we have been on a cadence that was much closer to two to three years. And then we embellished that – those architectures with, you know, every two years, an improvement in the silicon technology. So you had this interaction of silicon technology getting better, and micro-architecture getting better. And the two just kind of continued to work in a forthright fashion going – improving the product line.We let the Pentium IV micro-architecture, which was called Net Burst, just live too long. Six years. And as a result, it became, you know, less competitive than it needed to be. And we had competitive issues in desktop and servers. And we – it’s interesting that we made the switch to a new micro-architecture for notebooks with Centrino in 2003, which was begun – a project that was begun in ’99, 2000 timeframe. Late ’99, I guess. And that was a world-beating product, and continues to be the micro-architecture that leads the world in terms of portable electronics.In 2003, we made the decision to move all of our product lines towards this new micro-architecture, which is focused on parallelism as opposed to clock frequency for performance, focused on power efficiency. You know, focused on platform-level features to deliver new uses, new capabilities, to computer users. And those products didn’t come out until just a year ago. A year ago this month the Core products came out, and those came out in desktop and servers. And we’ve done very well since then.Unfortunately, it takes three years to build a state of the art microprocessor nowadays. So we recognised the need to change back in the early part of this – of the 2000 decade. And got it out in 2006. And what you’re seeing now is a very strong public commitment to maintaining that cadence. We call it the tick-tock model, the analogy being a clock, you know, a pendulum, so that every year, there’s something new.This year, for example, we have, in late 2007, we’ll have a new silicon technology, moving to 45 nanometres. Next year, we’ll take that silicon technology and bring in another new micro-architecture. And the year after that, have another new silicon technology. And a year after that, another new micro-architecture.So every year, something substantial gets better. And it gets better in a big way. And either it gets faster, it gets cheaper, it gets smaller, it gets cooler, it gets more power-efficient. And that really brings the might of Intel to bear on delivering a very predictable cadence into the marketplace, which is what our customers and quite frankly our shareholders expect.FT: I guess I had a suspicion that Intel here in the Valley had become a bit set in its ways in terms of you had to go to Israel for the Centrino, and I think it was you that sanctioned that kind of move to develop that. Is that the case? - you’ve got this big machine going, a bit of a dynasty of Intel –Paul Otellini:I think that’s an overstatement. But there is some element of success breeding complacency. By the way, the Net Burst micro-architecture was done in Oregon, not in Santa Clara. But the need to change and the creativity, you know, usually comes from the outside. And what I like very much, and you’ve seen us do, is have multiple teams, not so much in competition with each other, but parallel to each other, being able to implement new ideas. And this model of leapfrogging now, where we use one site to develop a product, and then the next site, you know, jumps on the next product, and the next site. And then they leapfrog each other. They’re building on each other’s cumulative experience.And I’ll be the first one to admit that a little of that – there is some internal competition there. But that’s very healthy. I’d rather compete internally than externally in some of these things, and have these good ideas come from within.FT: Is that something that you’ve felt necessary to do on your watch, to change the ____ – I mean, the two in a box thing seems to – doesn’t seem to be a set thing anymore, and –Paul Otellini:Well, we backed away from that for efficiency reasons. It’s a useful technology in some cases, where you want to balance the skill sets of individuals, or the job is just too big for any one person, or so forth. You can do that. Or you want to use that as a training position. Sometimes you might want a senior and junior person, so that there’s an ability to train.But it had gotten out of hand. And you know, we had hundreds of instances of two in a box. And in some cases, we had two in a box managing one or two people, which is just ludicrous. And those were some of the actions that we went through during ’06, as we went through the restructuring of the company. We went through the spans and levels, kind of a classic analysis of how many layers are there in the company. And we took out two layers. And how – and what’s the average span of control of management, of the given manager. And we have taken that up by two people, which is something like or eight or nine today versus, you know, six to seven before. Things like that. Just basic Management 101.FT: Isn’t that, though, the same dynamic in place when you have the leapfrogging dynamic? So that the team that gets leapfrogged –Paul Otellini:Well, they’re not being – they’re not leapfrogged like in the sense that we’re running two design teams in parallel, and one of them’s going to make it, and one of them be shot. But that’s not the model. The idea is your task is to bring out a product in 2007. Your task is to have it in 2009, 2011. So you – and we want to hit these markets, and these are the feature sets, and so they’re able to build upon – in a cumulative fashion, what was done before them. And yet – and yet there’s not the same team always doing it, so you don’t have the tyranny of complacency built into it.FT:And where does the competition come from, then, in that case? If it’s a time –Paul Otellini:Well, it’s competition for ideas. I mean, in general, I mean, we’re dealing – even though we’re dealing with, you know, chips that have hundreds of millions of transistors, the next transistor is the most expensive and scarce piece of real estate in the world. So what you want to do is, you know, from a cost perspective and a yield perspective, you want to minimize the transistors, but maximize the value of the chip. And so there’s this natural contention between ideas, things you want to embed in silicon, and costs, and efficiency, and – which is the other side of it. And that’s where the healthy tension comes in, which is how do you do things in a more clever fashion? Or how do you distribute features over multiple chips?FT: I guess the other thing you’ve done is bring a kind of necessary focus to the company in terms of – I think Craig Barrett just talked about the creosote bush of how microprocessors was something you just couldn’t get away from, in a way. Everything stuck to that. And tried to get away in terms of mobile phones and that. But you seem to see that as a strength perhaps. I don’t know, that that’s what you do best, and you’re sticking to it, and you’re working – you know, it’s variations on a theme for you, rather than sort of trying to go beyond that. Is that a fair assessment?Paul Otellini:I look at the same situation differently, I think. I’m not sure it’s moving away from. I always looked at communications as an integral part of what was – what I would now articulate as platform, or what we’ve been articulating as platforms in the past. And my view was that a computer that didn’t have an inherent communication capability is pretty useless. And so communications as a business per se never really stuck with me. Communications as an integral feature to a computer, particularly around platform architectures, is absolutely essential to what we’re doing. And so I tend to look at things from sort of the machine or the user backwards, as opposed to the products outwards. And that’s what Centrino was all about - how do we make the laptop more useful? Well, if we give it more performance, we give it longer battery life, we make it communicate seamlessly without wires, and we allow thermals that allow it to make it a smaller, you know, more compact machine, but still very powerful. And those kinds of things take the user first and work backwards to, okay, so what is the – what is the silicon requirement for that? And so in that context, WiFi was an integral element of what Centrino became. And we acquired many companies in the communications area. Not all of them worked out. But what we did acquire as a result of that was a pretty broad experience base in communications architecture of many kinds. We’d always been the leader in Ethernet. So now we are applying that Ethernet leadership to wireless Ethernet, which is what WiFi and WiMax are. And we’re very bullish on both those technologies, as being the means to bring low-cost broadband to the world. I mean, if you think about the world of portable computers, whether it’s your Blackberry, your iPhone, or even your laptop, all of us want to carry that machine around with us in various factors, but you want the power of the internet, in terms of the broadband capability.So to answer your question, I really think what we’re doing is – I mean, the core capabilities of our company are the – our computer architecture, principally around Intel architectures, and silicon technology. And when you think about where much of the world is going, it is around the kinds of products that have both of those intrinsic to them. That is internet access, compute capability, small form factors, or high performance, or low power for cost savings, are all necessary ingredients to build these new classes of machines, whether it’s in computer or in – where the handset world is going, or where the world of consumer electronics is going.And rather than rethink or rewrite the internet, which today runs on X86 machines, between us and our competition. I mean, the entire internet is coded for that base. All the browsers, all the Flash applications, all assume that. Rather than rewrite the internet to a new architecture, it’s a lot easier to – from my perspective, to do derivatives of our architecture to meet new form factor and power requirements, so that they fit inside that particular kind of device that you just pulled out.FT: Financially, does that mean that in terms of margins, we’ll never see those margins you used to make in the old days ever again?Paul Otellini:Well, you know, I don’t want to go there. You know, this – because margin as a percent is a funny thing to focus on. As a CEO, you know, I don’t really focus on percent margins. I focus on growing net income and growing revenue. And you know, if I could sell a billion chips a year with a 60 percent margin, but the selling price was $30, is that a good or bad thing for the company? If it’s on top of our current business, it’s a very good thing. All right? And that’s kind of the notion, is that many of these machines will require that compute capability, but at a much lower price point, because consumer price points are not $1,200. They’re $500, or $300, or $200. Or set top boxes that you lease from your cable company for $29 a month, or whatever they’re going to be, whenever they finish pricing them. Those things have to be relatively cheap, but also relatively high performance.And what we have recently talked about is a new class of devices. We – the first one is now out. It’s not in production yet. We’re demo-ing it. It’ll go into production late this year called Silverthorne. And Silverthorne is an extremely – is a product that was aimed at ultra-low power, ultra-small form factor devices, but still full internet and Intel architecture compatible. And then moving to a system on chip, which is where the ultimate direction of Moore’s law takes you, which is just integration.And I really see us moving into that direction. You know, we’re not abandoning computing by any stretch, and the personal computer is going to be around forever, in my view. At least certainly as far as I can see. But I think that these new classes of devices are going to be additive. And they’ll address low-cost – these kinds of chips can address the needs for ultra-low cost computing in emerging markets, where the disposable income isn’t what it is here. It’s new devices for your living room. New devices that you’re going to carry around. So this really expands the potential market for Intel dramatically.And the good news is that all these markets exist. They just don’t exist with our chips in them, and they don’t exist yet with the internet fully built into them. But the inevitability of the internet being built into the living room devices and the portable devices I think is now given. And when we started talking about this two years ago, there was a lot of scepticism. I think today, between the new generation of set top boxes and the new generation of HD DVD players, and the iPhone kinds of devices, you’re seeing the scepticism just dissolve.FT: So the value there for you is that – both in the proliferation of the market, expansion of the market, but also the volume. Right?Paul Otellini:Exactly. And in our view, at least articulated publicly a year ago, was that it was important for Intel to restructure itself for where these markets were going, because they are going to be, as you correctly discern, lower-priced products, right, than we classically have served today. And so if we’re going to make good margins on those, we have to have a better cost structure.And so what we’ve been focusing on is our cost structure. At the same time, we’re focusing on developing new classes of products, because developing those products and maintaining our old cost structure is not going to get us where we needed to be.FT: Of all these initiatives you’ve started, the emerging markets, health, consumer electronics, and now lately the Ultra Mobile PC , what do you think is the kind of low-hanging fruit there, and what’s kind of showing the most promise as you try and find the next kind of growth area for the processor business?Paul Otellini: I think it’s inevitable that all of the devices that we carry as – that are – that today we would call phones, for the most part will have internet access, and will take on capabilities that are more like computers than like phones. And I think that our architecture, as we bring it down to the power envelopes and the cost envelopes of these portable – ultra-portable devices, and the ability to run any software in the world, in a high performance environment, to give you that user experience that you’d want with these devices, is second to none. And I’m very – I’m extremely bullish on our opportunity in that space.I think that every television in every living room in the world is going to be connected to the internet at some point in time and it’ll happen first in mature countries, and then – and then spread to others. But the internet as a source of content, particularly user-driven content, is emerging. Why should you be beholden to a television network to select what you see when you can see anything you want?When we first introduced Viiv and talked about this concept, which was only – not even two years ago, it was radical. And when we had the studios get up, and NBC and ESPN and [actor and producer] Morgan Freeman and people like that got up, it was viewed as a bit of hype, that the internet would actually provide this kind of premium content. Today, you know, two years into YouTube, two years into Joost, two years into the content wars with the internet, it’s no longer a joke. And you watch what Disney’s doing. I think [chief executive Bob] Iger is really taking a whole different view in terms of how to monetise their content by making it available to a billion viewers on the internet.There’s a billion people that have – that are on the internet today around the world. And within a few years, there’ll be a billion people on the internet on broadband around the world. My favourite story on this is that it took – Titanic is the most watched film in history. Seven hundred million people have seen Titanic. It took seven years for that to happen. You could imagine a scenario where you run – you create a movie on an advertising-based download that a billion people see it in the next day. It’s not out of the question, because if a billion computers are connected, and they’re on televisions, and there’s five people or three people in the living room, the numbers just explode.So we’re not the only people who get this. Hollywood gets this. The content owners get this. So I’m very optimistic about our chances here. Now the industry is a bit more closed than the computer industry, so we have to work with different kinds of players than the traditional computer players. You’ve seen us have a recent announcement with Cable Labs and Comcast on this area.This is an area we – in the not too distant past, Intel and the cable companies were pretty vocal opponents of each other in places like Washington. We’re not out to change our business model. We’re out to help liberate their content and work with them in that context.So you’ll see us working with people like that. You’ll see us working with the Googles of the world, the Microsofts of the world, and increasingly, the overseas folks. That’s the long way of coming around.I think that PCs are likely to have a reasonable growth rate, and they’re closing in on 300m units per year, and likely to continue growing at the low double digits for a while. But there’ll be increasing price pressure as more and more of that market is emerging markets. So then you look to other markets. So the home, particularly the living room. Handheld devices. Health. Are all, we think, very interesting opportunities.And they lever – every one of them – none of them are orthogonal to us. They all lever the core capabilities of Intel.FT: It seems to me that health is the toughest one to crack for you. I haven’t heard much progress there…Paul Otellini:It is the slowest-moving industry in the world. And one indicator of that is of all the major industries in the world, it is the industry least penetrated by IT. I mean, how many times do you – have you gone to a doctor’s office and filled out that same piece of paper? Trust your memory of whether your grandmother had diabetes or not. I mean, how stupid is this?And it’s ripe for productivity, but it’s also slow to change for a whole bunch of reasons having to do with privacy and infrastructure. So this one is going to be a long – a longer hike than some of the others. But I think it’s equally – if you look at it, the current projections in health care, will break the bank of most mature economies if we don’t do something about it. The only thing you can do about it that lowers the cost – forget who pays – that lowers the cost, is apply productivity, information technology, to it.And the basic concept here we have is – we have a chart. It’s called keep left, or shift left. But what the focus is, you want to keep people out of hospitals. You want to keep people out of nursing homes. The best thing to do is keep them healthy and at home for as long as possible. They’re happiest, and it’s the lowest cost.How do you do that? You start working towards detection, and then towards prevention, of diseases. And so, you know, the systems that monitor your health at home without having to go into – and did you take your medications today – without having to go into a doctor’s office, or having tele-medicine capability to optimise the time of the nurse practitioner, are critical.And I think that’s the next – that’s the first crack in this monolith, is to move your own health care to yourself, in terms of managing yourself, and being able to then take advantage of all the information that’s out there.FT: Can I ask a question on this culture, because Intel I guess has been run by a succession of insiders. And how do you keep the – kind of the creative juices flowing if it’s always the insiders that run it, or at least at he top there’s insiders?Paul Otellini:The CEOs have been company people. And I think that’s good, because they know the company, and as long as they perform, that’s the best deal. It provides an aspirational opportunity for your executive. I too can be CEO kind of thing, which you want in any company. It also provides a continuity and a base of history. So as long as you’ve got the willingness or the ability to lead and drive the company in the right direction, that’s a good thing for any company, I think.In the last five years, 53 percent of our hires at grade nine and above, which is kind of the first level, upper middle – middle management and above, have been external hires. And 11 and above, which is senior management, I think it’s about 25 percent in that range. So this whole notion that Intel is comprised entirely at the top of people that were hired in college 30 years ago is wrong. There’s a lot of us that have been here 10, 20 years, but there’s a lot of people that are new.And that influx of people that are new came from – a lot of them came from those acquisitions we made, came from, you know, hiring in key areas, as we moved into new areas of software, into graphics, into new areas in communications. We had to hire people that were experienced in that area, and couldn’t just use the college graduates and stuff.FT: And a very, very quick question on a big topic for the whole of corporate America. This – how big of an opportunity for you is this drive to be greener? More energy efficient? Because you’ve gone that way, but I mean, is that a real demand for customers to do this?Paul Otellini:Well, there’s both a demand and a responsibility. The demand happens internally and externally. And by that I mean we are a large consumer of water, chemicals, electricity, in our factories. And so it is just – not just simple responsibility, but cost effectiveness, to be able to minimise that, and to – you know, in New Mexico, for example, where our fabs use quite a bit of water, we take water from the aquifer. We use it. We clean it. We put it back into the aquifer cleaner than when we get it out. Right? So after it’s finished. And so there’s a dramatic reuse, and we’ve been doing that for many, many years.On the other hand, the products that we build need to consume less and less energy per desk. But we also need to drive the performance up to be able to do more things with computers. And so that’s been the focus of our energy efficiency, particularly – and it’s obvious in handhelds and notebooks. It’s less obvious in the desktop, but it makes sense there. And it’s very obvious in server farms, where electricity costs more than hardware, in many, many instances.So this new generation of products that we’re building, based upon the Core 2 architecture, actually will save more energy as it’s deployed than it took to produce it, which is pretty cool. I mean, you get a one time pop, because you’re replacing older products that consumed a lot of energy. But that’s a great thing. So for a moment in time as a company, we’re actually carbon negative. And it would be great to figure out how to do that on a sustained basis, so that the net output of our factory saves more energy than they consume. And that is something we’re looking at. Is it possible to even do that, as a concept? Over time. Clearly for a few years, we’ve got it, while we’re replacing an older product line with a new one. So I think it is important. It’s important to our customers. It’s important to our economics, and important – it’s important to the world.FT: And there’s money in it for you. I mean, to put it crudely. There is money in it.Paul Otellini:There is money in it on both ends, both the savings of costs, and – but it’s also, you know, the – in many countries, I think you’re going to see it be a requirement for purchase. We’ve already seen lead-free initiatives in Europe, for example. Halide-free initiatives. Those kinds of things.
356;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-08-05T15:51:50Z;Intel’s architect of ever smaller things;;Paul Otellini’s challenge is to make sure the world’s biggest chipmaker gets smaller. Smaller circuitry, smaller power demands, smaller chips for smaller devices – the process is never ending.The pace was set more than 40 years ago by Gordon Moore, one of Mr Otellini’s predecessors as chief executive of Intel. Moore’s Law, as it became known (from an article he wrote in 1965), states that the number of transistors on a chip should double every 18 months to two years.In trying to maintain this pace in the current century, Intel lost its way. It failed to update the design of microprocessors and focused on speed. The crisis came to a head in 2006, one year into Mr Otellini’s tenure as the fifth chief executive since 1968, the year the company was founded. “I prefer not to dwell on it, because we’re over it, but we’d let our micro architecture get too old,” he says.In previous generations Intel would update its designs over two or three years, but the Netburst architecture “was six years old when we finally replaced it”. The architecture also generated too much heat and hogged power.Intel had decided that the clock speed of its processors should be the standard for performance improvements. This allowed its smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices, to gain market share by developing a more advanced architecture and features.By the time Intel finally introduced its Core micro architecture a year ago, earnings were suffering. Three years of double-digit growth in revenues and profits were followed by a 9 per cent decline in sales and a 53 per cent fall in profits in 2006.Mr Otellini carried out the biggest review of the company in more than 20 years. He sold off non-core businesses, eliminated more than 1,000 management posts and cut a global workforce of more than 102,500 by 12 per cent.It was perhaps the worst year for Intel since 1974, when Mr Otellini, now 56, joined the company. “I think Intel had its first significant lay-offs in July of 1974, which was the month I started,” he says.That year the US was in recession. “I liked the fact that during a tough time for the industry they respected their need to hire from college, which has really set a pattern to this date.”Compared with his gruff and outgoing predecessor Craig Barrett, Mr Otellini seems shy, sensitive and thoughtful. He is slightly nervous when speaking in public and reveals few personal details. A lifelong San Franciscan, he is a graduate of the city’s university, a member of the board of its symphony orchestra and a keen sailor.He is the first Intel chief executive not to be trained as an engineer, but has always been intrigued by technology. “It was also nice that the technology companies that were on campus were within 50 miles of San Francisco, so I gravitated to those.”He had a choice between jobs at Intel, Fairchild Semiconductor and AMD, which was to emerge as Intel’s big rival. He chose Intel because he liked the people. “Everyone I met was just bright and energetic and I liked the prospects for the company.”Intel grew from 3,000 people when he joined to 100,000-plus last year. Its share of the global market for the microprocessors that power computers is 80 per cent.Mr Otellini is speaking at Intel’s Santa Clara headquarters in Silicon Valley. As in all its offices, a cubicle culture prevails (see below). Viewed from above, the corridors and partitions resemble the circuit paths etched on its chips, data routes that, by the end of this year, will have been narrowed to widths of just 45 nano­metres, or billionths of a metre.“If we do the math, almost 90 per cent of the revenue that we get in December of any year is from products that we weren’t shipping in January,” Mr Otellini says.Intel has restored its metronome-like pace of development, the “tick-tock model”, he calls it, “the analogy being a clock or pendulum”. This year Intel is swinging to 45-nanometre chips. In 2008 it will introduce a new microprocessor architecture, followed in 2009 by the next level of miniaturisation – 32 nanometres – and another new design in 2010.He first set the company back on this path when, as head of the microprocessor business, he turned to Intel’s Israeli outpost for the development of what became the Centrino platform for notebooks.“There is some element of success breeding complacency,” he says of the Netburst era. “The need to change, and the creativity, usually comes from outside.”Centrino balanced power-saving against performance and led to the development of an architecture based on “parallelism” – two or more cores, or individual processing units, working together on the same chip. More tasks could be carried out at lower clock speeds and temperatures.Chip architecture is again mirrored in the company itself. Parallel teams work on each new generation of products. These leapfrog one another, as one team creates one generation, hands over to the next and then picks up the development cycle again. “I’ll be the first one to admit that there is some internal competition there, but that’s very healthy,” he says.The chief executive has also got rid of the Intel tradition of “two in a box” – two executives helping each other to manage a department. “In some cases, we had two in a box managing one or two people, which is just ludicrous.”Taking out layers of management has reduced costs, which Mr Otellini sees as essential in a world in which smaller chips on smaller devices means smaller margins. Chips for consumer applications are sold at lower cost, particularly in emerging markets.He sees growth in a new class of devices – ultra-mobile PCs, mobile internet devices and consumer electronics gadgets that will use a future chip codenamed Silver­thorne. It offers ultra-low power from an ultra-small chip but is still internet-enabled.“We’re not abandoning computing. The personal computer is going to be around forever, in my view. But I think that these new classes of devices are going to be additive,” he says.“These kinds of chips can address the needs for ultra-low-cost computing in emerging markets, new devices for living rooms. So this expands the potential market for Intel dramatically.”LIFE OUTSIDE THE BOX: SQUARING UP TO THE CUBICLE CULTUREPaul Otellini insists that plans were under way to modernise Intel’s office space well before the company’s cubicle culture was satirised on US television.Conan O’Brien filmed a visit to Intel this year for his late-night talk show. He mockingly praised Intel for creating a working environment where people could feel there was no individuality, no hope and no sense that life had possibilities.He admired the imaginative colour scheme of grey, grey and greyish blue and likened signs on columns such as B9 and H10, defining sections of a maze of partitions, to a carpark.All Intel employees, even the chief executive, work in cubicles. Mr Otellini has a corner cubicle next to the windows. He does not like the fact that engineers two cubicles apart send an e-mail rather than get up and talk.“The whole nature of sitting down and hashing out ideas and collaborating is a bit stymied by the construct of the cubicles,” he says. He is promising more common spaces and more colour, though not like that in the 1970s.“[The cubicles] were ugly orange. I remember, when they first put them in, they looked cool. But by the time you got to 1985, they looked pretty bad. And at the time, grey was très cool. I mean, how neutral can you get?”Now, he says, it’s time to move on. “Modern office furniture is much more configurable, so you can do things that meet an individual department’s need.”Read a transcript of this interview at www.ft.com/otellini
357;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Brussels questions Intel’s tactics;;The European Commission on Friday accused Intel of abusing its dominant position in PC microprocessors, alleging it was offering its chips at below cost and inducing computer makers not to use those of Advanced Micro Devices.The Commission was providing the first details of charges sent to Intel on Thursday in a statement of objections – the result of a seven-year investigation of the world’s biggest chipmaker.Intel has until October 8 to respond formally. If it cannot convince the commission that its business practices were legal, it could face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its revenues, or more than $3.5bn, based on 2006 sales of $35.4bn.The Silicon Valley company is alleged to have given substantial rebates to PC makers, as long as they bought the majority of their central processing units from Intel.The Commission also alleged that Intel had made payments to induce a manufacturer to delay or cancel a product line featuring an AMD processor.To compete with AMD in the network server market, Intel is alleged to have offered microprocessors at below cost.A spokesman for the European Commission said: “The rebates offered by Intel were of such a quantity, of such an amount, that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost and we think that would be very bad for competition and bad for consumers who would be buying computers.”Bruce Sewell, Intel general counsel, said the Commission’s case was based on a complaint from a competitor rather than customers or consumers.“We are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that Intel’s conduct has been lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,” he said.The Commission’s allegations relate to practices in a three-year period starting in 2003 and stem from a drawn-out investigation that began with an AMD complaint in 2000.“We’ve needed the time to get the supplementary information, the information from all parties concerned, to be able to send this statement of objections,” the Commission said.Mr Sewell said the allegations related to the past and that both Intel and AMD were now using price and discounts to compete.Intel had an 81 per cent share of the global microprocessor market in the first half of this year, compared with 11 per cent for AMD and 8 per cent for other manufacturers, according to iSuppli, a research firm.Antitrust officials have also been tied up with investigations of the effect of Microsoft’s dominant Windows operating system during the span of the Intel inquiry, as well as looking at another US company, Qualcomm, and its dominance of a cellphone standard.Intel will be closely watching a ruling, due in September, on Microsoft’s appeal against a €500m fine imposed in 2004.
358;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-07-26T23:22:51Z;Brussels charges Intel with market abuse;;The European Commission has issued formal charges against Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, alleging it has abused its dominant market position with respect to its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices.Antitrust regulators in Brussels have sent Intel a statement of objection outlining the charges, according to a person close to the investigation.Details have not been revealed but they are expected to include allegations that it undermined competition by offering rebates to PC makers that effectively shut out AMD from the local microprocessor market.It has also faced accusations that it paid retailers not to stock computers using AMD chips and engaged in “predatory pricing” tactics.Intel could face fines worth up to 10 per cent of its annual global revenues. The company, under chief executive Paul Otellini, reported sales of $35.4bn in 2006, which would equate to a possible fine of more than $3.5bn.An Intel spokesman declined to comment on Thursday while a spokesman for AMD said it had not received any official word yet on the charges from Brussels, but added: “We have always applauded governmental decisions to bring full and fair competition to the global microprocessor market.”AMD shares rose 1 per cent in after-hours trading on the news to $14.89, while Intel’s remained flat.The charges are the culmination of a slow-moving seven-year investigation, prompted by a complaint by AMD in 2000.The inquiry was almost abandoned in 2002 but gained fresh impetus two years later when the Commission requested more information. In July 2005, investigators carried out raids on offices of Intel and customers in Europe. Formal charges were expected by the end of last year, but the investigation and consideration of the evidence was spun out further.Japan’s Fair Trade Commission ruled in 2005 that Intel had abused its monopoly power in that country and its counterpart in South Korea carried out raids last year as part of its own investigation into alleged anti-competitive behaviour. That inquiry continues.AMD launched litigation in the US two years ago, but a judge dismissed major portions of the case last September, saying it was outside US jurisdiction. He put back a trial date until 2009.
359;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;AMD loses $600m but shares rise 5%;;Advanced Micro Devices reported a $600m quarterly loss on Thursday as it reeled from a bruising price war with Intel, its bigger rival.Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 5 per cent in after-hours trading, however, as investors reacted to news that capital spending would be lower than expected this year.Robert Rivet, chief financial officer, said: “While we made solid progress in the second quarter…we must improve our financial results. We continue to focus on realigning our business model and reducing our capital expenditures.”AMD’s $600m loss amounted to $1.09 a share, on sales of $1.4bn. That compared with a profit of $88.9m on sales of 1.22bn in the same period last year. Excluding special charges, most analysts had been expecting a net loss of 82 cents a share.The company said the quarter’s loss included a one-off charge of $130m related to the acquisition of ATI, a rival chipmaker AMD bought for $5.4bn in cash and stock in October.Just 18 months ago AMD was grabbing market share from Intel as computer makers such as Dell moved to introduce AMD microprocessors into product lines. But its performance suffered after Intel slashed prices.AMD shares rose 4.9 per cent to $15.78 in after-hours trading. The company now expects capital spending to total $1.8bn this year, $200m less than previous estimates.
360;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-07-19T21:24:52Z;S&P 500, Dow close at all-time high;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as positive sentiment in the technology sector helped investors shrug off fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market.The bullish mood propelled the S&P 500 to a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 for the first time.Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers that losses from the subprime mortgage market could range between $50bn and $100bn.Leading the major benchmarks was the Nasdaq Composite, with a gain of 0.8 per cent to 2,720.04. One boost for the tech sector was a 12.5 per cent surge to $30.06 in Juniper Networks shares after the networking equipment maker swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, in the expectation that strong sales growth would boost operating margins.Cisco rose 1.7 per cent to $29.94 and had set a 52-week high of $30.So far this year, the Nasdaq’s gain of 12.6 per cent has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 16.8 per cent. In a bull market, the more volatile technology stocks led the way as they enable investors to reap higher returns.“It’s no surprise that high beta stocks are doing well in this current rally,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “People who have missed some of the rally, and are forced to chase returns, can get back in the race by buying high beta names.”Another factor in favour of the tech sector is that international sales form a larger proportion of total sales, say analysts. A faster growing global economy in conjunction with a sharply weaker dollar is a fillip for the sector and multinational blue chip companies.But a sour note for techs was struck by Ebay, which fell 1.6 per cent to $33.50, after the online auctioneer posted a 50 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but left its outlook for 2007 unchanged. Investors had hoped for a rise in guidance and also focused on lower global listings.After the closing bell Google reported a 28 per cent rise in second quarter profits that missed estimates as higher costs eroded better-than-expected revenue growth. Google slumped more than 6 per cent in post-market trade.Also after the close, Microsoft met earnings estimates and raised guidance. Microsoft initially rallied in after-hours action, following a gain of 1.9 per cent to $31.51 in regular trade.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss in the second quarter as a rise in sales for the chip maker was offset by lower microprocessor prices and costs associated with the $5.6bn purchase of ATI Technologies, a graphics chip maker. In after-hours trade, the stock rallied further after a rise of 2.1 per cent to $15.87 at the closing bell.The enthusiasm for tech stocks lifted the broad market into record territory. The S&P rose 0.45 per cent to 1,553.07 a new record high. Among the major sectors, utilities, technology and energy led gains, while health care and financials declined.Among the financials, Bank of America said quarterly earnings rose 5 per cent with an increase in the provision for credit losses. BofA has now set aside $1.81bn to cover these losses, up from $1.01bn in the second quarter of 2006. Shares in BofA fell 0.2 per cent to $49.27.PNC Financial, a mid-Atlantic regional bank, said quarterly earnings expanded 11 per cent and was also buying Sterling Financial for $565m, or $19 per share. The stock slipped 2.5 per cent to $71.37.Shares in MF Global fell on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MF closed at $27.55, after the financial firm had listed at $30 a share – lower than the expected range of $36 to $39, traders said.The American Stock Exchange Broker-Dealer index fell 0.75 per cent.Another financial stock in the news was American Home Mortgage Investment. The stock plunged 20.8 per cent to $10.76 as subprime worries among investors intensified and the company did not comment on the sharp decline.Blue chips rallied, led by IBM, and the DJIA rose 0.6 per cent to close at 14,000.41.In earnings news, IBM reported a 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit, and raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock gained 4.3 per cent to $115.86 and had set a new five-year high of $116.48.Another Dow stock, Honeywell, posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating estimates. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $60.98 and also reached a seven-year high of $61.90 earlier in the day. The company raised guidance for 2007 and also authorised the buyback of an additional $3bn in stock.Shares in Foot Locker surged 8.6 per cent to $22.71, after the company said it would consider putting itself up for sale. The shoe retailer recently failed to buy rival Genesco.In other earnings, Motorola recorded a quarterly loss amid lower revenue from weak phone sales. Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $18.22.Union Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The railroad slid 0.1 per cent to $125.74.Hershey reported a 96 per cent drop in profits for the past quarter, as the confectionary maker invested in transforming its production lines. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $48.45.Harley Davidson reported a 19 per cent rise in profit and reaffirmed guidance for 2007. But domestic sales of motorcycles fell and the stock slid 2.9 per cent to $59.37.Investors will focus on earnings from two DJIA stocks, Citigroup and Caterpillar on Friday. Citi fell 0.9 per cent to $51.14, while Cat rose 0.9 per cent to $86.42 on Thursday.In economic news on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed survey reported a drop to 9.2 in July from a reading of 18 in June. The six-month outlook index rose 30.4 in July from a reading of 16.7 in June.Economists at Bear Stearns said: “This is a stronger report than suggested by the headline sentiment index.”Later this afternoon the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in June are released.Earlier in the day, leading indicators for June fell 0.3 per cent, more than a forecast decline of 0.1 per cent.“Housing continues to weigh, a theme that ties in with the concerns Bernanke stated yesterday [Wednesday],” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “However, despite the decline, the trend in the overall index appears to have stabilised after declining early 2006 to a cyclical low in early 2007.”Stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but did pare the worst of their earlier losses.
361;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-07-19T14:28:47Z;Wall St lower on poor earnings;;A combination of disappointing earnings and guidance, renewed worries over financials and cautious remarks on the outlook for the economy from Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, roiled Wall Street on Wednesday.Stocks pared some of their earlier losses late in the day, and the S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,546.19. Just three of the main 10 sectors in the index rose. Energy stocks were boosted by oil prices to 11-month highs and utilities also rose as Treasury bond yields fell on safe haven buying amid renewed jitters over subprime mortgages and hedge fund exposure.Leading the declines among the S&P sectors were financials, technology and telecoms.Financials floundered after Bear Stearns said late on Tuesday that subprime mortgage-related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless.Bear’s stock fell 0.4 per cent to $139.34. The American stock exchange’s Broker-Dealer index closed 1.7 per cent lower. Notable decliners included Merrill Lynch, down 3.3 per cent at $83.40, Lehman Brothers, 2 per cent lower at $71.57, while Morgan Stanley fell 2.8 per cent to $70.85.JPMorgan said its second-quarter net income rose 20 per cent, but noted weakness in regional banking and car finance. The stock closed 2.4 per cent lower at $48.74.In prepared remarks before Congress, Mr Bernanke stressed concerns over inflation and the housing market and the Fed lowered its growth forecast for the US economy for 2007 and 2008.“There is no doubt that housing is a headwind for the economy,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. “Bernanke’s testimony is fairly well balanced, but based on the June consumer price index [report] there are concerns that service sector inflation is not coming down.”The combination of a lower growth forecast and continued concern over inflation compounded the bearish open for stocks yesterday said traders.Higher oil prices were also on the radar screen of investors.“The market has broadly overlooked the recent rise in oil, but with sentiment turning negative, that has also become an issue,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The rise in oil prices during the past month does not bode well for future inflation numbers.”On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to close at 2,699.49 and led the major benchmarks lower. Sentiment for technology stocks was hit hard after Intel and Yahoo disappointed investors with their latest results.Intel posted better-than-forecast earnings, but its gross margin fell and the stock was 4.8 per cent lower at $25.06, after the chip maker had set a 52-week high of $26.52 on Tuesday.Yahoo’s quarterly results met estimates but guidance for the third quarter was lowered and the stock was off 4.8 per cent at $26.20.After the closing bell on Wednesday, IBM’s posted a rise of 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit and raised guidance for earnings in 2007. The stock set a 52-week high of $111.88 before the report and was trading higher in after-hours activity.Earnings after the bell from eBay also beat estimates and the stock rallied in after-hours trade, following a decline of 0.6 per cent to $34.05 in regular trade. Google reports on Thursday.Blue chips were hit by a number of earnings reports on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent at 13,918.22.Mr Pado said: “The market had enjoyed a big run up ahead of earnings results and as a result we were bound to see some pullback once the numbers arrived.”An example of this was the performance of United Technologies which reported a second-quarter net income rise of 4 per cent from the same quarter last year, beating estimates. UTX fell 1.7 per cent to $75.56, after a rise of around 6 per cent in the past week.David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management said equities were suffering “bull market fatigue” after their recent record run. “Provided that earnings growth is sustained, valuation concerns can probably be put to one side for now.”A bright spot for earnings was Humana as the health insurer reported better than expected earnings and raised its 2007 earnings outlook. The stock rose 9.8 per cent to $68.31.In contrast, Altria said second-quarter income fell more than 18 per cent. The stock slid 1.4 per cent to $70.30 as full-year guidance was lowered.Pfizer’s quarterly profit fell 48 per cent, hurt by restructuring costs and weaker-than-expected drug sales. Pifzer did endorse its guidance for 2007 and 2008 and the stock fell 3.2 per cent to $25.13.Macy’s, the department store, surged 7.6 per cent to $43.09, amid talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, could make a $24bn buy-out.Earnings from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York and Bank of America are due on Thursday, while Dow stock, Honeywell also reports.In economic news on Wednesday, the consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in June. The core rate excluding food and energy rose 0.2 per cent, and was up from a 0.1 per cent rise in May. Economists had expected a 0.1 rise in headline CPI, with a 0.2 per cent core rate forecast.The overall CPI rose 2.7 per cent over the past year, while core CPI was up 2.2 per cent, steady with the annualised rate for May.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: “Core inflation has behaved considerably better in the past few months and the near-term worries have receded, but the risks of too-high inflation remain and will keep the Fed uneasy.“In his prepared remarks before lawmakers, Mr Bernanke said the Fed expected core inflation to remain in a range of 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 2007, and then fall to a band of 1.75 per cent to 2.00 per cent in 2008.“Whether core inflation, at 2.2 per cent year-over-year, is contained or entrenched will remain a debate,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Mr Stanley said: “If the economy strengthens in the second half, as we expect, then core inflation will likely become a bigger concern, ultimately forcing the Fed to hike rates at some point, either late this year or in the first half of 2008.”Meanwhile, housing starts rose 2.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1.467m annual rate in June, reversing some of the 3.4 per cent slide in May. However the May starts were revised lower from an original decline of 2.1 per cent.
362;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-07-16T16:40:25Z;US stocks surge to record highs;;Wall Street advanced further into record territory on Monday, as investors adopted a bullish outlook ahead of this week’s swathe of earnings reports.“A list of positive factors are in place for a continuation of the current stock market rally,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. He cited “respectable jobs data, tame core inflation, better-than-expected earnings, attractive valuation, subdued sentiment, and an abundance of cash washing around globally.”At midday, the S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent at 1,555.54 and the broad barometer had set a new intra-day record of 1,555.74. Among the main S&P sectors, telecom, industrial and financial stocks were firmer, while energy and utilities were in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,710.95, its highest level since February 2001.Leading the bullish charge by a notable margin on Monday were bluechips. At midday the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent higher at 13,978.70 and the index had set a new intra-day record high of 13,982.12.Many of the Dow’s 30 components have a strong international presence and the buoyant global economy and a weak dollar are expected to boost their quarterly bottom lines.“Companies with higher international exposure are likely to show better earnings growth which will result in better performance for their stocks,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.The second quarter reporting season kicks into a higher gear on Tuesday, and this week will see many high profile companies in the banking, pharmaceutical and technology sectors reporting. Companies due to report their latest quarterly results on Tuesday include Johnson & Johnson, Yahoo, Intel, and Merrill Lynch.Among the groups reporting on Wednesday are Dow constituents United Technologies, which set an all-time high of $76.98 on Monday, JP Morgan and Pfizer, together with Wells Fargo and eBay.Google, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York, Bank of America are due to report on Thursday along with two Dow stocks, IBM – which reached a five year high of $109.88 on Monday – and Honeywell. Citigroup and Caterpillar, which set an all-time high of $86.49 on Monday, complete this week’s bluechip earnings line-up on Friday.With many banks reporting this week, investors are likely to focus on any evidence of problems in the mortgage market hurting their profits.”Continued weakness in mortgage banking, deteriorating credit quality, and a challenging yield curve for most of the quarter make negative earnings surprises more likely than results materially above expectations,” said strategists at Barclays Capital.The S&P financials sector has pared recent losses and on Monday the group entered positive territory for the year to date.As earnings beckon, technology stocks could extend their strong gains this year. Both Apple and Google set new record highs on Monday of $139.98 and $558.58 respectively. Analysts at Bespoke noted that technology leads other sectors in terms of international sales as a percentage of total sales.“It could be a good quarter for large cap tech, which explains the performance recently in stocks like Intel and Cisco,” said Bespoke.Citigroup said the 2008 consensus earnings estimates for Intel are low and that the chip maker “will accelerate its current low level of stock buyback activity.” The bank raised its price target for Intel to $31 from $27. The stock was a fraction higher at $25.98 on Monday, and is up more than 28 per cent so far this year.In deal news on Monday, IHOP, the restaurant chain operator, said it would buy Applebee’s for about $1.9bn or $25.50 a share. Applebee’s was up 1.9 per cent at $24.84, while IHOP surged 9 per cent to $61.29.Verizon was up 2.3 per cent at $42.70 at midday after the Financial Times’ Alphaville blog reported that Vodafone had considered a $160bn takeover of the US telecom group. Vodafone said it had no plans for such a deal.In earnings news, Mattel reported a 15 per cent rise in second-quarter profit. Global sales of barbie dolls rose 6 per cent and that helped offset slower growth in the U.S. The stock was up 3.1 per cent at $27.35.Eaton, the diversified manufacturer rose 4.6 per cent to $102.56. The company raised its earnings guidance after its second quarter profit fell 3 per cent, beating estimates.Last week, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,552.50 and also set a new intra-day record high of 1,555.10 on Friday. Traders believe some investors have been hurt by the recent rally in stocks and that the pain of losses could push prices higher.Late on Friday, data on short positions, sales of stock by speculators, from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicated the largest holding of bearish positions on the S&P since March 2004.The Nasdaq rose 0.2 per cent to close at 2,707 on Friday, its highest level since February 2001.Also this week, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and then the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.“We expect a rather dull discussion of the economy and policy outlook,” said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Bernanke will likely face tough questioning on regulation of the mortgage industry and may give an update on the Fed’s communication strategy.”The Fed chairman may also seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained, traders said.“Subprime and wider concerns over credit will not go away, however,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of fixed income strategy at Societe Generale. “The Jekyll and Hyde approach of the market to risk persists with emerging market, equities and FX carry trades doing very well, while credit has yet to recover much.“Economic reports due next week include the June producer price index and industrial production on Tuesday. Housing starts and consumer prices for June are due on Wednesday. Leading indicators and the Philadelphia Fed survey arrive on Thursday, followed by the Fed meeting minutes from last month.
363;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-06-22T20:31:51Z;Blackstone fever fails to lift Wall St;;"Wall Street posted sharp losses this week as investors worried about
elevated long-term bond yields, higher oil prices and the exposure of financial stocks to hedge funds.Not even the successful trading debut for Blackstone, the first private equity firm to list on an exchange, could dispel the bearish gloom.Blackstone began trading at $36.45 a share, about 17 per cent higher than its placement price of $31. The stock closed at $35.06.As a tough week ebbed to a close, the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 1,502.66 for a decline of 2 per cent since Monday.Investors on Friday were also mindful that the S&P 500 index and other benchmarks faced a shake-up in their composition. The S&P removed three stocks, PMC Sierra, ADC Telecom and Sanmina-SCI - all technology companies. As from next week, they will be replaced by Tyco Electronics and Covidien, two companies spun off by Tyco, while Discover Financial Services, a spin-off from Morgan Stanley, will also join the S&P.The Russell indexes were also rebalanced on Friday, and that sparked some choppy trading ahead of the close said traders.Among the leading S&P sector groups that led losses, utilities was down 4.4 per cent, healthcare was lower by 3 per cent and financials was off 2.9 per cent for the week.Real estate investment trusts and homebuilders also fell sharply this week.The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to close at 2,588.96 yesterday for a fall of 1.4 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 13,360.26 for a slide of 2 per cent this week.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were hurt as the yield on the 10-year bond consolidated near recent highs.Of greater concern for the financial sector, however, was a shake-out at two mortgage hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns.Investors wondered if the episode marked the start of further problems as various banks sought to sell collateral and limit their losses to the hedge funds.Analysts at S&P said: “Recent developments underscore the market and credit risks borne by the major broker dealers as a consequence of their hedge fund investments. This is a sector-wide phenomenon that warrants close scrutiny.”Late on Friday, Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $143.75, for a loss of 4.2 per cent this week. The American stock exchange’s Broker/Dealer index declined 1.8 per cent on Friday, for a loss of 3.6 per cent this week.The bearish mood in stocks was also a function of concern over earnings and the economy.“The market is currently a little nerve-wrecking for investors,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.He said investors were worried that it was becoming harder for the economy to reflect a “goldilocks mix” whereby growth slows to stall inflation but remains strong enough to keep corporate profit humming along.Meanwhile, more professional investors are betting that stocks will suffer the summer blues.For the month of June, the number of short-selling positions on NYSE rose 6 per cent to 12.47bn shares, a record high.One bright spot this week was a rebound in deal activity after a drought early last week.Nuveen Investments agreed to a $5.75bn private equity buy-out and shares in the investment manager jumped 15.1 per cent to $62.83.Genesco rose 6 er cent to $52.57 this week after Finish Line, down 19.8 per cent at $10.13, agreed to acquire the footwear and accessories retailer.Luxottica rose 3.9 per cent at $37.15 as the Italian eyeware maker bought Oakley, a US rival, in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share.

364;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-06-21T21:51:48Z;Wall St up in volatile session;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday after an uncertain start in equities reflected a similar pattern in other markets, suggesting investors are starting to seek a higher risk premium across asset classes.“The volatility we are seeing across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities is not of the run-for-the-door type – more a reduction in overall risk,’’ said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos.He said a tweaking of positions by equity hedge funds with long/short strategies had the potential to create choppy trade in the overall market.The S&P 500 index rose 0.6 per cent to close at 1,522.19 – rebounding from a low of 1,504.75 earlier in the day.A survey of regional manufacturing activity by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve was much stronger than expected and sparked a recovery in stocks at midday.Within the S&P, energy stocks rebounded from a sharp loss on Wednesday but financials lagged among the 10 leading sectors. The rebound in financials on Thursday, left the sector less than 1 per cent higher for the year.Shares in Bear Stearns bounced back from a low of $140.44 early in the day and gained 1.8 per cent to $145.81, as investors hoped that troubles at two of its hedge funds were contained.Analysts said wider credit spreads still warranted being watched by the equity market.“The widely advertised liquidation of hedge funds invested in the subprime mortgage market is causing some ripples in the credit markets and credit spreads are widening,” said Tony Crescenzi, bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.Technology led gains on Thursday, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.65 per cent to 2,616.96, boosted in part by a 2.8 per cent rally in the semiconductor sector. Advanced Micro Devices was upgraded and the chipmaker rose 7.9 per cent to $14.72.Blue chips also rebounded from early losses and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,545.84.In spite of worries about the recent rise in rates, deal activity continued at a brisk pace on Thursday.Luxottica, the Italian eyewear maker bought Oakley, a US rival in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share.

365;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-30T09:30:10Z;What’s new: New blooms in the laptop jungle;;Spoilt for choice in the laptop jungle? Well, the choice just got harder with a clutch of new notebooks from Dell, including its long-awaited entry into the tablet PC market.Until now, Dell has distributed third-party tablet PCs. It hopes the launch of the Dell Latitude XT will expand the appeal of tablet PCs beyond their current niche of vertical markets.Other new laptops include an ultra-portable model, the Latitude D430, two Intel-based models, the Dell 630 and D830, and the AMD-based D531. Reflecting the IT industry’s growing green awareness, these notebooks can be configured to conform to the new stricter Energy Star 4.0 regulations.This time they are from Hewlett-Packard, which is blitzing the market with 16 models. If you can not take your home theatre on the road, how about the next best thing: a laptop with a 20-inch screen, the Pavilion HDX. Great for juggling monster spreadsheets – or watching Shrek III – but it costs almost $3,000 and weighs more than 15lb.More useful for road warriors is the ultra-thin HP Compaq 2710p which has a tablet screen you can write on and weighs 3.6lbs. Its keyboard has a built-in nightlight, so the dedicated can keep working when the rest of the aircraft cabin is asleep. Some of HP’s new notebooks use Intel’s latest Centrino Pro Mobile technology, which rival Dell has yet to employ.UK-based Autonomy has launched new software to track and trace forensically the lifecycle of every piece of data within an organisation. Based on Autonomy’s existing Intelligent Data Operating Layer (Idol) technology, the new module, called Idol Echo, is designed to help big business keep on top of increasingly tough compliance rules and regulations.For example, using Idol Echo, a company can track exactly who has heard, seen or forwarded an incriminating e-mail or voice mail.Oracle has announced a new release of its home-grown range of CRM software, thus confounding those who expected it to push existing users of Oracle E-Business Suite CRM on to the Siebel CRM platform (Oracle acquired Siebel, the CRM market leader, in 2005).Oracle E-Business Suite 12 CRM has a simplified user interface and streamlined CRM task flow, so processes such as placing an order can be completed without leaving the CRM application.Microsoft has given the world a preview of the next version of its popular database, SQL Server. The new product, code-named Katmai, is designed to “democratise” business intelligence (BI), making it easier to deploy BI data and applications throughout the enterprise. This is done through tighter integration with Microsoft front-end applications and SharePoint Server.The thinking behind Katmai is that any office worker should be able to access BI data using a familiar spreadsheet. Katmai will not be released commercially until 2008.Jaspersoft, an up-and-coming contender in the BI industry, has announced the latest release of its open-source BI software, Jaspersoft BI Suite version 2. Four new programs have been added to the Jaspersoft suite and it now supports a greater range of operating systems, including various Unix/Linux variants, Windows Vista and Windows 2000.It is available in French, German, Italian and Japanese, as well as English. Jaspersoft sells its products with conventional licences but an open-source edition can be downloaded free of charge.
366;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
367;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-29T23:06:16Z;AMD in chip deal with Toshiba;;Advanced Micro Devices revealed Tuesday it had broken the stranglehold of its larger rival Intel on another PC maker, announcing a deal with Toshiba to supply chips for its notebook computers.The news came a year after Dell announced it would end its exclusive use of Intel microprocessors and begin buying from AMD.Toshiba had been the biggest remaining holdout among PC makers who relied solely on Intel for processors. It appears to have caved in for the same reasons as Dell – the brutal level of competition in the PC market.Dell’s decision came after it was overtaken by Hewlett-Packard as the number one supplier of PCs.Toshiba is the number four laptop maker after HP, Dell and Acer, who all use AMD and Intel chips. Toshiba has been increasing sales, but its margins are wafer-thin, particularly in low-price segments of the notebook market.A Toshiba spokeswoman said AMD’s chips would allow it to expand its product line. They would be used in moderately priced models for individuals and business users.AMD said Toshiba would introduce three Satellite notebooks based on its new mobile platform of dual-core microprocessors and graphics chipsets. The computers would be available for the back-to-school season.Henri Richard, AMD head of sales and marketing, said seven of the top ten notebook manufacturers would now be shipping AMD-based systems.“Today signifies an important achievement in AMD’s mobile business,” he said.The three remaining Intel-only notebook PC makers in the top ten are Lenovo, Sony and Apple.
368;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-22T18:13:26Z;Intel, STMicro partner on flash memory;;Intel and STMicroelectronics on Tuesday followed other chipmakers in offloading loss-making memory businesses, creating a separate $3bn company with the help of private equity.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, will have a 45.1 per cent stake in the yet-to-be-named company, STMicro will own 48.6 per cent and Francisco Partners, a Silicon Valley private equity firm, will pay $150m for a 6.3 per cent stake in a venture with a $3bn enterprise value.The company will comprise the flash memory units of Intel and STMicro.Intel made its division a standalone unit under Brian Harrison, general manager, last year, in what was seen as a preparation for a sale or spin-off.STMicro did the same for its weakest unit in the first quarter. Mr Harrison will be chief executive of the new company.The bulk of revenues in Intel’s business comes from NOR Flash, used as memory in mobile phones. It has recently lost out to rival standard NAND Flash. The NOR market has also suffered from price-cutting.Intel’s first-quarter NOR sales fell 20 per cent on the previous quarter to $427m, according to iSuppli research firm. STMicro’s sales were down $40m on the fourth quarter at $277m.Spansion was the leading NOR company with $628m in first-quarter revenues, but may now be overtaken on revenues by the new company when it is established in the second half.Spansion was spun off in December 2005 by Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices. A joint venture with Fujitsu, Spansion had become a drag on AMD’s core microprocessor business.German chipmaker Infineon also spun out its memory business, Qimonda, last May.Intel and STMicro will contribute 4,000 employees each to the new venture. Intel has more than 5,000 workers in its existing unit and STMicro had 4,300, implying job cuts will take place.“Our goal has been to become and remain profitable in flash memory. While we have greatly improved our cost structure and performance in this business, we have not yet reached that goal,” said Arvind Sodhani, president of Intel’s venture capital arm.Analysts have said they expect the spin-off will enhance both parents’ margins, and potentially make STMicro more attractive to private equity bidders.STMicro executives said they expected its stake in the new company to become accretive to earnings during 2008.They declined to comment on the possibility of new private equity interest.
369;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-18T20:57:59Z;Bull run continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street’s bull run continued this week, with the exception of the technology sector, as deals and earnings news pushed the S&P 500 index to within sight of its all-time high.Late on Friday, the S&P had risen 0.65 per cent to close at 1,522.75, a gain of 1.1 per cent over the week. The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn.

371;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-14T15:42:36Z;AMD launches chips to ‘leapfrog’ Intel;;The war between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices entered another phase Monday with AMD’s announcement of a family of microprocessors with as many as eight “brains”, or cores.Intel regained a technological edge last year when it released the first four-core processors by combining two dual-core ones.AMD has announced its “Phenom” processor family, with “true quad-core” – four brains linked together on the same chip – as well as dual-core processors. It is also demonstrating an eight-core processor for enthusiasts named FASN8, pronounced “fascinate”.The chips, based on an architecture codenamed Barcelona, will be available in the second half of the year.Randy Allen, head of AMD’s server and workstation division, said the products were the most significant since its Opteron server processor and Athlon 64-bit desktop processors were released in 2003, leading to market-share gains over Intel.“I think they will be pivotal in allowing us to make further progress. Barcelona is a leapfrog product that opens up the gap,” he saidIntel has been regaining share since it released processors last summer based on its own new architecture, which offered lower power consumption and better performance.It also switched to chips with smaller circuitry.“AMD has needed to bring out new products to do something about the drumbeat of introductions that Intel has had,” said Roger Kay, analyst with Endpoint Technologies.“Intel has closed the gap and then some over the past year so this is an important launch for AMD.”AMD entered the graphics market last year, acquiring ATI Technologies, the Canadian chipmaker, for $5.4bn at a time when Nvidia, ATI’s main rival, had released more advanced graphics processing units.But it is beginning a fightback on this front on Monday, with ATI’s next-generation graphics chips going on sale, offering faster performance, particularly in showing high-definition images.“This means parity at the very least for AMD,” said Dean McCarron, semiconductor analyst at Mercury Research.“Any gaps that we saw between the ATI and Nvidia [graphics] products have essentially been eliminated.”
372;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-03T19:50:23Z;Intel thinks small is key to big boost;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, on Thursday said profit growth would outstrip sales increases, as it predicted the next major shift in its business would be to supply processors for a new range of low-cost, low-powered internet devices.“These are likely to be the next inflection points for us,” Paul Otellini, chief executive, told the company’s analyst day in New York.On profits, he said: “While we will have revenue growth this year and we will certainly have revenue growth, I would expect, next year, we now project that our bottom line growth will grow faster in 2007 and 2008 than our top line growth.”Mr Otellini said a move in the second half to the next level of chip miniaturisation, with circuit widths down from 65 nanometres - or billionths of a metre - to 45, would enable a broad expansion of its product line.At the high end, it could add processors with more than its current maximum of four cores or brains. Octo Core – chips with eight processing units - would be next, he said, and options would be expanded further with a processor family codenamed Larrabee, capable of more than eight cores and powering high-performance computing.At the low end, a family of processors codenamed Silverthorne would be introduced. These would find their way into smaller mobile internet devices, consumer electronics devices such as set-top boxes in the living room and low-cost PCs sold in emerging markets.Chips produced in 2008 would be a quarter of the size and use a quarter of the power of those being made in 2006, while advances in 2009 and 2010, which would put all functions on a single chip, would make Silverthorne sizes one-ninth and power usage one-twentieth of 2006 levels.Mr Otellini said the new chips would give Intel an explosive growth opportunity. He predicted that new markets, which didn’t exist today, for mobile internet devices, consumer electronics ones and ultra low-cost PCs, would be worth $10bn each in 2011 and total 900m units.Margins would not be as good for Intel as in its higher-end products, but it was reducing costs with the smaller chip size, he said.The chief executive had discussed a restructuring of the company at its spring analyst day a year ago, after profits had fallen by a third and its share price fell 20 per cent on the year. It was losing market share at the time to its rival Advanced Micro Devices.On Thursday, Mr Otellini confirmed that Intel had been regaining market share and was on target to achieve structural savings of $2bn in 2007 and $3bn in 2008.
373;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Fight is on to get brand back on inside track;;While Intel was struggling to fight off AMD in 2006, it was also unable to exorcise the influence of former Intel employee Dennis Carter, creator of the ground-breaking Intel Inside marketing campaign.After formally abandoning its Intel Inside logo after 15 years at the end of 2005, the company plummeted 10 places – from number 15 to number 25 – in the 2007 rankings of the world’s 100 most powerful brands published by Millward Brown Optimor last month.Mr Carter, now retired, launched the marketing programme in 1991, marking the first time a company making something for the internal workings of a PC had tried to communicate directly with computer buyers.The idea stemmed from a desire to create consumer demand for its higher-value 386 processors, at a time when manufacturers were happy to keep selling computers containing its 286 chips. The Intel Inside slogan was born to differentiate itself from AMD after its rival entered the picture in 1990 with a 386 processor.Eric Kim, brought in from Samsung in November 2004 to revitalise marketing and branding, had taken the decision to retire the slogan.Mr Kim was in turn replaced by Don MacDonald, a Briton who became vice-president of marketing and brands.“We had Dennis in about two weeks ago and I joked with him that it was my job to banish the ghost of Dennis Carter,” says Mr MacDonald. “He is my hero, what he did was fantastic, but our goal is to try to come up with something better.”Mr MacDonald believes the survey showing a decline in Intel’s standing with consumers lags behind reality, and fails to reflect new products and revived fortunes.But the way he is unpicking the strategy of his predecessors suggests Intel acknowledges missteps in its branding campaigns.“Intel has allowed sub-brands to proliferate to such a degree that they are pulling down the parent and much of this problem was created by Eric Kim,” says Rob Enderle, technology analyst with the Enderle group.Intel pushed its Centrino platform, which stood for chips with wi-fi capabilities for notebook PCs, before Mr Kim’s arrival. Mr Kim then introduced the Viiv digital home platform at the beginning of 2006 and the vPro brand for enterprise computers. The Intel logo was played down and a subtler version of the “Inside“ formula was used.Mr MacDonald says some consumers failed to associate Centrino with Intel at all. He says Intel is reverting to a “master brand” strategy, with Intel writ larger in the logos for the new sub-brands.“People got confused by all the shiny badges,” he says. “I actually think we have too many brands and I want to simplify that.”Intel’s sliding standing could also be linked to the PC no longer being the technology focus for consumers, as equally sophisticated devices enter living rooms.Intel has risked diluting its brand by pushing into these new areas with products such as the Viiv platform.“Your brand has to be relevant to your consumer and we have got a lot more physical presence in consumer electronics devices such as set-top boxes,” says Mr MacDonald.Gary Barnett, research director at Ovum, a technology consultancy, says: “What Intel did very successfully was establish itself as the premium brand when, on a pure comparison of performance, there often wasn’t much difference with AMD.”Millward Brown says Intel’s “leadership” score has fallen between 2004 and 2006/7, according to its survey of 20,000 US and UK consumers, although its advertising claims that it made superior products were still credible to them.Stuart Whitwell, managing director of Intangible Business, a specialist branding company, says its new line of dual and quad-core processors should help: “Intel has to be seen to be leading innovation, otherwise its brand can become secondary to the main brand being advertised such as a Sony or a Dell. And to do that, Intel needs good product. It can’t rest on its laurels.”

375;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Intel eats away at AMD’s share of chips;;What a difference a year makes. On Thursday Intel will deliver an upbeat report on its new products and sound finances at its analyst day in New York, while its rival Advanced Micro Devices faces the wrath of investors at its annual stockholders meeting in Silicon Valley.The positions of the two chipmakers that dominate the market for PC microprocessors have completely reversed.Twelve months ago, Intel was announcing a drastic review of its operations after its profits had fallen by a third and its share price by more than 20 per cent over the year, making it the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.It told analysts that customers were reporting that several million of its processors had piled up in inventories as demand slumped.At the same time, AMD was reporting record gross margins for the first quarter of 58.5 per cent and a share of 27 per cent of the market for server processors. AMD’s shares had peaked at $42 during the quarter.Since then they have lost two-thirds of their value as AMD has issued a series of warnings this year.Its gross margins almost halved to 31 per cent in the first quarter as it swung to a $611m loss, while its overall market share slipped to 19 per cent.The reversal of fortunes is a tale of how a much smaller chipmaker was able to outwit a manufacturing titan, before the bigger player rediscovered its poise and engineering prowess.“I think that most of AMD’s successes over the past three or four years came against a very weakened competitor,” says Steve Kleynhans, analyst with the Gartner research firm.“Intel had a problem with its product family and the unfortunate thing about the semiconductor business is that it takes a long time to dig yourself out of a hole when you get into it,” he says.Intel’s hole was its Netburst chip architecture, which was built for speed but ran too hot and led to its microprocessors being outperformed by AMD’s, particularly in the server segment, where its rival made rapid market-share gains.Intel began to put things right last June with its first new architecture for five years and the launch of energy-efficient chips with two cores or “brains.”It also moved to the next level of miniaturisation ahead of AMD, making chips with circuit widths of 65 billionths of a metre, down from 90 nanometres.The new chips were more than 30 per cent smaller than the previous 90nm, producing cost savings.Combined with the need to clear out old inventory to make way for its new products, Intel was able to launch a price war against AMD that would cut into both companies’ margins but would hurt AMD more and result in Intel winning back market share.Traditionally, Intel has supplied the processors for more than four out of five computers using the dominant “x86” architecture and, in the first quarter, its share was restored to 81 per cent, up from 74 per cent in the fourth.It has also released processors with four cores more than six months ahead of those planned by AMD and is set to have a year’s lead over its rival in beginning production of 45nm chips in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, AMD has been sidetracked by its acquisition of the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI for $5.4bn in October.ATI makes lower-margin products and has seen its chief competitor Nvidia come out with more technically advanced products in recent months.But analysts feel the acquisition was a move AMD had to make to try to out-manoeuvre its bigger rival. “The timing was unfortunate, it’s going to make the next year or two kind of rough for AMD, but I think in the long run it’s a good move,” says Mr Kleynhans.Rob Enderle, technology analyst with the Enderle group, says that buying ATI was an excellent move from a strategic standpoint. “It caught Intel napping and it moves the argument into an area where Intel is historically weak – its graphics capabilities have improved so little over time.”AMD will launch a new series of processors codenamed Barcelona this summer that may give it some breathing space, but the real fruits of its merger with ATI are not expected until 2008-2009 when Fusion, a microprocessor combined with the latest graphics processing unit (GPU) is launched.Mr Enderle says that, as long as Intel defines the market, AMD will have fewer resources and will be unable to break out of the range of less than 20 per cent market share, well below its target of 30 per cent.“It’s only when AMD can change the battlefield and the weapons that it can move against Intel. That’s what it’s trying to do with Fusion – beating Intel to market with that can give it a leadership position again.”
376;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-05-01T11:07:43Z;Tech product cycles;;The march of private equity into Silicon Valley has fuelled a feeling that the technology sector is more predictable. There is some truth in that. Although growth rates have fallen since the heady 1990s, cash flows from big companies are attractive and many balance sheets are overcapitalised. In sectors such as software, profits are underpinned by recurring, high-margin maintenance revenue streams.Tech companies have become more attractive as buy-out targets alongside a growing perception that volatility in the economy and business spending have become more muted. But investors should be careful about interpreting that as a sign that cycles have vanished. Take the Blackstone consortium’s acquisition of semiconductor company Freescale. That was possible not because the chip cycle, with its periods of oversupply, has evaporated but because financing conditions are so incredibly forgiving. The buyers have flexibility from weak covenants and the ability to delay some interest payments on their debt if necessary to wait out a downturn.The other big issue is the product cycle itself. That is alive and kicking. Just look at Apple’s renaissance on the back of the iPod and Motorola’s fall from grace as the Razr handset has lost its shine. That is especially pronounced in consumer-facing tech companies. It becomes increasingly relevant as more companies focus on the man (or kid) in the street – say, Cisco in set-top boxes and Microsoft in games consoles.But it also affects those targeting the less fashion-conscious business market. Only last year, Advanced Micro Devices was riding high with a surge in market share because its microprocessors had the edge on Intel’s. It even got caught up in its own exuberance with the $5.4bn mainly cash deal for ATI. Now it is being hammered by an Intel product revival.New investors looking to dive into the “changed” tech sector should remember that, beneath the surface, the nitty-gritty technology and products really need to be understood. If not, they can quickly come back to bite you.
377;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-04-29T21:25:45Z;Hurd sees IT groups charting own path;;Private equity interest in software companies and other IT groups are unlikely to spark a broader overhaul of technology companies’ growth priorities or other business strategies, says Mark Hurd, Hewlett-Packard chief executive.“When I think of the future of the tech industry, I don’t think of private equity as a strategic destination,” he said. “I think of it as a stop along the way.”Mr Hurd’s comments come as big technology companies respond to private equity interest in IT groups by taking on more debt to fund stock buy-backs, pay dividends and take other action to return money to shareholders.International Business Machines, HP’s main IT rival, last week said it planned to take on debt to finance a 33 per cent increase in dividends and a $15bn expansion of its stock repurchase programme.The news sent the share price of IBM, known as Big Blue, up 10 per cent.Private equity groups have argued that strong cash flow and financial conservatism have left many tech companies with stronger balance sheets than they need.AMD, Sun Microsystems, and Computer Associates are companies mooted as buy-out candidates. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a US buy-out group, this year invested $700m in Sun.Mr Hurd, who has presided over a doubling in HP’s stock price since he replaced Carly Fiorina as chief executive in 2005, declined to comment on whether the company was considering additional leverage or spinning off part of its business to private equity investors.
378;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-04-20T13:02:38Z;Wall St advances to new highs;;Solid earnings and speculation about buy-outs of financial groups pushed US stocks into record territory this week as the leading indices recouped all the losses from the slump that began in late February.Boosted by bullish earnings updates from Caterpillar and Honeywell on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The S&P 500 index broke through its high for the year reached before the plunge in equities two months ago, rising 0.9 per cent to 1,484.35 on Friday to stand 2.2 per cent up this week.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent this week to 2,526.39.While the advance gathered pace on Friday, the rally earlier in the week was driven by a relatively narrow base of stocks. Blue chips had the best of the gains: the Dow Jones advanced 2.8 per cent this week while the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose just 1.2 per cent.“The big driver has been earnings, which have been much better than anticipated – we set the bar so low,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“It is a ‘Chicken Little’ recovery – the market rises yet never seems able to generate confidence.”Google led the way up after beating analysts’ expectations with a sharp rise in profits on the back of strong search engine revenues. Its shares rose 2.3 per cent to $482.48.This rise was in stark contrast to Yahoo, which slid 12.6 per cent to $27.46 this week after the introduction of Panama, its new online advertising system, failed to stem the deterioration in profits and sales. Caterpillar, a Dow component, surged 4.7 per cent to $71.82 on Friday after the heavy machinery maker reported profits in excess of analysts’ estimates and raised its earnings forecasts.Shares in Honeywell International rose 4.8 per cent to $51.40 on Friday after the industrial conglomerate raised its earnings forecasts for the year and beat Wall Street profit estimates.The financial sector came in from the cold this week, with the S&P Financial index up 3.9 per cent to break past its 50-day moving average and stand in positive territory for the year.The rise came amid a burst of takeover speculation after a $25bn agreed buy-out of Sallie Mae, the student loan group, by a JC Flowers-led consortium that sent shares in Sallie Mae up 15.5 per cent to $54 this week.The groundbreaking deal, which is structured to make it unnecessary for Sallie Mae to hold its own capital, turned attention to financial groups that were previously considered improbable buy-out targets. Foremost among those was Countrywide Financial, the biggest home lender, which jumped 11.1 per cent to $37.36.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Merrill Lynch, which has made bullish comments about the subprime mortgage market.Merrill rose 6.7 per cent to $92.02 this week after reporting a four-fold rise in profits.In the latest example of the growing appetite for financial deals, H&R Block agreed to sell Option One Mortgage, its subprime mortgage unit, to a company affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group. Shares in H&R Block rose 3.3 per cent to $22.56 on Friday.Intel made big gains this week, rising 8.3 per cent to $21.16, as the chipmaker raised its revenue forecasts after a successful overhaul of its product line.Rival AMD fared less well, easing 0.8 per cent to $14.16 on Friday after what Robert Rivet, chief executive, described as a “disappointing and unacceptable” first quarter, with lower sales and deteriorating margins.The rally in railway stocks gathered steam as TCI, the activist hedge fund, built a stake in CSX, highlighting the potential for takeovers and asset sales in this cash-generative sector.Shares in CSX jumped 6.1 per cent to $4504.Atticus, a hedge fund that has worked with TCI in the past, already holds big stakes in railway groups, including Union Pacific, which rose 6.8 per cent this week to $117.21.Homebuilders bounced off their lows for the year as fears eased about the severity of the housing market downturn. The S&P Homebuilders index jumped 8.6 per cent while DR Horton rose 8.9 per cent to $23.39.
379;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-04-20T01:02:20Z;AMD posts surprisingly big quarterly loss;;"Advanced Micro Devices reported a first-quarter loss more than double Wall Street’s expectations and saw its gross margins collapse in the face of a market-share battle with its bigger rival, Intel.AMD said on Thursday that it lost $611m, or $1.11 a share, compared with expectations of a 48 cent loss from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.Gross margins fell to 31 per cent, down from 40 per cent in the previous quarter and 59 per cent a year earlier.“After more than three years of successfully executing our customer expansion strategy and significantly growing our unit and revenue base, our first-quarter performance is disappointing and unacceptable,” said Bob Rivet, chief financial officer.AMD said it had suffered significantly lower unit shipments of its microprocessors, lower average selling prices, and margins had also been affected by the inclusion of figures from its ATI graphics chipmaker acquisition, which made lower-margin products. Mr Rivet said AMD “was aggressively addressing the issues that led to our significant revenue decline”.Revenues were $1.2bn, in line with a warning it issued last week that sales would not reach the $1.6bn to $1.7bn originally forecast. They were 7 per cent lower than the $1,332bn recorded a year earlier.AMD has issued three warnings this year as Intel has sought to regain market share with competitive pricing, newer products and a more advanced and cost-
effective architecture."
380;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-04-17T22:36:25Z;New chips give Intel edge over rival AMD;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said on Tuesday it had achieved solid results in its first quarter as prices for its processors held up and margins improved above 50 per cent.Its earnings report contrasted with the three warnings issued by its microprocessor rival Advanced Micro Devices this year. In the latest last week, it said first-quarter sales would be more than 20 per cent less than earlier expected due to lower average selling prices and significantly lower unit sales.Intel reported first-quarter sales of $8.85bn, below Wall Street forecasts of $8.96bn and figures of $8.94bn recorded a year earlier. Earnings per share of 27 cents were in line with the analyst consensus gathered by Reuters Estimates, taking into account a tax credit of 5 cents per share.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said its new Core microarchitecture family along with cost-cutting measures were behind the “solid financial results”.“Our product strength is reflected in the fact that average selling prices for the quarter held up well in a very competitive environment.”He said there was competitive pricing in the lower-end of the market in particular and there had been a decline in server average selling prices – the area of the market where Intel is trying to regain market share from AMD.Intel has been engaged in a price war with its rival but has had the advantage of newer products made in more cost-effective advanced processes.It reported gross margins had climbed back to 50.1 per cent after falling below 50 per cent in the second half of last year. It had earlier forecast first-quarter gross margins of 49 per cent. It raised its 2007 forecast to around 51 per cent, up from 50 per cent.Intel said lower costs for its microprocessors and good inventory management had more than offset the effects of lower revenues and start-up costs of new production lines.The Silicon Valley mainstay said its global workforce had been reduced to 92,000, meeting its target one quarter ahead of schedule.Intel shares were 0.3 per cent higher at $21.05 in after-hours trading in New York.
381;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-04-09T21:59:28Z;Wall Street mixed as investors exude caution;;Wall Street stocks closed mixed on Monday, as caution over inflation and future Federal Reserve policy followed Friday’s report of solid job creation last month and reports of a possible buyout of Dow Chemical, later scotched by the company.The S&P 500 index gained 0.1 per cent to 1,444.81, and spent the day locked in a narrow trading range. In spite of materials stocks rallying, weakness in energy, telecom, technology and financial sectors limited an early advance by the broad market.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,469.18 and was unable to hold onto a modest gain at midday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 12,569.14.Stock markets in Europe were closed on Monday, but Asian markets rallied in the wake of the stronger than forecast US payrolls report. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 1.5 per cent.The creation of 180,000 jobs last month beat the forecast rise of 135,000. Payrolls for February and January were also revised higher. The 0.1 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate to 4.4 per cent was also a surprise for investors, as it had been expected to rise a notch to 4.6 per cent.The jobs report soothed concerns about the economy and reduced expectations among bond investors that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. Investors on average now expect just one quarter-point cut by December, down from two cuts recently. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was at 4.75 per cent on Monday, its highest level since mid February.However, the inflation implications of the low unemployment rate and a further rise in average earnings had unsettled stock investors.‘The market is hesitant and treading water,” said Peter Cardillo, market strategist at Avalon Partners. He said concerns over inflation raised in the jobs report was “holding back positive sentiment for stocks.Amid light volumes, buy-out talk and earnings news stoked pockets of activity.As investors returned from the Easter holiday, sentiment was boosted by a report in a UK Sunday newspaper that Dow Chemical could be the target of a buyout at between $52 and $58 a share from a group of Middle East investors and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm.Such a bid would value the company in the region of $50bn and eclipse the recent proposed $32bn buyout of TXU, potentially the biggest private equity deal to date. Shares in Dow rose 4.9 per cent to $46.63, after trimming an earlier rise to $47.60. After the close, the company denied having any buyout talks.In other deal activity, Citigroup announced it would buy Taiwan’s Bank of Overseas Chinese for around $426m. Citigroup was a fraction higher at $51.58.Shares in Burlington Northern Santa Fe jumped 6.5 per cent to $88.08 after Berkshire Hathaway said it had accumulated a 10.9 per cent stake.Among financial stocks, American Home Mortgage plunged 15.2 per cent to $21.92 after the lender lowered its profit forecast for this year. A number of brokerages downgraded the stock and other lenders also fell.Shares in Accredited Home Lenders fell 4.25 per cent at $9.23.Earnings season picks up speed this week and Alcoa is due with its first quarter results on Tuesday. Alcoa rose 0.8 per cent to $34.87.Stocks may well remain range-bound until the earnings picture clears, analysts say. “Until we get into the full swing of earnings and guidance, the market will mark time,” said Mr Cardillo.The average growth in earnings for the first quarter versus a year ago is seen at 3.3 per cent, according to Thomson Financial. That would break a run of 14 quarters in which year-on-year earnings growth has exceeded 10 per cent.In earnings news on Monday, Advanced Micro Devices warned that its first-quarter revenue would probably miss estimates. Shares rose 3.8 per cent to $13.35 after the chip maker said it would cut costs.Rival chip maker Intel gained 2.7 per cent to $20.10. The stock was one of four companies somewhat out of favour with mutual funds, according to Citigroup.Analysts at the bank sifted through the leading 10 stocks held by 50 actively managed mutual funds. Four companies on the bank’s “recommended list” – Intel, Merrill Lynch, News Corp and UPS – “appear to be least favored by investors,” Citigroup said.“Over the past year, Google, Fannie Mae, Berkshire Hathaway, and Oracle have gained popularity, as ExxonMobil and Microsoft have slipped in the standings.”
382;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-04-09T16:29:29Z;AMD warns as revenues slide;;A bruising price war continued to take its toll on AMD on Monday as the world’s second-biggest microprocessor maker said it expected sales to miss forecasts by more than 20 per cent in the first quarter.Shares of AMD jumped more than five per cent, however, as the company announced $500m in cost cuts designed to help it better compete with industry arch-rival Intel.AMD now expects to record sales of about $1.23bn in the first fiscal quarter, below the $1.6bn to $1.7bn it had originally forecast. Investors had been bracing for the poor first-quarter performance since last month, when the chipmaker warned that it was unlikely to meet its sales targets.“Revenues declined sharply quarter-over-quarter for the Computing Solutions segment, primarily due to lower overall average selling prices and significantly lower unit sales, especially in the resale channel,” the company said in a statement on Monday.AMD’s stock price rose 5.5 per cent on Monday to $13.57 by mid-day in New York. The company’s shares had fallen sharply from a high of $40.54 in February last year as tough price competition and new processors from Intel cut into margins and sales.AMD said it planned to “restructure its business model to increase operational efficiencies and lower the operating cost structure.” The company said it would cut capital expenditures by $500m this year. It said it would cut discretionary expenses and restrict hiring to critical positions.Intel and AMD together dominate the market for the ”x86” processors that power most PCs. But Intel has traditionally held the lion’s share of the x86 market, providing the chips for four out of every five PCs sold.AMD, whose manufacturing costs are higher than Intel’s, has been hit hard by the ongoing price war between the two companies. Although AMD gained market share against its bigger rival in 2006, Intel has benefited from its own round of cost cuts and the launch of a new line of microprocessorsIn January, AMD reported a $574m loss for the fourth quarter, driven by shrinking margins and costs associated with its $5.4 acquisition last year of ATI, a graphics chip maker.A fall in average selling prices has put pressure on margins across the chip industry. AMD last quarter announced that its gross margins had dipped to 40 per cent, compared with 52 per cent in the third quarter and 57 per cent a year earlier.AMD said it would provide more details about its first quarter performance when it reports its full results on April 19.
383;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-03-15T01:20:31Z;Divvying up internet video;;YouTube may still be hogging the headlines but, in other news, more internet video channels are on the way.Divvio.com launched this week with a channel model designed to provide a more personalised and organised online video experience.Divvio allows you to set up video and audio channels according to your interests. For example, I created a Manchester United channel and Divvio searched for the term and came up with a list of soccer clips from YouTube, which I could then play in a window on its website or create a playlist from the best of them.Many didn’t work, were of poor quality or had already been removed from the site. The Divvio service is therefore only as good as the sites it links to, but its video player at least smoothes the process by being able to handle all types of files.Hossein Eslambolchi, former head of the old AT&T’s Global Network Services division, founded Divvio in Silicon Valley last year and attracted angel funding from the likes of Eric Benhamou of Palm fame, former Yahoo executive Geoff Ralston and former Cisco executive Mike Volpi.He says Divvio will be different from rivals such as Blinkx and Joost in searching more sites more intelligently.Meanwhile, the chipmaker AMD is promoting another means of moving internet video to your television through its Active TV Technology, launched on Wednesday at CeBIT. Using middleware partners such as MediaMall, it is creating a link between the PC and the set-top box to carry a range of internet-channelled content to the big screen. Reuters, the BBC and Movielink are among the featured channels.It’s very similar to Microsoft’s media extender for the TV and the channels available through its Windows Media Center.The technology is unlikely to gain much traction in the US where cable and satellite providers prefer to keep tight control over the content coming from their set-top boxes, but AMD is hopeful of a bigger take-up in Europe where free-to-air digital TV boxes are commonplace.
384;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-03-05T20:12:34Z;AMD issues revenues warning;;Advanced Micro Devices, the number-two PC microprocessor maker, issued its second warning of the year on Monday blaming weaker than expected demand for computers.AMD said it was unlikely to meet its previously estimated revenue guidance of $1.6bn-$1.7bn in the first quarter.Its shares, which have lost two-thirds of their value in the past year, were down 2 per cent in midday trading in New York, hitting a new low of $13.89. They fell more than 10 per cent in January after the number-two maker of processors for PCs warned of substantially lower fourth-quarter profits caused by a price war with its larger rival Intel.Average selling prices for microprocessors have fallen significantly for AMD, which announced gross margins had dipped to 40 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 52 per cent in the third quarter and 57 per cent a year earlier.Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, told a Morgan Stanley technology conference in San Francisco on Monday: “The pricing environment is very competitive.”But Mr Ruiz blamed PC manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell for the fresh warning. He said they had been over-aggressive in estimating demand, leaving chips on AMD’s hands that it did not have time to switch and sell to other buyers.The chip industry as a whole appears to be experiencing some weakness in the early part of 2007, according to January sales figures released on Monday by the Semiconductor Industry Association trade body.Worldwide sales of $21.47bn were 9.2 per cent higher than a year earlier, but were down 1.2 per cent from the $21.74bn reported in December.“January semiconductor sales reflected historical seasonal patterns, with strong year-on-year sales growth coupled with a modest sales sequential decline,” said George Scalise, SIA president.Joe Osha, Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst, said the statistics showed unit growth was still weakening. “We continue to believe Q1-07 will mark the trough on a year-on-year basis in both revenue and units,” he said in a note.
385;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-03-01T00:07:00Z;Intel and AMD are uneasy classmates;;A “UN Meets Silicon Valley” summit at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View on Wednesday was pushing technology to bridge the digital divide, but it also highlighted the different strategies in emerging markets of the two processor protagonists, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.It is not hard to see why Intel is focusing on emerging markets with its $1bn World Ahead programme aimed at extending broadband PC access by a billion people over five years.These markets now account for more than a third of its business and half the growth rate for PCs.Intel’s pump-priming for demand for its chips includes encouraging governments to introduce computers in schools and banks to offer interest-free loans to students.Its flagship product is the Classmate PC. After pilot programmes in schools in Brazil and Nigeria, it is about to go into mass production for trials in 30 emerging markets this year.It will cost around $300 and features a Celeron processor, 7.5-inch screen and ruggedised case.While pupils in a class will all have the basic laptop, teachers will have a more sophisticated notebook that can view what each child is working on through a dashboard networking application.This differs from the One Laptop Per Child product and strategy that aims to provide $150 notebooks to both pupil and teacher.“OLPC are very student-centric, we use teachers and are not so revolutionary, but we both have the same vision,” says John Davies, head of Intel’s World Ahead programme.AMD yesterday showed off the OLPC machine with its AMD Geode processor inside and said it was talking to partners about bringing similar devices to the same category.“Intel are trying to market to that environment, we are not: we are trying to change it,” said Henri Richard, AMD head of sales and marketing.He said Intel had rejected an offer he made to collaborate and share code between Intel and AMD engineers on emerging market products.Another market, another round of rivalry, it seems.
386;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-02-28T23:57:24Z;Força Barça;;Advanced Micro Devices is finally able to match Intel with a complete platform of its own chips following the introduction of the 690 Series chipset today.The product of its takeover last October of ATI, the Canadian graphics chipmaker, it allows AMD to combine its microprocessor with an ATI integrated graphics processor on a motherboard, something Intel has been doing for years with its own integrated graphics chipsets.The 690 is designed with Windows Vista in mind, allowing HDMI high-definition connections and superior gaming performance.Henri Richard, head of sales and marketing, was also talking tough at the launch about future offerings, including Barcelona, the codename for a quad-core processor expected in the third quarter.“It’s more of a killer product than Opteron was when it was launched,” he said, referring to the processor launched in 2003 that enabled AMD to make major market share gains against Intel in the server category.“It will be a fantastic second wave of success for our architecture,” he added.Barcelona cannot come soon enough for AMD, which has been taking a benchmark beating from Intel since its larger rival introduced a new architecture last year and became the first to offer quad-core processors. 
387;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-02-15T06:36:44Z;IT-related energy consumption doubles;;The amount of electricity consumed by computer servers has doubled in five years and will increase another 75 per cent by 2010, according to a report published on Thursday by an energy efficiency expert.Jonathan Koomey, a consulting professor at Stanford University and scientist at America’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, says the world’s servers and their cooling infrastructure consumed as much power as that put out by 14 1,000-mega­watt power stations in 2005.The total server electricity bill was about $7.3bn, of which the US made up $2.7bn.Prof Koomey said servers and associated equipment represented about 1.2 per cent of US electricity consumption in 2005, comparable to the amount consumed by televisions.His study, sponsored by the microprocessor maker Advanced Micro Devices, will be used in a call to action addressed to boards of companies that leave spending on servers to their IT departments.Internet and technology companies have woken up to the fact that the cost of equipment is often exceeded by that of the electricity needed to run it during its lifetime but this has yet to be properly recognised by non-technology companies.“At the moment, the IT budget of these companies is separate and IT departments don’t have any incentive to be more efficient, because the utility bills do not come out of their budget,” Prof Koomey said.Companies would wake up to the costs their data centres incurred only when “everybody is in the room” and responsibility was taken at board level, he said.Manufacturers of servers and their components have become energy-conscious. Intel, the biggest chipmaker, has set a new benchmark of performance-per-watt rather than chasing higher processor speeds, which burn far more energy.Prof Koomey said there were inefficiencies throughout processes in data centres and different companies were looking at how to make disk drives, power supplies and cooling systems use less power.But this was not being driven by a desire to be more environment-friendly, he said.“It’s mainly driven by business and IT constraints – they only have a certain amount of power in their buildings and they can’t keep on putting in more of these [energy-inefficient] servers,” he said.His study compared energy usage from 2000 to 2005 and predicted usage in 2010.
388;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Slowdown looms as groups miss targets;;The percentage of US companies failing to meet Wall Street’s earnings expectations has reached the highest level in more than two years, fuelling fears that corporate America’s record run of profit growth will come to an abrupt end.Concerns of a slowdown in corporate profitability – one of the key reasons for the stock market’s record-breaking streak – have been heightened by companies’ increasingly bearish outlook on business prospects.More than 22 per cent of the 400-plus S&P 500 companies to have reported results for the fourth quarter of 2006 failed to meet Wall Street expectations. This is the highest level of “misses” since the third quarter of 2004, according to Reuters Estimates.The spike in earnings disappointments increases the chances that corporate America will end a three-and-a-half year run of quarterly double-digit profit growth in the last quarter of 2006 rather than at the beginning of 2007, as widely expected.Missing earnings forecasts is particularly embarrassing for US companies because, unlike most of their European counterparts, many set their own yardsticks by providing analysts with quarterly earnings guidance.“The period of rapid earning growth is at an end,” said Ashwani Kaul, senior research analyst at Reuters Estimates. “Companies have reached levels of high absolute earnings and cannot be expected to continue at this pace. We are entering a low earnings growth environment.”The large number of companies missing Wall Street estimates – including carmaker Ford Motor, bond insurer MBIA and chip manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices – has prompted analysts to pare back forecasts. The consensus is that the S&P 500 will fall short of double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2006. Slowing corporate profitability could compound the negative sentiment towards the US stock market, which last week had its biggest weekly fall since December amid fears over inflation, oil prices and rising mortgage defaults.Analysts forecast a rise of about 5 per cent in earnings of S&P 500 companies in the first quarter of 2007, down from more than 7 per cent two months ago, according to Thomson Financial.“We are going through a big transition in mindset,” said Mike Thompson, director of research at Thomson Financial. “We are finally seeing a slowdown in earnings.”
389;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-02-02T21:00:31Z;Lawsuit against Dell alleges Intel kickbacks;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, on Friday denied allegations that it provided secret kickbacks to Dell in order to ensure it remained the computer maker’s sole microprocessor supplier.The allegations, contained in a lawsuit filed against Dell on Wednesday on behalf of two shareholders, add to the troubles facing Dell.The company this week said Michael Dell had re-assumed control following the resignation of Kevin Rollins as chief executive after several quarters of falling margins and slumping sales.The lawsuit accused Dell of “failing to make required disclosures” about the impact of hundreds of millions of dollars of rebates the company is alleged to have received from the chipmaker. It accused Intel of trying to keep “exclusivity” rebates paid to Dell and other customers secret in order to avoid antitrust claims.Dell declined to comment but Chuck Mulloy, Intel spokesman, said on Friday that some aspects of the allegations contained in the complaint filed by lawyers at Lerach Coughlin, a prominent shareholder law outfit, appeared to have been “completely made up”.“We deny the plaintiff’s allegations and we plan to move quickly to defend ourselves,” he said.Intel was for years the sole supplier of microprocessors that powered Dell computers. Last year Dell ended years of speculation by announcing that it would begin to offer some models with microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices, an Intel rival.
390;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-29T23:23:57Z;Intel’s tinier steps outpace rivals;;Analysts appear underwhelmed by Intel and IBM’s simultaneous announcements of the biggest chip breakthrough in 40 years.Joe Osha at Merrill Lynch says Intel and others have been talking about using high-k dialectric materials in next-generation 45-nanometre technology for years, so the accomplishment is no surprise.What is more interesting, he argues, is how many companies are likely to stay in this race to build smaller-scale chips as the technology becomes more challenging in the move from 45nm to 32nm and beyond.He has a point. Texas Instruments announced last week in its earnings report that it would be pooling its resources with its Asian foundry partners in future research. IBM has also developed research partnerships with Toshiba, Sony and AMD.Intel seems intent on ploughing a lone furrow. This is giving it a manufacturing lead at present – it will be first to market with 45nm chips, beating AMD by perhaps a year.The question is whether this will translate into market-share gains. Its lead in the current 65nm generation suggests it might, with the cheaper manufacturing process making it better able to compete in a price war with AMD.
391;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-26T21:40:10Z;Wall Street down on higher rates, volatile oil;;"US stocks were not for the faint-hearted this week. Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week. After tumbling 35 per cent in 2006, the stock has risen 10 per cent this month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,435.49 on Friday, a loss of 0.65 per cent for the week. A drag on the Nasdaq was Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares fell 3.7 per cent on the week to $71.50, after earnings failed to beat estimates.Other technology companies moving higher amid better earnings and guidance this week included Sun MicroSystems, up 9.7 per cent to $6.33, RF Micro Devices, up 13 per cent to $7.85, and Citrix Systems, up 8 per cent at $31.10. Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings. Shares in Corning surged 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the maker of glass and fibre optics products also beat estimates.Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 from $48.50 a share as it countered a rival buy-out offer of $52 a share. Shares in Equity Office rose 5.2 per cent to $55.22 this week.Countrywide jumped 4.2 per cent, to $42 on Friday after the Financial Times reported that the mortgage lender was in talks with Bank Of America about a possible $30bn deal. BofA shares fell 0.7 per cent to $52.04 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record close during the week, only to retreat. It fell 0.1 per cent to 12,487.02 on Friday, a loss of 0.6 per cent over the week.AT&T led Dow constituents reporting earnings this week. Better revenue growth sparked a 3.8 per cent rise to $36.40 and shares hit a multi-year high of $37.70 on Thursday.Caterpillar shares rose 2.5 per cent to $61.09 on Friday after it raised sales guidance for 2007.McDonald’s weighed on the Dow as its shares slid 4.2 per cent to $42.93. Its quarterly earnings met estimates that were recently upgraded and had sent the stock to a multi-year peak of $45.06 more than a week ago. Topping the Dow this week was General Motors, up 4.4 per cent to $32.93, although the stock fell from a peak of $33.30 after it announced a delay in filing its fourth-quarter earnings.The company reiterated that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006.In stark contrast, Ford announced an annual loss of $12.7bn, the largest in its
history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

But it disappointed the market in predicting gross margins of only 50 per cent in 2007 as it competed on price with AMD and invested in new manufacturing processes.AMD reported revenues rose 3 per cent on the prior quarter to $1.37bn, excluding ATI revenues. This was in line with a warning earlier this month.AMD said yesterday $550m of its loss was related to the acquisition and integration of ATI, the Canadian chipmaker bought for $5.4bn in October, and it had incurred $27m in stock-based compensation expenses.Gross margins of 40 per cent compared with 52 per cent in the third quarter and 57 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005.“We are not satisfied with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and we need to improve our results in the future,” Dirk Meyer, AMD president, told an analyst conference call.

397;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-22T21:24:05Z;Sun Microsystems and Intel in alliance;;Sun Microsystems and Intel, often bitter rivals in the microprocessor industry, on Monday announced a “landmark alliance” in which Intel’s chips would power a Sun server product line.Jonathan Schwartz, Sun chief executive, described the partnership as an historic moment that would change the market for his company.In a joint press conference with Paul Otellini, his Intel counterpart, he said Intel had agreed to distribute and support Sun’s Solaris operating system as part of the deal.The announcements were a blow to Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s processor rival, which has kept Intel’s chips out of Sun’s servers for several years.The move by Sun signalled that Intel was regaining a technological edge it had lost to AMD, along with market share, in the server segment of the industry.Sun said it would begin using Intel’s Xeon processors in the most common “x86” servers late in the first half. It uses its own processor in more high-end servers where it competes with Intel’s Itanium product.Sun is rated sixth in market share in the x86 segment, but it has been one of the fastest growing vendors over the past few quarters.Sumit Dhanda, Bank of America semiconductor analyst, said in a note predicting the move that Sun had used AMD’s Opteron processors exclusively over the past few years because they had used less power than Intel’s Xeon.“Now that Intel’s new Xeon processors are boasting better performance/power consumption versus AMD’s Opteron (based on 3rd party benchmarks), we believe that Sun, among many other server vendors, is exploring use of Intel processors in its x86 server line,” he wrote.Regaining Sun as a customer is Intel’s biggest win since it persuaded Apple to switch to its processors in 2005.Intel last week beat market forecasts when it announced it had delivered revenues at the top end of its expectations in the fourth quarter helped by higher selling prices for its new line of microprocessors.In contrast, AMD issued a profits and revenue warning earlier this month, blaming lower average selling prices. It releases its fourth-quarter figures after the markets close on Tuesday.
398;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel’s underclocked earnings;;"So Intel has a technological lead with its spiffing new dual-core and quad-core processors, it has a manufacturing lead with its smaller, more cost-efficient 65-nanometre chip circuitry and yet its margins remain below 50 per cent.
This was the big disappointment of its fourth-quarter earnings and first-quarter forecast this week. Margins were more than 60 per cent a year earlier with older products, inferior to its rival Advanced Micro Devices, that were made on 90nm chips.
The reason margins and profits will disappoint in 2007, despite its best new product line in years, is Intel’s apparent determination to grind AMD into the dust.
Intel intends to keep its prices low to win market share and it is accelerating its cycle of innovation to try to take an unassailable technological lead.
There will be two-year renewals of its architecture instead of five, while further miniaturisation will take place every other year now.
All this costs money and eats into margins – start-up costs for 45nm manufacturing will subtract a couple of percentage points this year and Intel will probably struggle to get full utilisation out of older plant being left behind.
Reasserting its traditional dominance over AMD will play well for Intel in the long term but it will not satisfy investors looking for a boost to dividends and a share price that has been in a long slump.
Joe Osha, Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst, says in a report that what has happened to Intel is simple: it has created too much manufacturing capacity.
“Until Intel starts to think more about running its business for returns and less about market share and the next process node, results are likely to continue to disappoint,” he said.
“Above all, we think that there would be real opportunity if Intel management accepted the fact that the processor market is now a duopoly, albeit a lopsided one, and acted accordingly.”
The evidence is to the contrary and Merrill Lynch sees Intel as a company with peak earnings power of $1.20 to $1.30 a share as a result.
By Intel’s processor standards, that represents an underclocking of the company’s earnings potential and Wall Street is not happy."
399;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-18T22:18:54Z;Technology transfer;;Energy and commodity companies have led the way in recent years when it comes to US earnings growth. As they tail off, can the technology sector take up the running?Analysts expect technology to become the fastest growing sector in 2007 – following the modest 9 per cent earnings growth expected for 2006. Technology alone cannot keep S&P500 earnings growing at double-digit rates. But as the biggest sector after financial services – accounting for about 15 per cent of stock market value – it can help.US corporate spending on information technology is projected to grow about in line with the 6-7 per cent seen in 2006. Company revenues should grow faster because of their exposure to less-mature overseas markets and consumer demand. But, after a tough 2006, margins will still need to expand to get near the 19 per cent earnings growth expected by analysts.Some expansion seems likely. There is high operational leverage in many technology businesses. Some also have serious recovery potential. Dell and Intel, for example, both saw their margins pummelled in 2006, providing easy comparisons.The trouble is that there was a good reason for some of the margin compression: competition. In computers, Hewlett-Packard is finally giving Dell a run for its money. Meanwhile, Intel is being challenged by AMD in microprocessors. Dell and Intel should both improve margins. But the world has changed and profitability will not bounce straight back to its old levels.The real hope is that technology companies have learnt to be more disciplined in a world of lower revenue growth. They have started demonstrating tighter management of inventories despite last year’s blip upwards. And there are signs that some companies are rising to the challenge by cutting costs and rethinking the way they do business.Overall, margins are likely to expand somewhat in 2007 despite fierce competition. But there will be winners and losers. The hefty earnings growth being pencilled in by analysts still looks too aggressive.
400;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-16T23:33:13Z;Margin fears drag Intel shares lower;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, delivered revenues at the top end of its expectations in the fourth quarter helped by higher selling prices for a new line of microprocessors.Its results were in contrast to a profit and revenue warning issued last week by its main processor rival, Advanced Micro Devices. AMD has more expensive manufacturing processes along with an older product line and had complained of lower selling prices.Intel shares fell 4 per cent in after-hours trading to $21.40 as it predicted little recovery in gross margins this year, despite its new high-end product line. It forecast gross margins, which had fallen below 50 per cent in the second half, to be around 49 per cent for the first quarter and 50 per cent for the year.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, blamed competition with AMD and costs associated with moving to the next level of miniaturisation. He said there would be a two-point margin deterioration caused by the high cost of starting up Intel’s manufacturing process for chips with 45-nanometre-width circuitry in 2007.Intel announced fourth-quarter revenues of $9.7bn, down 5 per cent on a year earlier, but up 11 per cent on the third quarter, when it predicted sales in the range of $9.1bn to $9.7bn for the final quarter. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates expected sales of $9.4bn on average and earnings per share of 25 cents.Intel reported profits of $1.5bn or 26 cents per share. The results included a gain from the sale of its cell-phone processor business and impairment and restructuring charges that added up to a net increase in earnings per share of one cent.Intel achieved a stronger second half after it introduced processors featuring two and then four brains or cores, based on its first new architecture in five years. It also shipped more than 70m microprocessors in 2006 based on smaller, more cost-effective 65-nanometre circuitry – around a year ahead of AMD’s full switchover to 65nm.Nevertheless, 2006 was a tough year for Intel as it lost market share to AMD, began a restructuring programme and cut prices to clear out old inventory. After three years of double-digit revenue and earnings growth, Intel reported revenues fell 9 per cent in 2006 to $35.4bn, while earnings per share plunged 39 per cent to 86 cents from $1.40.It ended the year with a global workforce of 94,100, down from 102,500 in the second quarter.“2006 was a challenging year,” Paul Otellini, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call.“In 2007, we will continue to drive technology including quad-core and 45 nanometre, while further increasing our operational efficiencies across the company.”
401;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-15T20:23:15Z;Technology profit warnings;;Technology companies have a proud tradition of keeping investors on their toes. Should a smattering of warnings in the run-up to the earnings season cause broader alarm in the sector?Not yet. In recent weeks, Motorola, SAP, AMD have all indicated that results would fall short of expectations. But the misses so far can be explained largely by company or sector specific issues and do not necessarily foreshadow broad-based technology weakness.Take Motorola. It has suffered mostly from pricing weakness in its mobile phone division. Not only are prices for its leading Razr phone under pressure but there is a general problem when it comes to persuading consumers to buy top-end phones, particularly in less developed markets. That is affecting companies from Nokia to Samsung. It also has a knock-on effect on chipmakers. Texas Instruments, for example, has said that it will be hit by consumers buying lower-end models, which requires less expenditure on chips.AMD’s problems appear more company-specific. Last year it stung Intel into action by taking market share and causing serious damage to its larger rival’s margins. As Intel now takes advantage of a stronger product pipeline and forces down prices in some of AMD’s core markets, the upstart microprocessor company is suffering. Intel, on the other hand, is set for a rebound because its sales and margins were hit so hard by AMD’s incursions last year.SAP and Oracle, meanwhile, have released weak new licence sales figures in recent months. That does not necessarily prefigure problems elsewhere in the software sector, given the lumpiness of their business and cut-throat rivalry. But, with SAP referring to weakness in the US market, investors should keep their eyes open for more signs that US technology demand is slowing.
402;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2007-01-12T23:48:29Z;AMD shares fall 10% after profits warning;;Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell nearly 10 per cent on Friday after the number two maker of processors for PCs warned of substantially lower profits caused by a price war with Intel, its bigger rival.AMD said its fourth-quarter gross margin and operating income were “impacted by significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices, which largely offset a significant increase in unit sales”. Operating income was “expected to be positive but substantially lower than in the third quarter”, it said, and sales should increase 3 per cent to about $1.37bn.Adding in expected revenues of $350m from ATI, its graphics chipmaker acquired in October for $5.4bn, a sales total of $1.72bn is below analyst expectations of $1.85bn for the fourth quarter. AMD’s shares fell 9.51 per cent to $18.26 in New Yrok trading.Sumit Dhanda, semiconductor analyst at Bank of America, described the figures as a big miss. He said AMD appeared to be under significant price pressure in its desktop and server processor businesses, largely due to Intel gaining market share.Joe Osha, Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst, lowered his 2007 earnings per share estimate to 15 cents, compared with a market consensus of $1.11, citing competitive pressures from Intel, slower demand and the need to digest its ATI acquisition as growth inhibitors.A slower recovery than expected in ATI’s graphics card business and AMD’s need to ramp up capacity meant that the company could lose money in the first half of the year, he warned.Glen Yeung at Citigroup downgraded AMD from “buy” to “hold”, saying it was coming under acute pricing pressure in its high-end server processors business from Intel.Intel has turned the tables on AMD in recent months, introducing its first new architecture in five years and beating AMD to the launch of quad-core processors – chips with four brains. Intel has moved to cheaper manufacturing, based on smaller 65-nanometre circuitry, a year ahead of AMD.Intel will announce its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, with analysts expecting it to report market share gains.
403;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft among tone-setters;;Technology, energy and airline shares largely dictated the tone for Wall Street this week, with a surge in Apple shares setting the pace.The slide in oil prices hurt the energy sector but provided a favourable backdrop for the broader market and could hold the key for further strength, analysts said.“Equity markets will need continued weakness in oil prices to push higher,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. He believes large pharmaceutical companies will benefit most from a further fall in oil.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent firmer at 1,430.73, its highest level since 2000, and a gain of 1.5 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 12,556.08, a new record close and gained 1.3 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.7 per cent to 2,502.82, a rise of 2.8 per cent this week.Apple set a record high of $97.80 after unveiling its new iPhone. That mood was clipped when Cisco said it had taken legal action over Apple’s use of the iPhone name and by reports of Federal scrutiny over backdated stock options given to Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive officer. Shares in Apple were 11.3 per cent higher for the week at $94.62.Marvell Technology, a chipmaker used by Apple for the iPhone, rose 5 per cent to $20.39.Other notable technology shares on the up this week included Yahoo, with a gain of 6.2 per cent to $29.45, and Microsoft, up 5.3 per cent at $31.21, its highest level since 2002.But it was not all good news for technology stocks as Advanced Micro Devices said lower product chip prices would hurt fourth quarter earnings and revenue. Shares in AMD plunged yesterday and were 7.4 per cent lower for the week at $18.26.Citigroup downgraded AMD and, although the news briefly hurt the Philadelphia semiconductor index, it was 2.9 per cent higher for the week.Shares in Intel, AMD’s rival, reversed early weakness yesterday and were up 4.9 per cent over the week at $22.13.Intel has gained 9 per cent since the start of the year and analysts believe the company has taken market share from AMD.“Intel has a reinvigorated product line that third party evaluations indicate have superior performance to AMD’s product line,” noted Citigroup.As tech hummed, oil stocks slid, led by a 5.3 per cent fall to $63.83 in ConocoPhillips. Exxon Mobil fell 0.8 per cent to $72.66, and is the weakest stock in the Dow this year with a loss of 5.3 per cent.The exchange-traded fund that tracks the energy sector of the S&P under the ticker symbol XLE fell 1 per cent to $55.44 this week and is down 11 per cent from the record high of $62.13 set in mid-December.Airline stocks were boosted by the lower oil prices, talk of further consolidation and the prospect of better earnings. The American stock exchange airline index rose 8.4 per cent this week. United Airlines’ parent UAL rose 7.8 per cent to $50.16, and made a new 52-week high. Shares in US Airways Group rose 4.3 per cent to $60.81 after it raised its offer for bankrupt Delta to $10.2bn.Earnings season began this week and Alcoa, the aluminium producer, provided a positive start. Its shares rallied 7.1 per cent to $30.79 after it beat estimates.Genentech rose 3.8 per cent to $86.83 after the biotechnology healthcare group surpassed earnings expectations.A slew of companies report results next week, and Thomson Financial said expect average earnings growth of 9.1 per cent for the fourth quarter.In the past 13 quarters earnings growth has been above 10 per cent.Shares in RadioShack rose 15.1 per cent to $19.35 and St Jude Medical jumped 10.2 per cent to $38.58 as they both raised their earnings outlooks.Sprint Nextel suffered a 10.2 per cent slide to $17.25 this week after it cut operating revenue forecasts for both 2006 and 2007.Manufacturing companies Molex and Schnitzer Steel also issued profit warnings. Molex fell 5.6 per cent to $29.06, and Schnitzer slid 8.1 per cent to $34.66.Shares in Gap rallied 7.5 per cent to $20.30 amid talk of a private equity buy-out for the company.
404;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;No Re-Viiv-al for Intel at CES;;"<!––>Las Vegas: Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, the PC processor rivals, are keeping a low profile at the Consumer Electronics Show compared to last year’s launch of their assault on the digital home.
Then Paul Otellini, chief executive, gave a keynote speech as Intel launched its Viiv home entertainment brand. AMD competed with AMD Live! and both held big parties with Intel’s featuring a concert by the Black Eyed Peas.
Today, just a couple of announcements are the highlights of their shows. Intel is launching three new quad-core processors, two for the enterprise and and its first one for the mainstream consumer – introducing the Core 2 Quad brand name for the first time. It has nothing new to say on Viiv, which has yet to become a household name.
AMD is expanding its Live! initiative from desktops to notebook PCs configured as entertainment centres. It is also providing original equipment manufacturers with a reference design for Live! Home Cinema – an all-in-one home theatre system that pushes it into the realm of consumer electronics boxes.
A reference design for a Live! Home Media Server that allows consumers to share pictures, music and videos among networked PCs completes its offering."
405;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-12-29T22:07:23Z;US stocks enjoy best perfomance since 2003;;"Investors in US stocks enjoyed the best equity market performance since 2003 this year, but the road was not easy.Fortune favoured the brave when stocks plumbed their lows during the summer and equity volatility jumped to its highest level in three years. As oil nudged $80 a barrel and the Fed was seemingly set for further rate hikes, the S&P 500 index was down 2 per cent from the start of the year, while the Nasdaq Composite was
8 per cent lower.“The year really came down to how you reacted once the market made its lows in July,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading. “If you thought the Federal Reserve still had room to tighten policy you lost. Investors who bet the Fed was done, were winners.”The subsequent rally in shares as oil prices receded propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average into record territory and the S&P back to levels not seen since late 2000. Stocks also benefited from lower long-term interest rates, better than expected third-quarter earnings of 19 per cent and a record $176,000bn in merger and acquisition activity.Still, 2006 contained its share of good and bad stock selections. “Every year is the the year of the stock picker,” said Stuart Schweitzer, a global fund manager at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management.As the year ebbed on Friday, the Dow had gained 16.3 per cent to 12,463.15. That was just shy of its record close of 12,510.57 and its intra-day record high of 12,529.88 set this week.The S&P had gained 13.6 per cent to 1,418.30 this year. All 10 big industry groups in the S&P rose by at least 5 per cent, led by a 32.1 per cent rise in the telecommunications sub-index. Energy followed with a rise of 22.2 per cent, but healthcare and information technology lagged behind with gains of 5.8 and 7.7 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq had risen 9.5 per cent to 2,415.29 for the year at the close of trading on Friday. Some big tech names such as Yahoo, down 34.8 per cent at $25.54 and Ebay, off 30.4 per cent at $30.07, endured a tough year.Leading the pack was the Russell 2000 index of small capitalised companies with a return of 17 per cent.General Motors led the Dow’s charge off its mid-year low of 10,706.14. In spite of facing significant hurdles in restructuring its car operations, its stock rallied 58.2 per cent to $30.72, and set a high of $36.56 in October.That performance paled however, when compared with Allegheny as the manufacturer of stainless steel and titanium rose 151.3 per cent to $90.68 for the year. The laggard in the Dow was Intel. The chipmaker fell 18.9 per cent this year to $20.25, as it endured falling revenues and market share amid a price war with rival chipmaker, AMD, whose stock slumped 33.5 per cent to $20.35 this year. The Philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index fell 2.4 per cent this year.Other Dow stocks ending the year in negative territory were Home Depot, down 0.8 per cent at $40.16 and Wal-Mart, off 1.3 per cent at $46.18.Boosting the Dow were Hewlett-Packard, up 44 per cent at $41.19, and Disney, 43 per cent higher at $34.27.AT&T, rose 46 per cent to $35.75, and the telecom company led the surge in merger activity with its purchase of BellSouth. The value of the deal has risen from $67bn to about $84bn and is pending approval from regulators. BellSouth has risen 74 per cent to $47.11.Another big deal was Freeport McMoRan’s $25.9bn purchase of Phelps Dodge that would create the world’s largest copper miner. Shares in Phelps jumped 66.4 per cent to $119.17 for the year.While 16 of the Dow’s 30 members failed to beat the overall market’s rise in 2006, Citigroup, with a gain of 14.8 per cent to $55.70, made a valiant effort late in the year, jumping 12.3 per cent in December as investors chased a year-end rally.A record year in earnings for investment banks was reflected in a 56 per cent rise in Goldman Sachs to $199.35.Search engine Google soared above $500 during the year and had rallied 11 per cent to $460.48 on Friday.One of the biggest companies caught in the backdated options morass was Apple. It was up 18 per cent at $84.84, off its peak of $91.89.Homebuilders were hit hard as housing slumped this yeart, led by a fall of 29.4 per cent to $51.28 in KB Home and a 25.9 per cent decline to $26.49 for DR Horton."
406;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-12-26T23:37:21Z;Intel still convinced two brains better than one;;When Intel launched its first dual-core processors, it hired Carl Reiner, the comedian who directed The Man With Two Brains, to bring some levity to the ever so technical presentation.His message was simple: these chips performed better because they had not one brain but two.But the plot could equally be an allegory for the choice PC makers have faced between Intel and its microprocessor rival Advanced Micro Devices.In the film, brain surgeon Michael Hfuhruhurr, played by Steve Martin, has to decide between keeping the brain of his beautiful but self-centred wife in her head or transplanting it with that of a kindlier soul pickled in a jar in the laboratory of a brilliant scientist.In the end, he opts for the latter course.The PC industry has been married to Intel for better or worse since it invented the microprocessor in 1971. But over the past two years, AMD has held a performance and innovation edge that has seen it gain a new level of credibility and market share. The choice for OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) between which brain should sit on their computer’s motherboard has become more difficult as the pace of innovation by both sides has quickened.Intel and AMD have close to 100 per cent of the market for the x86 processors that dominate the industry, with Intel chips traditionally finding themselves in more than four out of five PCs.But the nimble and innovative AMD has made inroads, particularly in the server segment of the market. It took more than 27 per cent of the total PC market in the first half of this year, up from 18 per cent a year earlier, according to Mercury Research.“I would say it’s more of a pitched battle now,” says Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies.“For a while it was more about Intel controlling the game and I thought AMD was a sparring partner – some company that Intel would allow to gain a bit of share if it looked as if the [anti-trust] authorities were getting anxious.“Then when they weren’t looking too closely, they would beat them up.”That was certainly the perception of AMD when it filed a major anti-trust lawsuit against Intel in June last year. It alleged that its bigger rival bullied big customers into buying exclusively from Intel and made rebates and incentives conditional on shunning AMD products.“I believe the day of reckoning is coming,” says Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, although Intel has succeeded in getting the case postponed until 2009. “The goal is to stop Intel abusing its monopoly.”He admits that AMD would effectively break any monopoly if it could reach 30 per cent market share. It got a big boost this year when Dell, recently toppled as the largest PC maker by HP, agreed to start using its processors for the first time.Dell had been suffering for sticking solely with Intel while its rivals were using AMD’s better-performing server processors. But it started to use AMD chips just as Intel was regaining the advantage.Roger Kay says a strong AMD helps PC makers drive a better bargain from both processor makers “The OEMs are getting a great opportunity to second-source. Dell is saying this is a long-term relationship with AMD, where the performance crown will trade back and forth over the next few years.”Intel has had one of its toughest years financially, with falling market share, inventory problems and a price war with AMD forcing revenues down after three years of double-digit growth.Paul Otellini, chief executive, has ordered a restructuring that will cut its workforce by more than 10,000 or about 10 per cent.But technically Intel has excelled – moving from single core to dual and, last month, quad core processors that experts say have helped it regain its performance lead. “Coming off a pretty ugly ’04 and ’05, this thing is firing on all cylinders,” says Pat Gelsinger, a senior vice president at Intel.“Everything’s ahead of schedule and we have re-leased over 40 new processors this year.”AMD is also trailing Intel in manufacturing efficiency, with Intel making processors with narrower 65-nanometre circuits in high volume while AMD is still six months away from getting up to full speed on these cheaper chips.“AMD are a year behind our cadence and if you think they are going to win the race to 32 [nanometres] or 24, you’ve got to be nuts,” says Mr Gelsinger.
407;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-12-19T22:22:00Z;Fast innovation lets PC catch up with consoles;;With the new Sony PlayStation 3 in short supply, there may be only one option left for parents seeking the latest in video game performance for their children this Christmas: buy them a PC.The plain old computer may seem unfashionable and slow beside the sleek black PS3, the most powerful games console ever made, but its image is being transformed by the latest technology and designs.At the same time, next-generation consoles are also undergoing an image change as they gain the power to perform extra functions such as surfing the web.For consumers, perceptions that the PC and the console perform very different functions will soon be challenged, and their buying decisions could become a matter of either/or, rather than feeling they need both machines.The new era of competition between the console and the PC began last month.As the PS3 and Nintendo’s Wii were launched, chipmakers Intel and AMD introduced processors with four cores or “brains” for PCs aimed at “extreme gamers”.At the same time, Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, launched two processors it claimed would “transform the PC into the definitive gaming platform”.Normally, games consoles lead PCs in performance when they are launched and are then overtaken towards the middle of the five-year cycle between generations.But a faster rhythm of innovation in the PC industry means that this time round computers are starting on an equal footing with the latest consoles.The PlayStation 3 still beats PCs in raw processing power, with nine brains inside its revolutionary Cell processor. But next year will see the advent of eight-core processors in gaming PCs, which already have superior storage and memory capabilities.Game developers have yet to fully exploit the power of the new machines. Only three PS3 games – NBA ’07, a basketball game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance and the driving challenge Ridge Racer 7 – have been launched that boast its “full HD [high-definition]” capabilities. So far there are no games that yet take advantage of PC quad-core processors.“We are at a point right now where there is a surplus of computer performance,” says Jon Peddie, a multi-media semiconductor analyst. But he says developers are fast catching up and learning to take advantage of the new consoles’ processing power.“In Europe, there are 50 games under development that do take advantage of multi-processing.”Meanwhile, Intel, AMD and Nvidia are emphasising that extreme PCs allow users to do far more than gaming.Pat Moorhead, AMD’s vice-president of advanced marketing, says: “We are calling it megatasking, we see [the gaming] enthusiast running four or five different things at once that really hit the system hard.”This could mean playing a game on one screen, while burning a DVD, downloading a high-definition movie and conducting an internet phone call on another.Though such gamers represent only a specialist corner of the computer market, their usage is seen as an indicator of future mainstream trends.Randy Stude, director of Intel’s gaming programme, says: “Enthusiast gamers are only around 8 per cent of the PC market but they are classic ‘sneezers’ – they like to infect others with their ideas.”But while the specifications of consoles and PCs may be increasingly comparable, prices currently are not.Extreme gamers can pay up to $10,000 (€7,600, £5,100) for exotically painted machines supplied by specialist assemblers such as Alienware, Falcon Northwest and Voodoo.At $599, the premium version of the PS3 may seem a bargain in comparison, particularly as it features the new Blu-ray drive, enabling games in the highest definition and greatest complexity owing to its discs’ larger storage capacity.Sony has also included a web browser in the PS3 and added built-in wireless networking, which enables easy internet connectivity. With a keyboard accessory, gamers could use it much like a PC in accessing web-based applications.The PS3’s 60-gigabyte hard drive, along with connectivity that allows extra drives to be plugged in, also gives it the storage capacity to hold and play music and videos and show photos.Even the less sophisticated Nintendo Wii, which retails in the US at $250, includes wireless internet hardware, features a web browser and handles photo display.With demand far outstripping supply, availability of both consoles is limited this Christmas, so the PC may be the only next-generation choice left for some consumers.But in 2007 consumers will have to weigh up what the Wii and PS3 consoles can offer.
408;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-12-15T20:18:26Z;Wall Street higher after CPI numbers;;US stocks rallied again this week, with a benign inflation report on Friday stoking bullish year-end sentiment and higher risk tolerance among investors.The news that headline and core consumer prices were both unchanged in November pushed the S&P 500 index to fresh six-year highs. It also generated yet another record intraday high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 12,486.30.Investors increasingly believe inflationary pressures and economic growth are both cooling. They see that as keeping Federal Reserve interest rate policy steady in 2007, or possibly sanctioning rate cuts should growth slow further.“This number is great news for the ‘Goldilocks’ economy and is very friendly for US equities and risk appetite in general,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich.Amid the rally, equity volatility as measured by the Vix index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 17 per cent this week. The low of 9.39 for the index on Friday approached its record nadir of 9.31, set in 1993.At the close on Friday, stocks had pared earlier strength.

410;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-11-30T05:18:59Z;AMD aims chips at ‘extreme gamers’;;The processor battle between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices will move to the next level of computing power Thursday with AMD launching its first quad-core product.Intel introduced quad-core products for servers, workstations and gaming enthusiasts earlier this month and AMD is now responding and taking Intel on in the “extreme gamer” segment of the PC market.However, no games have yet been released that take advantage of processors with four “brains” or cores. Furthermore, both sides can argue that their competitor has not produced a true quad-core chip.AMD’s Quad FX product is two dual-core processors placed in two separate sockets on a computer motherboard. Its first quad-core chips, with the brains on a single die, will not be ready until the middle of next year.Intel’s Core 2 Extreme quad-core processor is two dual-core processors in a single socket.Jon Peddie, a multimedia semiconductor analyst with Jon Peddie Research, said AMD’s Quad FX was probably the better performer.“You can stack up AMD processors more effectively for programs that can do multi-tasking,” he said.AMD has traditionally led Intel in the gaming enthusiasts market, which constitutes around 5 per cent of desktop PC customers.The processor manufacturers pay particular attention to gamers as pointing the way to the future needs of mainstream consumers.Randy Stude, director of Intel’s gaming programme office, said that, while there were no games able to take advantage of quad-core yet, the new products would allow greater multi-tasking by gamers. This could give them the ability to play a game while encoding video and burning DVDs, without any drag on performance.
411;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-11-16T20:46:23Z;Dell;;Not so long ago, Dell was revered for its delightfully simple yet hard-to-emulate business model. Its success rested on operating swiftly, controlling costs, growing at the expense of rivals, and further boosting its scale advantages. Stock watchers had ample reason to doubt that it could keep on doing this forever. But at least, Dell’s financial statements appeared fairly easy to dissect for a company its size.That makes the latest delay in reporting earnings for the third quarter all the more alarming. Dell blames the ongoing probes for the “complexity the company is facing in the preparation of its preliminary results”. It has yet to provide an official filing for the second quarter. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission has upgraded its inquiry to a formal investigation.All this has left analysts scratching their heads as to what the problem might be – and how long the accounting woes might drag on. One suspect area could be incentive payments from suppliers, notably Intel. These are hard to gauge from official filings and could lead to revenue restatements but should have little impact on earnings. The issue might also prove mainly historic, as preliminary second quarter results also hinted at a reduction in supplier subsidies – perhaps in response to Dell’s decision to do some of its business with AMD, Intel’s rival.This hints at a bigger concern for value investors, who have been piling into the stock in recent weeks. Even after Thursday’s weakness, Dell’s share price is up by about 25 per cent since its August low – despite further sales downgrades, strong indications of market share losses to Hewlett-Packard and operational hiccups. At the very least, the accounting probes look like an added distraction that will make it harder to address any of those issues. That alone is pretty scary with Dell trading at 23 times this year’s earnings.
412;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-11-15T00:44:58Z;Samsung goes via VIA for latest UMPC;;"The Ultra Mobile PC that was launched to a lukewarm reception by Microsoft, Intel and Samsung six months ago is back with Version 2.0 of this new category.Rather embarrassingly for Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker and champion of power-efficient processors is now missing from the triumvirate.Samsung has replaced its original Q1, which was criticised for its poor battery performance and high price, with the Q1b. It has also subsituted Intel’s original processor with one from its much smaller x86 rival VIA.VIA is currently proudly showing the Q1b around town. It points out its processor has enabled battery life to be doubled from two hours to four hours, despite a 30 per cent increase in screen brightness, and the Q1b’s price has been dropped $200 to a more affordable $900.Intel has more than 1,000 engineers working on the UMPC concept so to drop the ball and allow tiny VIA to step in shows they are going to have to work a lot harder.While there are other manufacturers of UMPCs, Samsung’s Q1 has been the flagship product of the category.Intel is expected to announce more partners at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, but VIA says it will have several announcments as well.With AMD not featuring in this segment yet, the Intel goliath has another ""David"" to deal with in UMPCs.Chris Nuttall, San Francisco"
413;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-11-14T05:26:11Z;Intel launches first quad-core chips;;Intel launches its first quad-core chips on Tuesday – the product of a reorganisation at the world’s biggest chip company that is creating a dramatic acceleration in the performance of its products.Over the past year, the company has moved from traditional processors with a single brain to those with two, and now four, in a move that has seen it overtake its rival Advanced Micro Devices and recapture its technology lead.“In one year, we’ve achieved a four-fold increase in performance. That is stunning,” Pat Gelsinger, head of Intel’s Digital Enterprise group, told the Financial Times.“We went through a period of not executing well, but we retooled and rebuilt the entire manufacturing and product model and now we are starting to deliver.”Mr Gelsinger said Intel had switched from a system of teams working in parallel on server, desktop and laptop computers to “leapfrog” teams that had converged and were delivering products for all segments of its business at the same time.This was demonstrated by its Core 2 Duo launch in the summer, with server, desktop and mobile dual-core processors delivered over a three-month period, based on Intel’s first new chip architecture in five years.In future, Intel plans to introduce a new architecture every two years based on the new method. In the interim, it will be moving the existing architectures to chips with ever smaller circuit widths.It has already moved from 90-nanometre to 65-nanometre widths and plans to progress to 45nm next year, introducing more efficiencies and cost savings.Advanced Micro Devices plans to produce quad-core chips from the middle of next year on 65nm. It says Intel’s chips are not true quad-core in that its rival has combined two dual-core chips.“With our pace of execution, we have now leapfrogged ahead of the competition and this is the heart beat we have laid out for the industry for the rest of the decade,” said Mr Gelsinger.The first quad-core chips – the Xeon 5300 and Core 2 Extreme – are designed for servers and high-end gaming machines and work stations. Quad-core chips for general consumer desktop PCs are expected to follow next year.AMD has been most successful in grabbing market share from Intel in the server segment, but the new Xeon processors offer 50 per cent faster performance than dual-core ones launched by Intel less than five months ago. The chips will cost between $455 and $1,172.
414;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-10-29T19:34:49Z;East Asia sees surge in R&D spending;;"East Asia is continuing to show spectacular growth in research and development expenditure, a comprehensive scoreboard of top R&D spenders reveals on Monday.Taiwanese and South Korean companies account for some of the most impressive growth: they increased their R&D investment by 30.5 per cent and nearly 12 per cent respectively last year, according to the scoreboard of the 1,250 biggest spenders on R&D published by the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK.Few of the 44 Taiwanese companies listed are well known in the rest of the world but their combined spending of $4.6bn over 2005/06 was 44.6 per cent higher than the average of the previous four years.Taiwanese R&D is distributed among a large number of electronics and computer companies, while in South Korea it is dominated by three fast-growing giants: Samsung and LG in electronics and Hyundai in cars. Samsung’s R&D spending has grown from $1.88bn to $5.44bn over the past four years, according to the scoreboard.R&D growth remains modest in Japan – a continuing legacy of the country’s long period of economic stagnation. Japanese companies raised spending by 4 per cent over 2005/06 and their investment was only 5.9 per cent above the average of the previous four years.In the rest of the world, the scoreboard reveals the transatlantic technology gap has widened in the past year, as US companies continue to increase R&D faster than their European rivals. Corporate R&D rose by 5.8 per cent in Europe over the past year compared with 8.2 per cent in the US.The findings will add fuel to the growing campaign in Europe for radical action to reverse the region’s long-term underperformance in industrial innovation.Mike Tubbs, who has led the R&D scoreboard analysis team for the past eight years, says there is now incontrovertible evidence that higher R&D spending tends to produce better long-term sales and profits growth.For example, technology companies that responded to the sector’s slump in sales between 2001 and 2003 by increasing R&D, such as Nokia, AMD and Juniper Networks, have done much better since then than companies that cut their R&D spending.Pharmaceuticals is the fastest-growing sector, the DTI analysis shows. When the scoreboard started in 1992, none of the top 20 R&D spenders were drugs companies; now six are.The telecommunications and chemicals industries, each of which had two top 20 companies 14 years ago, have lost them all.But the automotive sector retains the top spot, which it has held from the beginning. Pfizer, a US pharmaceuticals company, was widely predicted to take the lead in 2005/06, but Ford increased its R&D spending by 8 per cent to $8bn, in spite of its financial problems, and takes over from DaimlerChrysler as the number one on the scoreboard."
415;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-10-25T20:34:27Z;AMD plans new generation of graphics chips;;Advanced Micro Devices on Wednesday completed its $5.4bn acquisition of graphics chip maker ATI Technologies of Canada and said it would produce “Fusion” – a new kind of processor that integrates graphics processing with a computer’s central calculating functions.The news came as industry data showed larger rival Intel regaining market share with its latest processors, even though AMD had won its first orders from Dell.AMD said the new combined company would have 15,000 employees and be a “processing powerhouse”.Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, said: “In the near term, customers gain a new level of choice, and in the long term, we believe the possibilities for innovation are truly limitless.”Currently, PCs rely on a central processing unit or CPU to drive most functions and a separate graphics chip or card to handle display data. AMD said it planned to make a new class of processor integrating AMD’s own CPU microprocessor with ATI’s GPU (graphics processing unit) at the basic silicon chip level.The Fusion processors, which are expected by late 2008, would need less power and give greater performance, AMD said. “With the anticipated launch of Windows Vista, robust 3D graphics, digital media and device convergence are driving the need for greater performance, graphics capabilities and battery life,” said Phil Hester, AMD’s chief technology officer.Intel introduced processors with two cores or brains over the summer, and this appears to have translated into market share gains, according to the industry research firm Mercury.Intel’s share of the dominant “x86” microprocessor market grew from 73 per cent in the second quarter to 76 per cent in the third, according to Mercury data cited by analysts. AMD’s share increased from 22 per cent to 23 per cent, as Taiwan’s Via fell back.
416;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
417;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-10-19T00:18:58Z;AMD reports significant decline in margins;;Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 14 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after it reported a significant decline in margins caused by price-cutting in its battle with its bigger rival Intel.AMD said third-quarter gross margins fell to 51.4 per cent, down from 56.8 per cent in the second quarter. It said the decrease was largely due to lower average selling prices (ASPs) for its processors for desktop PCs.“This quarter we bounced below our [preferred] zone of 55 to 60 per cent for the first time in a long time,” admitted Bob Rivet, chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts.On Tuesday, Intel reported its margins fell to 49.1 per cent in its third quarter, down from 59.7 per cent a year earlier. It also said it had been forced to write off $100m of its inventory of older processors.Intel has spent the summer switching to a new architecture and processors with two cores or brains, leading to it cutting prices on its older inventory to try to clear it.AMD’s third-quarter results suggested it had also been forced to cut prices to compete with Intel’s new more powerful processors as well as with its older, cheaper ones.“The ASP is hard to have control over because we are in a competitive environment,” Dirk Meyer, chief operating officer, told analysts.AMD shares, which had closed 1 per cent lower at $24.23 in New York, fell a further 14 per cent in after-hours trading after the results were announced.This was despite AMD beating Wall Street’s top-line expectations of 24 cents a share in profits from $1.31bn in sales. It reported net income of 27 cents a share or $134m on revenues of $1.33bn.
418;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-10-18T01:19:46Z;Upbeat Intel bounces back;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, on Tuesday staged a comeback after three disappointing quarters, with profits and revenues for its September quarter beating Wall Street expectations.With a new product line and the technology lead regained from rival Advanced Micro Devices, Intel reported profits 47 per cent higher than the second quarter and revenues up 9 per cent. The Silicon Valley company said revenues were $8.7bn, ahead of analysts’ consensus of $8.6bn, while profits of $1.3bn or 22 cents per share were ahead of analyst expectations of 17 cents.Intel shares, down 3.2 per cent at the close in New York at $20.90 after a broker downgrade, were up more than 1 per cent in after-hours’ trading on the better-than-expected results. Intel introduced processors for servers, desktop and notebook computers over the summer that featured two cores or “brains” and were based on its first new architecture in five years.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said it was shipping four-core chips on smaller, more cost-effective 65-nanometre circuitry and would introduce a new architecture every two years – “a pace we haven’t seen in a long time”.AMD, which has beaten Intel to processor landmarks in recent years, is yet to ship on 65nm and does not plan a quad-core chip until the middle of next year.Mr Otellini said he was pleased with the third-quarter performance “with record mobile and server processor shipments, strong manufacturing execution, industry acclaim for our new products and quad-core processors now extending our leadership this quarter”.Intel reported restructuring charges of $98m – the result of a 90-day strategic review of the company that will reduce the global workforce to 95,000 by the end of the year, down 5 per cent from the end of 2005.Intel revealed the transition to its new line of dual-core processors had forced it to write off $100m of older processor inventory. Analysts had been concerned at high levels of inventory, and Intel has been cutting prices to shift older processors.Gross margins fell below 50 per cent, to 49.1 per cent, in line with Intel’s forecast in July.Revenues were 12 per cent lower and profits 35 per cent lower than the third quarter of 2005, Intel’s last strong quarter.
419;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-10-15T15:16:17Z;AMD’s David takes on the Intel Goliath;;Hector Ruiz’s actions speak far louder than his words. The unassuming chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices would have plenty to shout about on the microprocessor maker’s advances against its giant rival Intel – if only he felt at ease when sitting down and talking about his successes.They have been the result of his understated but effective management style, which has a willingness to delegate at its core.“It’s incredibly important for me to feel that I have good people around me that I can trust and that these people are in the proper seat on the bus,” he says. “Then it’s important for me to get out of the way for them to get the job done.”He shares a discomfort with media interviews with his opposite number at Intel, Paul Otellini. In this respect, both men stand in complete contrast to their shoot-from-the-hip predecessors, Jerry Sanders and Craig Barrett.“I don’t know what to say. This just happens to be a difference in style,” is his comment on the comparison.Other executives are more forthcoming. Henri Richard, AMD’s head of sales and marketing, refers to Mr Ruiz’s subtle but supportive style and praises his attitude to risk: “He’s always saying: ‘Under my watch, make sure you get speeding tickets, not parking tickets.’ He’s encouraging us to take risks and we’re in a culture where we know risks come with mistakes and as long as you don’t repeat them and you exercise strong business judgment it’s OK.”If Mr Ruiz is short on colourful soundbites, he has nonetheless made sure there has never been a dull moment for his company over the past 12 months.Intel and AMD have almost 100 per cent of the market for the “x86” processors that dominate the PC world. But Intel has traditionally had the lion’s share, providing the chips for four out of every five PCs sold. Intel has 100,000 employees worldwide compared with AMD’s 10,000 and its market capitalisation – at about $125bn (£67bn) – is also 10 times that of AMD.Yet, from the opening of AMD’s multi-billion dollar microchip plant in Dresden, Germany, a year ago to the $5.4bn acquisition of ATI, the Canadian graphics chipmaker, due to be completed this month, Mr Ruiz has been relentless in pursuit of his arch rival.The Mexican-born CEO realised soon after joining AMD in 2000 as president and chief operating officer that the company had to improve and expand on its reputation as a maker of cheap processors for desktop PCs. “Five years ago, we were a company that only had one product and was skewed towards the consumer market,” he says.“We wanted to improve the product and address the server space – in the same way that if you can meet Japanese manufacturing standards, you can meet anybody’s, we felt if we could meet server requirements, we could do well in other segments.”AMD successfully launched its Opteron processor in 2003 for the kind of servers that run company networks. By concentrating on quality and this mission-critical area, it improved its reputation for reliability and its credibility with big corporate customers.Furthermore, it began to win market share from Intel with a series of technical innovations and firsts that gave it a performance advantage over its rival’s microprocessors.It created its Direct Connect Architecture – a way of addressing computer memory to speed processes and eliminate bottlenecks. It also beat Intel in moving from 32-bit to 64-bit processors and in launching the first dual-core ones – processors with two “brains” on the same chip to handle multiple programs running at the same time and increasing response times.By the second quarter of this year, the company had 26 per cent of the server market for “x86” processors, up from less than 10 per cent at the beginning of last year. It also had a 25 per cent share of the desktop market.Mr Ruiz attributes AMD’s advances as much to listening to its customers as to the skills of its research and development team. “If we can anticipate and understand our customers’ needs perfectly then we would never need to worry about the competition,” he says. “Focus on the customer is critical, we are firmly committed to making that the centrepiece of our strategy.”Mr Ruiz has been entreating his customers for help ever since he opened up a new front against his rival in June last year – filing antitrust lawsuits against Intel in the US.AMD’s allegations include Intel forcing big customers into exclusive or non-exclusive deals, making rebates and other incentives conditional on customers not buying from AMD, forcing PC makers to boycott AMD product launches and threatening retaliation.“I believe the day of reckoning is coming to Intel’s board. More than 60 companies have opened their files to us to electronic discovery. The goal is to stop Intel abusing its monopoly.”But any day of reckoning is unlikely to happen before 2009, after a judge last month put the trial date back until April of that year and added that claims of monopolistic practices abroad were outside US jurisdiction. It was a double setback for Mr Ruiz.AMD is also under challenge from Intel’s manufacturing juggernaut. Paul Otellini said last month that 40m Intel processors had shipped on smaller, more cost-effective 65-nanometre circuitry while its competitor was still shipping on 90 nanometres. He said Intel would be first to launch quad-core chips, releasing them in November.AMD expects to be shipping quad-core chips on 65nm circuitry by the middle of next year from its state-of-the-art Dresden facility. It opened a factory there last October to double output over three years and then announced a further $2.5bn investment in May to expand production.On top of that, it said in June an option to build a multi-billion dollar plant in New York state that would be the most advanced chip factory in the world. The huge sums being committed and the uncertainty of future demand make this a high-risk business.“We are in an industry where we can’t figure out a way to do it differently,” says Mr Ruiz. “It takes two years to build a factory and two years to fill it up. It’s a modified version of Russian roulette – you pull the trigger and four years later you find out if it worked or not.”Mr Ruiz cut his losses last December in the company’s flash memory chip business, spinning it off as a savage pricing environment undermined profits from microprocessor revenues. Intel may follow suit in selling off its own flash business.“We wanted to refocus totally on x86 [microprocessors],” says Mr Ruiz.That concentration paid off in May when AMD made its biggest customer breakthrough – winning business from Dell, the largest PC maker and an Intel stronghold, for the first time. “Dell saw it to their advantage to have two suppliers.”AMD itself had always seen an advantage to having two suppliers – ATI and Nvidia – for the graphics chips for its microprocessors. But in July, Mr Ruiz decided to buy ATI, stretching the company’s finances with the $5.4bn price tag and, again, taking on Intel in matching its rival’s in-house graphics capabilities.“Everything in our industry has a level of risk, but I didn’t see this as gambling but part of our strategy of anticipating the future. We believe processing technology is going to develop as a graphics technology,” he says, alluding to growth of online video and the high visual demands of the new Windows Vista operating system.Intel appears to have achieved technology leadership with its Core 2 Duo processors, but Mr Ruiz says he believes that such leadership will flip back and forth and the right strategy will be more important.“We believe the market needs a level playing field. The math seems to show that the monopoly breaks at about 30 per cent [revenue share] of the market. So we need to get to that number, that’s the milestone. We hope to do it sooner or later, not only for us but for consumers and customers.”Passage to Texas and AMDMr Ruiz was born in the town of Piedro Negras on the Mexican side of the US border 60 years ago. He learned English from a Methodist missionary he ran errands for and she persuaded his parents to allow him to walk across the border every day to attend high school in Eagle Pass, Texas.He went on to earn electrical engineering degrees from the University of Texas at Austin, a city he now resides in and where AMD has a significant manufacturing base away from its Silicon Valley headquarters of Sunnyvale.He joined the company in 2000 after spending five years at Texas Instruments from 1972 and then the next 22 years at Motorola. At TI, he worked on the team that developed the first single-chip calculator. At Motorola, he eventually became president of its semiconductor products division.He joined AMD as president and chief operating officer and was groomed by Jerry Sanders, its flamboyant founder, to succeed him as chief executive in April 2002, later becoming chairman of the board as well.

Its shares have dropped 27 per cent this year.“Given few strong equity products at Legg right now, equity net outflows are likely to continue,” said Merrill’s Guy Moszkowski in a note to investors. “Without equity net inflows, and after three [quarters of] earnings disappointments, Legg is likely to trade at a 10 per cent discount to the peer average.”The news dented shares in brokerages that were also suffering after Bank of America announced that it would give 30 free trades a month to customers with $25,000 in deposits at the bank.Charles Schwab fell 4.7 per cent to $17.22 while TD Ameritrade lost 11.9 per cent to $16.82 and E*trade shed 8.8 per cent to $22.31. The AMEX Securities Broker Index sank 4.2 per cent, its worst day in four months.Aluminium producer Alcoa, the first Dow component to report earnings, lost 5.1 per cent to $26.85. Late on Tuesday, it announced an 86 per cent increase in third quarter profit, significantly less than analysts had ex-pected. Alcoa attributed the results to lower aluminium prices and weakness in the home-building and car- manufacturing markets.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, or 3.47 points, at 1,349.95, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent, or 7.16 points, at 2,308.27.

The Brussels regulator could also force the group to change its business conduct.Intel said: “Intel is continuing to co-operate with regulators from the European Commission. We believe our business practices are both fair and lawful.“This is a confidential process so we will have no further comment.”

They said average selling prices increased by a third in August “supporting our view that pricing has stabilised . . . and easing investor concerns of a [microprocessor] price war”.But average selling prices were down 18 per cent on a year ago, reflecting the strong competition between Intel and AMD.Merrill Lynch analysts pointed out that microprocessor bookings “grew an impressive 86 per cent month-on-month . . . it’s clear that August benefited from pushed-out demand from earlier in the year”.George Scalise, SIA president, said there had been relatively strong sales across a broad range of semiconductor products, reflecting healthy end markets. Sales were up 2.1 per cent on July and 10 per cent on the $18.6bn recorded in August 2005. The previous record monthly sales were $20.4bn in November last year.“Sales growth was led by [dynamic random access memory chips], which increased by 7.5 per cent from July and by 31.5 per cent from August 2005, an indication that PC sales remained strong,” he said.

The S&P 500 reached a five-and-a-half year high during the week.The main indices made their strongest gains early in the week, buoyed by bullish analyst sentiment, higher earnings forecasts and upbeat comments on the US economy and inflation from the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve.Tobacco stocks sank after a federal judge in New York granted class action status to smokers of light cigarettes. Altria, parent of Philip Morris, tumbled 7 per cent to $76.55 on the week, and the S&P Tobacco Index had its worst week in more than two years.The semiconductor sector had a mixed week. Shares in Broadcom gained 8.9 per cent to $30.34 after BMO Capital Markets raised its fourth-quarter and 2007 earnings forecasts for the company.Intel surged 7.9 per cent during the week to $20.57 – its best week since August 2003. On Tuesday, it said it would begin shipping microprocessors containing four cores in November. The chipmaker also won a legal victory with the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by rival Advanced Micro Devices.PMC-Sierra, however, lost 8.2 per cent to $5.94 after it lowered its revenue forecasts for the third quarter due to weak demand for communications chips.The slowdown in the
communications sector fed through to Ciena, maker of networking equipment for the telecommunications industry, which sank 9.3 per cent to $27.25.General Motors jumped
8.6 per cent over the week to $33.26, as GM’s chief executive Rick Wagoner met in Paris with Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Renault to discuss a possible alliance. The stock was further boosted when Kirk Kerkorian said his Tracinda investment group, which already owns nearly 10 per cent of GM’s stock, might increase its holding by 10m shares.At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 39.38 points, for the day at 11,679.07, up 1.5 per cent on the week.The Dow reached its second-highest intra-day level on Friday, and also had its second highest close ever on Thursday. However, the blue-chip index was still about 70 points short of its all-time high.The S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, or 3.30 points, for the day at 1,335.85, a gain for the week of 1.6 per cent. It too rose to a multi-year high on the week, at one stage reaching its highest level since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.59 points lower, for the day at 2,258.43, a 1.8 per cent rise for the week.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 had their best quarters since 2004, rising 4.7 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks still gained over the quarter but by less, rising 4 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.The Dow and S&P 500 also outperformed the Nasdaq and Russell in the previous quarter.“It’s been an extremely strong quarter and it’s certainly been a surprisingly strong September,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who believes equities will advance at a slower pace in the final three months of the year. “I expect another positive quarter, but I don’t think it can be as strong as last quarter,” he said.Since the beginning of the year, the Dow has risen 9 per cent, followed closely by the Russell, which added 7.9 per cent. The S&P 500 has returned 7 per cent, while the Nasdaq remains a laggard, gaining 2.4 per cent.Heavy machinery makers made strong gains on the week. Caterpillar fuelled much of the Dow’s advances as it added 4.8 per cent to $65.80. Deere, which makes farm equipment, gained 8.1 per cent to $83.91 following bullish comments on the stock in investor magazine Barron’s.After falling for the past four weeks, crude oil closed higher this week.

428;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-09-27T17:57:28Z;Setback for AMD in Intel court battle;;Advanced Micro Devices has suffered a significant setback in its antitrust case against rival chipmaker Intel, with a judge dismissing large portions of its case and deferring a trial until 2009.Judge Joseph Farnan, a district judge in Delaware, granted a motion by Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, to dismiss claims of illegal monopolistic practices committed abroad, ruling they were outside US jurisdiction.The claims are understood to form around half of AMD’s case against Intel and include allegations of anti-competitive practices in the UK, Germany, Taiwan and Japan. AMD was Wedmesday considering an appeal after a meeting between the judge and lawyers from both sides.Judge Farnan told them he was extending document discovery until next April, and setting a trial date of April 27 2009.AMD had been trying to get the case to trial by September 2008. “Notwithstanding the judge’s ruling …Intel cannot escape antitrust scrutiny for its conduct …wherever in the world it occurs,” said Tom McCoy, AMD’s executive vice president of legal affairs.“As this US litigation is joined by global antitrust investigations, it is clear that Intel cannot escape the consequences of its illegal monopoly abuses.”Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy commented: “We are pleased that the judge agreed with our motion and our legal arguments.”AMD launched its case in the US in June last year. Previously, it had complained to the European Commission about Intel’s practices in 2000 and 2003, but the Commission’s most significant actions so far were raids on Intel offices in Europe last year. In March 2005, Japan’s Fair Trade Commission ruled that Intel had abused its monopoly power there, and last February, South Korea’s FTC raided Intel offices as part of a probe into anti-competitiveness allegations.AMD’s allegations include Intel forcing major customers into exclusive or non-exclusive deals, making rebates and other incentives conditional on customers not buying from AMD and forcing PC makers to boycott AMD launches and promotions.Intel denied the allegations and argued in its motion that AMD made its microprocessors in Germany and assembled them in Malaysia, Singapore and China.It said AMD was seeking recovery of lost sales for foreign-made microprocessors to foreign countries – outside US jurisdiction.
429;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-09-27T00:50:53Z;Intel claims new lead over AMD;;"Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, on Tuesday announced shipment dates for the first microprocessors with four cores or brains and said it had regained its technology leadership over its biggest rival Advanced Micro Devices.Paul Otellini, chief executive, told the Intel Developer Forum that the company’s first quad-core processors would appear in November on high-end PCs for gamers and on servers.The Xeon server chips would offer a 50 per cent increase in performance on dual-core chips released less than six months earlier.“Much has been written in the last year about Intel losing its momentum, losing its leadership in the server market space,” he said.“I believe very much that with this new set of dual and quad-core microprocessors we’ve now regained our leadership.”Intel and Mr Otellini have suffered a torrid 12 months of chipset shortages, loss of market share to AMD and poor financial results.Revenues are expected to decline in 2006 after three years of double-digit growth and Intel shares are down more than 20 per cent this year.The chief executive has also been forced into restructuring to improve performance, deciding to reduce the global workforce by 10 per cent to 92,000 following a 90-day strategic review.“I saw the need to make these changes perhaps earlier than others inside the company and now I see that we are coming out the other side of it,” he said in an FT interview.“That, combined with the product cycle, which is going extremely well, gives me confidence in where we’re going.”The tide turned for Intel in the summer as it launched dual-core microprocessors based on a new architecture for servers, desktops and laptops that overtook AMD processors in performance in many independent lab tests.Intel also leveraged its manufacturing might to its advantage.Mr Otellini said 40m processors had now shipped on smaller, more cost
effective 65-nanometre-circuitry when its competitor was still shipping on 90 nanometres.AMD plans to ship its first quad-core processors on 65nm circuits by the middle of next year.“I think [our factories] have hit turbo mode: the yields are fantastic,
the factories are outperforming on every metric we have and there’s very good demand in what is a tough year,” Mr Otellini told the FT.Winning back market share remained the goal, he said. Intel’s share of PC microprocessors fell to 72.9 per cent in the second
quarter, down from 82.2 per cent a year earlier, according to Mercury Research.Intel shares closed nearly 3 per cent higher in New York at $19.96 on the back of Mr Otellini’s upbeat comments."

Nucor added 4.9 per cent to $44.47 and Allegheny Technologies rose 7.2 per cent to $63.28.Bullish analyst comments helped push Ebay up 5.5 per cent to $27.67. Goldman Sachs issued a research note saying shares in the online auctioneer could reach $35 in the next few months as it improves revenue growth and listings.Intel gained 2.8 per cent to $19.96 after it announced it would release a new microchip with four processing cores.This pushed down other chipmakers. Broadcom shed 1.7 per cent to $29.86 and Advanced Micro Devices dipped 2.8 per cent to $26.00.PMC-Sierra sank 8.4 per cent to $6.00 after it cut its third-quarter revenue forecast due to weak demand for communications products.At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent, or 93.58 points, at 11,669.39, its highest close since January 2000, and second-highest close ever.The S&P 500 finished at a five-year high of 1,336.34, up 0.8 per cent or 9.97 points on the day. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent, or 12.27 points, at 2,261.34.The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index rose to 104.5 in September, up from a reading of 100.2 in August and ahead of analyst estimates of 103, showing that falling oil prices have cheered consumers, despite the housing slowdown.Markets were further buoyed by the Richmond Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index, which also rose more than expected.Richard Cripps, chief market analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said money was flowing into equities as some investors realised their bearish forecasts for September had not been borne out.“A significant number of investors were expecting a difficult month,” he said.“Heading into the end of the quarter with the S&P 500 at a five-year high is pressuring a lot of sideline money to be invested. [Investment managers] do not want to show that they have bearish positions.”Gains in gold and copper prices buoyed miners. Barrick Gold rose 4 per cent to $30.25, and Freeport McMoran also jumped 4 per cent to $53.50.General Motors added 3.8 per cent to $31.75.

431;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-09-18T20:59:19Z;Sun worship dries up global silicon supplies;;California’s Silicon Valley is suffering acute shortages of the very material that gave it its name.But the main victims of the squeeze are proving to be new solar-panel producers with insatiable needs rather than the semiconductor companies who established the valley’s reputation with their silicon chips.The base material for both chips and the vast majority of solar panels is polycrystalline silicon, or polysilicon, which is raw silicon refined to 99.99999 per cent purity.The global solar-panel industry, boosted by government subsidies and incentives, is expected to consume 30 per cent of world supplies this year.But the production of polysilicon is limited to a handful of factories, which have been unable to keep up with demand.“I think the incentives that have been given in Europe and other areas have really spurred the growth and that’s what put the squeeze on. Solar panels consume a phenomenal amount of silicon,” says Len Jelinek, a principal analyst with the iSuppli research firm.Photovoltaic panels are made of silicon wafers laid side by side to absorb the sun and convert it to electricity. The more used, the greater the energy produced.But prices have risen from an average of $30 a kilogram for polysilicon in 2003 to about $72 this year, with some companies desperate enough to pay more than $300 for a few tonnes on the spot market.Solar-panel companies in Silicon Valley include SunPower, a spin-off from Cypress Semiconductor that floated successfully last year, and Google-backed Nanosolar and Miasole, who are both using a copper alloy rather than silicon for their solar cells.Most semiconductor companies, including Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, appear to have long-term fixed contracts for their polysilicon needs.Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting chipmakers are becoming concerned about the shortages and are beginning to stockpile silicon wafers.Industry figures show wafer shipments rose 22 per cent in the second quarter when sales of finished chips were up only 9 per cent.It was the third successive quarter that wafer shipments were up more than 20 per cent on the previous year but chip sales grew only in single digits.“That would indicate to me that the purchasing agents have noticed that supply and demand are tightening, so they are buying more than they need,” says Rich Winegarner, president of Sage Concepts, a market research firm specialising in semiconductor materials.

But it must first overcome an acute shortage of the commodity, which is throttling its expansion.Raw silicon refined to 99.99999 per cent purity for use by chipmakers such as Intel and AMD – and also by makers of solar panels – is known as polycrystalline ­silicon, or polysilicon.While the semiconductor industry has concentrated on miniaturisation – squeezing more and more transistors on to silicon wafers – the solar panel industry ­creates larger areas of silicon to absorb the sun’s rays.In 2005, the solar panel industry grew by 30 per cent, but analysts at Piper Jaffray expect only 5 per cent growth in 2006 due to the shortage of polysilicon. This has been caused by the industry’s rapid expansion – the result of government subsidies and incentives – and its insatiable appetite for the material. Some 30 per cent of world supplies are expected to be used on solar panels this year.This has caught polysilicon manufacturers by surprise. Production of about 26,000 metric tonnes in 2005 came from a small number of producers including Hemlock Semiconductor and MEMC of the US, REC and Elkem of Norway, Wacker of Germany and Tokuyama of Japan. While they recognised last year the need for extra capacity, it takes three years for new plants to come on stream, creating acute shortages until 2008. The squeeze comes at a time when chipmakers are also expanding their “fabs” or factories, using larger silicon discs.“You’ve got one input going into two outputs,” says Len Jelinek, principal analyst for the iSuppli research firm. “In the short term it’s kind of a perfect storm. You’ve got everything going against you and everybody trying to react after the fact.”Chipmakers are in a better position than solar panel makers as many have long-term contracts at fixed prices to ensure supplies. The silicon is also a lower part of the overall value of their chips compared with the cost structures of the solar panel makers, meaning they can afford to outbid the newcomers.Prices have risen from about $30 per kg in 2003 to around $72 now, according to Rich Winegarner, president of market research firm Sage Concepts.With no properly established spot market for the material, though, some buyers are paying more than $300 per kg for a few tonnes of silicon. “It does show the degree of desperation of buyers,” he says.More than 90 per cent of solar panels being produced today use large amounts of silicon, leading to the development of thin-film solar cells, where a layer of silicon thinner than a human hair is deposited on to glass, plastic or metal.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest maker of tools for the semiconductor industry, has transferred its expertise to the solar industry. It is based in the valley, along with solar power companies such as SunPower, Nanosolar and Miasole. This month, it announced its new solar strategy, saying it aimed to reduce the cost of generating a watt of electricity from $3 to $1.“We see the silicon shortage as a catalyst more than a permanent or critical feature,” says Mark Pinto, Applied Material’s chief technology officer. “It’s obviously choking the industry, a lot of people don’t have secure supply and they’re having to make the wafers thinner and thinner.”The wafers are now so thin they break easily but Applied’s equipment promises more sensitive handling and better yields. Its expertise in making equipment for the flat-panel display industry and its acquisition of Applied Films, which specialises in thin-film deposition of materials, means it can also help achieve finer coatings of silicon on glass-based solar panels.In 1980, factories were producing panels generating a total of 1MW of power a year. In 2000 that rose to 10MW, but Applied says a leap needs to be made from current 100MW fabs costing $200m to gigawatt factories that would cost up to 10 times as much to build.Mr Winegarner says the solar industry’s use of polysilicon in Silicon Valley will match that of the chipmakers when supplies get back to normal in 2008: “Twenty years from now, the primary use of that material will be solar and semiconductors will represent a small niche.”
433;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;EU expands Intel antitrust probe;;"European regulators have expanded their antitrust probe against Intel to include charges that the world’s largest chip company tried to prevent retailers from offering computers powered by rival microprocessors.The European Commission, which has been investigating Intel’s business practices for more than five years, on Monday said that it had taken over a probe that was started by Germany’s Federal Cartel Office earlier this year.It centres on allegations that Intel attempted to hurt Advanced Micro Devices, its rival, by cutting off the company’s access to the Media Markt and Saturn retail outlets. Owned by Metro, the German group, the chains are Europe’s biggest computer retailers.A spokesman for Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said the Commission and the German regulator had agreed that it would make more sense for Brussels to take on this probe. The Commission, he added, was already “looking into a range of tactics used by Intel to limit market penetration of AMD”.A spokesman for AMD said: “We are pleased to learn that DG Competition [the Commission’s antitrust arm] is examining Intel’s exclusive relationship with Media Saturn Holding. We are confident that DG Competition will conclude what the industry has known for years; that Intel has entered into an exclusivity agreement with Europe’s largest computer retailer.”Intel is the dominant force in the global market for microchips, with a markets share of about 80 per cent. AMD, its only rival, has said for years that its business has suffered because of Intel’s allegedly illegal businesses practices, and has complained to antitrust watchdogs globally. It has also launched a private litigation case against Intel in the US.As part of its investigation, the Commission raided the offices of Intel and several computer manufacturers last year. The next step would be for Brussels to issue formal antitrust charges against the US chipmaker, a move that could ultimately lead to painful financial penalties for Intel.A spokesman for Intel said: “We plan to co-operate with the staff of the European Commission. We believe our business practices are lawful.”"

Wall Street analysts had been expecting larger cuts, and the stock lost 3.4 per cent to $19.31, making it the biggest faller in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Other chipmakers followed Intel lower. Advanced Micro Devices fell 6.5 per cent to $24.53, and Broadcom lost 5.4 per cent to $27.48. In spite of the falls, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is still up 15 per cent in the past six weeks.General Motors was one of the rare bright spots, adding 2.4 per cent to $31.17, after it increased the warranty on its vehicles to 100,000 miles.Ford Motor also gained, jumping 1.9 per cent to $8.55, its highest level since the beginning of February. The rise came after the carmaker announced after the closing bell on Tuesday that Bill Ford was stepping down as chief executive and would be replaced by Alan Mulally of Boeing. Ford and GM were the day’s best performers in the S&P 500.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent, or 12.99 points, at 1,300.26, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.7 per cent, or 37.86 points, at 2,167.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6 per cent, or 63.08 points, at 11,406.20.Unit labour costs rose a greater than expected 4.9 per cent in the second quarter according to the US Labor Department.“It was the unit labour cost data that set everybody back,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, who does not believe the declines signalled a reversal in the trend of the market.“We have had a month-long rally without much of a decline, so today’s decline does not really upset the apple cart. From a trader’s perspective, it’s a buying opportunity.”Crude oil prices continued to sag as talks with Iran over its uranium enrichment programme continue. Occidental Petroleum shed 6 per cent to $47.78 and Sunoco lost 5.6 per cent to $67.24.Sara Lee, maker of Hillshire Farm sausages and Kiwi shoe polish, announced late on Tuesday that it had completed the spin-off of its apparel group Hanesbrands, which includes the Wonderbra and Champion Sports brands. Sara Lee climbed 4.1 per cent to $14.78, while Hanesbrands climbed 6.6 per cent to $21.11 on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Homebuilders were affected by interest rate fears. Centex slipped 4.5 per cent to $48.07, and DR Horton tumbled 3.7 per cent to $21.00. DR Horton has lost 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.
435;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-09-06T20:28:38Z;Intel;;"The world has changed. Intel is finally responding. The chip maker’s latest plan to cut 10,500 jobs is a response to the tough pricing environment and market share losses to AMD.Although certainly a step in the right direction, the headline numbers exaggerate the scale of the restructuring. About 5,000 employees were already set to leave through natural attrition, previously announced lay-offs and the sale of a mobile phone chip business. More pain will be required. The prospect of further restructuring – including the chance of businesses being sold – and recent new product launches do provide some solace for investors. After all, the shares have fallen 22 per cent so far this year.Unfortunately, Intel has far deeper problems that it will struggle to find
a quick solution to. First, the PC market, which accounts for the vast bulk of Intel’s revenues has been slowing down, particularly in the developed world. Second, smaller rival AMD has taken market share with innovative products and has managed to get its foot in the door at key customers who once used only Intel. Dell is a recent example.Now that computer makers have credible dual-supply, they will want to ensure that AMD remains healthy to keep pressure on microprocessor prices – particularly important in a slowing PC market, given how expensive the component is. Intel will be pushed to recapture anything like its historical growth rate or margins.There might be some short-term relief for investors if further cost-cutting starts to reverse the steady drip of earnings downgrades so far this year. But, with the shares still trading at more than 18-times next year’s consensus earnings, the tough industry backdrop should be enough to keep investors from rushing in."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 5.13 points, at 11,469.28.Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak, said that after the holiday weekend many investors were still deciding on their trading strategies, adding that more aggressive money managers would be preparing to exploit the traditionally sluggish September market. “People do not have any clear cut plans yet, but a lot of the gunslingers are expecting the market to go down [in September],” he said.Chevron rose 2.3 per cent to $66.34 in spite of falling crude oil prices. The energy group announced it had found oil in deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Devon Energy, which drilled the well and owns a 25 per cent stake in the project, gained 12.5 per cent to $72.14.Other oil groups also advanced. Anadarko Petroleum jumped 5.7 per cent to $50.24 and Pride International rose 6.1 per cent to $29.06.Apple Computer leapt 4.5 per cent to $71.48 amid speculation that it would soon make feature films available for download through its iTunes online music store.Rumours that carmaker Renault would choose Lehman Brothers as its adviser for a possible tie-up with General Motors helped buoy shares in the investment bank, which climbed 4.3 per cent to $66.25.Media group Viacom announced the departure of Tom Freston, chief executive, dragging shares down 5.4 per cent to $34.97. Viacom’s share price has lost more than 10 per cent since the group split from parent CBS at the start of the year.Construction machinery maker Caterpillar added

437;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-08-23T18:07:03Z;Dell;;Talk about crashing and burning. As if Dell’s share price collapse was not enough, it was forced to recall 4.1m spontaneously combustible batteries.It is no secret that Dell is malfunctioning. Hewlett-Packard recently outpaced its rival on revenue growth from computers. Meanwhile, Dell’s operating margins have shrunk from more than 8 per cent in recent years to 4.3 per cent. HP’s computer division, having looked structurally unprofitable not long ago, almost matched Dell’s margins last quarter.Can Dell be rebooted? Probably. Problems have been exacerbated by the slowing PC market, which has played to HP’s strengths. The fastest growth has been overseas and among consumers, where HP is stronger. Dell has expanded in Asia, but is still exposed to US corporations. There, demand is likely to stay sluggish until next year’s planned release of Microsoft’s Vista operating system.That said, Dell’s execution has been poor while HP got its act together. Dell’s recent price cuts have not yielded the volume increases they once did, putting pressure on profitability. It needs a new formula to keep raising already high market shares without damaging margins further. Dell’s profitability has also been squeezed by the cost of improving customer service and higher-than-expected component prices. The former is an extra cost of doing business. The latter should be corrected to an extent following its woefully late use of AMD chips.Dell’s malaise will not end overnight. But, in spite of the wave of bad news, it is too early to write Dell off. It has reinvented itself before and still has the most efficient model. Sanford Bernstein estimates the shares trade on about 19 times this year’s earnings. While cheap by historical standards, that is no bargain in the cold light of today.The crux is whether Dell’s earnings are artificially depressed and the company can claw back its margins. The latest quarter should be a low point, with improvements underpinning the stock from here. But, with HP back in shape, Dell will not re-open anything like the gap it once enjoyed relative to its rival.

It reported a 19 per cent fall in third-quarter profits as a result of the downturn in the US housing market. Results were in line with analysts’ expectations. Toll Brothers’ earnings guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter also was better than market forecasts.Timber company Weyerhaeuser rose 5.2 per cent to $60.03, its best day since April, after a note from Deutsche Bank saying the group was open to restructuring pressure and potential unsolicited buyout bids.Advanced Micro Devices gained 6.3 per cent to $24.88 after an executive said the chipmaker hoped to capture 40 per cent of the global server market by 2009.Jabil Circuit continued its month-long rally, jumping 1.6 per cent to $27.65.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.30 points, at 1,298.82, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent, or 2.27 points, at 2,150.02. The Dow was flat, down 5.20 points, to 11,339.84.Stocks gained early in the morning on hopes of talks over Iran’s nuclear programme, but major indices moved lower after comments from Michael Moskow, a Federal Reserve official, interpreted by the market as raising the chances of further interest rate hikes.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the jittery trading was mostly attributable to the lack of economic data on the horizon.“It’s a doldrum period. There’s not a lot of catalytic news this week,” he said.Mr Dow downplayed the importance of comments by Mr Moskow. “I don’t think anybody is viewing this as any change in Fed posture.”Electricity generator Mirant said shareholders had tendered enough shares for it to proceed with its 43m share buyback programme. Its shares ticked up 4.2 per cent to $28.70. Mirant is up 25 per cent so far this year.XM Satellite Radio was up 20.3 per cent to $13.52 after Bear Stearns changed its rating from “underperform” to “outperform”.

On Friday, the computer maker reported a 51 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, and announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating it for the past year over accounting issues. The news dented some of the 8 per cent gain it had made on the week but, by the close, Dell was still up 5.2 per cent for the week at $22.16. The stock has dropped 26 per cent this year.Dell’s main rival, Hewlett-Packard, fared even better, climbing 7.5 per cent to $35.52 after it reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. The maker of personal computers and printers also announced a $6bn share buyback and gave bullish earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.HP has risen 24 per cent this year to its highest level since the beginning of 2001.Chipmakers had a strong week, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index gaining 10 per cent, its best week in three years.Microsoft jumped 5.6 per cent to $25.79 on the week after it announced it was increasing its share buyback programme by $16.2bn.PMC-Sierra rose 26.1 per cent to $6.38 after it said it had concluded its stock options investigation and had not found any deliberate misconduct by staff.

Along with accelerating $3bn in cost cuts and increasing investments in customer services, Dell said it would extend its use of microchips made by Advanced Micro Devices in an effort to re-invigorate sales.Dell has been using AMD chips since May, when it dropped its decades-old exclusive reliance on Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, and began installing AMD processors in some of its high-end servers. Dell said on Thursday it would begin offering AMD processors in its Dimension desktop computers next month.Falling prices, weak sales growth and increased competition from rival computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer have bruised Dell’s reputation as the unchallenged leader in the PC market this year. Shares in the company have fallen more than 50 per cent in the past 12 months.Dell said it made earnings of $502m in the second quarter, well below the $1bn in profits it recorded in the second quarter last year. Earnings per share were 22 cents a share, compared with 41 cents last year. Sales grew 5 per cent to $14.1bn – much lower than the company’s traditional sales growth of the mid- to high-teens.The US produced the biggest drag on sales, with growth of 1 per cent.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent.

443;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-08-04T17:04:49Z;On Wall Street: Apocalyptic year for tech Horsemen;;"Judging by the best known indices of the US stock market, this has been an unspectacular but acceptable year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are both up.But that conceals one hugely important sector of the economy that is suffering through a biblically awful year – technology. The Nasdaq Composite is down
5.1 per cent for the year. In the six years since the bottom was savagely kicked out of the late 1990s bull market in tech stocks, the Nasdaq has done little more than move sideways.Internet names such as Yahoo, Amazon.com, and Ebay have all sustained losses. But the extent of the damage is clearest from the four stocks once dubbed the Four Horsemen of Technology – Microsoft, Intel, Dell and Cisco Systems. Unlike many of the dotcoms, they made real profits on the back of very real revenues. Dell became dominant in its market, while the other three were industry standards, if not effective monopolies.Unlike pets.com, these companies are still with us, and still making money. But their performance this year brings four very different Horsemen to mind.For War, look at Intel. At one point seemingly every computer had “Intel inside”. But it is now locked in a battle for market share, most notably with Advanced Micro Devices, which it is not winning. And look what is happening to its share price – down
31 per cent for the year, as part of a long-term
77 per cent slide from
its peak.For Famine, there is Dell. Its business model may indeed have turned out to be the best way to sell computers but demand is not growing at anything like the rate it once did. Its shares are down 62 per cent from their peak and
26 per cent for the year.For Pestilence, read Microsoft. Quite apart from PCs’ vulnerability to viruses, beautifully ridiculed by its rival Apple in its current advertising campaign, its product development pipeline seems to have caught a cold. The market is alarmed about the prospects of delays to its Vista operating system, due early next year, while many complain that the entire Windows architecture is sickly and overloaded. Its shares are down 59 per cent from their peak, but only
8 per cent for the year – although they would have been much worse if the company had not announced a $40bn buyback to support the price.The analogy breaks down when it comes to Cisco. Its shares are up 2.5 per cent for the year, so it cannot be likened to Death. But Cisco typifies the death of the cult of the tech stock better than any of the others. At the peak of the madness in 2000, it sold at an earnings multiple of more than 200. It now trades at less than a tenth of that. Its share price is down 78 per cent since the 2000 peak.And if the comparison to the Horsemen of the Apocalypse seems overdone, bear in mind that the scenarios currently worrying the market, particularly for Microsoft, are truly apocalyptic. The fear is that nimbler companies distributing software over the internet – led, naturally, by Google – have a superior business model, which will do to Bill Gates’ company what it did to IBM in the 1980s and Apple in the 1990s.Is this overdone? Quite possibly. It is not so bad to be the loser in one of these strategic battles. Timed correctly, investments in both Apple and IBM, historic strategic losers, would both have been very handy investments. The market value of those two companies combined is now only 25 per cent lower than that of Microsoft.A company as powerful and ubiquitous as Microsoft will surely find ways to make money for many years to come.But in the longer term, the way the market is behaving this year makes sense. Eventually, the tech sector will mature, and become “ex-growth”.Bruce Greenwald, the Columbia Business School professor whose course on value investing is recommended even by Warren Buffett, nails this phenomenon memorably. “In the long run,” he says, “everything is a toaster.” In other words, all great innovations eventually become commodities, bought on the basis of price and nothing else.Sooner or later, Microsoft software programs, Intel micro-processors, Dell computers and Cisco routers will all be toasters. The question is when. Mr Market has this year placed a bet that that moment is coming sooner than it had previously thought."

Its shares tumbled 11.8 per cent to $17.75.Offshore oil rig operator Transocean sank 8.7 per cent to $71.80 after it reported a worse-than-expected fall in quarterly profit.Shares of medical device makers sank after Medtronic warned that revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter would fall short of its own forecasts due to a downturn in the US defibrillator market. Its shares fell 13 per cent to $44.32. St Jude Medical tumbled 10.9 per cent to $33.70 and Boston Scientific shed 7.7 per cent to $16.27.Starbucks sank 8 per cent to $30.64. After the bell on Wednesday, the coffee chain reported a 16 per cent rise in third-quarter profits. However, sales growth for July fell below levels from a year ago due to staffing problems as consumers ordered more labour-intensive iced drinks.Procter & Gamble added 2 per cent to $59.45 after rival consumer products group Unilever disappointed analysts with lower margins.Prudential Financial slid 5.9 per cent to $73.66 after it missed analyst estimates and reported a 43 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings due to falling income at its insurance division.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.72 points, at 1,280.27, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent, or 13.53 points, at 2,092.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 42.66 points, at 11,242.59.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach believes two factors helped pull the major indices back into positive territory.“There was some short covering ahead of tomorrow’s [Friday] employment data. There also seems to be some good indications that the Middle East violence might be coming to an end.”Technology staged a rally. Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.3 per cent to $20.45 following a bullish analyst comment on the stock, while Ebay added 4.7 per cent to $24.07. Google gained 2.2 per cent to $375.39.Nordstrom and Limited Brands both pushed higher after their same-store sales for July beat Wall Street forecasts. Nordstrom gained 6.8 per cent to $35.62 and Limited added 5.4 per cent to $25.81.However, the real drag on the consumer sector was in casino stocks. Las Vegas Sands posted solid profit growth thanks to a strong performance at its Macau casino, but revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, pushing shares down 6.9 per cent to $60.81.MGM Mirage also sold off, losing 7.1 per cent to $35.31, after second-quarter earnings fell shy of Wall Street forecasts.
445;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-08-01T22:13:08Z;Intel’s chip stockpiles create glut;;Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has almost single-handedly created the biggest semiconductor glut in the industry since it was hit by massive stockpiles two years ago, according to a leading research firm.ISuppli on Tuesday estimated the value of surplus chip inventories in the second quarter at $2bn, higher than the $1.6bn recorded in the third quarter of 2004 - the peak of the last inventory mountain.The figure is 78 per cent higher than the $1.1bn recorded in the first quarter and is the highest since the $2.5bn accumulated in the third quarter of 2002.“Excess inventories have exceeded the worrying levels seen during the last semiconductor supply snafu in mid-2004,” said Rosemary Farrell, an iSuppli analyst.“However, with most of the excess inventory restricted to PC-related chips and mainly to a single supplier – Intel Corp – the surplus stockpiles are not a major concern for the global electronics industry.”Inventory build-ups can signal falling demand and lead to lower prices and sometimes write-offs of stock by manufacturers.Analysts expressed concern at Intel’s inventory levels during its second-quarter earnings call last month. But Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, said it would take a drop in demand of 10 to 15 per cent for it to consider any inventory write-offs.Intel’s inventory of $4.3bn was up more than $750m from the first quarter. It said that $200m of this came from the manufacturing ahead of schedule of its chip codenamed Conroe, which was launched as the Core 2 Duo microprocessor last week.The inventory build-up was also influenced by ramped-up production of its “Broadwater” chipset. Mr Bryant said inventories could rise again in the third quarter.Intel does not appear to be worried about its stockpiles. It sees them as part and parcel of a transition to a new generation of processors, with the latest chips unlikely to lose their value in the short term.It is also seeking to avoid the chipset shortage it suffered last year that caused it to concede market share to its rival Advanced Micro Devices.“If I have made one mistake in the last two years, it was that we did not build enough chips at the right time…that got us in trouble in terms of market share,” Paul Otellini, chief executive, told analysts.ISuppli predicted Intel’s surplus, which it determines as the point where days of inventory exceed historical averages, would linger into 2007. It said a price war between Intel and AMD meant customers were placing smaller, more frequent orders to get the best prices, but causing stockpiles at the manufacturers.
446;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Forecasts cool US earnings joy;;US companies have celebrated better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, keeping alive a streak of double-figure profits growth that has lasted for three years.However, there is growing sentiment that the growth in corporate profits, like the economy, is ready to slow.So far, nearly two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies have announced second quarter earnings. Of these 69 per cent beat expectations, up from the 60 per cent norm.However, many companies announcing second quarter earnings warned investors they were lowering forecasts for the rest of the year.Friday’s release of the government’s estimate that the economy grew only 2.5 per cent in the second quarter – far below market expectations – intensified sentiment that corporate America was heading for a slowdown.“On the one hand, earnings have generally come in better than expected, with 83 per cent of companies meeting or beating numbers,” said Henry McVey, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. “On the other hand, forward guidance has been punk, with the ratio of positive to negative pre-announcements at 0.34 versus 0.59 a year ago and 0.54 last quarter.”Companies announcing disappointing results, or bearish forecasts, suffered aggressive sell-offs. Principal victims have included Yahoo, the search engine, which is down 30 per cent for the year, health insurer Aetna, down 32 per cent this year, postal service UPS, whose share price suffered its worst ever daily fall when it announced earnings last week, and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, down 55 per cent since January.Investors’ downbeat mood became even more apparent at the end of last week when ExxonMobil reported the second-highest quarterly profit in US corporate history and still saw its shares end the day lower.According to UBS research of recent results, 45 per cent of companies that surprised Wall Street analysts with better-than-expected earnings saw their share price fall.“Investors thought those stocks’ good second quarter fundamentals were ‘old news’ and that the next shift in fundamentals would be down,” wrote UBS strategist Larry Hatheway.For the current quarter, downward revisions to earnings estimates are sharpest among technology and consumer discretionary stocks.Among the latter, the downward revision for third quarter earnings growth estimates has also been sharp, tumbling from 20 per cent two weeks ago to 15 per cent.
447;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-27T22:45:55Z;Intel aims to overtake AMD in technology;;Intel on Thursday staged its biggest microprocessor launch in more than a decade in a move to reclaim technology leadership from its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices.The company unveiled its Core 2 Duo chip at its Silicon Valley headquarters, the first time it had held such a ceremony there since the launch of its first Pentium processor in 1993.AMD became a bigger threat to Intel this week with its acquisition of the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies in a deal worth $5.4bn. It said the deal would help it to match the platform of integrated own-brand chips that Intel provides for business customers, while offering superior graphics for notebooks.“We are still evaluating what the situation means to us and the industry,” Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, told reporters at the launch.Intel is counting on the Core 2 Duo desktop and notebook chips, codenamed Conroe and Merom, to fire a second-half comeback after the company’s two most disappointing quarters since the dotcom bubble burst.But Wall Street appeared unimpressed with the launch yesterday – Intel shares closed 0.2 per cent lower at $17.47.The company aims to win back market share from AMD and Conroe and Merom are expected to reinforce its overwhelming leadership in enterprise PCs and mobile computing while helping it in the fight for share in consumer PCs. Its “Woodcrest” chip for servers, introduced in June, completes the new line-up against AMD.Mr Otellini said the Core 2 Duo processors were “simply the best processors in the world,” and quoted reviews from specialist magazines to back up his claim.“This is not just incremental change in terms of the capabilities of this machine, it’s a revolutionary leap,” he said.The Core 2 Duo is shipping immediately on “Extreme” edition PC gaming machines and costs $999. Other versions, priced from $183, will appear in August in consumer and enterprise desktop PCs, followed by notebook computers later in the month.It is based on Intel’s first new micro architecture in five years, one founded on the energy-saving principle of “performance per watt” rather than the previous generation’s focus on blazing speed.Dozens of computers were on display featuring the new chips and the Intel chief said they already had more than 550 design wins – the largest in Intel’s history.Intel said its new desktop chip contained 291m transistors, had two processing cores or “brains” and consumed 40 per cent less power than the previous generation while offering a 40 per cent increase in performance.But the operating system that will best take advantage of the extra power and drive sales – Windows Vista – is not due until early next year.
448;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-24T23:11:49Z;AMD/ATI;;Shame about the timing. Advanced Micro Devices might have found it easier to sell its $5.4bn acquisition of ATI Technologies to investors when it was riding high earlier in the year. Its stock price hit $42 in February, on the back of market share gains in microprocessors against larger rival Intel. That offered a potentially powerful currency with which to pursue acquisitions. However, AMD’s shares have since fallen almost 60 per cent and it is using mostly cash to acquire ATI.Strategically, the deal has some merit. It will give AMD exposure to high-end graphics chips (used in fast-growing markets such as gaming) and to areas where it is weak, such as mobile devices. Importantly, AMD will get ATI’s capability in producing chipsets which can be bundled as a package with microprocessors and sold to hardware manufacturers. That allows AMD to try competing more effectively for enterprise customers against Intel, which already produces chipsets.On the financial side, however, there is plenty to worry about. AMD already faces a price war with Intel in microprocessors, which will cut into profitability. The acquisition will remove AMD’s cash cushion and gear up its balance sheet at the same time as adding a new uncertainty: execution risk on the transaction. In addition, the deal is by no means cheap while the cost synergies are relatively modest.Much depends on the combined company being able to increase its market share through offering a broader product set and developing combined platforms. That is possible. But first, AMD is likely to have to make up for the revenue ATI currently makes from Intel-based chipsets, which could disappear following the deal.AMD clearly retains its appetite for the David and Goliath fight against Intel. For investors, however, it is a big gamble.
449;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;AMD to buy ATI for $5.4bn;;Advanced Micro Devices on Monday took its biggest gamble in its attempt to keep pace with its larger rival Intel, buying graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies for $5.4bn in the second largest takeover in the semiconductor industry’s history.AMD has confined itself to building the central processing units (CPUs) of computers until now. The acquisition of ATI allows it to offer the accompanying logic and graphics chipsets in an own-brand “platform” approach that will match that of Intel.But it is buying ATI in the middle of a price war with Intel, at a time when it is committed to spending billions of dollars on expanding its manufacturing capacity and when its shares fell to a 52-week low of $17.41 on Monday.AMD said it would pay $4.2bn in cash and offer 57m AMD shares, which closed at $18.26 on Friday. This would mean it paying $20.47 for each ATI share, a 24 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday.AMD has obtained a $2.5bn loan commitment from Morgan Stanley to help finance the cash portion and has around $3bn in cash and short-term investments available.The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter is the biggest since Texas Instruments acquired Burr-Brown for around $6bn in 2000, according to the Wall Street Access research firm. It will create a company of 15,000 employees, with ATI’s top management team being integrated into that of AMD and its main Toronto facilities being maintained.Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, told an analyst conference call he did not expect significant redundancies, although the elimination of overlaps would mean savings of $75m in 2007 and $125m in 2008.Bob Rivet, chief financial officer, said he believed the deal would be meaningfully accretive to earnings in 2008, before charges associated with the acquisition.The deal will mean major shifts in the industry. To date, AMD has worked with a range of chipset manufacturers to complement its microprocessors and relied on its Silicon Valley neighbour Nvidia and ATI to offer PC manufacturers best-of-breed graphics chipsets.AMD insisted on Monday that a relationship with Nvidia could still be maintained in some areas of its business. But the close competition between Nvidia and ATI in the graphics field, mirroring that of Intel and AMD in microprocessors, has taken on a new dynamic.Meanwhile, Intel has been a significant customer of ATI, using its chipsets in situations such as shortages of its own chips. It is highly unlikely to do so with ATI under the wing of its biggest rival.Dave Orton, ATI chief executive, said 30 to 40 per cent of revenues for its logic chips came from Intel in its last quarter and Mr Rivet said $80 to $100m a quarter in ATI revenues were Intel related.
450;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-24T21:26:15Z;Wall Street gains on earnings and deal news;;Wall Street closed sharply higher on Monday in a broad-based rally, buoyed by news of takeover deals and better than expected results at the start of another busy week for the earnings season.Hospital operator HCA rose on news that it had agreed to be bought out by a private equity consortium in a deal worth about $33bn. The deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history.Shares in HCA, which reported a sharp fall in second-quarter earnings, gained 3.4 per cent to $49.48.Other stocks in the healthcare sector were also higher. Schering Plough gained 5.7 per cent to $20.55 after swinging into profit in the second quarter and beating Wall Street estimates with sales growth of 11 per cent.Drugmaker Merck bounced back, adding 4.3 per cent to $38.95 after it raised its 2006 outlook and reported that profit nearly doubled in the second quarter.Pfizer also pushed higher, adding 4 per cent to $24.79.ATI Technologies, maker of graphics chips, leapt 18.8 per cent to $19.67 after an announcement that it would be bought by Advanced Micro Devices in a deal worth $5.4bn. AMD fell 4.8 per cent to $17.39.Nvidia, the main competitor of ATI Technologies, rose 10.1 per cent to $19.56, mitigating some of the 44 per cent drop it had suffered since the beginning of May.Crude prices ticked higher amid continuing violence in Israel and Lebanon. ConocoPhillips climbed 3.4 per cent to $65.78, and Marathon Oil rose 4.3 per cent to $87.78.By the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.7 per cent, or 20.62 points, at 1,260.91, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.1 per cent, or 41.45 points, at 2,061.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent, or 182.67 points, at 11,051.05.Henry McVey, chief US investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, raised his forecast for 2006 earnings per share growth to 11.4 per cent but cut his 2006 forecast for the S&P 500 from 1,400 to 1,350.“The swing factors for the 2006 increase include upward revisions to energy and materials, though these are offset partially by a deterioration in our outlook for the housing-sensitive consumer durables [shares],” he said.But the changing outlook for interest rates led to the downward revision in Mr McVey’s forecast for the S&P 500. “We under-estimated how high short-term and long-term interest rates would go . . . and we underestimated the underlying inflation outlook,” he said.Fashion label Polo Ralph Lauren rose 15.7 per cent to $55.40 after it raised its fiscal first-quarter forecast for revenue and operating margins on strong sales.American Express added only 0.1 per cent to $50.66 in spite of reporting a 13 per cent rise in second-quarter profit. Investors had not been expecting a charge related to the company’s rewards program.
451;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-24T20:51:51Z;High-definition benefits of AMD deal are clear;;Analysts may have difficulty processing the financial logic. But the changing digital landscape, in which smooth high-definition images are becoming as important as fast-opening software applications, means AMD’s takeover of ATI appears to make complete technological sense.For some time, there has been an intellectual debate in the industry on whether the graphics processing unit (GPU) is achieving primacy over the central processing unit (CPU).With graphics cards made by the dominant players Nvidia and ATI coming loaded with 256Mb of memory and capable of floating-point calculations 10 to 15 times faster than AMD and Intel CPU microprocessors, there is no doubting their superior power at delivering images to a computer or TV screen.But the CPU, as its name suggests, is still central to the basic workings of electronic devices and AMD on Monday made it clear the two would continue to co-exist doing their separate tasks, although it envisages one day combining them on a single chip.In the meantime, it will be mixing them in different strengths and combinations, and with other chipsets, to serve different markets.There will be general purpose, data centric, graphics centric and media centric products for business and consumer PCs, mobile users and living-room consumer electronics devices.ATI is supplying graphics chips for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii games consoles, as well as for digital television.Microsoft’s new Vista operating system requires much more powerful graphics to run its visually sophisticated interface, and handheld devices need more graphics muscle to handle 3D gaming and TV pictures.All these areas represent exciting opportunities for the new company, but its initial targets will be more prosaic.AMD has more than a 25 per cent share of the market for microprocessors in consumer desktop PCs and enterprise servers in its battle with Intel. It has less than 15 per cent of the market for notebook PCs and enterprise desktops.It says these latter markets are worth $16.7bn and represent major growth opportunities.Intel has excelled in offering business computer makers such as Dell an integrated set of its own chips – it is the largest maker of integrated graphics chips – that have enabled it to outpace AMD, which has gathered accompanying chips from an assortment of manufacturers.“This deal enhances our time-to-market capability in those product categories that require a lot of platform-level work,” Dirk Meyer, AMD president, told the Financial Times on Monday.“We can ensure the platform’s stability, and that’s hard to do in the enterprise.”Rob Enderle, analyst with the Enderle group, said in a blog note on Monday that becoming a “me too” vendor in those areas would not allow them to take much share from Intel. “They have to be better and one of the areas where Intel has been weak is in PC graphics. Both ATI and Nvidia have better graphics solutions than Intel and, by acquiring ATI, AMD gets to step ahead of Intel on system performance.”The competition was moving from a parts level to a platform level, he noted, and AMD’s Silicon Valley neighbour, Nvidia, was being left as the odd man out.AMD has relied more on Nvidia than ATI for accompanying chips in recent years, but Mr Meyer said it decided to buy ATI because it was a better cultural fit and had leadership in mobile and consumer electronics areas.It is also cheaper to buy than Nvidia, but AMD is still saddling itself with some serious debt.Standard & Poor’s Rating Services placed AMD’s B+ rating on Creditwatch with negative implications on Monday.Separately, an S&P chip analyst downgraded AMD from Strong Buy to Hold, noting the deal’s execution risk and debt burden.
452;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-24T17:59:47Z;Market Overview: Mergers and acquisitions help equities focus on positive news;;Global equity markets jumped on Monday after a flurry of merger and acquisition deals, better earnings news and an initial slide in oil prices.Recent worries over geo-political tensions and interest rate policy gave way to a relief rally on the emergence of more positive news.The M&A activity included a landmark buyout deal with a $21bn (plus debt) agreed takeover bid for HCA, the hospital chain based in Tennessee in the US, from a private equity consortium including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Merrill Lynch and Bain Capital.Other deals included the agreed acquisition by Advanced Micro Devices of Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies for $5.4bn. In Europe, it emerged that three private equity groups are in the running to buy the semiconductor unit of Philips Electronics, which could be worth $10bn.Investors took a more positive view of the second-quarter earnings season underway in the US after recent disappointments from bellwether stocks overshadowed a generally positive trend.Thomson Financial said of the 152 companies in the S&P 500 to have reported second-quarter results up to Friday night, 66 per cent beat market expectations, 20 per cent reported earnings in line with forecasts and 14 per cent disappointed.The positive surprise rate was higher than the 60 per cent typical for a quarter. Thomson Financial said the blended earnings growth rate – including both reported and forecast numbers for companies – for the S&P 500 index constituents was now 13.6 per cent. That growth rate was up from 12.4 per cent forecast in the middle of the month and 10.9 per cent expected at the start of the quarter.The more positive view of US earnings was aided by better-than-expected results from pharmaceutical heavyweights Merck & Co and Schering-Plough. Some 168 S&P 500 and 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents are expected to report results this week.Markets were buoyed by a initial fall in oil prices below $74 a barrel as Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, flew to Beirut to seek talks on a “sustainable” ceasefire in the conflict between Lebanon and Israel.This helped ease the worst fears of investors about the potential for the conflict to spread through the region. However, oil prices rallied from intra-day lows with West Texas Intermediate trading just 18 cents weaker at $74.25 a barrel by midday in New York.Still by midday on Wall Street, the Dow was up 1.3 per cent, while the S&P 500 index gained 1.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.6 per cent.The robust opening on Wall Street and a stronger dollar helped European shares extend early gains into sharp rises.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 1.86 per cent to 1,314.30. The Xetra Dax index jumped 2.33 per cent to 5,578.05.In Asia, shares slipped as technology stocks continued to suffer a sentiment hangover from the US sector setbacks last week. China’s move on Friday to cool down its economy by raising bank reserve requirements weighed on shares.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 14,794.50 while Taipei, one of the Asian markets most exposed to technology stocks, fell 0.9 per cent to 6,359.63.On bond markets, US Treasuries were mixed.By midday in New York, the yield on the two-year Treasury was 0.8 basis points higher at 5.097 per cent, while the 10-year note was yielding 5.042 points, down 0.7bp.
453;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-23T22:58:51Z;Three firms mull bids for Philips chip unit;;Three teams of private equity firms were on Sunday night putting the final touches on bids for the semiconductor division of Philips Electronics, which could be worth more than $10bn in a sale.According to people familiar with the situation, Netherlands-based Philips had set a deadline for the submission of final bids later this week, and would then proceed to determine whether to sell the unit.Competing in the auction is one group composed of Bain Capital, Francisco Partners, and Apax Partners. A second consortium includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners, which already joined forces to acquire the semiconductors unit of Agilent in 2004. A third group involves Blackstone, Permira and Texas Pacific Group, people familiar with the process said. They cautioned that while bids were due this week, the process was likely to drag on for some time before any decision would be made.Even as interest rates are rising, and the cost of financing acquisitions with debt becomes more expensive, the largest buy-out funds continue to pursue large targets. A buy-out of Philips’ chip unit would represent the largest private equity deal in the technology industry after last year’s $11.3bn purchase of SunGard Data Systems by seven firms.The uncertainty over the future of Philips’ semiconductor division comes amid more dealmaking in the chip business. Over the weekend, Advanced Micro Devices was close to an agreement to buy ATI Technologies of Canada for about $5.5bn, people familiar with the matter said.Philips announced its intention to sell a majority of its chip division in June saying at the time that it had accelerated the process of deciding the future of the unit. It is one of five business units the Dutch technology company operates, and generates about one-sixth of total sales.It said it would reduce its position in the semiconductor unit to a minority either via a flotation or sale to financial buyers, by the end of the year.It did not rule out eventually exiting semiconductor manufacturing entirely. The industry has proven a volatile drag on Philips earnings, as the company shifts from high volume electronics to a healthcare and lifestyle group in which manufacturing is largely out-sourced.Philips said on Sunday it had “no reason to comment” on the interest from private equity because “all options remain open”.The legal separation of that business will be completed by the end of the third quarter. It announced that process in December in order to increase shareholder value. Philips has been under pressure for some time to dismantle its conglomerate structure in order to realise value.
454;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;AMD close to $5.5bn deal for ATI;;Advanced Micro Devices is near to buying the Canadian graphics chipmaker ATI Technologies for around $5.5bn, according to people close to the deal.Any agreement would represent a major gamble by AMD to put itself on a level footing with its bigger rival Intel, which makes its own graphics chips.The asking price suggests AMD would have to offer a substantial number of its own shares as part of the deal or take on debt. It had cash balances of $2.5bn at the end of June, but is spending billions on developing new chip plants, including $2.5bn in capital expenditure next year.An AMD spokeswoman said on Friday it did not comment on rumour or speculation. Its shares closed nearly 16 per cent lower at $18.26 after poor second-quarter results and rumours of the deal. ATI’s finished 6 per cent higher in Toronto at $18.77.The takeover, which could be announced in the next few days, could also be a blow to AMD’s Silicon Valley neighbour Nvidia, whose shares fell 7.5 per cent on Friday. AMD has combined its microprocessors with both Nvidia and ATI graphics chipsets, but may side in future with ATI’s products.At the same time, ATI has been providing third-party chipsets to Intel and could lose that business if it is bought by AMD.Analysts have long speculated that the bigger microprocessor companies could buy the graphics chipmakers, but the logic has never been compelling.Intel is already the biggest maker of graphics chips with the integrated chipsets it sells for computer motherboards. It is also in a cost-cutting mode and has just sold its division making chips for mobile phones.AMD has always reasoned it can offer best of breed graphics by choosing chipsets from either ATI or Nvidia. It has also sought to focus on microprocessors after spinning off its Spansion memory chip business last December.But it may feel it has to match Intel’s graphic abilities to compete with it in future in new markets such as the “digital home”.In its last quarter, 23 per cent of ATI’s total sales and 70 per cent of its operating income came from non-PC businesses, according to Merrill Lynch.It reported revenues of $653m for the quarter and earnings per share of 12 cents.
455;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-21T20:51:16Z;Wall Street lower as tech results disappoint;;Wall Street ended the week mixed after a hectic few days of earnings reports depressed the Nasdaq composite index but boosted the S&P 500.It was also a good week for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Wednesday had its second-best day since 2003. The rally, aided by earnings announcements, came after congressional testimony by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that was interpreted as signalling an end to future rate increases.Microsoft rose 7.1 per cent over the week to $23.87, thanks largely to its announcement of a huge $40bn share buyback. It reported a 24 per cent drop in quarterly earnings – still ahead of analyst estimates.Apple Computer leapt 19.8 per cent to $60.72 following the release of quarterly earnings on Wednesday that came in ahead of analyst estimates. Profits soared 48 per cent in the second quarter, boosted by a rebound in sales of Macintosh computers and continued strong sales of iPod music players.Motorola surged 9.1 per cent to $20.40 after it beat Wall Street estimates with a 48 per cent jump in second- quarter earnings thanks to record sales of handsets.But the picture elsewhere in the tech sector was far less encouraging. Yahoo reported a 78 per cent slump in second-quarter earnings, in line with analysts’ expectations. The sell-off in the stock was precipitated by a delay in the introduction of the company’s new advertising platform, pushing the stock down 19.3 per cent to $25.89.Dell tumbled 9.1 per cent to $19.91 after it said secondquarter results would fall short of forecasts due to aggressive pricing in the fiercely competitive PC market.Chipmakers had another bad week, with Advanced Micro Devices falling 15.5 per cent to $18.26. It reported a rise in quarterly profit, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts, but its shares slumped as investors worried about falling revenues at AMD as it continued to cut margins to compete with Intel, whose shares fell 4.1 per cent to $17.15.Elsewhere, JPMorgan Chase gained 5.5 per cent to $43.15 after it announced a better-than-expected tripling in second-quarter profits thanks to strong performance in its investment banking and credit card businesses.Pfizer added 6.3 per cent to $23.83 after it reported a 10 per cent rise in quarterly profits from continuing operations.McDonald’s was another solid performer on the Dow. Early in the week, it announced that same-store sales in June rose 5.9 per cent, more than had been expected. The restaurant chain also reported prelim-inary quarterly earnings that were ahead of analyst forecasts, pushing shares up 5 per cent to $34.70.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, or 8.84 points, for the day at 1,240.29, a gain for the week of 0.3 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent lower for the week, at 2,020.39, a loss for the day of 0.9 per cent, or 19.03 points. The Dow had fallen 0.6 per cent, or 59.72 points, to 10,868.38, up 1.2 per cent for the week.According to Thomson Financial, the blended growth rate for second-quarter earnings now stands at 13.6 per cent, up from 12.4 per cent last week, and 10.9 per cent when the quarter started. The blended growth rate is a composite figure derived from estimates and earnings already reported.“At this point it’s looking very solid for another quarter of double-digit earnings growth,” said John Butters of Thomson Financial.After upward price rises that forced crude up 10 per cent in the space of four weeks, oil fell back during the week, inflicting heavy losses on oil services companies. Halliburton shed 18.7 per cent to $30.04, while BJ Services sank 14.1 per cent to $30.06. The S&P Oil and Gas Equipment Index lost 12 per cent, its worst week in more than four years. However, it is still up 12.9 per cent year-to-date.Safeway stood out from the malaise in the retail sector. Shares leapt 12.5 per cent to $27.97 after the company beat Wall Street forecasts when it reported an 84 per cent gain in second-quarter profit, and raised its outlook for 2006.Medical device maker Baxter International added 9.6 per cent to $41.47 after it posted better than expected profits and raised its full year earnings estimate.
456;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-21T20:15:48Z;Caterpillar indicates ‘old economy’ resurgence;;The contrast between the US’s resurgent “old economy” industries and its troubled technology sector came to the fore on Friday when heavy machinery maker Caterpillar reported its best-yet quarterly earnings while personal computer maker Dell capped a bad week for technology companies with a profit warning.The divergent fortunes of two of corporate America’s most important sectors, coupled with concerns about a slowing domestic economy and tensions in the Middle East, are fuelling investor uncertainty over the direction of the stock market.All the main US share indices were down as the woes of the technology sector, with the exception of Microsoft and Google, outweighed the good news from US manufacturers with exposure to booming markets such as mining and energy.Industry experts say that some of the US’s traditional industries, aside from the ailing automotive and airline sectors, are outpacing the “new economy”, thanks to a weaker dollar, high commodity prices and a wave of consolidation and cost-cutting that has weeded out weaker players.The prediction by Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, that it is on course to record its highest annual profits and revenues in 40 years follows upbeat pronouncements by other global manufacturers such as General Electric and Honeywell.“We had a spectacular second quarter [and] we don’t see 2006 as the peak,” said Jim Owens, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, after announcing a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to $1.5bn in the three months to June 30.The good performance, in spite of higher operating costs, prompted Caterpillar, which is seen as a bellwether for blue-chip manufacturing stocks, to lift its outlook for earnings and sales for the whole of this year. By contrast, sectors such as personal computers are resembling old maturing industries.Growth is slowing and companies have become involved in cut-throat price competition to try to increase their market share.Shares in Dell, the world’s biggest maker of PCs, fell to a five-year low during morning trading after warning that profits would not meet expectations because of heavy discounting in a softening market for PCs.Earlier this week Intel, the chipmaker, admitted that revenues would not meet its forecasts this year and were likely to be 10 per cent down after three years of double-digit growth.Shares in its rival AMD were down 10 per cent on Friday after its second-quarter sales suffered from the chip price war with Intel and slowing demand for PCs, while the search engine Yahoo disappointed Wall Street by losing further ground to Google.
457;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Dell shares tumble after warning over sales;;Shares of Dell suffered their biggest single-day fall since the collapse of the dotcom bubble on Friday after the world’s biggest PC maker said sales and earnings would fall short of expectations in the second quarter. The news capped a grim week for technology stocks.Kevin Rollins, Dell’s chief executive, said “aggressive pricing” had led to a decline in profitability at the company, which has been struggling to right itself for more than a year amid increased competition from low-cost rivals and a drop in sales growth.Andrew Neff, analyst at Bear Stearns, said he saw “potential for change” among senior management as the company struggles to get back on track: “Either [Mr Rollins] has to fix it or they have to get a new guy in charge.”Price competition and slowing demand for PCs led other tech bellwethers to suffer this week. Intel shares fell 7.5 per cent on Thursday after it reported second-quarter sales down 13 per cent and warned it would probably miss 2006 revenue targets set in April. Sales are likely to be around 10 per cent down on 2005 at $35bn after three years of double-digit revenue and earnings growth.AMD shares were trading more than 10 per cent lower on Friday after it reported mediocre second-quarter results – hit by slowing demand and stiff competition from its larger rival Intel.Meanwhile, Yahoo shares fell nearly 22 per cent on Wednesday on uninspiring second-quarter results and the news that new ad technology, to help it match Google, was being delayed by a quarter and would produce no revenues this year.Google, the internet search company, and Apple Computer were two bright spots. Google’s second-quarter profits more than doubled owing to market share gains and increased ad revenues. Strong sales of Macintosh computers and speculation that Apple may be close to unveiling fresh upgrades to its iPod music player line led shares in that company more than 11 per cent higher on Thursday.Dell’s shares hit a five-year low on Friday, falling almost 14 per cent to $19.02. The shares have fallen more than 50 per cent over the past 12 months.In an interview last month with the FT, Mr Rollins said Dell and its management were acting with a “sense of urgency” to put the company back on track and restore its reputation for out-performance.Dell has announced plans to accelerate $3bn in cost cuts and plans to invest $100m this year to improve customer service this year.
458;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-20T23:01:41Z;Intel to shuffle pack for better results;;Intel has announced a management shake-up in the latest move to restructure the world’s largest chipmaker and improve performance.The news came a day after Intel reported its worst quarter in years, with sales falling 13 per cent and the company saying it would miss its revenue target for 2006.Its shares fell 7.5 per cent on Thursday on the news while those of its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, were down nearly 6 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported second-quarter sales had been hurt by price competition with Intel.AMD said sales were $1.22bn, down from $1.26bn a year ago. Profits were higher at $88.8m, or 18 cents per share, up from $11.3m, or 3 cents, last year.Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said on Thursday he was changing its traditional management structure at the top level , where “two-in-a-box” co-managers often share responsibility.Sean Maloney, one of two deputies to Mr Otellini as executive vice-president, is being moved from co-manager of the Mobility group, responsible for notebook computer chips, to be head of sales and marketing.Mr Maloney, 50, and originally from the UK, is joined by another Briton, Don MacDonald, who becomes vice-president of marketing and brands. He was previously head of the Digital Home division, formed last year.David Perlmutter will now be the sole head of the Mobility group.Anand Chandrasekher, formerly co-manager of sales and marketing, will manage a new unit focused on low-power processors and a new market Intel is developing for the “ultra-mobile PC”.Eric Kim, who joined Intel from Samsung, is moving from co-head of sales and marketing to be head of the Digital Home group.William Siu, a 26-year veteran, who headed the Channel Platforms group and Richard Wirt, 25 years with Intel and co-manager of software and solutions, both announced their retirement.“The moves announced today will help us speed decision-making and bring new resources to bear in critical areas, while allowing me to spend more time on key strategic issues,” said Mr Otellini.A strategic review started in April has resulted in the sale of Intel’s business of making chips for mobile phones and the axeing of 1,000 managers.Andy Bryant, Intel’s other executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said the next two months would see spending and headcount reduced further.
459;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-19T23:17:54Z;Intel warns as sales drop 13%;;Intel admitted on Wednesday it was unlikely to make its revenue forecasts for this year after the world’s largest semiconductor maker saw sales fall 13 per cent in its second quarter.The Silicon Valley company struggled with sliding demand and falling prices for its microprocessors to beat its lowest expectations of second-quarter sales of $8bn by just $9m, down from $9.2bn a year ago.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, said 2006 revenues were now likely to be lower than forecast in April. He predicted sales of $8.3bn to $8.9bn in the third quarter and perhaps a 10 per cent increase in the fourth quarter.This suggests sales of $35bn for the year, 7 per cent less than the $37.6bn previously expected and nearly 10 per cent lower than in 2005.Intel has been suffering from soft demand for personal computers and loss of market share to its rival Advanced Micro Devices.“But I do think [this quarter] is as bad as it gets, business trends are showing improvement,” said Apjit Walia, semiconductor analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Intel is introducing a new generation of processors for servers, the desktop and notebook PCs over the summer that should lift average selling prices and boost sales.“In 2006, we are delivering the strongest line-up in the industry, with many of these new products shipping ahead of schedule,” said Paul Otellini, chief executive.He told an analyst conference call that Intel was well positioned for the second half, although pricing had become more competitive.Intel hopes to win back market share from AMD with the new chips.It can make major cost savings as the latest chips are made with smaller 65nm circuitry, but AMD and Intel are locked in a price war that is damaging both.Second-quarter profits of $855m, or 15 cents a share, beat analyst expectations of 13 cents but were down 57 per cent on the $2bn recorded a year earlier.Intel has begun a restructuring programme to improve profitability, selling off its mobile phone chip business and announcing redundancies for 1,000 managers.Mr Bryant said more decisions would be taken over the next two months to take down spending and the headcount of its 100,000-strong workforce.Qualcomm, whose business is focused on making cell phone chips and licensing its technology, reported a 15 per cent jump in profits to $643m on Wednesday and a 44 per cent increase in revenues to $1.95bn in its third quarter.But its shares fell 5 per cent in after-hours trading to $34.75 as it predicted a weaker fourth quarter than Wall Street expected.Intel shares were flat at $18.47.
460;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-13T20:55:16Z;Intel fires 1,000 managers;;Intel on Thursday announced its first job cuts in the restructuring of the world’s biggest chipmaker, saying it was firing 1,000 managers worldwide.“This morning we told our employees that Intel has reduced the number of managers company-wide,” said Chuck Mulloy from Intel. “This is one of the first actions of the structure and efficiency programme that we disclosed in April.”Paul Otellini, chief executive, launched a 90-day review of the company’s operations in late April after it reported profits fell by a third in its first quarter. He said the aim was to “restructure, repurpose and resize Intel”. “No stone will be left unturned” to create a “leaner, more agile and more efficient Intel”, he said.Intel shares initially slipped on the news, with investors expecting 10,000 to 15,000 job cuts, according to one analyst’s forecast. But they recovered to be 0.6 per cent higher at $17.98 near the close of trade in New York.“This is no real surprise,” said Apjit Walia, semiconductor analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “They may want to keep the employee base as big as it is and eventually find [new] revenue-generating business.”The cuts amount to 1 per cent of Intel’s 100,000-strong global workforce. The company has been suffering from soft demand for PCs containing its micro-processors and loss of market share to its rival Advanced Micro Devices.It has been exploring new markets for growth in the health sector and the “digital home”, after making little impression on the mobile phone market with its chips.Last month, it sold the lossmaking mobile business to its Silicon Valley neighbour, Marvell Technology, for $600m. It was its first restructuring move, taking 1,400 employees off its books.More job cuts could still follow. Mr Mulloy said the efficiency analysis was continuing and there would be further updates. He did not disclose cost savings from the redundancies but these will be reflected in Intel’s outlook when it reports second quarter earnings next week.“This is designed to improve costs and improve decision-making and communications across the company,” he said of the management cull.Intel is also expected to sell its networking processor business, which was linked to the mobile division. In May, it revealed it had reorganised its Flash memory division, separating production from its main manufacturing group. This has led to speculation it could spin off or sell this business.
461;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-07-07T15:10:11Z;AMD first casualty of chip price war;;The first financial casualty of a price war between the two major microprocessor makers has been suffered by Advanced Micro Devices, whose shares fell as much as 5.8 per cent yesterday on the back of its second-quarter sales warning.AMD said it expected revenues to be around $1.215bn for the quarter ending June 30 - 9 per cent lower than those of the first quarter.It had previously forecast sales would be flat to slightly down and consensus estimates among analysts were for revenues of $1.308bn.AMD blamed lower sales of entry level and mainstream processors for desktop and laptop PCs. Its bigger rival Intel has been aggressively cutting prices in these segments to win back market share, clear out excess inventory and make way for a new generation of processors appearing over the summer.Intel is itself expected to report its worst quarter in five years on July 19, a day before AMD officially reports its earnings. It has suffered market share losses to AMD and both makers of the dominant “x86” microprocessor family are feeling the effects of weak PC demand.AMD shares fell to $22.45, down 5.8 per cent, before recovering to $23.44, down 1.6 per cent, at noon in New York. They are down 47 per cent from their peak of $42.70 in February. Intel shares were a cent higher at $18.86 in midday trading.Joe Osha, Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a note that the shoe had dropped for AMD and its revenue warning was mostly due to “lousy second quarter demand”, with microprocessor revenues for AMD and Intel now expected to be down by an aggregate 14 per cent on the previous quarter.“The easy days are over for AMD …and even though Q3 may be better, we expect Intel to begin taking share in desktop while defending its dominant position in mobile,” he said.Intel is introducing its next-generation processors for server, desktop and notebook PCs in June, July and August respectively, while pre-announcing major price cuts for older processors from this month that is pushing out demand into the third quarter.Sumit Dhanda, Bank of America analyst, said there was a tougher road ahead for AMD. Significant price cuts it made in late June had been too late to save the day and would in turn put severe pressure on its sales and margins in the third quarter, he warned.

464;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-06-26T22:17:29Z;Intel takes on rival with new chip;;Intel has launched its opening gambit in a triple-play to win back market share from its biggest rival Advanced Micro Devices, introducing its first chip based on a new architecture in five years.The world’s largest chipmaker on Monday released its dual-core Xeon Processor 5100 Series, formerly codenamed Woodcrest, which is targeted at the server market where AMD has made the biggest inroads into its business.Dell, the biggest PC maker, which last month said it would begin buying AMD processors for some of its servers for the first time, announced immediate availability of the new Intel chip in its server range.Intel is rolling out microprocessors based on its new “Core” architecture over three months. Following Woodcrest, a chip for desktop computers codenamed Conroe will appear in July and a notebook computer chip codenamed Merom is due in August. The designs differ markedly from Intel’s last generation – the Pentium 4, introduced in 2000, followed by its high-end Itanium and Xeon processors in 2001.They were built for speed, but Intel is now emphasising efficiency, or performance per watt, as the heat generated by chips and the power consumed has made the energy costs of running them more expensive than the actual hardware.Intel said more than 200 models of servers and workstations from more than 150 manufacturers were planned for the Woodcrest chip. It would deliver a 135 per cent performance improvement and up to a 40 per cent reduction in energy consumption over previous Intel server products, according to the company.Intel’s server chips have underperformed those of AMD over the past two years and its market share has slipped from 95 per cent to 78 per cent, according to Mercury Research.But, at a presentation in San Francisco, Intel showed Woodcrest outperforming AMD’s equivalent Opteron processor, completing a task in 23 seconds compared to 30 seconds and using less power.“IT managers we have spoken to suggest Intel’s platform has ‘caught up’ to AMD’s in higher-end applications,” said Glen Yeung, Citigroup analyst, in a note.He added he expected a turning point for Intel’s shares as an expected second-quarter earnings miss was offset by the positive news of product launches and the promised restructuring at the company.Intel shares closed 1.6 per cent higher in New York at $18.28, while AMD shares fell nearly 2 per cent to $24.66.
465;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-06-23T22:49:03Z;AMD plans $3.2bn chip plant for NY;;Advanced Micro Devices is to invest $3.2bn in a new chip plant in the state of New York to stay competitive with its rival Intel in microprocessor production.In a joint press conference with New York politicians including Governor George Pataki, AMD said the plant would be built over the next three to five years and would employ directly 1,200 people.New York offered cash incentives of about $900m to bring AMD to the state and with an additional tax abatement offer, the package was worth more than $1bn to the number two microprocessor maker.AMD said it had spoken to various governments and explored locations in Europe and Asia before settling on the site in Malta, 25 miles north of the state capital Albany.On Thursday, Intel opened a new $2bn chip factory near Dublin in Ireland that will produce processors cut from the latest 300mm diameter wafers with circuits just 65 billionths of a metre wide. The AMD plant, depending on when it comes on-stream, will produce next-generation, 45-nanometre chips or, more likely, 32nm ones.Preston Snuggs, Manufacturing Systems vice-president at AMD, said New York had been chosen because of the incentives offered, the existing infrastructure and the availability of talent.The site would also put manufacturing close to a source of its technology, with AMD already working with IBM at a chip facility in East Fishkill, New York.Mr Snuggs said AMD’s factory in Dresden, Germany, would continue to be the centre of chip production. The company announced a $2.5bn refurbishment of that plant last month to take place over the next two years.Mr Snuggs said paying for the New York plant would take place in a different timeframe, with construction starting between 2007 and 2009 for production to begin in 2010 or beyond.This would allow AMD to pay for it through operating income and the incentives, without having to take on new debt.The new factory would not replace AMD’s relationship with IBM or its use of foundry manufacturer Chartered Semiconductor in Asia to fulfil its chip needs.“This creates a flexible way for AMD to increase capacity. We intend to grow the market as well as give ourselves assurance of supply for the future,” he said. AMD expects to have the capacity to supply a third of the market for the dominant x86 microprocessor by 2008, which would mean major market share gains.Intel has traditionally held more than 80 per cent of the market, with AMD taking up virtually all of the rest. But AMD has been making inroads with higher performing chips, and Intel’s share fell to 74 per cent in the first quarter, according to Mercury Research.
466;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Intel steps up chip race with Ireland plant;;Intel opened a new chip plant in Europe on Thursday as it stepped up its competition with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to expand manufacturing capacity and market share.Speaking in Ireland at the launch, Paul Otellini, chief executive, said Intel was the number-one investor in chip plants and equipment in the semiconductor world.“I think we’ll significantly alter the computer landscape,” he said of the processors the factory would produce later in the summer, based on its first new micro-architecture in five years.Intel has invested $2bn in the new fabrication plant alongside existing facilities at Leixlip, near Dublin. It has begun high-volume production of chips cut from 300mm-diameter wafers and featuring circuits 65 billionths of a metre wide.The process succeeds 200mm wafer and 90 nanometre circuits, offering major efficiency improvements and cost savings.AMD was reported this week to be in discussions to build a $3.5bn chip plant in upstate New York. Sheldon Silver, the state’s Assembly Speaker, said he had met AMD representatives to discuss terms of an agreement.Last month, AMD said it would expand production at its main chip plant in Dresden, Germany, at a cost of $2.5bn.Intel has lost market share in recent quarters to AMD, but still supplies the chips for about four out of five personal computers. However, AMD is aiming to grab a third of the market for the dominant x86 microprocessor, and says it will have the manufacturing capacity to achieve that by 2008.It trails Intel in converting to 300mm wafers and 65nm chips, and relies on IBM and the chip foundries of Chartered Semiconductor in Asia to help meet its current needs. Intel said on Thursday it had reached a crossover point, with its Irish factory becoming the third to produce 65nm chips.“We are now producing more 65nm than 90nm processors. We are hitting our commitments and are ahead of schedule,” said Tom Franz, general manager of fabrication manufacturing.Intel will introduce a new server chip next week, followed by desktop and notebook chips in July and August.

469;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-06-09T20:55:12Z;Wall Street falls back after heavy sell-off;;Wall Street fell back this week as three days of heavy selling dragged down the main stock indices.During the week, the S&P 500 briefly dipped into negative territory for the year.At one stage the Nasdaq Composite had fallen more than 10 per cent from its high in May, the scale of decline that many market watchers define as a correction. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 11,000.Chipmakers trailed the market, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping 6.4 per cent. On Wednesday, Citigroup re-vised down its sales forecasts for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices citing the possibility of a price war be-tween the chipmakers.Intel subsequently raised the possibility of just such a price war when it announced late on Thursday that it would cut prices by 60 per cent to gain market share. Intel fell 5.9 per cent to $17.16 and AMD dropped 11.1 per cent to $26.75.Broadcom plunged 14.5 per cent to $29.33 as its top salesman quit.Copper for July delivery fell more than 8 per cent and gold prices eased, impacting on the S&P Materials Index, which had its worst week since April 2005. Freeport McMoran fell 13.6 per cent to $49.03, and Phelps Dodge dropped 8.9 per cent to $79.01. Newmont Mining shed 7.5 per cent to $49.31.Homebuilders continued to decline. Pulte was down 9.8 per cent to $28.27, and KB Homes dropped 12.4 per cent to $44.74. Standard Pacific dropped 13.3 per cent to $26.02. The S&P Homebuilders Index dropped 7.4 per cent, its worst weekly fall since November.Tribune Group was the best performer in the S&P 500, boosted by reports that it might spin off its broadcasting unit, and confirmation that it would proceed with a $2bn share buyback. The stock gained 6.7 per cent to $31.96. Also bucking the trend in the S&P 500 was BMC Software, which rose after reporting increased profits for the fourth quarter, aided by higher sales and cost-cutting. The shares received a further fillip from upgrades from Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs. BMC was up 6.3 per cent for the week at $22.02.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 5.63 points, for the day at 1,252.30, a loss of 2.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.26 points, for the day at 2,135.06, a weekly decline of 3.8 per cent. The Dow was down 0.4 per cent, or 46.90 points, for the day to 10,891.92, a loss for the week of 3.2 per cent, its worst week in a year. “We had a choir of Fed members singing to the same tune, that basically interest rates needed to go higher because of oil prices beginning to impact on inflation,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.“That weighed on stocks and the correction continued. I suspect that the market was discounting higher rates of inflation and higher interest rates.”As the sell-off gathered pace, fears about inflation and interest rate rises – for a long time the dominant concern on Wall Street – were joined by broader fears about the health of the economy. This pushed up traditionally defensive consumer staple stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Molson Coors, while cyclical stocks suffered. Consumer staples groups Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson were rare gainers in the Dow.P&G added 0.9 per cent to $54.45, posting its biggest one day gain in over a year on Thursday. J&J was up 1.1 per cent to $61.38.Also attractive to skittish investors was brewer Molson Coors, which jumped 2.6 per cent to $67.96. Molson has gained 7 per cent in the past two weeks. “Defensive issues have become more fashion-able,” said Mr Cardillo.Slowdown fears meant investors shied away from cyclical and durable goods stocks. Monster Worldwide, the advertising and recruitment company, fell 11.7 per cent to $42.00, while construction equipment maker Caterpillar fell 7.3 per cent to $67.52.General Motors fell 4.3 per cent to $25.35.Exchange consolidation remained in focus as the NYSE Group’s agreed tie-up with Euronext ran into political opposition. Jacques Chirac, the French president, said he preferred a Deutsche Börse-Euronext combination, sending NYSE Group down 12.7 per cent to $57.15. Nasdaq fell 8.7 per cent to $27.41.
470;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-06-08T21:00:57Z;Wall Street flat after volatile session;;Wall Street ended flat on Thursday after a session of exceptional volatility sparked by growing investor concern about the US economy and interest rates. A late afternoon bounce pulled stocks back from an aggressive sell-off that for several hours had the S&P in negative territory for the year.“Some buyers jumped back in, but it was definitely a round trip,” said Brian Williamson, equity trader at Boston Company Asset Management.“There was a little bit of bottom fishing, and it’s definitely encouraging that the market held just below major support levels. It’s a positive sign that it bounced back like this.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.78 points, to 1,257.93, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3 per cent, or 6.48 points, to 2,145.32 – at one point falling more than 10 per cent from its May high, the threshold many analysts believe constitutes a market correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 7.92 points at 10,938.82.Reports of the killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaeda’s leader in Iraq, helped crude prices drop, but they recovered most of their fall later in the day, paring the losses made by energy stocks.Tribune jumped 4.2 per cent to $31.58 after the newspaper group said it was proceeding with its $2bn share buyback offer. There were reports it might also spin off its broadcasting group.Procter & Gamble proved attractive for investors skittish about a slowing economy. The world’s biggest consumer goods maker rose 2.8 per cent to $54.74, its best day in more than a year.Consumer goods and food retailers, both defensive plays, were the best performing sectors in the S&P.Fears of a slowing economy also fed through to advertising and recruitment company Monster Worldwide, which tumbled 4.9 per cent to $42.45.Novellus Systems, the manufacturer of semiconductor-making equipment, added 7.6 per cent to $24.16 after it raised its revenue and earnings forecasts. But other chipmakers suffered. Citigroup cut its price target on both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, citing the risk of a price war between the two. Intel fell 1.6 per cent to $17.11 and AMD dipped 3.5 per cent to $27.03.Apple Computer rose 3.8 per cent to $60.76 on reports that the company might escape antitrust fines from the European Commission. Other technology stocks to gain included Electronic Arts, which added 2.7 per cent to $42.38.Allergan added 3.9 per cent to $102.27 after announcing that it had won FDA approval for a new drug to treat facial wrinkles.Gold continued to fall, dragging materials stocks down with it. Barrick Gold dropped 2.2 per cent to $28.17 and Freeport McMoran shed 2.6 per cent to $49.93. Newmont Mining fell 1.4 per cent to $49.77.
471;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:27+0000;Computer pack top dogs lose their bite;;"When you bought your last personal computer, there is a good chance you logged on to a Dell website, picked a machine with the most powerful Intel processor you could afford, then loaded it up with Windows XP and Office, the staples of desktop software. After that, you were on your own.Your next purchase could be very different. You may go into a store to select from a range of slicker multimedia machines and to make sure there is someone you can turn to when things go wrong. The processor could end up being a less powerful chip from AMD, a perennial also-ran to Intel. The machine will almost certainly still run Windows – but when you turn it on, you may be greeted by software from Google.These are all glimpses of the future as envisaged by none other than Michael Dell, who has profited more than most from the old ways of the PC business. At 41, the boy wonder of the industry realises that things are changing. So it is a shame that he, like his counterparts at Intel and Microsoft, is simply not best positioned to handle this shift.It has become accepted wisdom in the technology world that innovation on the PC is over – indeed, that the PC era itself will soon be over, as mobile phones, videogame consoles and other computing devices take up the running. This is yesterday’s computing platform.The reality is more subtle. The PC is far from dead – annual sales have jumped from under 50m to more than 200m a year in the past decade and are still rising steadily. The PC ecosystem, however, is starting to shift and in ways that Microsoft, Intel and Dell itself can no longer control.Consider what has been going wrong with the old system. To establish their dominance of the PC world, the Big Three relied on mutually supportive business models. Microsoft added more and more features to its software to encourage users to keep upgrading to new versions of Windows and Office, Intel made faster and faster chips to handle the new software, and Dell used its direct sales approach to sell cheaper and cheaper boxes. More, Faster, Cheaper became the mantra behind successive waves of new PCs.This approach no longer works as well as it once did. Instead, it has become a recipe for bloated software, inefficient chips and bad service.Just look at the troubles the Big Three have run into. Microsoft is years behind schedule with its next version of Windows: the program got too big to be managed. By delivering its software as a service over the internet, Google has been able to release new products more quickly.Intel has reached the physical limits of speed: smaller, faster chips leak too much power. AMD, by putting a number of slower processing “cores” on a single chip, has come up with
a better design, forcing Intel to change course.Dell’s approach to low-cost production still works fine. The trouble is, other companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo have learnt how to copy the advantages of its methods, while the disadvantages – a lack of sales and service support – have become more apparent.Step forward Mr Dell, who has come up with three intriguing notions over the past month that suggest how things are changing. One has been to end his exclusive deal with Intel in order to start building AMD chips into some of his company’s servers. This is a seismic event in the tech world, a weakening of one of the industry’s closest alliances, and is widely expected to lead to the appearance of AMD chips in Dell PCs as well.A second change of course has been to start loading Google software on to Dell PCs before they are shipped. This is partly defensive for Google, which needs to secure a position in front of its users before the arrival of the next versions of Windows and Office, which will favour Microsoft’s own search software.Google may be known as an internet company, but it now has a “software-lite” strategy for the PC, using Dell to distribute lightweight “toolbar” and desktop search products that stand in marked contrast to the bloated software of Microsoft. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, last week promised more to come.The sight of Dell distributing software on behalf of Microsoft’s arch-enemy should warm the hearts of antitrust regulators in Washington. Windows may still be ubiquitous, but the days when PC makers feared reprisals from Microsoft if they stepped out of line seem to be over.Mr Dell’s third notion is to open stores to sell his company’s machines. This is a telling moment for a company founded on the economic advantages of selling over the telephone and internet. The low-cost, commoditised box is no longer the be-all and end-all of the PC business.Microsoft is now in the unfamiliar position of trying to copy Google’s approach to software development, while Intel is aping AMD’s approach to chip design. Dell, meanwhile, is trying to look more like Apple, whose company-owned stores have helped to breathe new life into the Mac.What is interesting about all of this is not that the Big Three are about to be overthrown. It is that others have found ways to make money on the desktop, profiting from a computing platform that was thought to be securely in the hands of Microsoft, Intel and Dell. History suggests that the old dogs, accustomed for so long to being in charge, will find it hard to learn new tricks.richard.waters@ft.com"
472;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-06-01T22:20:32Z;AMD forecasts continued growth;;Advanced Micro Devices on Thursday forecast a fourfold increase in capacity and new microprocessor designs would enable it to continue to increase its market share and retain a technological edge over the number one player Intel.AMD said it would be able to increase production capacity at its main Dresden chip plant by four times within the next three years and be in a position to supply a third of the market for the dominant “x86” microprocessors by 2008.AMD increased its market share to 21.1 per cent in the first quarter, according to Mercury Research, up from 16.9 per cent a year earlier. It has benefited from manufacturing slip-ups by Intel, which ran short of components, and the superior performance of its processors in the server market.During a technology day at its Silicon Valley headquarters, the company presented a road map to analysts on the future direction of its processors.It said one with four brains – a quad core – would appear from the middle of next year and performance-per-watt, a measure of power-saving efficiency, would increase by 60 per cent on servers based on its Opteron processor in 2007 and would be 150 per cent better in 2008.However, AMD will be a year behind Intel with its next-generation architecture on this timetable. Intel begins to roll out its new processors this month and has moved from 90 nanometre or billionths of a metre to smaller 65-nanometre circuitry well ahead of AMD.AMD sought to convince analysts it could compete with Intel’s manufacturing might. It said 65nm-based processors would ship by the end of this year and 45nm circuitry would follow 18 months later, with 32nm on course for two years after that.AMD shares closed 1.6 per cent higher in New York at $31.39.
473;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-29T18:10:46Z;AMD investing $2.5bn in German chip factory;;Advanced Micro Devices said on Monday it was investing $2.5bn in a German chip factory in a move to expand its capacity and grab more market share from its rival Intel.AMD, the number two maker of PC microprocessors, said it would implement three new projects at its existing Dresden facility over the next three years.This would give it additional production capabilities to produce circular wafers that are 12 inches or 300mm in diameter. The larger diameter wafer yields more than twice as many processor chips and greater efficiencies than its 200mm predecessor.Hector Ruiz, chief executive, said: “As global demand continues to rise for AMD products, we are scaling our manufacturing capacity intelligently to meet our customers’ growing needs.“To achieve this, we are pursuing an aggressive path to invest in and expand our top-rated manufacturing capabilities in Dresden.”AMD has set itself a target of winning 30 per cent of the market for the dominant “x86” family of microprocessors over the next few years. Traditionally, Intel has held around 80 per cent of this market but its lead has been slipping as it has suffered chipset shortages and AMD’s chips have offered better performance.Analysts have said that one of the reasons Dell, the biggest PC customer for chips, has not bought from AMD to date is concern over its manufacturing capacity and ability to deliver.However, Dell announced earlier this month it would use AMD chips for the first time, in a small server segment of the market. AMD may feel its announcement of new capacity could broaden the relationship.AMD has lagged Intel in converting to 300mm wafers and in moving from 90 nanometres or billionths of a metre to 65 nanometre processes.The measurement refers to the reducing width of circuitry on chips, allowing more transistors to be fitted on the die.The Silicon Valley-based company did not say how it would fund the Dresden expansion.
474;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-25T23:12:00Z;Dell to offer Google software on PCs;;The battle for market share among computer makers and internet companies took a new twist on Thursday after Dell, the world?s biggest PC maker said it would sell PCs with pre-installed search software from Google.For Dell, the partnership represents the latest attempt to boost revenues as it struggles against slumping margins, slowing sales growth and a turnround at Hewlett-Packard, its biggest PC rival. Dell last week announced that it would begin shipping some high-end servers containing AMD microchips in a separate attempt to increase sales.For internet search giant Google, the move to offer Dell customers factory-installed search technology represents a direct challenge to Microsoft, the world?s biggest software company, whose suite of software tools has long dominated the PC desktop.Eric Schmidt, Google?s chief excecutive, indicated that Thursday?s announcement marked the beginning of a broader partnership between the two companies.?We are partnering on the advertising and there?s more to come,? he said, adding that both would share revenue from the partnership.Google's rivals are implementing their own strategies to deal with Google?s rapid rise to the top of the internet search market. Yahoo, the search portal, on Thursday announced a multi-year advertising partnership with Ebay, the online auction site. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been talking steps to boost its own search offerings in an attempt to make up lost ground in the lucrative paid search business.Dell said it would install the Google software on all of its consumer and small and medium business PCs. It said it would also offer the Google package to a limited number of its big corporate clients. The company declined to specify how many computers would be installed with Google but said it would be ?certainly in the millions? per year.If successful, Dell?s partnership with Google could set the stage for further deals between software companies and computer makers, as PC groups attempt to squeeze move revenues out of their core hardware business.Software companies such as Google also stand to cash in by tapping into a captive audience of computer users - the same strategy that propelled Microsoft to the top of the world software market after it began bundling programmes such as Microsoft Office with its Windows operating system.Shares in Google fell slighly in after-hours trading, while shares of Dell rose 0.5 per cent to $24.43.
475;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Wall Street slides as rate fears weigh;;Wall Street turned lower on Monday as interest rate fears continued to weigh on sentiment and investors remained skittish over falls in European and Asian markets.NYSE Group was closely watched by investors as the exchange made its bid for control of Euronext.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 4.96 points, to 1,262.07, at one point in the session dipping into negative territory for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1 per cent, or 21.02 points, to 2,172.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent, or 18.73 points, at 11,125.33.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 0.5 per cent. It has lost more than 8 per cent in two weeks, an indication of the comparatively greater pressure smaller companies face when interest rates threaten to rise further.The Vix, the most widely used index of US equity market volatility, remained near one-year highs – an indication of growing risk aversion on the part of investors.“The Vix is up quite sharply, but it’s coming from a 10-year low,” said Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak.“It’s not even as high as it was during a mild setback in 2004.”Trading was brisk in exchange stocks after NYSE Group outlined details of its $10.2bn offer to buy Euro-next. NYSE fell 2.6 per cent to $62.85. Nasdaq, which has been buying up shares in the London Stock Exchange, was down 5 per cent to $31.40 on the news, its lowest level since October 2005.Lowe’s, the home-improvement retailer, fell 4.5 per cent to $59.82 despite reporting better than expected quarterly profit. The company revised its 2006 profit forecast downward slightly and said a housing slowdown could provide a headwind for the company.New contracts between mining companies and steel-makers locked in hefty price increases for iron ore, depressing steel makers. Nucor was down 4.5 per cent to $100.25 and US Steel fell 5 per cent to $60.82.Investment banks suffered as interest rate fears took hold. Bear Stearns dropped 2.4 per cent to $128.68 and Goldman Sachs fell 2.2 per cent to $146.15.Corning skidded 4.9 per cent to $23.29 after it said it would ship lower volumes of its liquid crystal display glass, which is used in televisions and computer monitors.Semiconductors also slumped, led by National Semiconductors which was downgraded by Piper Jaffray from “out perform” to “market perform”, sliding 4.7 per cent to $26.33. Advanced Micro Devices followed suit, shedding 5.1 per cent to $33.18.Other tech stocks fared better. Yahoo gained 3.2 per cent to $30.46 following an upbeat assessment of the stock from Barron’s. Microsoft added 1.4 per cent to $22.88 on the day it launched a cheaper pre-paid licensing system for its software.
476;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-21T18:46:15Z;AMD reflects on sucess of Dell deal;;Advanced Micro Devices winning a future customer for its processors in a tiny segment of the PC market might hardly seem news.But when that customer is Dell Computer, the number one PC maker, and the deal signifies the end of an exclusive relationship with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, AMD can rightly claim something of a breakthrough, writes Chris Nuttall.The market saw it that way on Friday – AMD’s shares jumped 11.5 per cent to $34.95 while Intel’s fell to a new 52-week low of $18.36.Merrill Lynch analysts tried to quantify the dollar impact – the server market Dell competes in was worth $35bn in 2005, but servers running on AMD’s Opteron processors took up only $2.5bn of this.They forecast that if Opteron server revenues grew at 80 per cent for two years, Dell won 10 per cent of the Opteron market by 2007 and used AMD in the high-margin machines containing between two and eight processors, it would generate $823m in incremental revenues, just 1.2 per cent of total sales in 2007.AMD would get a cut of this from its processors’ role, but so far it is only assured of a place in Dell’s four-way and probably its eight-way servers, with Intel’s rival Xeon processor also likely to be offered as an option for Dell customers wanting four or eight processors.“The MP [multi-processor] space is a fairly small slice of the market,” says Scott McLaughlin, Intel spokesman.He adds that Xeon will be more competitive with a processor codenamed Tulsa due in the second half of the year – the same time that Dell will begin offering Opterons.However, Tulsa is still based on Intel’s five-year-old Netburst architecture rather than the new, more power-efficient Core architecture being introduced for lower-end servers, desktop and notebook PCs during the summer.Dell’s decision to begin buying from AMD thus seems to be the result of pressure from customers anxious to achieve the power savings and performance improvements that Opterons offer over Intel’s less efficient chips in the MP segment.Ignoring AMD could have eroded Dell’s market share, with Intel’s rival making market share gains of its own in servers – up from 16.4 per cent in the fourth quarter to 26 per cent in the first quarter, according to Mercury Research.“At the higher end of the multi-processor space, we think we could do better, and we think now that the Opteron product can fill a hole there,” Kevin Rollins, Dell chief executive, told analysts last week.The news came as a further blow to Intel, a day after management faced calls from shareholders at its annual meeting for top executives to be fired.Paul Otellini, chief executive, promised that a strategy review under way would lead to a restructuring that would cut costs and improve performance.“The primary driver behind that [strategic review] is people don’t expect us to lose share,” says Sean Maloney, executive vice-president at Intel.“Our focus over the next nine months is going to be to bring these new products out, ramp them through the roof really fast …and then we want to regain what we lost.”Marty Seyer, senior vice-president of AMD’s commercial business, says that he is convinced that AMD will retain a lead and “keep the performance-per-watt crown”, a reference to the new de facto standard of performance and energy efficiency that the industry has set itself.Tom Smith, semiconductor analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, says: “In the near term, I see some weakness for Intel and an open field for AMD.“It’s credible to me that in two to three years’ time AMD could be a larger and more persistent competitor to Intel than they have been in the past decade.“That’s the sea change people are seeing here.”
477;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-19T20:57:52Z;Wall Street lower amid mixed data;;"Wall Street finished the week lower as mixed economic data painted a confusing picture for investors worried about the possibility of interest rate rises.A commodities sell-off dented the materials and energy sectors, while retail stocks were also in the spotlight as a range of earnings reports mostly heartened investors.Economic data provided cause for cheer and worry in equal measure in a week that saw the release of key inflation numbers. Although producer price data were benign, they were followed by worryingly robust consumer price numbers, which fanned fears that the Federal Reserve would be forced to raise rates again in June.Analysts said weak commodity stocks and inflation concerns were the key drivers behind the week’s decline in equity prices.“I would give equal weight to [commodities prices and] continued concern that inflationary fears will keep the Fed on a tightening trend,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The market didn’t think this was the case for the first four months of the year and it did some adjusting this week.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent, or 5.22 points, for the day at 1,267.03, down 1.9 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite picked up, gaining 0.6 per cent, or 13.56 points for the day at 2,193.88 – a loss of 2.2 per cent for the week. on Friday the index finally broke eight days of consecutive declines, its worse losing streak since September 1994.The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up on Friday, adding 0.1 per cent, or 15.77 points, to 11,144.06, a fall of 2.1 per cent since Monday.In a depressing week for the markets, retail offered some therapy. It was the only major sector to end higher, thanks to mostly strong earnings reports.Robust numbers lifted Sears Holdings after it surprised investors with a
19 per cent increase in quarterly profit. The company’s shares gained 16.1 per cent to $161.89 for the week, its highest level since July of last year. It was the best performer in the S&P 500.The markets also warmed to Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer nudged up
1.7 per cent to $47.32 after it announced a 6 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The results, ahead of forecasts, offset a warning that high energy prices could affect results for this quarter.Others were less fortunate. Wal-Mart’s rival Target fell 5.8 per cent to $49.16, in spite of news of a 12 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The stock was undermined by concerns about the retailer’s shrinking margins.Staples slid 7.9 per cent to $24.52. Although profits rose strongly, investors took fright at sluggish same-store sales that rose just 1 per cent, the slowest rate in three years.The commodities bull run finally looked like it might be running out of steam after a broad-based sell-off on Monday dragged oil and metals lower. A brief rally on Tuesday failed to hold, and Nymex crude for June settled on Friday at $68.53, down 5 per cent for the week, while gold and copper also fell steeply. The S&P Metals and Mining Index was down 10.2 per cent for the week.“The good news is that this takes a bit of the inflationary fears away,” said Mr Hogan.Oil services company Noble shed 11.2 per cent to $68.98, its lowest level since November 2005. ConocoPhillips sank 3.8 per cent to $62.72.Mining and materials stocks also suffered. Barrick Gold shed 9 per cent to $30.56 and Phelps Dodge, the copper producer, lost 12.9 per cent to $83.06. Aluminium producer Alcoa fell 8 per cent to $31.98.One of biggest decliners over the week was Carnival Cruises which shed 12.8 per cent to $40.71 after it cut its outlook for 2006. Of the 10 worst performing stocks on the S&P 500, Carnival was the only stock not involved in energy or mining.Technology stocks were on the move as Advanced Micro Devices surged 10.4 per cent to $34.95 after Dell Computer announced it would no longer exclusively use Intel chips in its PCs. Intel was down 3.6 per cent to $18.36 on the news.But Apple continued to fall, losing 3.5 per cent to $64.51 as Singapore-based rival Creative Labs accused it of patent infringement, prompting a counter-suit from Apple."
478;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-19T15:15:10Z;Dell to buy AMD chips and drop exclusive Intel deal;;Dell signalled a significant shift in alliances in the personal computer world on Thursday as it announced it would end its exclusive use of Intel microprocessors and begin buying from Advanced Micro Devices.The move underscored Dell?s difficulties in competing with rival Hewlett-Packard and others in the PC server sector, where Intel?s chips have been outperformed by those of AMD. It was a further blow for Intel, which has suffered market share losses to AMD in recent months and disappointed on earnings.For AMD, the decision represented a major breakthrough ? it has supplied every other major PC manufacturer apart from the number-one company, Dell. Its shares rose 14 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday in New York on the news. In early trading on Friday morning, they tacked on 10.1 per cent to $34.50.?This is outstanding news, we are just jumping for joy here that Dell has embraced AMD,? said Marty Seyer, senior vice president of AMD?s commercial business.Dell said in its quarterly earnings report that it planned to introduce multiprocessor server computers that would use AMD?s Opteron processors by the end of the year.But Kevin Rollins, chief executive, commented: ?Intel are still going to remain the vast majority of the processors we buy.?Scott McLaughlin, an Intel spokesman, said it was a competitive industry and the multiprocessor sector had been a challenging one. But he said a new processor, codenamed Tulsa, would be available in the second half of the year.Mr Seyer said AMD had reinvigorated the server segment where four processors were installed in systems, providing owners of data centres with major savings on power use and greater ?performance-per-watt?, the new de facto standard of performance for the industry.Dell?s timing could be seen as a determination to recoup market share or as a sign of impatience with Intel.Roger Kay, analyst with Endpoint Technology, commented: ?This was a long time coming, I think the pressure was on Dell to make a move like this, the server area is where Dell was hurting the worst.?The gap in performance is going to be tighter [in the second half], but enterprise customers who already have Opterons need more than a dead heat to reconsider.?Mr Seyer said he was convinced that AMD could retain a lead and ?keep the performance-per-watt crown.?He would not speculate on whether AMD would go on to order processors for the rest of its business, but said:?I do not know of any other server customer that started at the high end and did not go wider with the product line.?The Dell-Intel exclusive relationship has lasted longer than the ?Wintel? alliance with Microsoft, although Intel made its own breakthrough last year when it wooed Apple away from IBM and Freescale Power PC processors.
479;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;The week in technology: Creative differences;;A tit-for-tat legal battle broke out between Apple and Creative this week over technology used in the companies’ rival digital music players.Singapore’s Creative kicked off the action, filing a suit against Apple claiming the iPod maker, which with a 77 per cent share dominates the US market for MP3 players, had infringed one its so-called “Zen” patent relating to hierarchical categorization of music - menus used to choose and play music - and sought to stop sales of some models of Apple’s iconic hand-held digital player.But Apple immediately countersued, and not to be outdone claimed that Creative, whose Zen and Nomad players account for about 10 per cent of the US market, had infringed no less than four of its patents for the display and interface. Creative responded that Apple had never mentioned these issues in discussions concerning Creative’s claims.People have been queuing up to take Apple to court recently as the success of the iPod rubs others up the wrong way. France is trying to force Apple to allow tunes downloaded from its iTunes online music store to be played on MP3 players other than its own, while the company recently batted away a suit by Apple Corp, the Beatles’ company, which tried to stop the computer maker using the Apple name in music-related products and services.Mike on Techdirt was scathing about Creative’s reasoning behind the suit.”Apple’s iPod has done much better in the market than comparable portable music players from Creative - and there are a variety of reasons for that. The idea that it was because they somehow “stole” this one minor idea from Creative is pretty ridiculous on its face.“This is clearly yet another patent lawsuit that is not about encouraging innovation, but about causing trouble in the courtroom for a competitor who figured out the market much more successfully,” he said.However, a forum on Realtechnews showed that not everyone was siding with Apple.In response to the following pro-Apple stance of blogger Bryan Henry - “Looks like an attempt for Creative to cash in on the Ipod popularity. I doubt the courts will give anything to this company unless they have some great evidence. My only fear is that the Ipod may be forced to stop production while the case is heard” - Omac pointed out that Creative had had “their product out over a year before Apple”.“Apple has shot themselves in both feet with this one. The first thing the Creative lawyers will do is establish a pattern of Apple copying from Creative,” he added. He thought the two companies were likely to reach an agreement before the action reached court.Several web commentators thought that regardless of the content of Creative’s objections to the iPod the company, which is struggling with huge losses because of pricing competition, was playing a dangerous game.“Market analysts believe that Creative is playing a losing battle as they are relying on lawsuits to get their competitor out of the market. All these court cases would take a lot of steam out of Creative and the delays in the results would hurt them more than Apple who are profitable and in a good situation to defend themselves in the courts,” said TechWhack News.Apple Urged to take noteApple’s iPod difficulties may only just be beginning, after MTV linked up with Microsoft to create Urge, a new music downloading service that could provide the first serious challenge to iTunes’ virtual hegemony.The service [Try it out here with a 14-day trial], which launched on Wednesday and is incorporated into Microsoft’s latest Media Player technology 11.0, offers 2m tracks at the same 99-cents-each price as iTunes but also has a $14.95 subscription service that allows users to download tracks on to music players.As well as MTV’s marketing clout, the service boasts a surfeit of streaming radio stations and specially-written expert blogs with attached playlists.Urge is going to target consumers who use rival MP3 players to the iPod. These listeners have been unable to use iTunes which Apple has restricted to iPod owners.Early reactions to the service were favourable, with reviewers particularly praising the presentation and quality of blogs and playlists.A ZDnet reviewer described it as “Microsoft’s best jukebox to date” and “an iTunes contender”.“I signed up and have begun testing and really like the new interface. The album view for the library is nice as it displays all of the album art for your folders and the search feature is really fast!,” said Crowe’s Blog. See the things Crowe likes best here.The blog added: “If I DO end up paying for a service, I think this will be the one”. Quite. Apple may want to take note.We iPod users are of course too cool to comment!With so many iPods in circulation and an online service that has more tracks on offer is doing very nicely, Apple doesn’t have to be watching its back just yet (although it might be time to get the Beatles’ back catalogue online Steve).But with so much room for growth in the sector and signs that consumers may be tiring of the higher-priced iPod, Urge may just have a running chance.Dell makes AMD’s dayDell, the number one PC maker, has agreed to use AMD chips in its servers, but said the “vast majority” of chips bought by Dell would continue to be from Intel. Shares in AMD rose 14 per cent in after-market trade.Marty Seyer, senior vice president of AMD’s commercial business sounded like he could barely contain his enthusiasm after years of being eschewed by Dell. “This is outstanding news, we are just jumping for joy here that Dell has embraced AMD.”The story got a relatively meagre 183 comments on Slashdot by the time Tech Review was written, with AMD’s capacity to meet Dell’s high volumes a popular theme.Some were concerned AMD wouldn’t meet the demand but one wrote: “I really think the reason they’re finally using AMD chips is that AMD will finally have the manufacturing capacity to supply Dell.”Details were light but news site The Register said that Dell was “expected to use Opteron in four-socket servers”.Despite limiting its use to servers, a moderate degree excitement was sparked in one of the IT industry’s classic battles: AMD-versus-Intel. The story got 882 “Diggs” and members of the community tech news site were thrilled.“Wow. I was so excited just from the tech standpoint that I forgot that I owned AMD stock for a minute there. Awesome all around!” wrote one.“[Dell] were too good for AMD while they were on their way up and living the good life, now at the first sign of trouble and as people are starting to lose interest they embrace it,” a CNet reader wrote.
480;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Dell chief outlines plan to correct stumbles;;The chief executive of Dell on Thursday outlined a plan to correct stumbles at the world’s biggest computer maker, whose dominance of the PC market has been challenged this year amid falling prices and a turnround in fortunes at Hewlett-Packard, its biggest US rival.Among other moves, Mr Kevin Rollins said the company planned to end two decades of exclusive reliance on Intel microprocessors by introducing microchips made by Advanced Micro Devices into some its high-end server lines.The shift in strategy came as Dell reported an 18 per cent decline in quarterly profits. The slide, which followed a profits warning last week, marked the third time in four quarters that Dell’s quarterly results have fallen short of Wall Street expectations.“The market intensified more than we understood or acknowledged early in the year,” said Mr Rollins, explaining the company’s recent troubles. “Some of our competitors are a little stronger than we thought.”Dell has suffered this year from falling margins, customer service problems, and improvements at HP following a $1.9bn restructuring under chief executive Mark Hurd.HP earlier this week reported profits and sales ahead of expectations, as cost cuts boosted margins across the business.HP’s resurgence, coupled with a fall in average selling prices for computer equipment driven by increased competition from low-cost Asian producers, have combined to challenge Dell’s traditional dominance of the personal computer market.Mr Rollins said Dell maker planned to “reignite growth” by changing its price position, investing in customer service, and accelerating $3bn worth of cost cuts aimed at boosting productivity.Dell reported first-quarter earnings of $762m, a decline of 18 per cent from $934m in the first quarter last year. Revenues were $14.2bn, an increase of only 6 per cent over last year – well below Dell’s traditional pattern of revenue growth in the the the traditional mid-to high teens.Dell said it expected results next quarter to be “similar” to its first-quarter results, and announced that it would end its practice of providing specific quarterly earnings and sales guidance.Dell’s shares, long considered a must-own among technology stocks because of the company’s history of outperformance, have tumbled more than 40 per cent from a July high of $41.54.By contrast, HP’s shares have risen about 57 per cent since Mr Hurd took over as chief executive last year.Dell’s shares rose 1.4 per cent on Thursday to $23.95 ahead of the announcement.
481;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-12T21:40:53Z;Wall Street unsettled by Fed language;;Wall Street was spooked this week by a combination of rising commodity prices and comments from the Federal Reserve that heightened fears about interest rates and inflation.Stocks in focus included Wachovia and Dell, while Archer Daniels Midland and General Motors provided some relief from the gloom.Markets were sluggish in the run-up to the meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open markets committee on Wednesday.The 25 basis point rise in the Fed funds rate to 5 per cent, the 16th in succession, was widely expected but the markets were unsettled by the language used by Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman.Traders initially did not know which way to turn after Mr Bernanke made no reference to a “pause” in monetary tightening, but instead said further rate increases “may yet be needed”.Having slept on it however, investors decided to take fright. This triggered a Thursday sell-off that was the largest loss on Wall Street since January.“That’s quite a typical reaction,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “If you look back at all 16 meetings, the real reaction came the day after, and that’s what we got on Thursday, and we’re seeing some follow-through today [Friday].”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent or 14.68 points for the day, or 2.6 per cent for the week, at 1,291.24.The Nasdaq Composite was also mauled, shedding 1.3 per cent or 28.92 points for the day at 2,243.78 – a loss of 4.2 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from a six-year high to lose 1 per cent, or 119.74 points, on Friday to 11,380.99, a fall of 1.7 per cent for the week.The Russell 2000 Index of small companies fared even worse, losing 5 per cent for the week.Wachovia disappointed investors after it announced it would buy Californian lender Golden West for $25.5bn, a price many investors felt was too high at a time when the lending industry was slowing. Wachovia fell 7.9 per cent to $54.67 for the week, and Golden West rose 5.2 per cent to an all-time high of $74.14.It was a particularly grim week for technology stocks, as bad news hit two titans of the sector, Dell and Cisco, which both made gloomy predictions for future business. The S&P Technology Hardware and Equipment Index dropped back to its February level, down 4.7 per cent for the week.On Tuesday, Dell said that its quarterly profits would fall short of its own forecasts, because of price cuts aimed at increasing market share and revenue. Dell, which had gained 2.7 per cent on Monday, finished the week down 6.5 per cent at $24.02, its lowest level since February 2003.Cisco followed suit the next day, reporting a rise in quarterly profit above analyst expectations. However, the networking equipment manufacturer fell 6.5 per cent to $20.34 after its fourth- quarter revenue forecast disappointed investors. Google which had returned above the $400 level, was also caught in the melee and finished the week down 5.5 per cent at $373.75.Chipmakers also suffered. The separation by Intel of its flash-memory unit – widely seen as a prelude to spinning off the business – allowed it to avoid the worst of the carnage on the Nasdaq. The stock fell just 1.2 per cent over the week. Other chip manufacturers and makers of flash memory were less lucky. Micron fell 7.3 per cent to $15.81, and Advanced Micro Devices slumped 8 per cent to $31.66.“It’s not a good market for tech,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at Cybertrader. “For two years we’ve had a market dominated by energy. There are very few times when energy does well and tech does well.”With commodity prices pushing higher, one of the biggest gainers was Archer Daniels Midland, the largest US producer of ethanol. The stock jumped 8.4 per cent to $44.10, leaving it up 25 per cent since late April and 87 per cent since January.Autos provided another bright spot. Delphi went to court with its unions to try to renegotiate labour contracts. As optimism grew that it would avoid a strike, shares rose 35.8 per cent to $1.31.General Motors, Delphi’s principal customer, also benefited, rising 12.6 per cent to $26.09, amid upgrades by Deutsche Bank and Keybanc Capital Partners.
482;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-09T19:32:08Z;Lex: Dell;;How low can Dell go? The question is one spooking investors, who have watched the computer-maker’s shares plunge 37 per cent in nine months. It is also one for Dell itself as it cuts prices – the cause of its most recent profits warning – to try kick-starting its growth.In the past, Dell’s direct model provided such a cost advantage that it could continually squeeze rivals – by cutting prices and taking market share. But the likes of Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo have not stood still. They have narrowed the cost differential, through improved manufacturing and moves such as using cheaper AMD chips.Dell still leads in terms of market share and margins. But momentum is against it. It is descending from the heights towards the rest of the industry – operating margins should fall from 8.6 per cent two years ago to about 7 per cent this year. HP in contrast, is ascending from its dismal position of negative PC margins a few years ago. Both share prices have been re-rated accordingly.Dell’s magic pricing lever seems to be malfunctioning. There is the risk that, given changes in the market and Dell’s already high market share – particularly of the direct channel – aggressive price cuts will not generate big enough volume increases. Instead, Dell might have to put more focus on service and branding to keep taking market share. Those cost money, take time to achieve and are a serious management challenge.While Dell is not broken, the performance gulf it once enjoyed over rivals has narrowed. The de-rating of the shares, now trading on about 18-times this year’s earnings, reflects that, but it does not make Dell cheap. Investors should expect a protracted management struggle to restore order at Dell, not a sudden bounce back.
483;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-05-08T17:52:03Z;Intel expected to sell memory chip unit;;Intel, the world?s biggest chipmaker, is reorganising its memory chip business, in a move being taken by Wall Street as a signal that it could soon sell or spin off the operation.Shares in Intel rose more than 3 per cent amid the heaviest trading on Nasdaq on Monday as Wall Street took a corporate reorganisation by the world?s biggest chipmaker as a signal that it could soon sell or spin off its memory chip business.Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, said that the move was intended ?to get greater alignment of resources and efficiency through the system.?He said talk of a spin-off would be speculation and Intel would not comment. But sector analysts have suggested that Intel?s memory business ? which is running at an operating loss ? is a prime target for a sale or an initial public offering.It is focused on Nor Flash memory chips. These have been losing out to the rival Nand Flash standard, which is dominated by Samsung of Korea.The chips are used to supply the memory for storing pictures and music on digital cameras and mobile phones.The reorganisation of the memory operations will be overseen by Brian Harrison, who was made head of the Flash Memory group when the new post was created last November.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel?s microprocessor rival, spun off its Spansion flash memory joint venture with Fujitsu last year after it had dragged down financial performance.Last month Paul Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, announced a 90-day review of the company?s operations which is expected to lead to restructuring. He also said there would be $1bn in cost savings this year.Intel disappointed market observers with its first-quarter results and is expecting sales to fall by 3 per cent in 2006 ? after three years of double-digit growth and when the rest of the industry is performing strongly.The company?s stock fell by more than 20 per cent during the first quarter.Doug Freedman, an analyst at American Technology Research, said in a research report that Intel had separated Nor Flash production from its main manufacturing group, and that this was ?likely signalling the IPO or sale of the business?.Mr Mulloy confirmed that a number of facilities had been taken out of the company?s main Technology Manufacturing group (TMG). These included Fab 18, which is a 90-nanometre Nor Flash production plant situated in Israel, a 200mm wafer plant in Ireland and D2, a development plant at Intel?s headquarters in Santa Clara.Mr Mulloy said: ?We have the Number One position in Nor flash, we want to extend that and improve profitability.?
484;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel strives for new route to domination;;"Twenty years after Intel made a transition that changed the technology industry, the world’s biggest chipmaker is engaged in a soul-searching exercise it says could be of equal importance.In the mid-1980s, faced with strong competition from Japanese manufacturers of D-Ram memory chips, Intel decided to get out of the business and focus instead on making microprocessors, the calculating brains of computers.The decision propelled Intel to domination of the emerging market for personal computers – its processors are still in four out of every five PCs – and its move sounded the death knell for most of the mainframe computer manufacturers that had held sway until then.It was one of those “inflection points”, according to Andy Grove, Intel’s former chief executive, that could lead a business to new heights or signal the beginning of the end.But the comparison by Paul Otellini, the current chief executive, last week of his 90-day strategic review with that turning point of two decades ago, has not rung entirely true with Wall Street. His promise of “the full commitment of the management team to make Intel a different type of company” left some with doubts at Intel’s analyst day in New York.“That would be an old dog learning new tricks. This is not a company or a management team that has been willing to admit they are making mistakes,” says Charlie Glavin, analyst at Needham and Company and a former Intel employee.He says Intel has failed to show the same kind of discipline as its rival Texas Instruments in getting rid of existing businesses that might compromise future growth.Mr Otellini’s comments also suggested contradictions. While he promised “no stone will be left unturned”, he said the company structure of five divisions introduced more than a year ago would remain in place.He predicted slowing PC growth this year – in high single-digits percentage-wise rather than the low double-digits forecast by market research firms – but still insisted Intel’s earnings would make a strong comeback in the second half after two poor quarters. “I think they are overly optimistic; you can’t say PC growth is slowing, but we are going to have our second-best second half ever,” says Mr Glavin.Unlike 20 years ago, Intel is not facing a major challenge from Japan but a nibbling away at its market share by a much smaller Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices.AMD’s success is in part due to Intel’s miscalculations. The NetBurst micro-architecture Intel introduced five years ago was aimed at boosting processor speeds to as much as 10 gigahertz. But the heat the chips produced and the power required was untenable and none ever breached the 4Ghz barrier.More recently, Intel has suffered shortages of the chipsets that accompany its processors and has had to resort to supplies from third parties. Meanwhile, AMD has introduced innovative processors that gave it 27 per cent of the server market in revenue terms in the last quarter, according to Mercury Research.Intel has sought to expand beyond the maturing PC market with its new Digital Home and Digital Health divisions, a Channel Products division dedicated to bringing more affordable PCs to emerging economies and a Mobility division that aims to make inroads into mobile phones.Sumit Dhanda, Bank of America analyst, says there is promise in Digital Home, with Intel predicting $1bn in revenues from its new Viiv brand in its first year.“I also share their optimism on emerging markets: look at mobile handsets, once they hit a certain price-point, adoption turned out to be massive, emerging markets are now where 60 per cent of handsets are sold,” he says.But the sources of savings of $1bn this year and a $300m cut in capital expenditure will not be fully clear until the strategic review is completed in the third quarter."
485;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-25T18:17:02Z;McNealy takes the hits and a back seat at Sun;;Brash, optimistic and pugnacious, Scott McNealy will always be identified with Silicon Valley’s great period of exuberant expansion.This week, however, a more muted Mr McNealy was on display, as the co-founder of Sun Microsystems took a step away from centre stage.“We clearly got mis-positioned in the marketplace,” he conceded in an interview, after announcing that he would step down as chief executive officer in favour of Sun’s number two, Jonathan Schwartz.“I’ll take the hits for where we went wrong.”Among the mistakes to which Mr McNealy confessed: Sun over-expanded during the boom years, and waited too long to launch its Solaris computer operating system on low-cost servers that run the standardized X86 chips made by Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.The latter mistake helped to open the door to the Linux open-source operating system, which has become a popular choice for customers looking to escape the high prices of proprietary servers made by companies like Sun.There was one other fault, though, that might sum up the company’s eclipse – the sin of hubris.Sun under Mr McNealy developed an arrogance during the boom years that appeared to blind it to the new realities of the tech world after the bust.“We lost focus on the customer from a quality and service perspective,” the Sun chairman said this week.While Mr McNealy has been more prepared to concede his failings, however, one thing is not about to change.Sun still plans to plough money into the high-tech products that it believes will set it apart, even though that led it to spend 16 per cent of its revenues on research and development last year, a higher figure than most of its rivals. “We will continue to value intellectual property as the key differentiator,” said Mr Schwartz.Squeezing a better return out of that investment in a tech market that is now dominated by low-cost, standardised products will be the new CEO’s biggest challenge.Mr Schwartz at least starts out with what is generally seen as a better product line-up than Sun has had for some time. Revenues from the company’s new AMD-powered servers are running at an annualised rate of $400m and growing fast, the company said.High-end servers based on its multi-core UltraSparc chips have also had good reviews in the tech world.The key now, according to Mr Schwartz, is to increase sales volume.One promising sign is that in the latest quarter the company said that sales of its core products had turned up again in the US – something few on Wall Street had expected.Investors, however, are more likely to dwell in the short term on the need to cut costs further.Mr Schwartz said this week that he would be sharing an office from now on with Mike Lehman, who returned to the company this year as chief financial officer – an apparent nod to the need for tighter discipline on expenses.Sun has already gone some way to trimming its R&D as it focuses on fewer, bigger bets.However, it still maintains a wide range of products not directly related to its core server business, including the Sun Ray, a “thin client” computer and StarOffice, an open-source productivity software package – a throwback to Mr McNealy’s long period of antagonism with Microsoft.While claiming that he needs only to “refine” Sun’s existing business model, Mr Schwartz has already given hints that deeper changes may be needed, for instance to reduce its heavy sales and marketing costs.“The internet is a better discovery mechanism [for finding customers] than any sales rep,” he said.Sun has already converted Solaris into an open-source product – something it says has led to 5m free downloads of the software.Yet trying to compete on the same terms as Linux implies that much bigger reductions in costs – and workforce – may lie ahead.At least Mr McNealy, who oversaw Sun’s rise, will not be the one who has to make the tough choices.
486;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-19T23:08:16Z;Intel profits drop by a third;;Intel’s profits fell by a third in its first quarter, and gross margins are expected to drop below 50 per cent in its second, as the world’s biggest semiconductor maker struggles in the face of slowing PC growth.Intel’s earnings report, its worst since the bursting of the technology bubble, contrasted sharply with those of Qualcomm and Freescale on Wednesday and that of Texas Instruments a day earlier. The trio of chipmakers is focused on a booming mobile phone market, and reported rising profits.Paul Otellini, chief executive, said Intel believed PC growth rates had “moderated over the course of the past few quarters, leading to slower chip-level inventory reductions at our customers and affecting our revenue in the first half of the year.”He announced revenues of $8.94bn and earnings per share of 23 cents – in line with analyst estimates that had been revised down after Intel issued a revenue warning in March. This compared to sales of $9.43bn a year earlier and profits of 35 cents a share. Intel reported first-quarter gross margins of 55.1 per cent, compared with its expectations in January of 59 per cent. It blamed lower microprocessor revenues and higher inventory write-downs.The company has suffered from its customers not requiring chips they had earlier ordered as demand for personal computers slowed – leading to inventory build-up. It has also been losing market share to its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices.There is worse to come in the current quarter – Intel said revenues were expected to be between $8bn and $8.6bn, below normal seasonal patterns. Gross margins would fall to about 49 per cent as it sold more of its cheaper processors and suffered higher costs. Intel is introducing more powerful and efficient chips based on a new micro-architecture in the coming months. Mr Otellini said the new processors would set the stage for a “strong second half”.However, this will not make up for the poor first-half performance – 2006 revenues are expected to be 3 per cent down on 2005 after a three-year run of double-digit sales growth. Intel shares were nearly 1 per cent higher in after-hours trading at $19.75.Qualcomm reported a 34 per cent rise in revenues year-on-year and an 11 per cent rise in profits.Freescale also reported higher sales and profits, while Texas Instruments had experienced a 42 per cent increase in profits in its first quarter.
487;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-17T21:08:25Z;Wall Street falls as oil worries weigh;;"Wall Street retreated sharply on Monday as worries about record high oil prices offset solid earnings from the financial services sector to pull the market lower.US crude oil futures closed at $70.40 a barrel, a record high amid continuing tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme and lingering fears over supply disruption in Nigeria.Alongside surging commodities prices and rising bond yields, Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said sentiments were also rattled by hawkish comments from Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.Mr Moskow said he believed “monetary policy must be vigilant,” expressing his support for the central bank’s stand on raising interest rates as required to guard against inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.6 per cent to 11,073.78; the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,285.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,311.16.Technology stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, with chipmakers and computer hardware makers the worst performing industry groups on the S&P.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 1.5 per cent, led by Advanced Micro Devices’ 3.8 per cent slump to $30.60. Hewlett-Packard was down 1.8 per cent at $32.03 and Intel down 1.3 per cent to $19.19.Weighing on the Dow was General Electric, which fell 1.8 per cent to $33.29 after Credit Suisse cut its prices target on the stock. The note helped drag down other industrials, with 3M and Honeywell shedding 0.9 per cent to $80.26 and 1.2 per cent to $42.88 respectively.Elsewhere, the quarterly earnings season clicked into top gear, with Citigroup climbing 0.6 per cent to $48.35 after delivering a 4 per cent rise in fourth quarter profits.Wachovia, the fourth largest US bank, said lending to businesses and trading helped it achieve 7.4 per cent growth in profits for the first quarter.The bank said it earned $1.77bn excluding merger and restructuring costs in the first quarter, up from $1.65bn in the previous year. Even so, Wachovia’s shares slid 1.4 per cent to $55.05.Discount broker Charles Schwabposted a 68 per cent jump in quarterly earnings, but its shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $17.34.Among other movers, TiVo, which makes digital video recorders, was up
60 cents or 7.5 per cent at $8.65 and was the Nasdaq’s most-actively traded stock.Exchange stocks saw continued activity, as the NYSE Group, which announced last week that it was in discussions with possible acquisition targets, fell 1.1 per cent to $74.25.Shares in its rival Nasdaq, which bought a 14.99 per cent stake in the London Stock Exchange last week, gained 1.9 per cent, or 79 cents, to $43.03."
488;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-16T20:06:12Z;Intel hit as PC market slows;;Intel is expected this week to report its worst quarter in years, with the world’s biggest chipmaker suffering from a slowdown in the personal computer market, an inventory build-up and loss of market share to its chief rival AMD.Semiconductor analysts at Merrill Lynch have predicted the most disappointing set of results and forecasts since the technology bubble burst and have even questioned whether Paul Otellini is the right man to lead the company – less than a year after he became chief executive.“We think that Intel is in need of an overhaul similar to what Lou Gerstner undertook at IBM following that company’s crisis,” said Joe Osha, Merrill Lynch analyst, in a research note this month. “We’re not yet convinced that Paul Otellini, a career Intel man, is the guy to do it.”The note suggests there is “a disconcerting lack of urgency at Intel” and says it is unlikely to “ever return to the dominance it once enjoyed”.Intel shares nearly all of the market for the “x86” processors at the heart of PCs with AMD, but still enjoys more than 80 per cent of industry sales. However, AMD has been gaining.Its share grew from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 2005, and last week it reported further gains in the first quarter. Bank of America analysts said it appeared to have gained up to a further percentage point.AMD has benefited from the superior performance of its chips. Intel has suffered from double-ordering by customers who have then cut back as PC demand has slowed. This has left it with a substantial inventory.Intel is expected to fight back with chips based on its first new architecture in five years. The increased performance and energy-saving features of the Woodcrest and Conroe chips will make it more competitive in desktop PCs and servers.First-quarter earnings of 23 cents a share and revenues of $8.93bn are expected on Wednesday, according to a poll of analysts by Thomson First Call. Second-quarter forecasts should be downbeat and Apjit Walia, semiconductor analyst at RBC Capital markets, sees nothing to spark a rally in Intel shares, which hit a 52-week low of $19.10 last week.“People are saying maybe the worst is over, but the PC market is slowing down and AMD has reached a threshold that’s unprecedented so I’m not that optimistic – I think [the shares are] dead money,” he says.
489;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Wall St unsettled by commodities surge;;"Industrial blue chips held their ground on Wall Street this week but the wider
market buckled as a surge in commodity prices and a jump in long-term bond yields unsettled investors.Crude oil futures topped $69 a barrel as unrest in Nigeria and deepening tensions with Iran stoked fresh fears over supply disruption.Worries over the prospect of mounting inflationary pressures were further fuelled by soaring metal prices – gold broke through the $600 an ounce mark and copper breached $6,000 a tonne.The strength of commodities took the shine off some surprisingly strong sets of quarterly earnings from bellwethers such as Alcoa and Micron Technology.Despite the volatile trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the truncated four-day week 0.2 per cent higher at 1,1137.65. However, the S&P 500 retreated 0.5 per cent to 1,289.12 while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,326.11 despite a rally on Thursday led by Intel.Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the market held up well in spite of the headwinds it was facing. However, he warned that strong earnings, which had helped curtail losses on the main indices, would not be enough to support the market in the longer term.“At the moment, expectations of strong corporate earnings are holding the market up against inflation and interest rate fears,” he said. “But what is going to hold the market up after we are through with the earnings season?”With the 10-year US Treasury bond yield rising above 5 per cent for the first time in nearly four years, Mr Pado said some investors might now be tempted to shift their money out of equities and into fixed income.“Investors are looking beyond this quarter’s earnings,” he said. “They are scrutinising second-quarter guidances for reasons to stay in equities.”The lack of earnings upside prompted traders to unload their shares in General Electric. Although GE delivered a 14 per cent increase in first-quarter profit – in line with forecasts – investors were disappointed that the conglomerate did not raise its 2006 outlook. The stock fell 1.7 per cent on Thursday and ended the week down 0.4 per cent at $33.89.Similarly, Advanced Micro Devices, which swung to a larger-than-expected first-quarter profit and reported market share gains against rival Intel, tumbled more than 10 per cent on Thursday on concerns over the chipmaker’s weak second-quarter guidance. For the week, it fell 5.6 per cent at $31.80.Intel, due to report its quarterly figures next week, gained 1.1 per cent to $19.45 on speculation that it might cut its chip prices to regain market share. The stock was also boosted by positive comments from analysts at Bank of America, who said negative perception about Intel had “overshot” reality.Overall, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index saw a weekly loss of 1.7 per cent.Supporting the Dow was aluminium maker Alcoa, which jumped 3.7 per cent to $33.71 after it topped market estimates with its 50 per cent jump in first-quarter profits. Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch all raised their price target on the stock, saying they expected the shares to be buoyed by the continued strength in metal prices.Other blue chip gainers included Boeing, up 4.2 per cent to $82.93 after it closed a deal to sell 80 of its 737 jets to China, and General Motors, which gained 4.6 per cent at $20.40 after the cash-strapped automaker agreed to sell its stake in Isuzu for about $300m.On the downside, Bausch & Lomb, the maker of contact lenses and eye-care products, plunged 19.9 per cent to $46.17 this week as major retailers, including K-Mart and Sears, pulled its ReNu with MoistureLoc products from their shelves following reports of fungal infections among some users. The stock was hit by downgrades from JPMorgan Chase, Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs, with the latter saying the health advisories posed “significant uncertainty and risk” to Bausch’s forward earnings.Stock exchange mergers were back on the agenda after Nasdaq Stock Market acquired a 14.99 per cent stake in the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq rose
2.6 per cent to $42.24, while rival NYSE Group fell 3.8 per cent to $75.08."
490;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-13T21:14:31Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street higher;;Technology stocks led Wall Street higher on Thursday as a flurry of positive corporate earnings helped stocks weather a rise in long-term interest rates.Stocks wobbled in early morning trade after the 10-year US Treasury bond yield broke through the psychologically significant 5 per cent for the first time in nearly four years, amid increasing investor concern about building inflationary pressures.Rising bond yields kept a lid on industrial blue chips, but tech stocks saw gains after sector bellwether Intel jumped 1.5 per cent to $81.98.Intel shares rose following some positive comments from Bank of America.“Negative perception has likely overshot reality,” said analyst Sumit Dhanda. “Despite the likely negative tone of Intel’s report, overall, we think investor sentiment is even more negative.”The Nasdaq Composite index ended the light pre-holiday session up 0.5 per cent at 2,326.11, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both edged up 0.1 per cent to 11,137.65 and 1,289.12, respectively.Expectations that Intel might cut its chip prices to expand market shares boosted shares in semiconductor equipment makers. Lam Research rose 4.6 per cent to $46.77 and Applied Materials gained 3.9 per cent to $18.10.Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices, delivered stronger than expected first-quarter earnings, but the stock tumbled 10.2 per cent to $31.80 after Sanford C. Bernstein downgraded the stock, citing among other things, concerns over AMD’s weak second-quarter guidance.Still in the technology sector, IBM rose 1.5 per cent to $81.98 after Lehman Brothers raised its price target on the stock from $90 to $92.Shares in SanDisk shot up 4.1 to $61.90 after Standard & Poor’s announced that the maker of flash-memory products will replace Chiron Corp in its benchmark index.Gains on the Dow were limited by General Electric, which fell after it reported earnings that failed to inspire investors. Profits at the giant conglomerate rose 14 per cent in the first quarter, in line with forecasts and the company also affirmed its 2006 guidance.But the stock, which has risen more than 1.5 per cent over the last two sessions, dropped 1.7 per cent to $33.89 as investors moved to lock in profits.“The lack of earnings upside may be modestly disappointing given recent positive preannouncements by Ill Tool Works, 3M, and Danaher,” said Deane Dray, analyst at Goldman Sachs. Goldman maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock, however, saying that it believes “the pendulum is swinging towards favouring GE’s long-cycle and services business mix.”Also on the Dow, McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $34.85 in spite of beating market expectations with its 6.6 per cent rise in March same-store sales.
491;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-12T22:13:27Z;AMD moves into Intel’s turf;;Intel’s stranglehold on the computer microprocessor market was loosened further by its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in the first quarter as it reported market-share gains in a new generation of chips.AMD opened the technology hardware earnings season on an optimistic note for the industry, with profits well ahead of Wall Street’s expectations at 38 cents a share, compared with an analyst consensus of 30 cents gathered by Thomson Financial.But its comments did not augur well for erstwhile bellwether Intel, which reports next week along with other major US chipmakers Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Freescale.“AMD had another great quarter,” said Bob Rivet, chief financial officer. “Building on our positive momentum, we believe we once again gained dollar market share based on strong customer demand for AMD64 single and multi-core processors.”The move to computing that addresses 64-bit instead of 32-bit memory and from single-core to dual-core processors has been driving sales for Intel and AMD, which share the market for the dominant “x86” family of microprocessors.In a Merrill Lynch report released last week entitled “Looking into the Q2 Abyss”, semiconductor analyst Joe Osha said Intel’s results next Wednesday would “probably be the worst set of results and forecasts that the company has delivered since the bursting of the bubble”.He cited excess inventory, pricing pressures and AMD’s long-held lead in processor technology for servers as raising short-term and long-term doubts about Intel’s ability to regain the dominance it once enjoyed.AMD shares closed 3 per cent higher at $35.42 in New York and were flat in after-hours trading. Intel’s fell 0.2 per cent to hit a 52-week low of $19.12.Intel still supplies the processors in four out of every five PCs made globally but AMD’s market share has increased significantly of late – rising from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent from the third to fourth quarters of 2005.Last month, Intel issued a first-quarter sales warning, in part blaming further market share loss.
492;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-04-10T16:36:37Z;Market Overview: Commodity strength boosts equities;;"US and European equity markets started the week on a positive note as persistent strength in commodity prices gave a boost to mining and oil stocks.Copper and zinc both recorded fresh all-time highs, while gold hit a fresh 25-year peak of $598.10 an ounce but failed to push through the psychological $600 barrier.Benchmark US oil futures, meanwhile, climbed above $68 to a two-month high amid growing fears that the US may launch military strikes against Iran.By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent, the S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent higher and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent, as all three indicators recovered some of Friday’s steep declines.Those losses came after a robust US employment report led some investors to rethink their stance on how high the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates.Tim Harris, markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said the jobs figures had challenged the notion that the Fed was close to taking a pause from raising interest rates, and also noted that William Poole, the president of the St Louis Fed, had hinted that he was leaning towards a Fed funds rate of 5.25 per cent.But Mr Harris added: “The middle of an economic cycle tends to produce contrasting data from one week to another and we should also look to data, such as housing activity and industrial confidence, to see whether the Fed needs to continue tightening.”“Our read is that the Fed remains on course to move to hold on interest rate policy soon.”There might be some respite from the debate over interest rates as the US first-quarter earnings season gets under way.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, was scheduled to kick things off after the close of trade on Monday, and results are also due this week from General Electric and Advanced Micro Devices.Paul Ashworth, senior international economist at Capital Economics, warned that US profits growth was likely to slow this year.“We expect profits growth to slow from 16.4 per cent last year to around 11 per cent this year,” he said. “Our forecast profile for corporate profits is consistent with modest declines in S&P earnings per share too.”“A modest decline in earnings appears to be consistent with our existing forecasts that the S&P 500 index will fall to 1,200 by the end of this year and 1,100 by the end of 2007,” he added.European stocks moved ahead in spite of a steep fall for Swiss biotechnology group Serono after it abandoned its search for a suitor. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent.Italian stocks outperformed after exit polls pointed to a win for Romano Prodi in the country’s general elections. The MIB30 index rose 1.3 per cent as fears of parliamentary paralysis were eased.Asian equities broadly declined, with the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific index retreating from a 16-year high struck on Friday. There was more pain for the Saudi Arabian market as the country’s main share index dived, down 8.3 per cent in late trade.The dollar gave back some of the gains chalked up against the euro at the end of last week as investors looked ahead to US trade data on Wednesday and retail sales figures on Thursday.Treasury bonds attracted bargain-hunters following the steep falls last week which drove the yield on
10-year paper to a four-year high within a whisker of 5 per cent."
493;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;IBM unveils security for chips;;IBM will unveil a technology on Monday that aims to bring a new level of security to devices such as PDAs and mobile phones that were previously considered vulnerable to attacks.“SecureBlue”, as the technology is called, will enable encryption of data to protect it on the core processors, or central chips, that power such devices. IBM’s initiative might put pressure on processor makers Intel and AMD to step up security on their chips.The invention hard-wires encryption capabilities into a section of the central processor chip, giving a hardware solution that is faster and more efficient than existing security software. IBM hopes to license the technology to chipmakers.“More than half of enterprise data is not on the servers any more, it’s all over the place – on your Blackberry or your phone or laptop or with your business partners,” Charles Palmer, manager of security and privacy at IBM Research, told the Financial Times. “These devices are in harm’s way, but if they are subject to abuse or attack they will not yield their secrets if they have SecureBlue.”Dan Olds, analyst with the Gabriel Consulting Group, said: “I believe you are going to see more and more of these security products embedded because of the amount of sensitive information flowing to non-traditional devices like PDAS and cellphones,” Mr Olds said. “On corporate systems, these are the weakest link.”Intel has been working to incorporate security into its chips with a technology codenamed LaGrande, while AMD has a similar project called Presidio.Richard Doherty, analyst with the Envisioneering group, said: “You’d expect some sort of response to this from these two, because they haven’t delivered on the demands from enterprises for more secure platforms.“We think this will be a wake-up call for them to look at this – SecureBlue represents a technology breakthrough in getting security down to this scale.”
494;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

Caterpillar rose 2.5 per cent to $76.21 and Honeywell gained 0.9 per cent to $42.66.The gains took the Dow 0.7 per cent higher at 11,317.43, while the broader S&P 500, buoyed by gains in energy stock climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,305.04. The Nasdaq Composite turned around earlier losses to trade 0.4 per cent higher at 2,303.35.Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders rose. Morgan Stanley, which topped analyst expectations with its 17 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, jumped 2.5 per cent to $61.94, while JPMorgan added 1.9 per cent to $41.99.Pharmaceutical stocks also moved broadly higher after drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb settled a key patent dispute with Canadian generic drugmaker Apotex.The deal, which would allow Bristol to retain patent protection on its blockbuster Plavix blood thinning treatment until 2011, prompted rating upgrades from UBS, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan.Bristol shares shot up 10.6 per cent to $25.24, while Eli Lilly ended the session 2.1 per cent higher at $58.49.Overall, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology index rose 1.2 per cent to become the second-best performing industry group on the S&P.By contrast, technology stocks were under pressure, with Microsoft sliding 2.1 per cent to $27.15 after it announced late on Tuesday that the finished consumer version of its Vista operating system would not be available until next year.Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping
season.Shares in Hewlett-Packard slid 0.5 per cent to $33.36 while Gateway slumped 2.8 per cent to $2.36. Apple Computer, which does not use the Windows operating system, also got caught in the the falling trend, easing 0.2 per cent to $61.67 after having risen by as much as 1.5 per cent earlier in the day.Losses on the Nasdaq were pared by Chaparral Steel, which surged 16.5 per cent to $57.50 following a strong quarterly earnings report. The robust figures set off a buying spree on metal makers. US Steel jumped 4.4 per cent to $59.86 while Alcoa gained 0.8 per cent to $29.36.On the earnings front, Nike and FedEx both exceeded analysts’ expectations with their earnings.

After racking up three consecutive days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its advance yesterday, rising 0.2 per cent to close at 11,279.65.The S&P 500, which broke through the 1,300 mark on Wednesday for the first time since May 2001, edged up another 0.2 per cent to 1,307.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to settle at 2,306.48.This took the weekly gain for the Dow to 1.8 per cent, for the S&P to 2 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 2 per cent.The week produced record quarterly figures from Wall Street’s top investment banks, which defied expectations that their trading businesses would suffer as US short-term interest rates increased.Goldman Sachs set the bar for its peers on Tuesday as it delivered first-quarter net profits 50 per cent ahead of analyst forecasts.The stellar performance was followed by Lehman Brothers, which unveiled a 24 per cent jump in quarterly earnings and Bear Stearns, which reported a
34 per cent earnings increase on the back of strong performances in trading, derivatives, investment banking and wealth management.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein Research, said he expected merchant banking “to remain an exceptional business in 2006”.Goldman Sachs ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $150.36, while Lehman and Bear Stearns inched up 0.5 per cent to $142.80 and 0.5 per cent to $132.87 respectively, having seen their gains pared by profit-taking.Investment banks were not the only ones doing brisk business. Charles Schwab shot up 11 per cent to $18.13 after the discount broker issued a bullish first-quarter forecast, saying client trade was up 52 per cent last month, compared with the same period a year before.Railroad stocks also chugged ahead after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit guidance by 20 per cent, and CSX, the third-
biggest, was upgraded by analysts at UBS.Separately, Merrill Lynch raised its price estimates on Union and four other rail companies, saying railroads had benefited from increased shipping of commodities such as coal.The Dow Jones transportation index gained 2.2 per cent for the week. The S&P railroads index jumped 6.2 per cent, led by Union, up 6.2 per cent to $91.07 and CSX, up 7.6 per cent to $59.46.Energy stocks had a lacklustre start to the week, thanks to data which revealed rising crude inventory levels in the US. However, that news was overshadowed by mounting tensions in Iraq.The announcement by the US military of the start of “Operation Swarmer” – the largest aerial bombing campaign since the 2003 invasion – saw traders rush to cover short positions.Heavyweight oil stocks felt the benefit of heightened worries over the sustainability of crude supplies, with ExxonMobil climbing 3.2 per cent to $61.05, Chevron up 5.7 per cent to $57.18 and Marathon Oil putting on
9.9 per cent to $76.36.The upswing in crude prices weighed on chipmakers. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tumbled 3.2 per cent on Thursday, ended the week with a loss of 1.2 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices led the way with a 7.3 per cent fall to $33.95 as investors exited the sector to jump on the energy bandwagon.Merrill Lynch said it believed investors were factoring in the reality that there was little additional volume growth upside or margin leverage left in the semiconductor sector.North Fork Bancorp climbed 14.8 per cent to $29.10 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash-and-shares deal. Calyon Securities said the deal came as a surprise, but it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. Shares in Capital One fell 8.9 per cent to $81.90.General Motors, which tumbled nearly 5 per cent yesterday after announcing 2005 losses were $2bn deeper than previously thought, ended the week 2.4 per cent lower at $21.13."

However, the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 11,076.02.Shares in North Fork Bancorp rose 15 per cent to $29.20 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash and stock deal.Calyon Securities maintained its “add” rating on Capital One, saying that while the deal came as a surprise, it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. “We also think it does a lot to further the company’s transformation into a traditional banking business,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Calyon.Shares in Capital One fell 7.6 per cent to $83.10.Elsewhere, newspaper publisher McClatchy slipped 2.9 per cent to $51.55 after saying it would acquire Knight Ridder, its larger rival, in a cash and stock deal worth $4.5bn. Knight Ridder eased 1.7 per cent lower to $63.92.Analysts at Merrill Lynch noted McClatchy shares had moved up on Friday as it became clear the company was the frontrunner to acquire Knight Ridder. “This leads us to believe that some of the more risk adverse money had already bolted the shares,” they said. “We believe the deal would be attractive financially to McClatchy.”The telecommunications sector was also in focus on reports that Verizon had made an initial approach to Vodafone for its 45 per cent stake in the companies’ Verizon Wireless joint venture.Verizon rose 0.4 per cent to $34.32, while Vodafone put on 4.8 per cent to $22.56.Shares in the Nasdaq Stock Market eased 0.6 per cent to $43.30 after jumping more than 10 per cent on Friday following its $4.2bn bid for the London Stock Exchange. The bid was rejected as too low, but few people were predicting the end of the affair, with the NYSE Group, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, up 9.3 per cent to $81.49, predicted to enter the fray.Watson Pharmaceuticals slipped 1.9 per cent to $29.00 after saying it had agreed to buy Andrx in a $1.9bn deal designed to bolster its generic drugs business. Shares in Andrx climbed 9.9 per cent to $23.73.Away from M&A, Apple Computer rose 3.9 per cent to $65.68 as Citigroup upgraded shares in the maker of the iconic iPod music player from “hold” to “buy”.The broker said that while product transitions had conspired against the company during the current quarter, it expected new products to fuel growth in April. “Apple remains one of the best ways to play the digitisation of music, photos and video,” analysts said.Elsewhere in the technology sector however, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 7.2 per cent to $34.00 after broker ThinkEquity Partners downgraded the stock from “buy” to “sell”. Analysts said the change was triggered by talk that Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, was beginning to slash prices.
499;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-03-10T21:32:40Z;Inflation worries prey on Wall Street sentiment;;US equities put in a mixed performance this week amid fears about a build-up of inflationary pressure in the world’s largest economy.Worries that the Federal Reserve might extend its current cycle of interest rate rises pushed yields on 10-year Treasury bonds to their highest level for 21 months early in the week. This depressed share prices as investors focused on the impact of higher borrowing costs on corporate profits.Friday’s employment data offered the market some respite, however. Although US job creation in February grew at a faster pace than predicted, investors shrugged off fears of possible wage-induced inflation, preferring to focus on the implications for economic growth.“The employment report should be seen as broadly neutral, with the slightly stronger than expected increase in payrolls broadly offset by the tick upwards in the unemployment rate,“ said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. “With productivity still increasing and wages still not rising in real terms, the Fed shouldn’t be unduly worried by this.”By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1 per cent at 11.076.34, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,281.58 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,262.04.The rally took the weekly gains on the Dow to 0.5 per cent, although the S&P was still off 0.4 per cent and Nasdaq down 1.8 per cent.The technology sector was the hardest hit, with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, falling 2.3 per cent to $19.85, Advanced Micro Devices shedding 7.3 per cent to $36.63 and National Semiconductoroff 7.6 per cent at $27.12.“Technology stocks fell because they are the quintessential growth cyclicals,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Elsewhere in the sector, Texas Instruments lost 4.7 per cent to $30.77 after the world’s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips failed to deliver the strong earnings outlook some investors were hoping for. Shares in Google, the world’s most-used internet search engine, fell 10.8 per cent to $337.50 after the company urged investors to ignore a financial forecast unwittingly posted on its website.The week also saw a renewed upswing in merger and acquisition activity, including AT&T’s $67bn move for BellSouth.The deal, which would make AT&T the largest telecommunications company in the world, prompted speculation that more consolidation in the sector could be on the horizon as wireless, cable and conventional phone companies look for ways to counter AT&T’s newfound dominance.Verizon, the second largest US carrier, gained 1.8 per cent to $34.19 on the week, while Alltel and Sprint Nextel, widely seen as a potential takeover target for Verizon, climbed 2 per cent to $65.60 and 4.8 per cent to $25.37 respectively.AT&T shares ended the week 2.7 per cent lower at $27.16 while BellSouth, which was upgraded by Bear Stearns, surged 9.2 per cent to $34.35 over the five sessions.Meanwhile, Blackstone Group’s $5.6bn deal to acquire CarrAmerica Realty showed that rising interest rates have done little to damp interest in real estate investment trusts. Carr-America ended the week up 7.8 per cent at $44.30.General Motors was the top performing stock on both the Dow and the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $21.64.Its shares were lifted by a combination of positive factors, including reports it was near an agreement with the United Auto Workers union to cut labour costs.The NYSE Group received a warm welcome this week as trading got underway in the company formed from the New York Stock Exchange’s merger with Archipelago Holdings. The stock ended its first session up nearly 25 per cent. However, profit-taking eroded some of its gains and the stock ended the week 11.3 per cent higher at $74.55.
500;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-03-09T20:11:34Z;Intel banks on new chips and new technology;;When asked about morale at his company, Paul Otellini recalls the mood of staff a week ago when Intel warned Wall Street about another tough quarter.During an open forum for workers at the world’s biggest chipmaker, the chief executive explained that demand for its microprocessors was turning out to be weaker than expected in the first quarter as it suffered further losses in market share to rival AMD.Response from the audience of sales, marketing people and engineers at Intel’s Folsom campus in the foothills of California’s Sierra Nevada was “as lively and robust and challenging as anything we’ve had”, he recalls. “It was not a bunch of people who were morose or shocked.”This week the chipmaker had a chance to fight back at its Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco, where it unveils many of its product plans and chip roadmaps to its developer community.Executives’ speeches focused on its first new architecture in five years being introduced in the second half. It promises major performance and energy-saving improvements for the complete range of mobile, desktop and server processors.“With these products that are coming, I think we will see the energy levels just pick up,” says Mr Otellini.Intel’s 100,000 employees worldwide have a case for being downhearted, with shares in their company dipping below $20 to their lowest level in 18 months. But their leader recalls that each time Intel has combined new processor designs with advances in core technologies, it has made rapid gains in market share.Mr Otellini predicts this alignment will happen again this year as the new chips become available and Intel’s huge manufacturing capacity switches to silicon with circuit widths of just 65 billionths of a metre, down from the current 90 nanometre standard. Intel says it is a year ahead of AMD in making the switch.The cost savings brought about by the smaller circuitry mean the price cuts that analysts see as inevitable as Intel tries to win back market share will be less painful.For its part, AMD argues it is still getting far better performance than Intel out of 90nm and customers are favouring its processors on more than just price grounds.“Just because you have the capacity doesn’t mean you’re the leader – look at General Motors, it’s not a fait accompli,” says Margaret Lewis, director of commercial solutions strategy at AMD.“Yes Intel has a lot of money and it can cut prices. But the sales force of one of our partners say they had a customer that would not accept its processors [when offered] for free.”All processor manufacturers are emphasising “performance per watt” in their sales pitches – arguing that the new dual-core technology that puts two processors on the same chip gives both performance improvements and energy savings. These can dramatically cut utility bills that exceed the cost of the computer over its lifetime.AMD’s lead in cooler, faster processors has seen its market share grow to 15.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from 9.6 per cent a year earlier.But the developer forum was told that Intel’s new architecture would bring an 80 per cent improvement in performance and a 35 per cent increase in energy savings in its top-end server processors.With PC demand weakening, Intel is also exploring new markets and concepts to maintain its growth. Its one-year-old Digital Health division is still in its formative stages but Digital Home has got off to a strong start with the launch of the Viiv platform in January and the shipping of hundreds of thousands of units this quarter.IDF also saw the unveiling of the Ultra Mobile PC by its Mobility division. The UMPC, developed in concert with Microsoft, is an attempt to define a new smaller type of notebook device that offers entertainment options, wireless internet connectivity and makes the keyboard optional.“There’s a lot of potential for it in the upper end of the consumer segment and even the broader consumer market. For this to get the most attention, they’ve got to get it to a price point of under $500,” says Tim Bajarin of the Creative Strategies consultancy.Mr Otellini appears cautiously optimistic: “It’s a non-existent market today but one could argue that the iPod was addressing a non-existent market [when it launched].”
501;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-03-07T21:04:31Z;Intel upbeat on fight for market share;;Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, on Tuesday predicted the world’s biggest chipmaker was at the beginning of a cycle that could lead to rapid market-share gains over rival Advanced Micro Devices.Mr Otellini was speaking to reporters at the Intel Developer Forum where the company introduced a new PC format it dubbed the Ultra Mobile PC. Microsoft has code-named it the Origami Project ahead of its own unveiling of the device on Thursday at the Cebit technology show in Germany.Intel issued a first-quarter revenue warning last week and admitted to further market-share loss to AMD as it suffered from chipset shortages and an inventory build-up by its customers. AMD says it increased its market share from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent between the third and fourth quarters.Justin Rattner, Intel’s chief technology officer, told the forum that the company was “under tremendous competitive pressure” but was responding with a new micro architecture for its chips that would boost performance. It was also a year ahead of its rivals in producing smaller 65-nanometre circuit widths on silicon.Mr Otellini later told reporters that the company had fared best when design and technology breakthroughs came together. It had gained five to eight percentage points of market share within a year when the company moved from the 486 to the Pentium processor and from Pentium 3 to Pentium 4, he said.“We are at one of those dual transitions – a new micro architecture and new silicon technology - and we have the capacity to retake share and that’s our statement of intent this year.”The move from 90nm to 65nm circuits for processors at four factories will produce major cost savings for Intel. Mr Otellini said it would also free up 90nm facilities to produce the chipsets that accompany processors. “We just couldn’t build them fast enough in the last year,” he admitted.Mr Rattner said the new architecture would produce an 80 per cent improvement in performance and a 35 per cent improvement in power demands for its server processor codenamed Woodcrest.The new ultra mobile PC (UMPC) will feature next-generation Intel chips and Microsoft Vista software, offering an optional keyboard, wireless connectivity and a smaller format.“It’s a non-existent market today but we think, if you look at the evolution of phones getting smarter and the capabilities of the notebooks as they get smaller, there’s a blurring between them and the Ultra Mobile PC is the first device we’ve seen that starts to address any opportunity in that space,” said Mr Otellini.“How big a market is it going to be? - we’ll figure that out.”
502;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Small player is fast enough for supercomputer;;"IBM must have thought it was on to a shoo-in. Late last year the creator of Blue Gene, the world’s fastest supercomputer, was ­confidently expecting a positive response to its bid to build a machine that would be almost as powerful for the Tokyo Institute of Technology.But instead, the institute opted for a consortium led by NEC, the Japanese computer group. Alongside big names such as Sun Microsystems, US chip-maker AMD and US networking specialist Voltaire Infiniband, the grouping includes UK-based Clear-Speed Technology, which is providing $2m worth of specialised microprocessor technology which will give the supercomputer its blinding speed. Ironically, IBM makes ClearSpeed’s chips on a contract basis in its US fabrication plants.The Japanese order represents a huge step forward for the company. Alex Jarvis, research analyst with KBC Peel Hunt, the company’s broker, says the contract is a “superb first win” for ClearSpeed and vindication of its decision to stick with its business strategy during recent years when the semiconductor industry was going through its worst recession.The management bet the company, which listed on Aim, London’s junior market, in July 2004, on a belief that a market would emerge for its esoteric product.Tom Beese, chief executive, a very experienced former Hewlett-Packard executive, recalls he told the investors and the team: “Classically this will feel like the worst of times to do this, but if we are right in believing that this market will emerge – and if we are right in how to address the needs of that market – then this is potentially the best of times to do this. We might emerge with significant first-mover advantage.” He adds: “And that is how it has played out”.Brave words for the dark days of 2002, which is when the company was founded – although its roots go back to Inmos, the UK-based ­inventor of the transputer, through Division, the virtual reality group, and Pixel­fusion, a high-end graphics company. All were specialists in parallel processing – computer systems that can handle two or more streams of computation simul­taneously. This is inte-
gral to high-performance ­computing.ClearSpeed’s product family is described as “double-precision, floating-point accelerator boards”, jargon for printed circuit boards and chips that can manipulate very long numbers with very high accuracy.They are not the main micro­processors but co-
processors that relieve the central processing unit of the heaviest arithmetical load and permit computational speeds that have only ever been beaten by Blue Gene.John Fowler, chief software technology officer for Sun Microsystems, which is developing the Tokyo supercomputer, says: “The critical thing that ClearSpeed adds is the ability for Sun to
meet efficiently a customer’s most intense floating-point require­ments in a way that cannot be done economically with central processors alone.”ClearSpeed has no plans to move its headquarters from Bristol, three hours’ drive west of London, although its US operations in San Jose, California, are vital for staying in touch with the all- important US supercomputer industry. With revenues of only £146,000 ($256,000) at the half-year point last June, the $2m japanese deal represents a breakthrough.Mr Beese points out how quickly the kinds of projects that ClearSpeed wants to tackle can develop. At the start of August last year, he had no information about the Tokyo contract. Within two weeks, he was approached by possible bidders who realised conventional microprocessors would not meet the specification. “Sun engaged with us less than 10 days before the bids had to be in and the consortium was still able to win.”Supercomputing, however, will remain a small market. Mr Beese believes the future lies in linking off-the-shelf microprocessors to accelerator boards such as the ClearSpeed CSX 600 which will open high-powered, low-cost computing to a wide range of industries – aerospace, white goods, automotive, oil and gas.“We saw that was likely to happen. The collapsing of the cost of entry is producing a whole new wave of demand,” he says."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average however, fell 0.4 per cent to 11,021.59, while the S&P 500 stood at 1,287.23, a 0.2 per cent fall on the week.Semiconductor stocks led the gains on the Nasdaq, in spite of yesterday’s warning from sector leader Intel, that its first-quarter gross margins would be hit by lower-than-expected revenue. Intel’s shares, which fell by as much as 2.3 per cent yesterday, ended the week down 0.2 per cent at $20.32.National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices were lifted after Mark Edelstone from Morgan Stanley said he expected positive earnings surprises from both companies.National, he said, would benefit from strong seasonal demand for mobile phones, while AMD had increased its penetration into the server and PC markets. Shares in National gained 7.7 per cent over the week to $29.34, but AMD reversed early gains to finish 2.5 per cent lower at $39.51.Altera climbed 5.9 per cent to $20.89 after Bear Stearns raised its rating to “outperform” from “peer perform”, and Texas Instruments added 8.8 per cent to $32.29 after Goldman Sachs said it expected the company to raise its financial outlook at its update on Monday.Google’s fortunes this week hinged on the company’s prospects for growth, and confidence took an early knock when chief financial officer George Reyes said on Tuesday there were signs it was slowing.The shares fell more than 7 per cent on the day, but recovered steadily over
the week as the damage control statements rolled out. “We still see significant opportunities to improve monetisation,” the company said just hours after the CFO’s comments.At its second annual analyst day on Thursday, Google described a robust growth outlook, which convinced several brokers. Citigroup “came away incrementally more positive” and re-iterated its “buy” rating and price target of $490. Lehman maintained its “overweight” rating, saying it was positive on short- and long-term prospects.The shares ended the week 0.2 per cent higher at $378.18.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the market had held up well in light of the turmoil in the technology sector.“Despite the non-bullish news we saw this week, the market has not given up much ground from its highs last week,” he said. “I have not had much of an occasion to be short-term bullish over the last six months, but that is changing now. I believe we will see the market press on.”Higher crude prices, pushed up by lingering concerns about supply disruption in Iran and Nigeria, made energy stocks one of the best performing industry group on the S&P 500 this week. Oil-field service provider Schlumberger climbed 3.2 per cent to $122.22 while drilling rig operator Noble jumped 6.1 per cent to $78.6.Rising energy prices also helped propel natural gas producer Chesapeake Energyinto the S&P 500 index this week.Chesapeake, whose market value more than doubled last year on strong gas prices, replaced car parts maker Dana, which filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday after it failed to make a $21m bond payment.Shares in Chesapeake ended the week 5 per cent higher at $31.51 while Dana plunged more than 56 per cent to $0.66.Financial stocks were under pressure this week as investors took profit following renewed concern over the prospect of further interest rate rises.Companies with significant lending operations were hit. Wells Fargo fell 1.2 per cent to $63.82 and Citigroup lost 2 per cent to $45.92, while mortgage financier Fannie Mae dropped 2.8 per cent to $54.52. Wachovia, which was downgraded by Morgan Stanley on valuation concerns, fell 4.3 per cent to $55.16.AK Steel, which surged 23.4 per cent yesterday after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported the company was in talks to be acquired by US Steel. On the week, AK was 21 per cent higher at $13.99, while US Steel shares gained 0.4 per cent to $57.98.Networking software maker Novell fell 18.3 per cent to $7.90 after its profit guidance for the second quarter fell short of market estimates."
504;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-03-03T20:30:13Z;Intel loses market share to AMD;;Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, on Friday disappointed the market for the second time in six weeks with its sales figures, blaming weaker demand for its processors and market share loss to AMD, its biggest rival.Intel, which has abandoned its practice of mid-quarter updates, issued a revenue warning, predicting sales of $8.7bn-$9.1bn in the first quarter, down from the $9.1bn-$9.7bn it forecast in January.The group said then that the mid-point of $9.4bn represented a decline of 8 per cent over the fourth quarter – 3 percentage points more than was seasonally normal.Intel said the revised forecast was “primarily due to weaker than expected demand and a slight market segment share loss”.Its shares were down 1.8 per cent at $20.12 at noon in New York and have fallen about 20 per cent this year, after fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. Intel, which is seen as a bellwether stock, led the US market slightly lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 0.06 per cent.“It’s a surprise, they are obviously in trouble with [market] share and are seeing weakening PC demand, which is worrying for the rest of the market,” said Apjit Walia, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.However, Intel’s problems were not mirrored in the fourth-quarter results of other semiconductor companies. In particular, AMD reported a 35 per cent increase in sales over the previous quarter, with its share of the “x86” processor market rising from 11.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent. Intel has all but about 1 per cent of the rest of that market.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, had reported a tough December and this appears to have continued into January. Intel, whose customers have been suffering from a shortage of the chipsets that accompany its processors, has been forced to turn to third-party suppliers to meet demand.Mr Walia said he expected aggressive pricing from Intel in the next two quarters as it tried to reclaim market share from AMD.This would hit margins and Intel said on Friday that it expected first-quarter gross margin percentage to be “adversely impacted” by the change in revenues. It was already expected to fall 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter to 59 per cent.More clues to the health of the chip industry will be supplied in Texas Instruments’ mid-quarter update on Monday.

The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent to 2,314.64, while the S&P 500 gained 0.8 per cent to 1,291.24.Semiconductors put in the best sectoral performance after several upbeat offerings from brokers. National Semiconductor gained 5.1 per cent to $29.47 after Mark Edelstone, at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target, saying seasonally solid mobile phone demand and higher margins would drive a positive earnings surprise.The broker was also upbeat about Advanced Micro Devices, as the company “increased its penetration into the enterprise server and PC markets”. AMD climbed 3.6 per cent to $40.07.Bear Stearns upgraded Altera to “outperform” from “peer perform”, citing, among other factors, attractive valuation and healthy communications spending for 2006.

506;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-02-14T21:35:17Z;Dow leaps above 11,000 after strong retail sales;;Unexpectedly strong retail sales data, combined with gains for technology stocks, helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its best performance of the year and drove it back above the 11,000 level.The Department of Commerce said January retail sales rose 2.3 per cent, easily beating the 0.9 per cent forecast by analysts.The Dow closed 1.3 per cent higher to 11,028.39, the S&P 500 added 1 per cent to 1,275.53 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,262.17.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, was up 1.1 per cent to $21.37 after Apple Computer said it was to start rolling out its MacBook Pro laptop range Intel processors.Intel’s gains came in spite of a lowered price target from UBS. The broker said it believed competitive pressure from Advanced Micro Devices would cause erosion to margins as the company lowered prices to defend its 80 per cent market share. AMD shares climbed 3.2 per cent to $40.22.Apple benefited from news that Warner Music Group’s quarterly profit had more than doubled thanks to rising sales of digital music through outlets such as Apple’s iTunes online music store.Although Warner shares were down 1.8 per cent to $20.43 on falling revenues, shares in Apple gained 4.5 per cent to $67.65.Meanwhile, RealNetworks leapt 15.3 per cent to $8.53 after it was upgraded by Piper Jaffray from “market perform” to “outperform” ahead of its results due out after the Wall Street close. The broker cited strength in the company’s core digital music business.3M, the industrial group and maker of such products as Scotch tape, added 1.1 per cent to $73.70 after the Dow constituent raised its quarterly dividend and announced a share buyback.Among other strong performers on the Dow, aluminium producer Alcoa gained 3.7 per cent to $31.37, while Home Depot gained 3.6 per cent to $41.13, and Hewlett-Packard climbed 2.4 per cent to $32.50.Cendant, owner of the Avis car rental company, fell sharply after it announced that 2006 earnings would rise by “low single digits”, less than the 10-12 per cent guidance the company gave in December. The shares fell 6.7 per cent to $15.70.Marsh & McLennan, the world’s largest insurance broker, reported net income of $35m, beating its $680m loss in the previous year, but this fell short of expectations.The company said lower insurance premium rates, as well as currency effects and weaker equity investment sales, were responsible for the shortfall, and the shares fell 4.8 per cent to $29.09.Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, said it had revised its fourth-quarter results higher by more than a third following a lower than expected charge on an asset sale. The shares edged up 0.4 per cent to $60.07.
507;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-02-07T01:03:43Z;New IBM chip breaks barriers to double speed;;IBM will unveil a new processor on Tuesday that will be twice as fast as those of competitors such as Sun, Intel and AMD when it appears in 2007, according to the group.IBM’s Power6 chip is a radical departure from the trend among microprocessor makers to produce more energy-efficient chips after their race to increase speeds created overheating problems.IBM said it had broken through energy and heat barriers with the Power6 to achieve speeds of between 4 and 5 gigahertz – more than double the performance of the next generation of Intel’s Itanium chip, planned at less than 2GHz.The processor will give IBM an edge in the high-end server market, operating faster in the same “power envelope” as its rivals.Bernie Myerson, chief technology officer of IBM’s Systems and Technology group, said existing chip technology reached its physical limits four years ago in terms of doubling the number of transistors on a chip while reducing the amount of power needed to run them.But techniques such as stretching and squeezing the silicon used, improving synchronisation at high speeds and taking a holistic approach to improving the chip architecture had enabled a breakthrough.“There’s nobody looking at anything like this. We have a more highly integrated chip that is multi-core and we are increasing the frequency – we are turning up both knobs at once when the industry is going the other way and turning [the frequency] knob down,” Mr Myerson said.Richard Doherty, analyst with Envisioneering, a consultancy, said IBM achieved frequencies of 6GHz in their labs.“It’s our belief that this is going to be the fastest computing chip and family in the world for some time.“A lot of people will be surprised by this. It will cause a lot of companies to go back to the drawing board,” he said.IBM will make its disclosures about the Power6 at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.It unveiled its revolutionary Cell processor at the same conference a year ago, which will feature in Sony’s PlayStation3 games console.
508;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel heralds chip breakthrough;;Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, on Wednesday said it had become the first manufacturer to produce a working chip for the next generation of miniaturisation, where transistors are reduced to 45 billionths of a metre in size.The 45-nanometre breakthrough comes as Intel is ramping up production of the latest 65 nanometre chips, six to nine months ahead of its biggest rival in processors, Advanced Micro Devices.The lead in manufacturing technology suggests Intel could begin to recapture market share lost to AMD, whose processors have been offering better performance and energy efficiency.Figures just released from Mercury Research show AMD’s overall market share of the dominant “x86” processor market grew to 21.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from its 17.7 per cent share in the third quarter. Intel and AMD have more than 98 per cent of the x86 market.AMD advanced across all segments – its server market share grew from 12.7 per cent to 16.4 per cent, desktops increased from 20.4 per cent to 24.3 per cent and mobile processors grew from 12.2 per cent to 15.1 per cent, according to Mercury.Intel last week blamed a shortage of chipsets for loss of market share and fourth-quarter results that fell short of expectations.But the move to smaller-scale 65 and then 45 nanometre chips means Intel can cut costs and undercut its rival’s prices. The new scale allows more transistors on a chip, greater power efficiency and faster performance.Intel said it had crammed more than 1bn transistors on its 45nm test chip, which had been produced on time as it continued its chip evolution of a new generation every two years. Volume production is expected from the second half of 2007.
509;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-20T22:05:45Z;Dow tumbles 200 points on earnings gloom;;Wall Street endured its worst one-day session for almost three years on Friday as a sharp jump in the oil price and badly received figures from Citigroup, General Electric and Motorola robbed the market of what was left of its early-year gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points or 2 per cent to 10,666.99, its worst single-day performance since March 2003.The broader S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent to 1,261.43 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunged 2.4 per cent to 2,247.70.“It is a domino effect of negative news,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The chief reason was a further undermining of already-dented investor confidence in corporate earnings. The culprits were some of the country’s leading blue-chip companies, including financial services giant Citigroup, whose fourth-quarter earnings fell short of what the market had expected.Citigroup was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 4.7 per cent to $45.69, closely followed by conglomerate General Electric, off 3.8 per cent to $33.37. GE’s earnings came in largely as expected, but revenues were less than hoped.At the same time, Motorola, the telephone equipment maker, failed to raise guidance for the first quarter, and guidance from maker Xilinx also disappointed. Motorola and Xilinx lost 7.7 per cent to $22.48 and 8.1 per cent to $27.39 respectively.Google, the search engine, endured its worst day as a listed company, falling 8.5 per cent to $399.46 amid concerns over the possibility of a legal threat concerning how people use its search technology.The cocktail of bad news came at the end of an already difficult week during which JPMorgan Chase reported figures that even the bank’s chief executive admitted were disappointing and guidance from Apple Computer and Ebay left investors unsatisfied.“Companies tend to put their best feet forward in the fourth quarter, so coming up short is more meaningful than at other times,” said Mr Pado.He also noted that Friday saw the monthly expiry of stocks options, which added to volatility and uncertainty.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, agreed that cuts in earnings guidance were disappointing, but said the market’s main concerns were geopolitical.“The real problem here is the oil price,” he said, as uncertainty about the possibility of conflict with Iran pushed crude over 2 per cent higher to more than $68 a barrel, its highest level for four months.Friday’s slump took the fall in the Dow over the truncated four-day week to 2.7 per cent and took it below the level at which it began the year. Over the week, the S&P 500 lost 2 per cent while the Nasdaq slumped 3 per cent.Sentiment was not helped by Wednesday’s events in Japan, where a sharp rise in trading volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange overloaded the market’s computer systems and forced trading to halt early.The week’s other big story concerned contrasting fortunes of two leading chipmakers.Shares in Intel, the global leader, came under pressure as it admitted earnings in the first quarter would be less than expected. A day later, Advanced Micro Devices, its rival, reported record fourth-quarter sales.Joshua Osha, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said it was clear “how much competitive ground [Intel] has lost to AMD.” Over the week, Intel slumped 15.6 per cent to $21.76 while AMD rose 4.6 per cent to $35.70.In the market on Friday, McDonald’s, up 1.9 per cent at $35.86, was the only Dow stock to making gains. Shareholder activist Bill Ackman continues to push for corporate restructuring at the fast food group.Amid the gloom, it was a good day for Schlumberger, the oil services group. It jumped 6.4 per cent to $122.25, an all-time high, as its quarterly profit doubled and beat even the most optimistic of Wall Street estimates.Halliburton, its oil services peer, gained 5.3 per cent to $74.50.There was also some takeover talk, as a rumour circulated the market that Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was looking to buy a controlling stake in BlackRock.Shares in the money manager rose 6.4 per cent to $127 , while Morgan Stanley lost 2.5 per cent to $57.85.
510;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-19T21:44:25Z;Wall Street rally buoyed by AMD and Pfizer;;Technology stocks snapped out of their week-long slump yesterday as investors jumped back into the market looking for buying opportunities among freshly discounted stocks.Chipmakers led the rally on the Nasdaq Composite, with Advanced Micro Devices surging 11.3 per cent to $37.13 after it reported a 45 per cent increase in fourth-quarter sales.AMD said net profits rose to $96m, or 21 cents a share, compared with losses of 8 cents a year ago.Although the figure came in below market expectations of 25 cents, AMD’s strong result, which contrasted sharply with those released by Intel on Tuesday, was enough to lift other chipmakers. Overall, the Amex semiconductor index rose 3 per cent.This, along with a 5.3 per cent jump in Ebay shares, helped the Nasdaq Composite end the session 1 per cent higher at 2,301.81.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,285.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 per cent to 10,880.71.Fresh deal talk helped buoy the two indices. There was speculation that Walt Disney might be looking to acquire Pixar in a deal that would offer a small premium to the company’s current market value of $6.7bn. Pixar shares rose 2.8 per cent to $58.87 while Disney climbed 4 per cent to $26.24.News of lower jobless claims and weak housing-starts added extra steam to the rally.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said the data, which suggested the economy was continuing to grow with inflation in check, helped ease investors’ concerns about the prospect of further interest rate rises.Homebuilders suffered, however. Toll Brothers was off 2.4 per cent at $35.94 and Pulte Homes dropped 2.7 per cent to $40.78.Pfizer paced the gains on the Dow. Shares in the pharmaceutical group rose 3.6 per cent to $24.97 after its fourth-quarter earnings fell less than expected.Merrill Lynch, which reported a 25 per cent jump in quarterly profit, also helped ease concerns about a slowdown in earnings growth. Shares in the investment bank moved up 3.2 per cent to $72.85.Still in the financial services sector, JPMorgan Chase fell 0.7 per cent to $39.06 as investors mulled over news of a 38 per cent decline in profit from its investment banking unit.Wachovia, which reported an 18 per cent jump in profit, also fell. Its shares lost 1.5 per cent to $52.81.Other financial stocks that were pulled down included Bank of America, down 2.9 per cent at $31.73, and Citigroup, down 0.9 per cent at $47.94.Elsewhere, Apple Computer fell 4.2 per cent to $79.03 in spite of a sharp jump in quarterly profit, as it forecast for the second quarter failed to match Wall Street expectations.
511;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-19T18:50:52Z;AMD showing cast doubts on Intel;;Concerns this week about the PC industry turned in a day to perplexity over bellwether stock Intel. On Tuesday, the longtime leader in the microprocessor market missed its numbers, blaming in part falling demand for desktop computers. But on Wednesday, results from smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices beat analysts’ wildest expectations.“We have been surprised – blown away is more like it – by the extent of the company’s gains,” said Merrill Lynch, as AMD reported that fourth-quarter sales of its microprocessors grew 35 per cent over the previous quarter and earnings per share reached 45 cents – well ahead of consensus estimates of 25 cents.Intel reported just 2 per cent sales growth and predicted an 8 per cent fall in revenues in the current quarter – three points more than would be seasonally normal.“The weakest Q4 revenue result and Q1 outlook since the bursting of the bubble,” wrote the analysts.Intel had blamed a shortage of chipsets – such as video and sound chips – that accompany its processors for losing perhaps a point of market share to AMD, and it spoke of a drop in demand for desktop PCs in a “difficult December”.But Intel’s problems seem to be more than one bad month. Persistent inventory issues have forced it to rely on third-party suppliers for chipsets. Its processors remain hotter and more expensive to run than those of AMD.While Intel still has more than 80 per cent of the market for the dominant “x86” processors, AMD reported its share grew to 15.3 per cent in the fourth quarter from 11.9 per cent in the third and 9.6 per cent a year ago.“We’ve been following the microprocessor companies for eight years and haven’t seen this rapid a shift in competitive momentum before,” said Joe Osha of Merrill Lynch.Banc of America’s Sumit Dhanda questioned Intel’s bellwether status: “We think the unprecedented competitive pressure Intel is facing from AMD suggests that Intel may no longer be the proxy it once was for the overall semiconductor group.”Intel does appear to be undergoing a painful mid-life transition. It is seeking out new markets, with its Digital Health and Digital Home divisions set up last year, and new partners – with Apple starting to use its processors and a joint venture established with Micron to produce flash memory. In mid-year, it will launch its next-generation processor architecture in a bid to take back the technology lead conceded to AMD.Charlie Glavin, analyst at Needham & Co and a former Intel employee, says it is hard to identify enough high-margin, high-volume markets to replace the lucrative PC and server ones that have fuelled Intel’s success since the 1980s. “It’s 40-year-old man syndrome – its metabolism is slowing and it’s still remembering the glory years.”Many in the industry feel it is only a matter of time before Intel’s favourite squeeze, Dell, puts aside its concerns about AMD’s ability to deliver in volume and has an affair. Kevin Krewell, editor-in-chief of the Microprocessor Report, says this will probably happen this year in the server market with AMD’s superior Opteron chip. “Opteron would seem to be a no-brainer, you don’t need as much volume in the server space compared to desktops so it would be fairly easy to supply enough chips.”What seems equally possible is Intel using its greater muscle in a price war. “That looks like it’s going to be here in 2006,” says Mr Glavin.
512;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-19T18:03:54Z;Oil and earnings play on investors minds;;A rebound for Japanese stocks on Thursday had only a limited impact on equity markets elsewhere as investors continued to worry about high oil prices and corporate earnings.The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo jumped 2.3 per cent, its biggest one-day rise for three months. The gain followed a near-6 per cent slide over the previous two sessions, which was sparked by news of an investigation into Livedoor, the internet services group.Analysts remained broadly optimistic about the prospects for Tokyo stocks despite their rollercoaster ride this week.“The Japanese market has come a long way in recent months, so events like the recent sell-off are always bound to occur,” said Jeremy Podger, manager of Threadneedle Investments’ Global Select Fund.“The important thing to remember, though, is that the economic and corporate recovery remains on track.”The Nikkei’s advance set a positive tone for European stocks, and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent. Mining stocks got a boost from rising metals prices.But an initial rally on Wall Street soon evaporated despite positive earnings reports from Pfizer, the drugs group, and Merrill Lynch, the investment bank.By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.1 per cent and the S&P 500 moved 0.2 per cent higher.But the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8 per cent, helped by a rally for Advanced Micro Devices after the chipmaker unveiled strong results.High oil prices continued to unsettle equity investors. The benchmark Nymex crude future was hovering around the $66 a barrel mark as lingering concerns about supply disruptions outweighed news of an unexpected rise in US crude inventories last week.“The worsening unrest in Nigeria, which has involved disruption to supply and more important still, the current crisis involving Iran, have the potential to propel the oil price back up to last August’s high and beyond,” said John Lewis at independent consultancy Sevendaysahead.com.“Now the US and its European allies have lost patience with Iran and are threatening to refer that country to the United Nations Security Council, Iran has threatened to retaliate using its status as the world’s fourth largest oil exporter as a weapon.“Since this crisis will not dissolve into the background we expect an increase of volatility to result, as the market eventually makes significant new highs. We advise traders to stay long and buy into any sell-off,” he added.Metals prices resumed their upward momentum amid continued fund buying.Copper and zinc both hit all-time highs, while aluminium touched a 17-year peak. Gold climbed above $554 an ounce in European trading but remained short of the 25-year high of $564 hit earlier in the week.The dollar held firm and Treasury bonds fell as a surprisingly large fall in new US jobless claims encouraged the view that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at least once more.“This is a big surprise,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.“Two big declines in three weeks does not mean for sure the trend in claims has fallen but it certainly means we’ll be watching the next few weeks’ numbers very closely. If claims remain anywhere near this week’s level, they will send a very strong signal that the labour market is tightening,” he said.
513;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD puts in stronger showing than Intel;;"Advanced Micro Devices, the second-largest PC microprocessor maker after Intel,
on Wednesday reported record fourth-quarter sales of $1.84bn, 45 per cent up on a year earlier and ahead of market expectations.A day after its much larger rival disappointed Wall Street as it failed to meet its own and analysts’ forecasts, AMD reported revenues ahead of the market consensus of $1.66bn recorded by Thomson First Call.But its net profits of $96m or 21 cents a share – compared with losses of 8 cents a year ago – were below market expectations of 25 cents. Net income would have been $205m or 45 cents a share but for a non-cash charge of $110m or 24 cents associated with the spin-off of its Spansion memory-chip joint-venture in December.“AMD’s growth rate increased in the fourth quarter resulting in continued market share gains across server, desktop and mobile product lines,” said Bob Rivet, chief financial officer.Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, conceded in a conference call on Tuesday that Intel had lost about one point in market share for low-end PCs to AMD because of a shortage of chipsets in its fourth quarter.AMD said it expected first-quarter sales to be flat to slightly down seasonally from the fourth quarter – a slightly better forecast than Intel, which predicted an
8 per cent sequential decline caused in part by a customer inventory build-up.AMD shares traded 5 cents higher at $34.20 in after-hours trading.Intel shares had closed more than 11 per cent lower at $22.59.Analysts were still taking stock on Wednesday of Intel’s disappointing fourth quarter with several reasoning it was more because of a loss of market share to AMD than to a weakness in demand for PCs – Intel had blamed both circumstances.Joseph Osha of Merrill Lynch said in a report: “In posting the weakest fourth-quarter revenue result and first-quarter outlook since the bursting of the bubble, Intel has made it clear how much competitive ground the company has lost to AMD.”Charlie Glavin of Needham & Co downgraded Intel from “buy” to “hold” and said it faced a wider problem.“We find it hard to identify enough high-volume, high-margin markets for Intel to replace its traditional lucrative PC/server markets that fuelled its success since the 1980s. In many ways, Intel is beginning a multi-year process to re-invent itself,” he wrote."
514;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-18T21:08:21Z;US earnings season brings more disappointment;;Leading US technology stocks suffered a sell-off on Wednesday as the market’s reaction to earnings from Intel and Yahoo demonstrated how much optimism is embedded in current share prices.Yahoo, the internet portal, and Intel, the largest chip manufacturer, ended down 12.3 per cent and 11.4 per cent respectively, while negative sentiment surrounding these two dragged down other current stars of the sector, such as Google (down 4.8 per cent) and Apple Computer (off 2.6 per cent).Further unwelcome news came after the market closed as news of strong earnings from Apple was balanced by an outlook that the market found disappointing. Apple shares fell almost 7 per cent in after-hours trading.EBay’s outlook was similarly greeted, triggering a 6 per cent fall in shares in the internet auction site in the after-market.The dramatic reaction appeared to confirm warnings from several equity strategists that optimism about earnings was already embedded in share prices, and that the market was exposed to surprises on the down-side.Intel’s failure to meet analysts’ expectations, and its warning that the outlook for revenue in the current quarter was worse than it had previously predicted, prompted a number of banks to cut their recommendations, including Citigroup and UBS.But this had more to do with its competitive position than with worries about the sector as a whole. UBS highlighted the threat to Intel from rival Advanced Micro Devices. “AMD is likely to remain a serious competitor to Intel and Intel’s longer-term risk profile is now higher than we previously believed,” analyst Thomas Thornhill said, lowering his rating on Intel to “neutral”.In the case of Yahoo!, the reaction occurred despite the company meeting its own guidance figures. At 16 cents per share, its earnings fell only marginally short of Wall Street’s official consensus of 17 cents, as compiled by First Call. Both Citigroup and Morgan Stanley described its revenue as “in line”.Justin Post, tech sector analyst at Merrill Lynch, suggested that valuations had grown so high that companies needed to deliver a positive surprise in order to avoid damage to their share prices. He said: “Beat and raise quarters are probably necessary to support near-term valuations.” He added: “While we expect strong results from eBay, given lofty expectations exiting the fourth quarter, we continue to prefer more conservatively valued InterActive in e-commerce and Expedia in online travel.”Mark Mahaney of Citigroup described the sell-off as an “over-reaction”. He said: “We attribute this to a ‘miss and lower’ quarter, and the 12 per cent intra-quarter rally in the shares. But we believe that the market over-reacted.”Mary Meeker, technology analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that she continued to rate Yahoo! an “overweight,” but said that “it may be up to (an) especially strong financial performance - that exceeds the Street’s expectations - to drive the shares higher”. She said this was more likely in the second quarter than the first.
515;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-18T00:02:49Z;Intel shares drop on fears of PC downturn;;Intel shares dropped 9 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday as the market took fright at fourth-quarter numbers that fell short of expectations and suggested a dip in demand for desktop computers.The biggest semiconductor maker also forecast slower growth in 2006 than the past three years, saying this was in line with industry forecasts and the overall economy.Paul Otellini, chief executive, announced Intel was abandoning mid-quarter updates because they were “increasingly irrelevant” to the company’s long-term growth.He reported fourth-quarter sales of $10.2bn and profits of 40 cents a share. Analysts’ expectations were for $10.56bn in revenues and earnings per share of 43 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.The company said revenues were below expectations stated in its mid-quarter update of $10.4bn-$10.6bn. This was primarily because of lower than expected desktop processor unit shipments and prices.“2005 was a good year punctuated by a difficult December,” Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, said.Intel shares fell $2.30 to $23.22 on the news.“I don’t think this is market share [loss] but some inflection in demand for PCs,” said Apjit Walia, semiconductor analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “This will worry people, Intel is the canary in the coalmine, when it sees weakness it’s a warning for the rest of the sector.”Intel could have fallen short by losing market share in desktop processors to its rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.Mr Otellini said Intel gained market share in the first half and lost some in the second half. He predicted Intel would take back share in 2006.For 2005, Intel said it achieved record revenues of $38.8bn, up 13.5 per cent on 2004’s $34.2bn. Net profits grew 19 per cent to $8.7bn.“2005 was our third consecutive year of double-digit revenue and earnings growth, leading to the best operating results in the company’s history,” Mr Otellini said.Intel said it expected revenue to be 6-9 per cent higher in 2006 and that capital spending would be about $6.9bn as it began building new factories in Arizona and Israel.It expected revenues to fall 8 per cent sequentially in the first quarter to $9.1bn-$9.7bn. This is more than is seasonally normal and Intel blamed a build-up of inventory at its customers in the fourth quarter.
516;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-17T21:42:18Z;Wall Street spooked by oil price concerns;;Wall Street stocks were pulled lower on Tuesday as the oil price jumped to its highest level since early October.Concerns about earnings quality were magnified as unrest in Nigeria and continued tension with Iran sent crude oil to more than $66 a barrel in New York.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.6 per cent to 10,896.4 while the S&P 500 was off 0.4 per cent to 1,282.93 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 2,302.69.Energy stocks were among the few to make any headway. ExxonMobil rose 1 per cent to $61.55.Other sectors went into retreat. Financial stocks came off the boil as Wells Fargo‘s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations. Well Fargo fell 1 per cent to $62.60.Speculation it may have to pay more than $1bn to settle an accounting probe sent American International Group 1.4 per cent lower to $69.04. Merrill Lynch, which reports fourth-quarter earnings this week, lost 0.4 per cent to $70.14 amid talk it could be in the market to buy a US regional bank.Dana was the biggest faller on the S&P 500 after the auto parts maker reported a third-quarter loss of $1.27bn after it wrote off tax benefits. Dana slumped 20.6 per cent to $5.40. Continental Airlines fell 11.4 per cent at $17.24 in spite of reporting of a narrower fourth-quarter loss. As well as the oil price concerns, the shares were hit by the airline’s cautious statement on its outlook.A downgrade to “sell” from Merrill Lynch pulled Advanced Micro Devices, the circuit maker, 3.7 per cent lower to $32.86. SanDisk fell 1.8 per cent to $71.54 as Citigroup cut its rating on the maker of flash memory chips for mobile phones and digital cameras to “hold”. There was also a downgrade for Toll Brothers, the homebuilder. It lost 1.9 per cent to $37.03 as Banc of America Securities cut its rating on the stock to “sell”.However, shares in medical devices maker Guidant surged 7.6 per cent to $76.22 as Boston Scientific raised its offer for the company to $80 a share. Boston’s fresh offer, worth $27bn, is a 12.7 per cent premium over the Johnson & Johnson bid that Guidant’s board had accepted late last week. Boston fell 5.2 per cent to $23.90.St Jude Medical rose 0.6 per cent to $53.83 on speculation that J&J would switch its attention to St Jude should it lose out on Guidant.US Steel jumped 5.4 per cent to $52.80 on hopes it could be bought as part of consolidation in the industry. Arcelor of Luxembourg and ThyssenKrupp of Germany are involved in a $4.7bn battle for Canada’s Dofasco.Earnings are released after the close from Intel, the chipmaker, IBM, the computer company, and search engine Yahoo. Yahoo closed up 0.5 per cent at $40.11, Intel was off 1 per cent at $25.52 and IBM was down 0.2 per cent at $83.00.
517;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-12T19:57:09Z;Toshiba, IBM and Sony extend partnership;;IBM, Sony and Toshiba, whose revolutionary “Cell” processor will feature in the next version of the Sony PlayStation, have extended their partnership to develop semiconductors.In a joint announcement on Thursday, the three companies said they had begun a new five-year phase of their technology alliance.Over the past five years, the three developed the Cell microprocessor, with its nine cores or brains, compared with the two just being introduced by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.Cell is designed for a range of appliances from high-end workstations to consumer electronics products. The PlayStation 3 is due to appear this year.Underlying the development of Cell were advances made in process technologies known as Silicon on Insulator (SOI), where the silicon used sits on an insulator, needs 50 per cent less power and provides 25 per cent greater performance.The companies said the next step would be to work together on fundamental research on advanced process technologies, as transistor widths fell from 90 and 65 nanometres to 32 nanometres and beyond.“This is a winning combination,” said Masashi Muromachi, chief executive of Toshiba’s semiconductor company.“With Toshiba’s cutting-edge process technology and manufacturing capabilities, Sony’s various semiconductor technologies and deep knowledge of consumer markets, and IBM’s state-of-the-art material technology, we can anticipate breakthrough process technologies for the 32-nanometre generation and beyond.”Industry observers pointed out that the alliance did not mention joint development at the 45-nanometre level – considered the next step after 65 nanometres. The partnership is seen as making financial sense because of the high cost of researching, developing and manufacturing processors.
518;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2006-01-05T05:41:00Z;Gates unveils new range of media players;;Video, whether in high definition or transferred to a hand-held device, took centre stage on Wednesday night as Bill Gates delivered the opening address at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.The Microsoft chairman announced a DVD player, based on the new HD-DVD standard, for the Xbox 360 games console, as well as new portable media players that will be able to display a widening range of movies and TV shows.Mr Gates’s opening remarks traditionally mark the opening of the annual event where the world’s biggest consumer electronics and computer companies scramble to attract attention for their latest digital entertainment products – though this year, rivals Apple and Google are set to steal much of his thunder.While Google earlier this week denied reports that it was to launch its own low-priced PC, a scheduled appearance by co-founder Larry Page on Thursday has already attracted much of the attention in Las Vegas.Meanwhile, speculation has been rife that next week Apple will reveal its first machines based on Intel chips, challenging the long-standing alliance between Intel and Microsoft. Last year Apple switched its chip supplier from IBM to Intel.On Wednesday night, Mr Gates declared that widespread adoption of high-definition TV was close, with video games stimulating much of the demand. Independent research had shown that nine out of 10 buyers of Xbox 360, launched on November 22, either already own a high-definition TV or plan to buy one in the next six months.A supporter of the HD-DVD standard, a rival to Sony’s Blu-ray, Microsoft is to sell an HD-DVD player, based on the technology, as a peripheral for the Xbox, though it will not announce a built-in player.Mr Gates also unveiled a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices, which will make a version of the Media Center PC for use as an entertainment device.Microsoft also announced partnerships, including one with Philips, to sell cordless telephones that will carry internet voice calls for users of its MSN instant messenger service, as well as regular telephone calls, a new departure in the competition between so-called VoIP services.
519;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Chipmakers lead way in new digital revolution;;Intel, the biggest maker of semiconductors, has given many of its processors names that recall base metals – such as Itanium and Pentium – as the slivers of silicon have become the hot inner core of millions of computers.But with the promotion of its new Viiv (which rhymes with “five”) brand at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, as well as the retirement of its “Intel Inside” logo, the company is leading a charge by chipmakers out of the confines of the PC and into the digital home.Chipmakers are set to benefit as high-definition televisions and entertainment centres become dependent on computer chips tuned to multimedia uses.While Intel has Viiv, its biggest processor rival AMD is on Wednesday chiming in with similar-sounding AMD Live!, while Texas Instruments will be pushing its DLP television technology and Da Vinci multimedia chips.Effective branding strategies will be key to their success in a world where Sony or Samsung is synonymous with stylish devices for the home.“Viiv is a departure for Intel,” says David Placek, whose company Lexicon Branding came up with the new name.“It still has a feeling of something elemental, but it reflects a leader moving to a different level that is now more human – there is a vitality and a vibrance in Viiv.“With the digital world becoming completely integrated with our lives, we believe Viiv, with its simplicity and aliveness, will be quite easy for consumers to embrace as part of their digital life.”But Intel may find the established players in consumer electronics less welcoming and even unwilling to have the Viiv badge displayed alongside their own brand.The chipmaker has adopted a separate strategy to win over the industry, based on its standards-setting work in the PC world, where it has championed innovations such as USB (Universal Serial Bus) connectivity.“In the living room, there’s a real problem of a proliferation of devices that do not interface with one another – how do you hook them up and share content?” asks Eric Kim, Intel’s chief marketing officer and former head of marketing for Samsung.The Viiv brand, he argues, will assure users of interoperability as content is exchanged between devices made by different manufacturers and Intel is in a unique position to help the consumer electronics industry achieve this.“I come from Samsung and it could clearly not do this for Sony or Philips or Panasonic, so there’s a real need for an industry third-party player that can provide leadership on interoperability,” Mr Kim says.Viiv will provide a platform of dual-core processors and chipsets designed to speed the handling of multimedia files in different formats and reproduce them in high-definition video and surround sound. It is appearing first in PC-like devices running Microsoft’s Windows Media Center software and AMD is developing its new Live! platform as an alternative for buyers of Media Center devices.Lacking the resources of its much larger rival, it will not launch a marketing blitz and will seek partnerships.“We are not trying to displace the devices that are already in the living room, we have a more collaborative approach,” says Hal Speed, marketing architect at AMD.“We are trying to bring together the best of both worlds, with partners such as set-top box makers where we can help combine the broadcast world with what comes over the broadband network.”TI made earlier inroads into consumer electronics with the DSP (digital signal processor) chips that it specialises in proving to be an ideal solution for many manufacturers wanting fast processing of multimedia content. It has innovated with its DLP (Digital Light Processing) technology offering an alternative to LCD and Plasma televisions.At CES, TI is likely to be pushing its Da Vinci multimedia chips, although the brand is more likely to be seen on an inner circuit board than on the outside of a product.“Our aim is to work with our customers and we don’t see any advantage to the customer in putting the TI name on the outside,” says Doug Rasor, head of TI’s worldwide strategic marketing.He warns: “I think Intel is going to have a hard time getting much traction with that strategy in the consumer space. It’s different from the PC world – in consumer electronics, you have to earn your business one customer relationship at a time.”
520;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-12-15T18:56:51Z;Spansion cuts price range of its IPO;;Spansion, the memory chip maker being spun-off by Advanced Micro Devices, has been forced to cut the price range of its initial public offering, expected to take place on Friday.Spansion said on Thursday the offer price would be between $13 and $14, down from $16 to $18. It still plans to sell 39.2m shares.The move illustrates the lack of appetite among investors for memory chip stocks. AMD itself is spinning off the unit after seeing it drag down its results.AMD’s processor business has been showing impressive growth but the NOR flash memory market that Spansion specialises in has suffered from volatility, over-supply and falling prices.In the second quarter it reported an operating loss of $90m followed by $50m in the third quarter. Last month, it warned of another loss in the fourth quarter caused by under-utilisation of its factories.Analysts at Moors & Cabot said in a note that the forecast was disconcerting and it put the credibility of the IPO in question.Spansion was expected to be the biggest technology IPO of the year. But in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission it said it would now raise $493m rather than $622m, putting it behind database provider Neustar and Dolby Labs.Spansion is a joint venture with Fujitsu, 60 per cent owned by AMD. After the IPO, AMD will retain a 40 per cent stake, with 27 per cent for Fujitsu.Intel, AMD’s main rival in Nor flash, this week won Federal Trade Commission approval for a joint venture with Micron to develop Nand flash, which is proving more popular in devices such as mobile phones.Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein are underwriting the offering.Spansion will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol SPSN.
521;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-12-15T05:26:57Z;Intel to announce venture with BMW;;Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will on Thursday announce a wide- ranging partnership with the carmaker BMW, ranging from support for its Formula One racing team to co-operation on standards for in-car equipment.The deal represents the biggest example so far of chipmakers’ identification with fast cars and shows how they are competing to provide more sophisticated components for the automotive industry.Since 2002, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s biggest processor rival, has been a technology partner of Ferrari, a team that has since won three championships and 38 grand prixs. It is also technology partner for world motorsport’s governing body, the FIA, and the US’s Nascar organisation.Infineon, the German chipmaker, has paid to have a Nascar racetrack named after it in California and Texas Instruments sponsors a leading Nascar racing team.Intel said its technology would be deployed throughout the BMW Group and its worldwide dealer network. BMW would convert its corporate notebooks to those based on Intel’s Centrino processor and would work with Intel on an industry specification that would allow devices such as phones and portable media players to work with BMW vehicles.“Intel has a proven track record for establishing standards for markets and car infotainment is another major opportunity,” Eric Kim, Intel chief marketing officer, told the FT.“Larger enterprises are coming to the conclusion now that it is better to standardise on a common technology foundation. We think more and more companies will be taking BMW’s path.”Intel’s sponsorship of the Toyota Formula 1 team expires at the end of the month and there had been rumours for months that it would partner with the more successful McLaren team.But it will instead be the partner for BMW’s newly acquired Sauber team, replacing AMD, which is providing more than 500 of its Opteron processors for a supercomputer that analyses wind-tunnel results for streamlining the design of cars.“It will be interesting to see how they move forward with that,” said Morris Denton, AMD corporate marketing vice-president. “It’s not that simple to replace a supercomputer or the processors in it.”“We have existing relationships with a variety of the teams, so there are opportunities for our competitor to come in and do some [technology partnerships], we look forward to the competition.”
522;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-12-06T08:18:47Z;Sun Micro looks to new servers to pep up sales;;Sun Microsystems will on Tuesday take one of the most important steps in its bid to reverse its sliding market share with the announcement of a new line of servers based on an innovative processor that has up to eight “cores”, or brains.By making it possible to handle more computing tasks on a single chip, while also reducing the electrical power needed to run the machines, the new servers represent a crucial part of Sun’s attempt to stem the loss of customers to the low-cost, standardised servers based on processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.Codenamed “Niagara”, the processors used in the new machines are the first in a series of ambitious bets on new silicon technology that Sun hopes will revive its flagging fortunes.While most of the industry has turned towards standardised chip architectures, Sun has continued to invest heavily in its own Sparc line of processors, betting that it can sustain its comparatively high profit margins with superior performance.The new machines are priced to undercut existing hardware from rivals IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard and represent an attempt by Sun to recover ground lost since its fortunes peaked at the end of the 1990s.“We’re going after market share,” said Jonathan Schwartz, Sun’s president. “The problem for Sun hasn’t been [profit margins on] the parts we sell – it is to drive revenue.”Every percentage point of market share Sun manages to recover will add $160m to its revenues and 1 cent to its earnings per share, calculated Richard Farmer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.However, in a note to investors, he added that the servers might eat into sales of other Sun products.
523;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel plans to invest $1bn in India;;Intel, the world’s largest maker of semiconductors, said it would invest more than $1bn in India during the next five years in areas such as venture capital, though it stopped short of announcing firm plans to set up a manufacturing plant.Craig Barrett, chairman, on Monday said the US chip-maker would set up the $250m Intel Capital India Technology Fund – the country’s largest venture capital fund – to invest in software and hardware start-ups.Another $800m would be used to expand Intel’s existing research and development centre in Bangalore, which employs some 2,800, as well as to support some of the company’s education and community programmes in India. The planned investment more than doubles the $700m Intel has put into the country during the past 10 years.Intel, however, disappointed industry watchers who had anticipated it would announce plans for a manufacturing facility, particularly since its rival Advanced Micro Devices last week said it would license its technology to a group setting up India’s first fabrication plant.Mr Barrett said Intel was discussing with the Indian government the sites of manufacturing operations in the country but added: “We’re not ready to announce anything at this time.”However, he said Intel would not follow the strategy adopted by AMD, which will outsource its microprocessing and logic manufacturing technology to SemIndia, a consortium of non-resident Indians that plans to begin construction on the $3bn fab next year.“The technology we use is not available to third-party establishments and we do not make it available,” Mr Barrett said.Intel commands more than 80 per cent of the global chip-making industry, while AMD has about 13 per cent.Domestic demand in India is growing rapidly and is estimated at an annual $160bn by 2016, according to SemIndia.The chipmaker, which has already put $100m into some 40 start-ups since 1998, said it would invest $2m-$5m in new Indian companies involved in areas such as cellular and wireless technology and broadband applications.Intel is focusing more on emerging markets to maintain its double-digit annual growth in percentage terms. In January, it reorganised the company and created a Channel Products division to meet the needs of local markets worldwide.P Chidambaram, India’s finance minister, said of the planned fund: “This new capital will give a head-start to the many new enterprises engaged in the frontline of research. With Intel’s backing, no doubt many of these companies will turn out to be huge successes.”
524;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-11-30T16:59:41Z;SemIndia plans $3bn chip plant;;SemIndia, an Indian company run by non-resident Indians, will use technology from US-based Advanced Micro Devices to build what is poised to become India’s first semiconductor manufacturing plant.SemIndia would spend $3bn on the fabrication plant, which would use microprocessor and logic manufacturing technology, said Vinod Agarwal, chief executive.Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, said his company would monitor the progress of the plant, leaving its options open to invest in the fab at a later date.SemIndia has yet to decide where to locate the fab and is in discussions with various state governments. But it hopes to begin construction next year and chip manufacturing in two to three years.Mr Agarwal said Indian demand for chips would grow to $160bn a year by 2016.While India has succeeded in establishing itself as a hub for software services, poor infrastructure has hampered its attempts to become a force in the manufacture of hardware.At $4.8bn in fiscal 2004, hardware manufacturing pales in comparison with the country’s software industry output of $12.8bn, according to figures from the National Association of Software and Services Companies. The gap is widening, too, with hardware revenues growing at 25 per cent this year, and software at 29 per cent.The manufacturing picture, however, is starting to change as global companies such as LG Electronics, Motorola and Nokia set up mobile handset factories in the country. Figures released on Wednesday showed manufacturing growing at 9.2 per cent in the second quarter.“Only work on the design side of semiconductors is happening here,” said Sudhir Swamy, associate vice-president of the technology practice at Ernst & Young. “Manufacturing will help complete the entire chain.”China and Taiwan account for the bulk of chip manufacturing. The global semiconductor industry, including design and software application development, is valued at $230bn, of which India has a $100m morsel.Other local and global chip makers such as Intel have made noises about setting up plants in India, but Sem-India’s plan is by far the most concrete.“Somebody has to make the first move and a lot more things will fall into place,” Mr Swamy said.
525;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-11-16T20:06:18Z;Low-cost laptop aims to bridge world’s digital divide;;Apart from the hand crank on the side it looks and behaves much like any other laptop on the market. The big difference is the price.At $100 (€85, £58), this notebook computer, the prototype of which was unveiled on Wednesday in Tunis, costs about a 10th of the price of the average open-market model.The brain-child of Nicholas Negroponte, founder and chairman of the legendary Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, the laptop was conceived as a way of improving access to technology for students in developing countries.The machine, part of Mr Negroponte’s non-profit One Laptop Per Child initiative whose sponsors include Google, AMD and Rupert Murdoch, will be sold only to ministries of education.No firm orders for the computer have yet been signed but the group is in talks with several countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Egypt, China, Nigeria and South Africa. Brazil and Thai­land had ex­pressed the most sustained commitments to date, Mr Negroponte said.Mr Negroponte was inspired to begin the project after seeing Cambodian children benefiting from dona-ted computers. He said production would begin at the end of next year, with up to 10m units shipping in 2007.The laptops are designed for tough, developing country conditions, with a dual-mode display that can switch from colour to black and white, to make it easier to view in bright sunlight. The screen can be built for $35 or less, compared with the usual $100.The laptops are encased in rubber to make them more durable, and a hand crank provides power when there is no electricity.Software has been stripped down to the basics. The computer has a 500 MHz AMD microprocessor and runs on free Linux software. It can connect to the internet through wi-fi.The one thing the laptops cannot do is save large amounts of data, because they have no hard drive. Instead, they use flash memory like that in a digital camera.Mr Negroponte said the $100 price was still too steep for many countries and promised to bring this down further over time as technology advanced. However, it was likely to remain at the $90-$100 mark for the next few years.The laptop is the latest in a series of low-cost devices that have been developed to try to bridge the digital divide. Ndiyo, a UK non-profit group, has developed a computer called Nivo that costs less than $100. And Indian scientists have designed a low-cost hand-held device known as the Simputer.
526;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-11-15T23:49:46Z;AMD to launch new chip brand;;Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday signalled it would step up its battle with Intel to penetrate the digital home with the launch of a new brand for its processors.Intel announced in August it would launch a platform branded as Viiv to promote digital entertainment devices to consumers in early 2006.Henri Richard, head of sales and marketing, told the annual analysts’ day at AMD’s Silicon Valley headquarters that it would also come up with a new brand for its digital media platforms in 2006, but did not reveal the name.In addition, Intel has announced it will introduce a new processor design next year and Phil Hester, AMD chief technology officer, said the company would also launch a new design for its mobile, desktop and server processors in 2006. It would address 64-bit memory and have two cores working on the processor, with the capability of being upgraded to four cores, he said.Bob Rivet, chief financial officer, said he expected AMD’s operating profit and earnings per share to increase significantly in 2006. He excluded Spansion, the memory-chip subsidiary that is in the process of being spun off, from his figures.Mr Rivet said production would begin in the next two weeks at AMD’s new chip plant, Fab 36 in Dresden, Germany, which was officially opened last month. It would move to volume production of the latest 65-nanometre circuit-width chips in the second half of 2006. Intel leads in this area – it opened its second fab for producing 65nm chips two weeks ago.AMD has been making market share gains on Intel. It overtook its rival in sales of consumer PCs and laptops in retail stores in October, with 49.8 per cent of the market to 48.5 for Intel, according to the Current Analysis research firm.
527;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-10-24T15:33:08Z;Chip to rival Intel comes out of the shadows;;A team of veteran chip designers will break cover on Monday with a computer processor they claim has as much as a tenfold advantage over rivals’ models in providing high performance with low power requirements.PA Semi, founded in Silicon Valley two years ago, has been in stealth mode until now, devising from scratch a processor focused on the performance-per-watt criteria that leader Intel declared this year as its new benchmark.Dan Dobberpuhl, PA Semi chief executive and co-founder, will unveil a processor family at the Fall Processor Forum in San Jose with the same 64-bit, multi-core features that Intel and AMD introduced this year. Mr Dobberpuhl was the lead designer of the built-for-speed DEC Alpha series of processors and of the power-efficient StrongARM processors.The new processor has licensed IBM’s Power software instruction set to run on its own original core and system platform. Initially, it will find its way into networking, storage and data centre equipment and will only be in serious competition with Intel’s x86 architecture in the server market when it is launched in 2006.The chipmaker has already hired 150 people, who have an average of 10 years’ experience in the industry. Financing has come from Bessemer Venture Partners and Venrock Associates, while PA Semi has partnered with a US-based foundry able to produce chips at the latest 65-nanometre circuit sizes.The chip launch echoes that of another Silicon Valley fabless chipmaker five years ago. Transmeta also said its Crusoe chip would use as little as a tenth of the power of traditional processors and analysts predicted it would be a threat to Intel. But it has struggled to make any impression and switched to a business model of licensing its intellectual property earlier this year.“There are two important differences between PA Semi and Transmeta,” says Nathan Brookwood of the Insight 64 chip consultancy. “PA Semi is really looking more towards the embedded [chip] market than the consumer one and that’s one area where Intel does not have a strong presence.“The other thing is Transmeta always over-promised in my book on what they could do, and, in the case of PA Semi, both because of the pedigree and the approach they are taking, I give them a higher chance of succeeding.”
528;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Intel revenues reach record $10bn;;Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, said on Tuesday that third-quarter revenues were a record $9.96bn, 18 per cent higher than a year earlier.However, it said an inventory build-up by its customers would hit fourth-quarter sales, causing a 3.5 per cent dip in its share price in after-hours trading in New York.The third-quarter revenue figure was 8 per cent up on the second quarter and beat the analyst consensus of $9.92bn gathered by Thomson First Call.However, Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, said the numbers benefited from an inventory build-up that saw about $100m in sales recorded in the third quarter rather than the fourth quarter.After a period of tightness in supply, he said it was only natural that Intel’s customers would want to be able to respond to any upside in the fourth quarter by expanding their inventories. He said fourth-quarter revenues were expected to be between $10.2bn and $10.8bn, below analysts’ expectations that were at the top end of that range. Intel shares were down 3.5 per cent on the news at $22.89.Third-quarter earnings per share rose from 30 cents a year ago to 32 cents, below analysts’ forecasts of 33 cents. Intel said a $140m charge to third-quarter cost of sales had reduced earnings per share by around 2 cents. This was part of a $300m settlement with MicroUnity to resolve a patent infringement case.“In the third quarter, we achieved all-time records in company revenue and unit shipments across all of our major product lines,” said Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive.Last week, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival, also reported growth in processor and flash memory sales, with total sales rising 23 per cent on a year earlier.Mr Bryant said gross margins should rise from 59.7 per cent in the third quarter to 63 per cent in the fourth quarter as the company benefited from the efficiencies of moving from 90 nanometre to 65 nanometre circuit widths.For the full year, he anticipated revenues of $39bn, up 14-15 per cent on 2004 and gross margins of 60 per cent, up two percentage points.“The combination of our 65m manufacturing network, broad range of new dual-core processors and unique ability to provide platform solutions positions us well for continued growth,” added Mr Otellini.The company has suffered from capacity constraints in not being able to produce enough chipsets to accompany its processors. Mr Bryant said third-party suppliers were helping out with low-end desktop PCs.“The numbers all seem fairly good, with the margins for the fourth quarter trending up,” said Apjil Walia, semiconductor analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“The stock has underperformed significantly in the past few months and I think it looks more attractive at these levels.”
529;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Technology leads broad stock decline over week;;Wall Street finished the week lower with technology stocks spearheading a broad decline across the market.There was modest recovery on Friday on news that US core inflation appeared to be less than feared.This saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.7 per cent, or 70.75 points, to 10,287.34 by the close on Friday and the S&P 500 gain 0.8 per cent, or 9.73 points, to 1,186.57. The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.9 per cent higher, or 17.61, at 2,064.83.However, over the week the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent lower and the S&P 500 index 1.1 per cent down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average appeared less bruised, off only 0.4 per cent since last Friday.Among the 10 industry groups of the S&P 500, utilities were the worst performers, falling 5.5 per cent, followed by energy with a 4.7 per cent retreat. Healthcare, financials and consumer staples performed best in that their losses were less than 1 per cent for the week.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach and Co, saw Friday’s market resilience as a sign of better things to come, even though headline inflation was sharply higher last month.“We are seeing a bottoming-out process. The market has already discounted factors such as . . . interest rates and weaker earnings guidance, and is trying to stabilise,” he said. “The market can do one thing only now: focus on the economic rebound that should take place in the first and second quarters.”However, Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, saw further falls on Wall Street. He pointed to the fact that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are now close to falling below their 20-month moving average, something the Dow has already done.“That is the line of demarcation between a bull and a bear market. We could see all three major indices moving below their major support levels. The market is at a crossroads right now.”Mr Johnson further warned that investors who had been lured back into the market in the belief that October is normally a strong month could turn tail if things do not pick up quickly. “If the market does not find the strength to really start rallying next week there is very much a risk of an exaggerated sell-off,” he said.Semiconductor stocks, as reflected in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange chip index, finished the week 3.7 per cent lower.In the wake of Xilinx’s announcement of a quarterly revenue decline, which cost its stock a 16 per cent tumble to a 30-month low on Monday, the sector received a broad downgrade from analysts at Prudential on Wednesday. Xilinx’s shares lost 18.5 per cent on the week by midday yesterday.This saw Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lose 0.8 per cent while Advanced Micro Devices, its nearest rival, lost 12.5 per cent despite having forecast above-expectations earnings the day before. For the week, Intel declined 2.9 per cent while AMD lost 11 per cent.Apple Computer did nothing to help techs when it reported fourth-quarter revenues below expectations, and fell 4.5 per cent on Wednesday. However, the shares bounced 9.1 per cent a session later to finish the week 4.6 per cent ahead.The auto sector attracted a fair amount of attention after the widely anticipate bankruptcy filing by component maker Delphi last weekend. The company, which is the largest supplier to General Motors, said it needed to extract significant concessions from its unions to become competitive.The filing triggered concerns that GM itself might be in jeopardy, and the carmaker’s shares lost 9.9 per cent on Monday. For the week, they lost 5.8 per cent.Adding to the sector’s woes was Dana, which fell 34.3 per cent on Monday after it warned its third-quarter results would be delayed. The decline pulled Visteon, a leading supplier to Ford Motor, 5.3 per cent lower in the same session. Another rival, Arvin-Meritor, lost 7.4 per cent. For the week, Dana lost 31.8 per cent, Visteon fell 11.5 per cent, Arvin lost 7.2 per cent and Ford was 6.2 per cent behind.Away from cars, Johnson & Johnson fell 3.6 per cent on Thursday after it sued Amgen for anti-competitive practices. It was 3.6 per cent higher for the week.
530;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;The week in technology: The video iPod;;Apple’s latest product announcement was preceded by the usual amount of excitement - at last, the long-rumoured video iPod was to be launched. Apple and Walt Disney plan to sell episodes of Desperate Housewives and other television shows over an iPod device capable of playing video, the companies announced on Wednesday at an unveiling of the video iPod in Silicon Valley.At last count Google News was listing an incredible 1,355 items on the topic, a number no doubt sickening for the likes of rivals Sony and Microsoft.Fears over piracy and copyright control meant the move was seen as something of a risk for Robert Iger, who has been in the chief’s seat at Disney for barely three weeks.There were also fears for Apple – namely, that taking on video may be ‘one thing too many’ for the company. Some analysts pointed out that Microsoft had tried and failed to light up the mobile video market, some pointed to the popularity of Sony’s video-capable PSP, but others thought Apple’s ‘fascination’ value would be enough to help kickstart demand.In all the excitement it was easy to forget that due to copyright wrangling, consumers outside of the US won’t be able to download the TV programmes for some time.In more iPod-related news, Apple is pushing for a much bigger percentage of sales from iPod accessories, according to Engadget. “Who was calling who greedy now?” asked Techdirt, reminding readers of Apple chief executive Steve Jobs’ recent accusation that record companies of greed for wanting more royalties for songs sold on iTunes.Google and Comcast eye AOL stakeGoogle and Comcast, the biggest cable operator, are teaming up to bid for a stake in AOL- a move that pits them against the might of Microsoft, which was already in talks with Time Warner about buying a piece of its ailing internet service provider.Collaboration between Google, Comcast and Time Warner could create a headache for the likes of Microsoft and Yahoo - who, incidentally, just announced their instant messaging networks would become interoperable.The motive behind the collaboration depends on who you read - the AP says that, for Google, it’s a combination of portal content and the advertising partnership which accounts for about 10 per cent of Google’s revenues. The Networking Pipeline blog, meanwhile, says it’s about AOL’s instant messenging software, AIM. Google’s new Talk software is very clean, “but it has one serious problem – no one appears to use it,” says Preston Gralla.Either way, we’re bound to hear a lot about synergies in the weeks to come.And in the meantime, avid Google-watchers can amuse themselves with the SF Weekly’s ‘Is Google Good?’ survey.Samsung pleads guilty to price-fixingSamsung, the Korean electronics company, pleaded guilty to price-fixing for its computer chips- the third company to do so under investigation from the US Justice Department.Intel launches dual-core XeonIntel began shipping its first dual-core Xeon processors and only a few months after arch-rival AMD. Intel however said its processors were twice as fast.
531;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-10-12T20:41:26Z;Tech stocks suffer on Wall Street;;Disappointing quarterly earnings and downbeat analyst comments kept Wall Street technology stocks on the back foot on Wednesday.Apple Computer weighed on the sector a day after the maker of iPods reported below-forecast quarterly revenues, sending its shares 4.5 per cent lower to $49.25. PortalPlayer, which supplies the chips for iPods, was down 3.2 per cent to $26.13.The decline made the tech-laced Nasdaq Composite the worst performer of the three main US equity gauges and sent it to its lowest point in 3½ months.Downgrades compounded the technology sector’s woes. Prudential downgraded Intel, as well as the rest of the semiconductor sector. Shares in the world’s largest chipmaker headed 0.8 per cent lower to $23.24.Intel pulled its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in its wake. AMD’s above-forecast quarterly results were overshadowed by dented hopes of higher margins. The Prudential analyst who was downbeat about Intel was positive about AMD, but this still did not prevent AMD shares from falling 12.5 per cent to $20.99. AMD has still managed to outperform the Philadelphia Semiconductor index so far this year.The chip index eased 0.4 per cent, with more than half of its 19 components bucking the downward trend. Risers included Texas Instruments, up 2.2 per cent to $29.72, and KLA Tencor, up 1.5 per cent to $46.55.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent, or 35.70 points, to 10,217.47, while the broader S&P 500 index edged off 0.6 per cent, or 7.15 points, to 1,177.72. The Nasdaq Composite index was 1.2 per cent, or 23.62 points, lower at 2,037.47.Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that the market was approaching oversold levels fast and estimated that “being bullish sometime in the middle of next week will be the right camp to be in”.The Dow received strong support from Pfizer, which gained 2.2 per cent to $24.84 after a British judge blocked an attempt by a rival company to copy Pfizer’s highly successful Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol drug.Elsewhere among drug stocks, Merck put on 0.2 per cent to $26.80 while GlaxoSmithKline’s US-listed shares added 1.2 per cent to $50.73. However, it was Schering-Plough’s 4.2 per cent advance to $20.67 that led the gains for the Amex Pharmaceutical Index, which climbed 0.4 per cent.The drumroll of earnings reports continued, and Harley-Davidson shares added 2.9 per cent to $46.94 after the maker of the iconic motorcycles reported a 16 per cent increase in quarterly profits.True Religion’s guidance to better-than-expected profits was not enough to halt a 13.4 per cent decline in the clothing maker’s stock to $13.81. Analysts at Wedbush Morgan downgraded it, citing valuation concerns.
532;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-10-11T22:45:36Z;AMD beats sales expectations;;Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday beat market expectations with record third-quarter sales driven by a 44 per cent increase in revenues from its microprocessors.AMD also exceeded analysts’ forecasts for profits, reporting earnings of 18 cents a share or $76m, compared with expectations of 8 cents.Sales rose 23 per cent on a year earlier, from $1.24bn to $1.52bn, and were ahead of the consensus of $1.38bn gathered by Thomson Financial. Microprocessor sales rose to $969m, from $673m a year ago.AMD shares rose 2.6 per cent on the news to $23.90 in after-hours trading.“This was another record-breaking quarter for AMD’s microprocessor division,” said Robert Rivet, chief financial officer, in a statement. “Exceptional customer demand for our server, mobile and desktop processors helped drive microprocessor sales growth of 44 per cent compared to the third quarter of 2004 and 26 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2005.” There had been new quarterly records in unit and dollar sales, gross margin and operating income, he added.AMD has achieved technology leads over its bigger rival Intel in developing faster chips that use less power and moving to 64-bit computing and dual-core processors. Analysts expect its advantage to diminish with Intel now releasing its own dual-core chips and moving to a next-generation architecture next year.AMD also benefited from an improved performance by its Spansion memory chip subsidiary – a joint venture with Fujitsu it plans to spin off. Spansion has suffered from prices falling for flash memory, which is used in mobile phones and other devices. But in the third quarter to September 25, “a more balanced supply and demand environment helped stabilise the average selling price”, Mr Rivet said.Memory sales were still down 4 per cent on a year ago, but up 12 per cent on the previous quarter.Overall gross margins were 41 per cent compared to 39 per cent in the second quarter. Operating income improved to $79m from a loss of $7m in the previous quarter.AMD said it expected fourth-quarter processor sales to grow between 7 and 13 per cent compared to the third quarter.
533;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-10-10T22:57:07Z;Intel ships first ‘chips with two brains’;;Intel on Monday began shipping its first “chips with two brains” for servers running with two processors inside.The world’s biggest chipmaker said its new product, which trails a similar offering by its rival Advanced Micro Devices by several months, would offer a 50 per cent improvement in performance.Its dual-core Xeon processor for dual-processor servers will effectively provide four machines or eight threads for a computer to divide its workload and offer better performance with lower power requirements.The 2.8Ghz chip will cost $1,043 in batches of 1,000 and will be followed in the next two months by a faster version for servers with more than two processors.Intel has been losing market share to AMD in recent months in the “x86” server segment due to its rival’s technological lead. Mercury research reported AMD’s share increased from 7.4 per cent in the first quarter to 11.2 per cent in the second, although Intel still dominated with 88.8 per cent.The dual-core Xeon was due to appear in the first quarter of next year but has been brought forward due to demand from PC manufacturers. Dell, which does not use AMD chips, will be one of the first companies to offer the new Xeon.Intel is promising a greater range of dual-core processors, codenamed Bensley, in the first quarter of next year that will be priced the same as single-core chips and feature smaller 65 nanometre technology.”It’s clear the market is forcing Intel to respond to AMD and Intel is betting its success on another stopgap solution,” said Henri Richard, AMD head of sales and marketing, on Monday.Analysts at A.G.Edwards said AMD’s noticeable advantage in the server space was beginning to fade with the Xeon announcement.While it had been able to charge higher average selling prices than Intel over the past few quarters in servers, there was not much room for continued AMD price increases given Intel’s pricing strategy, they said.
534;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Intel fights AMD on practices;;Intel on Thursday rebutted allegations by its smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices, that unfair business practices had helped it win dominance over the microprocessor market.In its first legal response to the charges made by AMD in June, Intel alleged its competitor owed its position to its own failings.“AMD is dogged by its reputation for unreliability as a supplier,” it said in a 63-page court defence filed in Delaware. “The company has a history of manufacturing snafus that led it to cut off microprocessor supplies to many customers, making it difficult to regain share and crippling earnings.”Intel has an 80 per cent global market share for PC processors, but Japan and South Korea’s Fair Trade Commissions, as well as the European Commission, have investigated it this year.Japan’s FTC found that Intel had violated antitrust laws by offering rebates to five PC makers on condition they agreed to limit purchases of chips made by AMD and other rivals.AMD’s complaint in June said Intel had engaged in a number of anti-competitive practices, including secret and discriminatory discounts and rebates. It quoted executives of the PC maker Gateway claiming Intel had “beaten them into guacamole” for having limited dealings with AMD.Intel said in its response on Thursday “fanciful claims of its alleged misconduct had already been publicly denied by some of the third parties cited, including Acer and Dixons.”Price discounts reflected “the essence of competition: earning more sales by cutting prices and expanding markets, while delivering more benefits to consumers.”Intel said its success was a result of consistent performance over many years, offering customers a reliable supply and competitive products and cost.In contrast, AMD “was content with anaemic investment in manufacturing capacity,” it said.“The company entered into a failed partnership with [Taiwanese foundry] UMC through which AMD never sold a single microprocessor. A design-based strategy also failed, and AMD’s highest-volume factory is producing less than one-half of the chip volume promised in 2002.”Intel said its Silicon Valley rival’s real goal in the lawsuit was to protect itself from price competition.“Under the cover of competition law, AMD seeks to shield itself from competition, hoping to impede Intel’s ability to lower its prices and allow AMD to charge higher prices.”AMD’s litigation has also spawned dozens of class-action lawsuits by consumers against Intel.The main AMD v Intel Corp case is due to be heard in Delaware next year.
535;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-09-01T18:01:22Z;Silence is golden for promising new treatment;;"Fifteen years ago, plant scientists looking for a way to deepen the colour of petunias introduced additional copies of a gene encoding a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into the plants. But instead of turning dark purple, the flowers turned partly white, because the pigment genes had been turned off by some mechanism then unknown to the scientistsresearchers.Today, many prominent scientists believe this basic biological method of “silencing” genes could be the next big medical breakthrough to cure or treat an incredibly a wide array of diseases from HIV to cancer to diabetes.The gene-silencing mechanism was coined “RNA interference” – or RNAi – by researchers investigating it in worms in 1998. Scientists led by Tom Tuschl COR at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Germany then found it to be at work in human cells in 2001. The discovery immediately spurred scientists to dream about harnessing the natural mechanism to shut down diseases caused by faulty gene expression.Developments in the field are moving rapidly. Many researchers believe that RNAi-based drugs could be on the market in as little as five years, although there are some steep hurdles to be overcome first to translate the new knowledge of molecular biology into medical reality.“Maybe RNAi therapeutics are not moving fast enough for patients looking for a solution – no therapeutics do – but this is moving as fast as anything I’ve ever seen,” says Greg Hannon, COR an RNAi researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories in the US.John Maraganore, COR chief executive of Alnylam, one of the leading RNAi therapeutic companies, says that the three most pressing issues to be resolved with RNAi-based drugs are “delivery, delivery and delivery”. Most in the field agree, although there are other crucial issues, such as hitting unintended genes and staying active long enough.The delivery issue arises because unlike small molecule drugs, RNAi drugs do not readily diffuse into the cell because– as a consequence of their larger size and different chemical properties.Many are Researchers working to address the issue and have made substantial progress at curing disease in animals through a variety of delivery methods. Alnylam chemically modified the RNAi drugs with cholesterol, which is readily absorbed by liver cells. Therefore, some early therapeutic targets are liver diseases such as hepatitis C – for which Sirna Therapeutics, COR another company leading the field, hopes to start clinical studies next year.Mark Davis, a researcher at California Institute of Technology and co-founder of Calando, succeeded in reducing or preventing tumours in mice by delivering RNAi drugs through nanoparticles, while Judy Lieberman’s team at Harvard Medical School reduced the HIV infection in mice by delivering RNAi drugs coupled to antibodies.Many RNAi companies are planning to tackle viral diseases, including hepatitis C, RSV and HIV. These provide very visible targets – if a gene that the virus needs to replicate is blocked, the disease is halted – and there is no danger of shutting down a gene that our own bodies may need.Several RNAi companies are also targeting cancer. Challenges in targeting this complex disease include deciding on the most appropriate cellular gene targets – which RNAi can itself help determine – and delivering the therapy to every cancer cell in the body.Mark Davis, a researcher at California Institute of Technology, succeeded in using nanoparticles for delivery to reduce tumours in mice. Just as with other diseases, a possible RNAi drug might be used in conjunction with existing therapies. Other early targets include Parkinson’s, cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s, diabetes and asthma.Although the most advanced drug entered clinical trials only last November, However the fact that the two leading RNAi therapeutic companies, Alnylam and Sirna Therapeutics have gone public before any drugs have even reached late stage trials is testament to the fact that many belief many investors have a strong belief in its potential. Alnylam has raised about $100m since inception in 2002, including $30m from its initial public offering last year. Sirna has also raised about $100m.Some in “big pharma” have become involved as well. Merck, the US group, has paid given Alnylam an upfront payment of $3m and will pay up to $19.5m in pre-clinical cash milestones in a partnership to develop a treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in older people. Eli Lilly may partner with Sirna on a cancer drug.Others, however, are waiting for further proof of RNAi’s therapeutic potentialas a . Klaus Lindpaintner,COR head of the Centre for Medical Genomics at Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, says he is “cautiously optimistic” and “very keenly watching the scene” but needs to see some additional developments in the field – particularly in drug delivery – before Roche would consider investing.“Drug development is an exceptionally risky business. In this case, there is a risk to the underlying technology,” says Edward Tenthoff, COR analyst at Piper Jaffray, which underwrote Alnylam’s public offering. “It is very early days in this approach, but the potential is massive.” he adds.The earliest that an RNAi-based drug might come to the market is 4-5 between four and five years, estimates Phillip Sharp, the Nobel Prize-winning biologist and co-founder of Alnylam.The first drug that could become reality is a treatment for AMD for which Sirna has commenced
clinical trials. A success with AMD would go some way towards validating RNAi as a therapeutic
technique.AMD is an easy target because it is a localised disease and an RNAi treatment could simply be injected into the eye, thus avoiding the critical delivery issue. the main roadblock obstacle in the path to RNAi’s success as a therapy.Besides the complex delivery issue that needs to be resolved to treat all these diseases, there is the thorny issue of intellectual property (IP) in the form of patents on key RNAi technology. Some investors are waiting to see which company wins before putting their their money on the table.“In the early years it’s hard to pin down where all the key patents are....Our investment is partly based on which company has an important part of the IP,” says John Shields at Abingworth, the life sciences venture capital firm. which has invested in Alnylam.Both Alnylam and Sirna have secured some key
patents already. “Our leading IP estate has been a significant barrier to entry for new ventures,” says Mr Maraganore However, he adds says that his company has already licensed its IP to more than a dozen companies, assince no one company is big enough to do all the vast research required by the field.HOW RNAi DRUGS COULD ‘TURN OFF’ DISEASED CELLSThe genetic revolution 50 years ago showed that information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. When a protein is needed, the corresponding gene, or DNA, is first transcribed into a type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into protein.The RNAi mechanism acts when a small RNA molecule, called short interfering RNA (siRNA) binds to and degrades complementary mRNA or viral RNA and prevents its translation into protein. This blocks or “silences” gene expression.Pharmaceutical labs everywhere are currently using RNAi as a tool in “target validation”. Silencing a specific gene can help scientists determine the gene’s function in the cell – an essential step in finding out which genes to target in designing drugs.But RNAi can potentially serve an even greater function than a tool in drug discovery – it can be the basis for the drugs themselves.In viral diseases such as hepatitis and HIV, RNAi could silence one or more genes that lead to the virus’s replication; in cancer, it could silence genes that have mutated in tumour cells and led to uncontrollable cell proliferation; in dominant genetic diseases such as Huntington’s it could turn off a mutated gene but allow its normally functioning copy to be expressed.The main difference between RNAi therapeutics and traditional “small molecule” drugs is that the RNAi products go one step up in the genetic pathway.The RNAi drugs would target complementary mRNA to inhibit gene expression; small molecule drugs target proteins for the same purpose.While proteins are not always easy to target because of their complex three-dimensional structure, mRNA’s linear structure makes it easier to hit. This means RNAi drugs can operate on “non-druggable” targets.“Many proteins don’t have surfaces that you can design a small molecule drug to bind to with high affinity – you can’t make a key when you don’t have a lock,” says Phillip Sharp, the biologist who was a co-founder of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.“In theory, RNAi drugs could be designed to target any gene,” says Prof Sharp. “If it worked perfectly, you could treat almost anything with it.”This, of course, is a big “if”."
536;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-08-23T22:52:50Z;Intel talks up its next generation microchip;;Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, on Tuesday announced a new microarchitecture that it said would make its processors ten times more powerful by the end of the decade while consuming a tenth of the energy currently needed.Paul Otellini, chief executive, told the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, that the new design would combine features of an existing desktop PC microarchitecture built for speed and those from a mobile one that optimised power consumption.“We can significantly reduce energy costs around the world,” he said, citing savings of $1bn a year from the new architecture. An estimated 200m computers will be sold this year worldwide.He declined to give the next-generation architecture a name but said it would include new innovations and appear in the second half of 2006. New processors will be launched in the server, desktop and mobile markets and will have two cores or “brains”, a feature introduced earlier this year.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's main processor rival, took out full-page advertisements in major US newspapers on Tuesday, challenging Intel to a “dual-core duel” - a technology benchmark test to prove which company offered the best performance.“I have always thought that companies are best judged in the marketplace,” Mr Otellini responded.Intel's processors are in four out of every five PCs sold but AMD has been credited with stealing a technological advantage over Intel of late and launched a major lawsuit in June alleging anti-competitive practices, including threats of retaliation against customers that did business with AMD.“Intel is trying its best to make incremental improvements to its architecture to try to catch up with the architecture we have established,” said Bahr Mahony, a marketing manager at AMD's microprocessor business unit on Tuesday.Mr Otellini, in his first major public speech since becoming chief executive in May, said the industry was on a “performance per watt” course that would lead to smaller, sleeker, more energy efficient computers. He demonstrated a concept PC he described as a “handtop” that would consume only half a watt of power.“We expect to go from five watts to half a watt by the end of this decade, a factor of 10 times less power but a ten-times increase in performance.”As well as 15 dual-core projects, Intel was working on more than 10 projects containing four or more processor cores per chip, he said.
537;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intel set to unveil power saving processor;;Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company, will signal next week the onset of a new technology cycle that will determine the winners and losers in the computer industry in the second half of the decade.The company's first new-generation chip architecture in five years will be launched in the second half of 2006, coinciding with the release of Microsoft's new operating system Vista and the next major PC buying cycle.“This will likely be the biggest ramp in PCs this decade, much like what Windows 95 did for the last decade,” says market consultant Rob Enderle. “This is Intel's attempt to exit this cycle as the dominant vendor. It can be the same kind of opportunity for PC manufacturers by 2008, Dell might not be on top any more.”Intel already provides the processors for four out of every five PCs sold. But it has allowed its closest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, to grab a technological edge over the past two years in being first to announce faster chips and a move from 32 to 64-bit desktop computing.Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive since May, will unveil to next week's developer conference an architecture for high performance, energy efficient, multi-core processors. The emphasis has changed from increasing speed to reducing power and heat and producing better performance per watt.“It's going to save energy from notebook computers to the racks of servers that need large amounts of power and have become a huge cost, so it's a very welcome approach,” says Richard Doherty, research director at the Envisioneering group.Intel is also gearing itself up for the holy grail of Windows computing a long-promised feature known as instant-on that would allow computers to be turned on without the familiar long “boot” process.Intel's new architecture should be able to virtually shut down and then quickly awake different cores of the processor.“I've seen thermal camera images where you can see one core almost go to sleep,” says Mr Doherty.Bill Calder of Intel confirms: “Vista will benefit from the track we are on with our microprocessors.”The new chips will succeed the Pentium 4, launched in November 2000, and be the natural successors to the Pentium M, a notebook processor that tackled the problems of heat and power created by faster chips. The new architecture has not yet been named.
538;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-08-08T17:46:51Z;Intel in South Korean investigation;;Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor maker, revealed on Monday that South Korea's Fair Trade Commission was investigating marketing and rebate programmes it had entered into with Korean PC manufacturers.The inquiry mirrors an antitrust investigation held by Japan's Fair Trade Commission this year, and one still under way involving the European Commission.Intel also faces litigation by Advanced Micro Devices, its closest microprocessor rival, over alleged anti-competitive actions and it said dozens of class-action lawsuits had been spawned by AMD's action.In its quarterly 10Q report, Intel said the FTC in South Korea had requested documents from its arm there. It said it was co-operating and expected the matters would be acceptably resolved.In March, its Japanese subsidiary avoided a protracted legal battle when it accepted a “cease and desist” ruling from the FTC there. It had found that Intel violated antitrust laws by offering rebates to five Japanese PC makers on condition they agreed to limit purchases of chips made by AMD and other rivals.Intel said it did not agree with the facts and felt the ruling still gave it a workable framework to offer competitive pricing in Japan.Last month, European Union investigators raided Intel offices as part of an antitrust investigation dating back to 2001.In June, AMD filed a complaint in a Delaware court alleging Intel had engaged in a number of anti-competitive practices, including secret and discriminatory discounts and rebates.The company said it disputed the AMD and class-action claims and intended to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Intel processors feature in four out of every five PCs sold worldwide.
539;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Wall St shrugs off hangover of rising oil prices;;For once the markets were not totally in thrall to oil prices during a week that saw a surge of investor optimism after an extended period of worrying that rising energy costs would eat into corporate profits.Instead, the market was energised by better than expected jobs figures and some good earnings results – not least from Apple, which reaped rich rewards from the enduring popularity of its iPod music player system.Owen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said traders had not been as jittery about oil prices as in previous weeks.“The market seems to be taking it in its stride because it is so weather- related. It goes up when a storm is brewing in the Gulf but when it passes oil falls back off again.” Although the rising oil price helped the energy sector, the week finished with uncertainty hanging over CNOOC’s $18.5bn attempt to takeover Unocal.A crucial board meeting by Unocal executives ended on Thursday night with no public statement about the competing bid from Chevron. During late morning trade yesterday CNOOC’s New York listed shares were down 1.6 per cent on the day at $59.90 – down 3.6 per cent on last Friday’s close.Technology and healthcare stocks performed well during the week.Leading the pack were Advanced Micro Devices and Apple. A record five-fold increase in sales of iPods sent Apple shares soaring, up 7.8 per cent at $41.23 compared to last week.AMD reported better than expected profit as strong sales of personal computers and corporate servers offset losses from flash memory chips for consumer gadgets. AMD shares rose 1.3 per cent during the week to $19.18.The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 3.9 per cent to 459.85 during the week on the back of AMD’s results.Intel was up 4.7 per cent to $19.71 over the week while Texas Instruments, which is to publish its results this month, gained 2.3 per cent to $30.42.Amgen, the biotechnology company, rose above the $70 mark, with a 1.4 per cent gain during the week taking it to $70.10 a share.Mergers and takeovers also helped to bolster the healthcare sector with VNU, the Dutch owner of AC Nielsen, agreeing to buy IMS Health in a $7bn deal.VNU was up 3.7 per cent over the week at $12.47 while IMS was up 5.1 per cent at $27.22.It was also a good week for PepsiCo when the world’s second-largest soft-drinks maker reported better than expected quarterly profits due to strong growth in its international business, taking it to $55.71 – a 4.1 per cent gain since last Friday.“All these good results have reassured the market that growth is not going to fall off a cliff,” said Mr Fitzpatrick.Investors also cheered strong economic reports, including a slight narrowing of the US trade deficit, and government data showing retail sales rose 1.7 per cent in June even as inflation remained under control.Among various bits of data released yesterday the government said producer prices had held steady over the last month and the Federal Reserve announced that industrial production rose 0.9 per cent in June, compared to a 0.3 per cent rise in May.By late morning yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen slightly to 10,626.82 and the broader S&P 500 was down at 1,225.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,148.76.Over the week the Dow was up 1.7 per cent, the S&P advanced 1.1 per cent, after attaining a four-year high on Thursday, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 per cent.Among the stocks to disappoint this week was General Electric. Yesterday General Electric announced profits that only met analysts expectations and warned third-quarter earnings may fall short of some forecasts.By late morning yesterday shares in the company had slipped 1.2 per cent to $35.19.Yum! Brands, the owner of Pizza Hut and KFC, saw its shares fall more than four per cent after it lowered its forecast for the year. Across the week its share price fell 1.6 per cent to $51.03.Shares of DreamWorks Animation SKG also took a tumble after the maker of Shrek said it would post a second-quarter loss.

540;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-14T22:34:45Z;S&P 500 index closes at four-year high;;An undiminished appetite for iPods sent Apple climbing on Thursday and helped Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index to a four-year high.The markets surged as Apple announced third-quarter profits had grown fivefold and the government reported increased retail sales and tame inflation.A record increase in sales of the ubiquitous digital music player sent the computer company’s shares up 6.3.2 per cent to $40.75. Whit Penski, senior analyst at Bear Stearns, said the company’s “fantastic numbers” were also helped by a “spill-over” effect of iPod fans beginning to buy Apple computers.“While Apple is not exactly a bellwether stock, we think this could be the beginning of a trend for large cap growth assets which are still much cheaper relative to large cap as a whole,” he said.The tech-based Nasdaq Composite index set a 2005 high, gaining 0.4 per cent to 2,152.82 by the close. The S&P 500 index was up 0.3 per cent at 1,226.5 and the Dow Jones industrial average was 0.7 per cent up 10,628.89.Other tech stocks received a lift yesterday. Microsoft gained 1.2 per cent to $25.97, Hewlett-Packard was up 0.8 per cent at $24.62 and IBM rose 1.2 per cent to $82.42. Gatewayslipped, however, by 5.5 per cent to $3.76.Advanced Micro Devicesmanaged to stem its expected profit decline, its share price rise 3.3 per cent to $19.88. Second quarter profits fell 65 per cent as the falling price of its memory chips ate into higher sales of personal computer.The markets also cheered government data showing retail sales up 1.7 per cent in June. The consumer price index was unchanged from May.“The consumer continues to be the cat with nine lives,” said Michael Strauss of the Commonfund. “The fear has been that this is an economy where the consumer has two nails in the coffin, but it’s not so.”In other earnings news, MDC Holdings climbed 1.8 per cent to $87.96 despite continued concerns about a housing bubble. The Denver-based homebuilder said sales had increased by 20 per cent in the second-quarter.Shares in the other major house builders did not echo MDC’s performance, however.

541;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-14T16:58:25Z;Market Overview: Falling oil and level inflation sends indices into earnings season upbeat;;Global equity markets swept higher once again on Thursday as upbeat earnings reports, tumbling oil prices and supportive economic data fed a growing appetite for risk.Hopes that the US Federal Reserve is approaching a pause in its tightening cycle were supported by the release of benign US inflation data, with the core consumer price index rising just 0.1 per cent in June for the second month running.But stronger than expected US retail sales suggested growth was still solid.This gave a further boost to stock markets already basking in the glow of strong results from Apple Computer and Advanced Micro Devices, released after Wednesday’s closing bell.Technology stocks, not surprisingly led the way, with the likes of Tokyo Electron and Advantest helping Japan’s Nikkei 225 index 0.9 per cent higher.European stock markets hit their customary fresh three-year highs, with STMicroelectronics, Infineon and Philips leading the FTSE Eurofirst 300 0.6 per cent higher to 1,165.91. However, London’s FTSE 100, virtually bereft of tech stocks, gained just 0.3 per cent to 5,259.7.Once again there were signs of rotation out of defensives, with utility stocks softening.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent firmer at 1,227.70, heading for a fresh four-year closing high, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.7 per cent.David Bowers, chief global strategist at Merrill Lynch, said equity markets were in a “sweet spot” created by reasonable economic growth and retreating inflation fears. “People are obsessed with the idea that equities are cheap compared to bonds and cash,” he added.John Hatherly, head of global analysis at M&G, attributed the rally to a cocktail of rising earnings, optimism on the US economy, perceived cheapness of equities and a ready supply of cash on the sideline.Germany’s Xetra Dax has risen 12 per cent since April, with France’s CAC-40 up 11.9 per cent, the FTSE 100 10 per cent higher and the S&P 500 up 8.2 per cent. The Nikkei 225 has gained 8.7 per cent since its own lows in May.The momentum suggests further gains to come, although risks lurk in the shape of oil prices, a lack of corporate pricing power, US monetary tightening and slowing global growth.The 1.1 per cent rise of South Korea’s Kospi index to its highest close since December 1994 led to a spillover into currency markets.Foreign investors have been net buyers of Seoul equities for the past 11 trading sessions. In response the South Korean won has risen 2.3 per cent to Won1,031 against the US dollar and rallied to Won9.1873 against the yen, its strongest level since August 1998.Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York, pointed out that, since April 2003, when foreign investors returned with a vengeance to Asian markets, there has been an 82 per cent correlation between the performance of the Kospi and the won/dollar.Reduced appetite for more defensive asset classes was demonstrated by the UK’s second sale of 50-year gilts, which garnered the least demand for an auction since 1998, covered just 1.23 times.Oil prices fell as signs that Hurricane Emily will miss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure built on Wednesday’s data showing strong US distillate inventories.By mid-session, New York trading August West Texas Intermediate was $2.31 weaker at $57.70 a barrel. Tom Vosa, market economist at National Australia Bank, argued $60 was proving to be a ceiling, triggering fund selling whenever it was breached.
542;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Eurofirst 300 steels to another three-year peak;;Technology, steel and auto stocks led the charge on European stock markets on Thursday as the FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the session at a fresh three-year closing high.The pan-European index gained 5.89 points, or 0.51 per cent per cent, to 1,165.43 thanks to a blend of upbeat sectoral news and better-than-expected second-quarter results. The index hit 1,170.34 at one point.French markets remained open on the Bastille Day public holiday, and although volumes were thin, the CAC-40 index of French blue-chip stocks outperformed, gaining 0.63 per cent to 4,370.88, a 38-month closing high.Steelmakers were among the best performers. After a series of downgrades in the sector on Tuesday, stocks staged a recovery on Thursday on hopes that the worst for the sector is over.Many European producers had to cut output in the last few months to defend prices as demand fell due to rapidly expanding production capacity in China, the world’s biggest consumer of steel.“The European producers are in a better position to supply specialist steel as demand begins to pick up,” said Stephen Pope, head of strategy research at Cantor Fitzgerald. Arcelor, which Mr Pope named as his top pick in the sector, was up 2.4 per cent to €16.86.Arcelor’s interest in Turkish state steel company Erdemir is attracting tough opposition from Turkish politicians and businessmen.Elsewhere in the sector, Corus Group, the Anglo-Dutch producer, was 3.1 per cent higher at €0.67, while ThyssenKrupp, the German steelmaker and engineer, was up 2.8 per cent to €14.71.European technology stocks were lifted after two US companies reported better-than-expected earnings following the Wall Street close on Wednesday. Chipmaker AMD and Apple Computer both beat forecasts for the second quarter.Among the chipmakers, STMicroelectronicswas up 2.9 per cent to €14.80, helped also by rumours it was in talks with South Korea’s Hynix Semiconductor over a memory chip joint venture.Infineon, the German chipmaker, gained 3.6 per cent to €8.39, Philips Electronicsof the Netherlands rose 1.4 per cent to €22.68 and ASML, the Dutch maker of chip manufacturing equipment, added 1.7 per cent €14.24.Swiss pharmaceuticals group Novartisrose 2.1 per cent to SFr62.35 after reporting net profit rose 9 per cent in the second quarter, beating expectations, thanks to improving sales of core brands Diovan, the blood-pressure drug, and Glivec, a leukaemia treatment.“Novartis, in our view, deserves to trade at a meaningful premium to the sector average, not least due to its robust stable pharmaceutical revenue growth and its improving operating margin, which is already towards the top end of the sector,” said Michael Leacock, analyst at Nomura.Belgian brewer InBev, maker of Stella Artois, reported internal beer volume sales in the first half totalled 89.1m hectolitres, lower than the 91m expected. In a statement however, the world’s largest brewer by volume, said it was still on target to deliver “solid” earnings this year as first half sales rose 5.5 per cent. Shares were up 3.8 per cent to €30.70.After its all-time high and 7.3 per cent rise of the previous session after outstanding second quarter results, Swedish ball bearing maker SKFwas up a more modest 1.4 per cent to SFr89.75 as analysts queued up to recommend the company.“We consider the 25 per cent valuation discount to Swedish capital goods peers to be increasingly anomalous and expect this to close over the next year or so,” said Andrew Carter at Deutsche Bank. “On this assumption, we raise our target price to SKr100 and remain buyers.”James Moore at Goldman Sachs re-iterated the “outperform” rating and raised earnings-per-share estimates. “We believe SKF has now shown sufficient evidence that it is a premium growth company with sustainable high margins and as such we believe that it should not trade on such a discount to the European capital goods sector,” he said.Among the stocks benefiting from positive sentiment in the auto sector were DaimlerChrysler, up 1.7 per cent to €34.64, and Renault up 2 per cent to €75.55.Opap, the Greek gaming group, fell 2.7 per cent to €24.18 after a record high in the last session. The Greek state started selling a 16.4 per cent stake on Wednesday at €22 to €25.20 a share.
543;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-14T03:16:35Z;Tech sector leads Tokyo shares higher;;Japanese shares rose on Thursday, led by buying in the technology sector following better-than-expected earnings reports from US peers and positive news on Wednesday from the Bank of Japan.The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index rose 0.90 per cent to 11,764.26, while the broader Topix average firmed 0.46 per cent to 1,191.17. Trading was light, with 12.5bn shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section.After an unexpected quarterly profit report from US chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, investors were quick to grab shares of Japanese competitors, pushing the precision machinery subindex up a full 2.4 per cent. The news followed a BoJ report on Wednesday that said the Japanese economy continued to recover.Tokyo Electron rose 3.2 per cent to Y5,840, Elpida climbed 1.7 per cent to Y3,560, and Advantest was 2.7 per cent higher at Y8,320.Buying was not limited to chip-related shares, with other major technology companies also getting a boost from the positive news in the US market.Fujitsu rose 1.5 per cent to Y599, Toshiba was 0.5 per cent higher at Y441, and Canon also tacked on 0.5 per cent to Y5,990. Sony posted its third successive day of gains, rising 1 per cent to Y3,990.Kyoei Tanker surged 10.3 per cent to Y430 following a report by the Nihon Keizai business daily that oil tanker freight charges from the Middle East to Asia have risen due to rising import costs for crude oil.Nomura Holdings gained 1.4 per cent to Y1,335 after Goldman Sachs upgraded its recommendation on the company’s stock to “outperform” from “in-line.”Teikoku Oil picked up 0.9 per cent to Y835 after reports on Wednesday that the Japanese government would grant it test-drilling rights in a gas field in the East China Sea this week.The news pushed down competitors’ shares, with Inpex dropping 1.5 per cent to Y662,000 and Japan Petroleum also slipping 1.5 per cent to Y4,600.
544;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-13T22:49:43Z;AMD defies earnings forecasts;;A 38 per cent increase in microprocessor sales enabled Advanced Micro Devices to beat second quarter revenue and earnings expectations.The semiconductor company, which last month filed an antitrust complaint against arch-rival Intel, said it expected microprocessor revenues to “exceed normal seasonal patterns” during the current quarter.In the three months to June, AMD achieved earnings per share of 3 cents, down from 9 cents, on revenues unchanged at $1.26bn. Wall Street analysts had forecast a loss per share of about 5 cents.Microprocessor sales were driven by strong demand for personal computers worldwide. AMD commands about 20 per cent of the market for PC processors. Intel's share is about 80 per cent.Sales of server processors used in computers sold to corporate customers increased by 89 per cent from the first quarter. AMD's Operton line of server processors has been gaining market share over alternatives from Intel, Sun Microsystems and International Business Machines.In a complaint filed in June in a federal court in Delaware, AMD claimed that Intel has unlawfully maintained its dominant PC market position by forcing PC makers to enter into exclusive supply agreements in return for cash payments or lower chip prices.European Union officials this week raided Intel offices in several countries as part of a separate EU investigation into Intel's market tactics. Intel has said its policies were fair and lawful.Spansion, AMD's flash memory business remained in the red, losing $90m in the quarter, compared with an operating profit of $45m, on revenue down 31 per cent to $462m.
545;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-12T22:17:47Z;EU steps up Intel antitrust probe;;European Union antitrust officials on Tuesday raided the offices of Intel and several computer manufacturers and distributors, in an escalation of their probe against the world's largest chipmaker.The raids underline the European Commission's determination to conclude a case launched five years ago, and is an important step in the worldwide campaign against Intel waged by Advanced Micro Devices, its smaller rival. Last month, AMD filed an antitrust complaint against Intel in a US court accusing the group of illegally maintaining a monopoly.A complaint by AMD in Japan led to a formal ruling against Intel this year by the Fair Trade Commission.The Commission probe, however, raises perhaps the most serious threat to the US chip giant, because Brussels has the power to impose antitrust fines of up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover. Though the EU regulator normally settles for a lower fine, penalties can run into hundreds of millions of euros.All three actions are based on similar allegations that Intel offered rebates to personal computer manufacturers that were aimed at excluding AMD from competing for business.A spokesman for Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said: “I can confirm that Commission officials accompanied by officials from national competition authorities have conducted on-site investigations at several premises of Intel Corporation in Europe as well as a number of IT firms manufacturing or selling computers.”He added: “The investigations are within the framework of an on-going competition case.”The Commission's investigation into alleged abuses by Intel began in 2000, after AMD filed a complaint to the Brussels regulator. The probe was almost abandoned in 2002, but gathered steam again one year ago, when the Commission requested fresh information from Intel and other market players.A spokeswoman for Intel said: “We can confirm that officials of the European Commission conducted a search of some Intel offices in Europe. It is Intel's normal practice to co-operate fully with regulatory agencies and we are doing so in this case. We believe that Intel's business practices are both fair and lawful.”She declined to reveal which offices had been raided. Intel's European headquarters are split between Swindon in the UK and Munich, Germany, and it has offices across dozens of countries in Europe.Computer manufacturers, including Dell, IBM, Toshiba and Sony, all declined to comment on whether raids had taken place at any of their offices. Hewlett Packard said its offices had not been visited by officials.Competition officials are certain to spend at least several months analysing the information gathered in Tuesday's raids.
546;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-05T20:27:53Z;Wall Street undeterred by higher oil prices;;Shares rallied in New York yesterday despite rising oil prices as retail stocks rose on better-than-expected results from Wal-Mart.Stocks stalled in early trade as investors returning to work after the Fourth of July holiday had to consider the immediate impact of oil creeping back up towards $60 a barrel after sliding from a record high set last Monday. The price of crude oil for August delivery climbed $1.20 to $59.95 a barrel on the Nymex market in the wake ofwas lifted by news of a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico that could disrupt fuel supplies.But the main stock indices recovered and at the close the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,204.99 and the Dow Jones gained 0.7 per cent at 10,371.80. The Nasdaq climbed 1 per cent to 2,078.75.With earnings season fast approaching, there was some good news from Wal-Mart. The group said on Saturday that it estimated June sales rose a better-than-expected 4.5 per cent at its US stores open at least a year, which could mark its biggest monthly gain in 13 months. Wal-Mart rose 3.2 per cent to $49.80. The S&P food and staples retail index gained 2.4 per cent.Gordon B Fowler Jr, chief investment officer at the Glenmede Trust Company, said despite some concerns that the forthcoming earnings announcements would underwhelm investors, there was enough good news to keep the market happy.“There is a tremendous spread between earnings yields and bond yields. People are looking at the bond yields and the competitive rate of return that stocks offer and are concluding that there is something attractive about equities at this point.”There was mixed news from the technology sector. Apple Computer climbed 4.1 per cent to $37.98 after JP Morgan lifted its third-quarter earnings forecast on the company.Boston Scientific continued to gain ground. The group rose more than 10 per cent in extended trading hours on Friday after a Federal jury in Delaware found that Johnson & Johnson had infringed two of Boston Scientific’s patents on drug-coated stents. Johnson & Johnson fell slightly, while Boston Scientific rose 6.4 per cent, taking it to $28.60.Shares in Advanced Micro Devices gained 3.4 per cent to $18.04 following a report in Barron’s that suggested the chipmaker could see its share price soar if it wins its battle with rival Intel, which gained 1.8 cent to $26.68.Alvarion was the Nasdaq’s biggest loser, falling 22.5 per cent to $8.88, after the Israeli broadband wireless issued an earnings warning.KB Home, one of this year’s star performers on the stock market, fell 1 per cent to $75.00 after Credit Suisse First Boston reduced the homebuilder from “neutral” to “underperform”. CSFB said the company was highly exposed to the potential bubble markets of Las Vegas, Phoenix and parts of California.It had similar things to say about homebuilder MDC Holdings, which fell 0.9 per cent to $80.75.
547;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-07-01T20:57:06Z;Wall Street ends half on a positive note;;Wall Street concluded a modestly positive quarter with gains this week, as traders took an optimistic view despite a further increase in interest rates that at first caused concern.A sharp decline in crude oil futures helped the indices finish the week higher, alongside the view that the US, the world’s largest economy, might be able to grow despite the central bank’s commitment to tightening borrowing costs.By Friday’s close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent up at 10,303.44 while the broader S&P 500 index gained 0.3 per cent to 1,194.44. The Nasdaq was virtually unchanged to 2,057.37.Over the five sessions the Dow gained 0.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.2 per cent each. The second quarter ended on an uninspiring note, with the S&P 500 registering a 0.9 per cent fall over the three months, while the narrower Dow advanced 2.2 per cent and the technology-laced Nasdaq put on 2.9 per cent.Crude prices, which were about $60 at the start of the week, fell throughout the week, removing one concern from traders’ agenda. But gains were held in check by the markets’ other chief preoccupation, the Federal Reserve and what it intends to do to monetary policy.The question had less to do with the maths than with the literature component of Thursday’s meeting of Fed policymakers.While the quarter-point increase had been expected, some market participants had hoped Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues might hint at the end of the cycle of monetary tightening. When the hint failed to materialise, bearish fears that rising borrowing costs would affect already-slowing corporate profit growth weighed on stocks.However, on Friday the market’s structural optimism, combined with what some older traders call its tendency to demonstrate the attention span of a two-year-old, came into force. A batch of positive data signalled the economy continued to grow despite recent interest rate increases, and buying ensued.Among stocks in the news this week, airline stocks rose as crude futures cooled. The Amex airline index climbed 6.3 per cent on Tuesday, lifted by Delta Air Lines’s 12.8 per cent surge, along with a 9.3 per cent jump in AMR, the parent of American Airlines, and AirTran Holdings, the parent of a low-cost carrier that added 6.1 per cent. For the week Delta was off 0.3 per cent as AMR added 0.8 per cent and AirTran gained 2.7 per cent.A high-profile legal spat in the technology sector put semiconductors in the spotlight. In a move reminiscent of battles against Microsoft last decade, Advanced Micro Devices accused its larger rival Intel of coercive tactics and forcing clients to use its own chips as opposed to AMD’s. Shares in AMD rose 6.3 per cent for the session. Intel added 1.8 per cent. On the week AMD put on 1.6 per cent as Intel added 0.4 per cent.Deal-making continued to attract attention, but bids did not have to be completed to generate excitement. The stock of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange gained 12.9 per cent to more than $300 per share amid reports the CME was pursuing its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade. For the week, CME was 15.8 per cent up.The banking sector provided most of the merger and acquisition excitement. Bank of America on Thursday said it was taking over MBNA, a credit card issuer, in a $35bn cash-and-stock deal that sent BofA’s shares 2.8 per cent lower, while MBNA’s soared 24.2 per cent, and ended the week 20.1 per cent up as BofA was 3.7 per cent lower for the same period.Executive appointments attracted attention but generated more subtle market reactions.The appointment of John Mack as Morgan Stanley’s chief executive officer and chairman led to a 1.6 per pent decline in the bank’s shares on Thursday.The appointment of James McNerney as Boeing chief executive sent its shares up 6.8 per cent on the week, while shares of 3M, whence Mr McNerney hails, fell 4.9 per cent on Thursday and were down 3.3 per cent on the week.
548;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;AMD charges Intel with coercion;;Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor maker, was on Tuesday accused by its closest microprocessor rival of a global plot to force computer makers and retailers not to buy its competitor's products.Advanced Micro Devices said it had filed an antitrust complaint in a Delaware court detailing how Intel had unlawfully maintained a monopoly and identifying 38 companies it said had been victims of coercion.The move follows a complaint by AMD to the European Commission alleging anti-competitive practices and a ruling by Japan's Fair Trade Commission earlier this year.The ruling said Intel had violated antitrust laws by offering rebates to five Japanese PC makers in exchange for limiting purchases of AMD chips.The US Federal Trade Commission has investigated Intel twice, but closed both cases. AMD has a long history of litigation against its much larger rival and, with Intel processors featuring in four out of every five PCs sold, has waged a public relations war to try to raise its profile and brand among computer buyers.The latest complaint quotes executives of computer maker Gateway claiming Intel had “beaten them into guacamole” for having limited dealings with AMD.It cites Michael Capellas, then chief executive of Compaq, telling AMD in 2000 “he had a gun to his head” when Intel withheld delivery of critical server chips because of the volume of business he had given to AMD.Tom Beermann, Intel spokesman, said the company disagreed with the complaints and believed in competing fairly.“AMD has chosen once again to complain to a court about Intel's success, with a legal case full of excuses and speculation,” he said.The case is expected to be brought before the court in 2006.AMD shares ended 6.3 per cent higher in New York on Tuesday at $17.70, while shares of its Silicon Valley rival closed 1.8 per cent higher at $26.33.
549;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-06-28T20:28:56Z;Wall Street boosted by data and lower crude;;Positive data on consumer confidence and a retreat in crude oil futures helped Wall Street stocks higher as a high-profile lawsuit put the semiconductor sector under the spotlight.Profit-taking ended the run that sent Nymex crude oil contracts above $60 on Monday. The benchmark WTI contract fell more than $1 on Tuesday as John Snow, the Treasury secretary, acknowledged that high fuel prices were hurting the world’s largest economy.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent up at 10,405.63, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.9 per cent at 1,201.57. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2 per cent at 2,069.89.An index of consumer confidence reached a three-year high. Steve Wieting, the US economist at Citigroup, said the data pointed to continued strength in consumer spending despite rising fuel prices, adding that labour market conditions also appeared to be improving.Economists fear that high crude will mean higher costs, but they are more worried about the impact it could have on consumer spending if it forces Americans to fill up their cars using money they would have otherwise spent in shops. The consumer sector accounts for about two-thirds of activity.Marc Pado, US market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, told clients that some technical market indicators pointed to oversold conditions and concluded that “with oil below $60, stocks are worth a nibble”.In a predictable market reaction to the declining oil price, airline stocks saw broad gains and some were among the top performers on the New York Stock Exchange. The Amex sector index rose 6.3 per cent as Delta Air Lines put on 12.8 per cent to $3.97. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, was 9.3 per cent higher at $12.3, while AirTran Holdings, the parent of a low-cost carrier, added 6.1 per cent to $9.47.Some energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the laggards on the NYSE as decreased oil prices appeared to be seen as a threat to their profits. Amerada Hess declined 3.8 per cent to $106.26 while Marathon Oil lost 2.9 per cent to $53.96.Advanced Micro Devices rose 6.3 per cent to $17.70 after the chipmaker said it had filed a lawsuit against its large arch-rival Intel, whose shares inched up 1.8 per cent to $26.33. The suit alleges that Intel forced clients to use its chips at the expense of AMD’s.IBM shares rose 1.9 per cent to $75.30 amid a broad rally for Dow stocks and despite news that regulators were looking into the disclosure of disappointing figures in the spring.Sun Microsystems put on 1.4 per cent to $3.74 on news it had agreed to buy SeeBeyond Technologies, a software company, for $387m. Shares in SeeBeyond jumped 30.8 per cent to $4.29.Meanwhile, shares in Apollo Group, an education company, gave up 1.4 per cent to $79.13 after the company reported a 40 per cent increase in profits, but gave a cautious earnings forecast.Also reporting earnings was Paychex, whose shares rose 10 per cent to $33.01 after the payroll processor said new clients and higher prices helped it increase profits in the last quarter.
550;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Brussels pursues Intel complaint;;AMD's move against Intel in the US comes as the European Commission is working on its own antitrust case against the world's biggest chipmaker.The Brussels antitrust regulator began investigating an AMD complaint against Intel five years ago, almost abandoning the case in 2002. Its case focuses on whether Intel abused its dominant position by offeringrebates that froze out rival chipmakers from the market.A spokesman for the Commission said on Tuesday: “We are actively pursuing our investigation into possible violations of EU competition rules by Intel, particularly as regards its policies on rebates.”The Commission is understood to be looking at similar charges to the ones that earned Intel a warning from the Japanese Fair Trade Commission earlier this year.AMD confirmed the Commission was investigating its complaint but declined to comment further, citing the ongoing probe. Last summer, the Commission requested detailed information on Intel's practices from computer manufacturers and retailers.If the regulator concludes that Intel has violatedEU competition laws, it will issue formal charges and give the group the chance to respond to its allegations.Brussels could then fine Intel up to 10 per cent of global annual turnover.
551;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-06-03T11:21:21Z;The week in technology: Joining up the cables;;Joining up the cablesTelewest and NTL look set to enter talks about a long-awaited merger to create a cable giant worth over £5.8bn that would have the scale to compete with incumbent market leaders BT in telephony and British Sky Broadcasting in digital television.Telewest has hired Rothschild to advise on merger talks and will work alongside Deutsche Bank which is advising the company on the sale of Flextech, which jointly owns UKTV with the BBC and runs other digital channels such as Living TV.Until recently, Telewest had insisted that providing content was integral to its operations. However, NTL is understood to have insisted on a firm valuation for Flextech before talks begin. Simon Duffy, NTL chief executive, does not think that cable and content businesses should be combined. So far valuations have ranged from £450m to £1bn.Dell goes upmarketDell took a step away from its traditional business as it revealed plans to launch a new brand of “premium” PCs, an area of the market that has been dominated by its rival, Apple Computer.Dell, which has built up a reputation for offering good value PCs computers, said its new range of desktop and notebook computers would target the luxury market, which wanted more powerful systems for gaming, music and watching videos. It would not admit that its move was engineered to steal market share from any specific rival but the new PCs will compete more closely with Apple’s range of Macintosh computers.The launch by Dell follows Apple’s decision to branch into the lower end of the market, with products such as the Mac mini.The new range of Dell systems will be priced between $1,200 and $3,500, The group expected that premium PCs would eventually acount for 10-20 per cent of the group’s consumer PC sales.AMD launches dual-core chipAdvanced Micro Devices announced its new dual-core, consumer-grade processor just days after arch-rival Intel launched similar products.Dual-core processors are the next big leap forward for processors, and have been eagerly awaited by hardware geeks, who have grown impatient with months of “performance stagnation”.The traditional means of improving performance have slowed as transistors – the tiny on/off gateways that make up a processor – have become so microscopic that their reliability is compromised.In contrast to Intel, AMD’s “Athlon 64 x2” will go up to the same speed as its single-core processor – that is, each core of Athlon’s dual-core processor will run at 4200 (equivalent to a 4.2GHz), whereas the top speed of Intel’s dual-core is only 3.2GHz, compared with 3.8GHz for its fastest single-core processor. AMD’s fastest offering will be more expensive, but unlike Intel’s it does not require a new motherboard.Dual-core processors are not automatically twice as fast as their single-core counterparts – their ultimate speed is dependent upon many factors such as the ability of the PC’s operating system to allocate tasks to each chip.Although it’s hardly a failure, AMD is still a minnow compared with the behemoth that is Intel, which provides the processors for about four out of every five PCs sold. The smaller company has typically fared better with users who want high performance, such as gamers, and AMD product manager, Jonathan Seckler, said the company was seeking “validation” from this market before taking the Athlon 64 x2 to the mainstream.Both Intel and AMD will be hoping that the new dual-core chips will help shore up the industry’s recent return to growth after three years of its own stagnation.Sun buys StorageTekDisappointment reigned when Sun Microsystems decided to spend some of the $7.4bn on its balance sheet onStorageTek, the storage company. Scott McNealy, co-founder and chief executive at embattled Sun, pointed to StorageTek’s annual growth rate of 3 to 4 per cent and opportunities for cross-selling Sun’s own hardware and software, but the market focused on the opportunity cost of investing in storage, rather than faster-growing industries such as software.Sun has struggled to make any profit in recent quarters as demand for its servers, which were considered essential in the dotcom era, has continued to fall. By contrast StorageTek, a Colorado-based leading supplier of tape storage and automated tape back-up products, has margins in the high single digits. Analysts agree that Sun’s $4.1bn acquisition will leave it faster growing and more profitable than before, but Sun was punished for not making a more lucrative purchase, with its share price falling 14c to $3.76 on the day of the announcement.
552;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-05-30T20:58:45Z;AMD in dual-core processor move;;Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday launched its first processors operating with “two brains” for desktop PCs, five days after its bigger rival Intel unveiled its own dual-core line-up.The two leading processor makers have been in fierce competition over the past year to be first to market with next-generation models that offer 64-bit rather than 32-bit architectures and two cores instead of one.The battle is now moving from enterprise servers to consumer PCs and the rivals' strategies differ. The cheapest AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processor is more than twice the price of Intel's base model. But it is more powerful and, unlike Intel's offering, it can plug straight into existing motherboards rather than requiring a new one.Intel's dual-core processors start at $241 for one running at a speed of 2.8GHz to $530 for a 3.2GHz processor. AMD's 4200 processor runs at the equivalent of 4.2GHz, according to the company, and costs $531, rising to the 4800, costing $1,001.Analysts say Intel has priced its products to appeal to mainstream users, and major PC makers such as HP and Dell are introducing them in systems. AMD has priced and powered its processors to appeal to power users including gamers, a smaller niche. “We want to get validation in the marketplace with the early adopters and then we'll bring it into the mainstream,” says Jonathan Seckler, product manager.Intel's processors are in four out of five PCs sold. It has adopted a platformisation strategy that will see its dual-core versions bundled with chipsets that offer improved multimedia capabilities, such as high-definition television and surround sound for Windows Media Center PCs.
553;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-05-03T17:29:54Z;Software serves up real savings;;How do you divide one computer into 10? Or change one computer into another? Or take a bunch of computers, slice and dice them all kinds of ways and then put them back together?The problem is not one troubling the Magic Circle, but it is being solved in data centres and enterprises by IT managers wanting to use resources more efficiently. They are using a technique known as server virtualisation. This hardware emulation has become a hot topic in the Intel dominated world of computers based on x86 processors, mainly because of two companies, VMware and XenSource, and advances in processor technology recently announced by Intel and its rival Advanced Micro Devices.“Until we came along, most of our customers had been putting just one application on each of their servers in the data centre,” says Raghu Raghuram, senior director of strategy at VMware. “That would cost them $5,000 for the server and $7,000 to install it, but only 10 per cent of it was being used.”Single application servers are common because they give convenience and security - they can be easily backed up and swapped and the risk of one application crashing another on the same operating system (OS) is removed. But their power consumption and the space they occupy is costly.“For every box you don’t buy, you also save the software cost that comes with it, power and cooling costs, real estate space and configuration and deployment costs,” says Simon Crosby, vice president of strategy at XenSource. “One large enterprise we are working with has estimated $100m in savings over five years.”At the centre of the technology is a hypervisor - a term coined by IBM, which introduced virtualisation in mainframe computers many years ago. The hypervisor is a layer of software that runs on the server and achieves the sleight of hand that makes it appear as a number of machines able to run multiple operating systems.This allows several applications to be run securely on the same server, without the risk of them interfering with one another and serving to increase dramatically the utilisation of the machine.VMware’s hypervisor made its debut on workstations, where developers needed to test how applications performed on different platforms. The testing role represents significant sales for the company but its revenues more than doubled last year as it capitalised on demand in the server space.“We saw this was going to solve an awful lot of problems in terms of security and wastage,” says Diane Greene, VMware’s co-founder and president. “We have created a permanent new category of software.”The company’s seven years’ experience in virtualisation has given it a significant lead in the x86 world, but XenSource, an open-source alternative, has been gaining a lot of backing in recent months.XenSource grew out of a project at Cambridge University in the mid-1990s that was exploring guaranteed resources within an operating system. With its 2.0 release last October, Xen proved its performance against other open source virtualisation efforts and has received support from IBM, Intel, AMD and Sun among others. “Xen is tiny, its code is 40,000 lines thin and it goes like heck. It can offer 10 times the performance benefit over VMware and 1,000 times in some cases,” says Mr Crosby.Xen does not contain device drivers that can jeopardise reliability and it calls its technology “paravirtualisation”, which requires tweaks to the operating system using it.The need for modifications puts it at a disadvantage to VMware’s more sophisticated product when competing for adoption by large enterprises.Other competitors include Swsoft, whose Virtuozzo product virtualises the operating system to create multiple instances, and Microsoft’s Virtual Server.But perhaps the biggest threat to Vmware and XenSource’s products comes from hardware manufacturers Intel and AMD. Intel is hard-coding virtualisation technology codenamed Vanderpool into its processors from around 2007 and AMD has similar plans for its Pacifica virtualisation development. Both VMware and XenSource welcomed the moves, saying it will increase the performance of their own products.But analysts say it strikes at the core of their businesses through the commoditisation of the technology: “Xen will become part of the Linux [operating system] kernel over time and with all this slicing and dicing becoming a feature of the processor, the VMwares of this world will increasingly have to move up to providing command and control features for these virtual machines,” says Gordon Haff, analyst at Illuminata.This is already happening as the two conjure up their next tricks. VMware has introduced “virtual infrastructure management services” - tools to create and reconfigure pools of servers to run different applications, move them around and provide back-up and disaster recovery. XenSource says it has perfected taking an operating system running on one machine and moving it onto another without any perceptible interruption, all within 50 milliseconds - a good deal less time than it takes to say “Hey Presto!”
554;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-04-27T03:44:12Z;Infineon, STMicro swing to loss on restructuring;;Europe’s two largest chipmakers, Germany’s Infineon and Franco-Italian STMicroelectronics, announced on Tuesday they became loss-making businesses in the last quarter as they restructured their operations to become more competitive.Infineon issued a gloomy outlook for the next three months as it delivered a worse-than-expected loss for the second quarter. STMicro predicted sales growth of minus 1 per cent to 7 per cent after it announced a net loss of 3 cents a share compared with analyst forecasts of a profit of 2.5 cents.The poor figures underscored a divergence in the chip sector, which has suffered a downturn over the past three quarters. Intel and Texas Instruments of the US both posted strong results last week. But earlier this month, Advanced Micro Devices was hit by weakness at its flash memory arm. STMicro said on Tuesday it was also suffering from strong pricing pressure in the memory chip market.“In the sector as a whole it looks like a mixed picture,” said Gunther Hollfelder, analyst at HVB. Referring to the strong results by the large US chipmakers and some smaller companies, he added: “This gives us some confidence that the bottom of the cycle will be reached in the first half.”Infineon made a net loss of E114m in its second quarter compared with a profit of E142m in the first, as it was burdened by a E74m charge for restructuring its wireless communications unit.It said it saw “no major improvement” in demand in the third quarter but hoped to earn a profit before interest and tax. The chipmaker also refused to comment on when the communications unit, which makes mobile phone chips, would return to profit. The division made an operating loss of E142m in the quarter as demand slowed across the mobile phone industry but in particular from Siemens, which is one of its biggest customers.Its other segments also suffered from a weakening performance with D-Ram memory chips, which generate about 40 per cent of group sales, seeing a fall in operating profit from E196m to E17m quarter-on-quarter.Wolfgang Ziebart, chief executive, said he would increase efforts to slash costs and shut loss-making businesses.His words were echoed by Carlo Bozotti, chief executive of STMicro. “ST is sharply focused on on improving the competitiveness of the company,” he said.This would mean fresh steps to streamline its cost structure including the closure of several non-manufacturing sites, he added.STMicro incurred $78m in impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs in its first quarter, compared to $33m a year earlier.Sales of $2.08bn were down 10.5 per cent on the previous quarter but up 2.6 per cent compared to a year earlier. The net loss was $31m compared to a profit of $77m a year earlier.
555;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-04-21T21:26:10Z;AMD launches ‘dual core’ chips;;Advanced Micro Devices, the US-based chipmaker, launched a family of 'dual core' 64-bit computer chips in New York on Thursday that combine two x86-style microprocessors on a single piece of silicon.The move comes on second anniversary of AMD's introduction of its 64-bit Optoron processor and a few days after Intel, AMD's arch rival, made a similar dual core announcement.It marks the start of a significant shift in the basic architecture of computing devices. Hector Ruiz, AMD's chief executive, believes that dual-core chips will gradually replace single microprocessors over the next few years. He predicts that within two years, over half the processors that AMD ships will be duel-core devices.The new AMD chips were designed from the ground up to use less power and generate less heat than their Intel counterparts and deliver up to a 90 per cent performance improvement over single-core AMD Opteron chips.They are likely to appear initially in high performance computer servers made by Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and IBM and found in corporate data centers, but are expected to find their way into desktop machines and notebook PC quite quickly.
556;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-04-19T22:48:50Z;Intel to increase capital spending;;Intel plans to increase capital spending this year after a first quarter in which the world's largest chipmaker comfortably beat revenue and earnings forecasts.The California-based company now plans to spend $5.4bn-$5.8bn on new chipmaking facilities in 2005 a 10 per cent increase over earlier plans.Craig Barrett, chief executive, said sales of mobile chips, used in notebook computers and mobile phones, hit a new record in the three months to March. Revenue for the quarter was $9.4bn, an increase of 17 per cent.Net income was $2.2bn, up 25 per cent. Earnings per share were 34 cents, 3 cents above Wall Street expectations and 31 per cent higher than last year.Gross profit margin was 59.3 per cent, compared with guidance of up to 58 per cent.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, said margins were boosted by sales of inventory that had previously been written down and high capacity utilisation in Intel's chip fabrication plants.?Our factories producing microprocessors and chipsets were full,? he added.Intel expects to achieve a gross margin for the full year of about 59 per cent, one point higher than its earlier forecasts. However, Mr Bryant warned that margins would decline sequentially.Gross margin for the current quarter is expected to be about 56 per cent, due to a combination of lower revenue and costs associated with launching new products. Second quarter revenue will be $8.6bn-$9.2bn.Even so, investors reacted with relief to the earnings announcement in a nervous period for technology stocks. Intel stock gained 70 cents to $23.33 immediately following the announcement, which came after the close of regular trading in New York.Mr Barrett confirmed that Intel was on target to introduce this year its first chips built using the latest 65 nanometre manufacturing process. Intel hopes the move to 65nm will allow it to build more powerful chips than can be achieved using current 90nm technology.Intel is also introducing new chip designs it hopes will give it an edge over rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, IBM and Sun Microsystems.The company this week introduced its first ?dual core? microprocessor for personal computers.AMD is also launching dual core processors, designed to deliver improved performance for certain kinds of computing applications.
557;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Chip sector relief at TI earnings;;Texas Instruments, the largest supplier of silicon chips for mobile phones, soothed frayed nerves across the technology sector by meeting earnings targets and issuing better than expected guidance for the current quarter.Shares in the Dallas-based company gained $1.25 to $24.17 following the announcement, which came after the close of regular trading in New York.TI increased net profit by 12 per cent to $411m in the three months to March. Earnings per share were 14 per cent higher at 24 cents, up from 21 cents.?The market environment is improving,? said Rich Templeton, chief executive.Technology stocks fell sharply last week following disappointing earnings announcements from IBM, Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices. However, TI said demand for its products had improved during March and were contining at that pace.Although revenue was barely changed at $2.97bn, earnings were boosted by higher capacity utilisation at TI's chipmaking plants, lower administrative costs and the company's active share buyback programme.Almost $1.5bn was invested in the quarter to buy back 58m shares. A further $1.5bn remains available for investment.TI expects revenues in the current quarter to be $3bn-$3.24bn, with earnings of 25-29 cents. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of around 26 cents.The figures do not include any impact from the expensing of employee stock options, which will be required from next year by US securities regulators. TI plans to begin expensing options from the third quarter of this year, it said.TI last month scaled-back its outlook for the first and second quarters because of weaker than expected demand for big-screen televisions and projectors powered by its proprietary 'digital light processing' (DLP) chips. DLP revenue declined by 25 per cent as equipment manufacturers agressively cut inventory.Although the impact will continue to be felt in the current quarter, the rate of inventory reduction is expected to be less pronounced raising hopes that the DLP business will return to growth. DLP-powered televisions took 18 per cent of the US big screen TV market in December and January, TI said.Revenues from wireless chips used in both mobile phone handsets and wireless infrastructure equipment grew by 15 per cent as increased sales of 3G chips more than offset the expected decline on older, 2G technology.
558;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-04-14T20:47:17Z;Market Overview: Equities ease on US concerns;;World equity markets fell on Thursday, dragged down by deepening concerns over the outlook for the US economy and corporate earnings.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average touched a fresh intra-day low for the year as a mixed start to the earnings season for US corporates added to worries over by poor retail sales data on Wednesday.The market has seen some relief this week from two recent negatives overhanging equity valuations – high oil prices and rising treasury yields. Both oil prices and bond yields have fallen. Oil briefly fell below the $50 mark yesterday for the first time in seven weeks.But these concerns have been replaced by worries over the US economy and consumer demand.After Harley-Davidson disappointed the market by cutting its profit targets for the year on Wednesday, it was the turn of Apple to slide after its revenue growth failed to meet expectations. The Apple setback and an unexpected first-quarter loss from Advanced Micro Devices offset strong results from the likes of Pepsi-Co and Southwest Airlines.World markets were also weighed down by weakness in mining and energy stocks following the fall in metal and crude oil prices this week. By the close of trade, the Dow was down 1.2 per cent, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4 per cent.European shares were dragged lower by the Wall Street performance despite gains for most of the day on continental exchanges. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 0.2 per cent. Asian shares also fell. The Nikkei 225 index closed 0.6 per cent lower at 11,563.17, its lowest level since February 24.The dollar rose despite recent poor economic news. There were rumours that big investors, including Warren Buffett, were buying back the dollar after taking large positions against it.Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, said there was potential for the US economy to hit another “soft patch” in coming months amid high oil prices and increases in interest rates.“Rapidly rising commodity prices can be seen along with house prices as a sign of excess liquidity in global markets. An excess that the Fed will gradually drain from the system in coming months,” he said. “This means that we could see the combination of higher Fed funds alongside lower commodity prices later in the year. Markets would have to balance the implications of higher interest rates against the benefits of lower energy and raw material costs.”
559;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-04-13T22:48:15Z;AMD plans to spin off flash memory arm;;Advanced Micro Devices, the PC processor and memory chip maker, on Wednesday announced it was spinning off its Spansion flash memory business as its first quarter earnings took another big hit from the loss-making business.Spansion, a 12 year-old joint venture with Fujitsu of Japan that makes memory chips for mobile phones and other devices, announced an initial public offering in New York expected to raise as much as $600m.AMD said sales of $447m for the memory group in the first quarter were down 29 per cent on a year earlier and 11 per cent compared to the fourth quarter. Operating losses nearly tripled from the fourth quarter's $39m to $110m.?The NOR Flash memory market continued to experience industry-wide oversupply and strong pricing pressure,? said Robert Rivet, chief financial officer. ?We experienced a rise in unit shipments, but our average selling price declined significantly, resulting in weaker than expected sales.?AMD's bigger rival Intel has made dramatic gains in market share with an aggressive pricing strategy for NOR flash. AMD has been under pressure from analysts and investors to act decisively to prevent Spansion becoming a permanent drag on its profitable processor division and overall earnings. Memory chips have accounted for around 40 per cent of AMD's revenues.AMD said the microprocessor business had delivered record sales in what was typically a down quarter seasonally. Sales of AMD Opteron and Athlon 64 processors were double that of a year ago and processor sales overall gained 31 per cent to $750m.The company said the growth was driven by record sales for chips in servers and mobile devices and, geographically, by strong penetration of Greater China.But AMD's net loss of $17m or four cents per share missed analyst forecasts of earnings of two cents. A year earlier, it recorded a net profit of $45.1m or 12 cents a share. Overall sales were $1.227bn and the operating loss was $46m.Nevertheless, shares rose 4 per cent in after-hours trading on news of the IPO.In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Spansion said it would be taking on AMD's salesforce for its products and reducing Fujitsu's distribution margin.Spansion had sales of $2.3bn last year. Proceeds from the IPO would be used for working capital and capital expenditure, it said. Citigroup and Credit Suisse First Boston are joint book runners on the Nasdaq placing.AMD said it expected processor sales to be flat or down slightly in the seasonally quieter second quarter. It declined to provide guidance for the flash memory business.
560;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-03-23T08:20:23Z;Chris Nuttall: Slugging it out to be the processor inside;;I have just bought a new computer from Hewlett-Packard.It had Intel inside, but it could equally have been an AMD processor, like the one that came with the previous computer I bought. After all, is there any difference in performance in processors per gigahertz to the naked eye?I also went to the Intel Developer Forum this month. Intel was inside the Moscone Center in San Francisco and AMD was outside. Again, there was no difference in performance.Inside, Intel had a panel on virtualisation technologies hosted by a Gartner analyst.Outside, AMD held a rival panel on virtualisation technologies, hosted by the same Gartner analyst.Craig Barrett gave his last big keynote speech at IDF as Intel’s chief - he steps down in May.But AMD was waiting with a stretched limo outside straight afterwards to ferry journalists to a briefing on its big announcements at CeBIT, the IT trade show in Hanover which ran from March 10 to 16.Pluckily and painfully predictably, AMD is always trying to gatecrash its bigger rival’s party.At previous IDFs, it has tried simple stunts such as setting up coffee carts with its logo outside the Moscone and serving free cups of Java. This year, it got more serious.Five aircraft buzzed the Moscone and tried to write AMD Turion 64 in the sky. The wind blew the smoke away before they could even complete the celestial branding exercise.But a curious thing happened, as I thought I saw the smoke reforming into some different names - was it Centrino or CenTurion? Pentium or Athlon or Pentathlon?Funny how the products of INTegrated ELectronics and Advanced Micro Devices sound like prefixes and suffixes sometimes.Their battle is a global one. Intel has been keeping AMD outside in Japan, we learned this month.The Fair Trade Commission there said Intel’s Japanese subsidiary had been anti-competitive in offering lower prices to five OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) if they stopped or reduced purchases from AMD. Intel has said it might challenge the ruling as it has worldwide implications.Intel’s chips are in four out of five PCs sold round the world, but AMD’s market share in Japan rose from 17 per cent to 22 per cent between 2000 and 2002.After putting the squeeze on OEMs, Intel’s share increased to 89 per cent in 2003, according to the commission.The week after IDF, Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee were both inside the Game Developers Conference at the Moscone Center, resolving to have a battle over their claimed superiority for gamers.AMD was showing off with demos of 64-bit games running on its processors, Intel was demonstrating a game running faster on one of its dual-core processors.But it didn’t do either any good, as a monstrous crow called IBM was already inside everything else.Nintendo’s president announced an IBM processor would power its next-generation Revolution console. Microsoft has already settled on a multi-core IBM chip for its next Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation3 will be taking advantage of IBM’s revolutionary Cell processor, whose nine cores put Intel and AMD’s dual-core processors in the shade somewhat.Intel and AMD were thus confined to their regular territory of performance-obsessed PC gamers, but determining which should be inside is becoming unfamiliar ground now the speed benchmarks formerly used to judge them are falling away.Processor speeds are currently topping out at 3.8Ghz - Intel has been encountering problems with heat generation, the higher it goes with speed. What’s more, gamers are more likely to appreciate the speed of the Nvidia or ATI graphics processor (GPU) inside than the CPU as they watch their environments being rendered.So, instead of being judged on their Roadrunner speeds, Intel and AMD these days ask to be valued more for their multifarious Wile E. Coyote methods of getting performance improvements.These include 64-bit, hyperthreading, dual core, virtualisation, cache and input/output improvements, as well as the added chipsets that create the platformised processors Intel claims are its future.They represent both innovation and obfuscation - the different combinations of features make it ever harder to judge who is coming out on top.And as demand for processors in mobile phones and consumer electronics grows, the battle for the PC motherboard seems more of a sideshow than the main event these days.But if you’re thinking of buying a computer, help may finally be at hand if you feel totally confused by now by the relative merits of processors.ECS, the Taiwanese motherboard maker, unveiled a card at CeBIT that allows AMD and Intel chips to sit on the same platform. Unhappy with your Intel processor, just add an ECS daughter card to the motherboard and plug your AMD processor in instead.So, in future, that racket inside your computer won’t be the fan whirring away, it will be Intel and AMD - both inside - fighting over the jumper switches.
561;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-02-23T21:28:00Z;Wall St higher as inflation concerns ease;;Wall Street regained ground on Wednesday in the wake of Tuesday’s stormy session, as investors welcomed data showing that consumer prices rose less than expected in January.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 10,673.79, and the S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,190.80. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,031.25.The rally came as welcome relief to shell-shocked investors, who were left reeling on Tuesday after a sharp fall in the dollar and a spike in oil prices led the Dow and the S&P 500 to their biggest single-day fall in months.Concerns about mounting inflation and the sustain-ability of the US trade deficit have cast a shadow on trading in recent weeks. But investors received a respite on Wednesday after official US data showed that consumer prices rose less than expected in January.François Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Steans, said in a research report that rising prices could be a sign of a return to a pattern of higher inflation after years of lower price increases.“While we believe it is still early to say whether we have reached a secular turning point, we feel compelled to point out that a return of inflation cannot be assumed to be favourable for equities,” he said.Technology stocks were the focus of early attention in an otherwise quiet day for corporate news.Semiconductors led decliners on the S&P 500. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip company, shed 1.9 per cent to $23.31. Its chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 2.4 per cent to $16.60.Texas Instruments, the pocket calculator and microchip maker, slipped 0.4 per cent to $25.47. Motorola , the mobile handset maker, fell 0.9 per cent to $15.42 after it restated fourth-quarter earnings.Healthcare stocks were also in the spotlight after Medco Health Solutions, the pharmacy benefits manager, announced a $2.2bn deal to buy Accredo Health, the drug store services provider. The news sent Accredo shares soaring almost 40 per cent to $42.11. Medco shares slipped 0.7 per cent to $43.14.Elsewhere, Lowe’s, the hardware chain, rose 0.6 per cent to $57.90 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings up 27 per cent.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods giant that last month announced a $57bn deal to buy Gillette, a rival, was one of the biggest gainers on the Dow. Shares in P&G rose 2.4 per cent to $53.49 following an analyst upgrade. Gillette shares rose 2 per cent to $50.75.Goodyear, the tyremaker, was one of the day’s biggest gainers. Its shares rose 6.7 per cent to $14 after it said it expected to make a profit in the fourth quarter.Shares in food processors were lower after Archer Daniels Midland said it would not raise corn syrup prices this year - a signal that food processors are likely to continue to struggle against stiff competition and a lack of pricing power this year. ADM shares, which were also hit by an analyst downgrade, dropped 7.3 per cent. Shares in ConAgra, a rival, fell 3.2 per cent to $26.62. Bunge, the second-biggest US food processor, rose 0.6 per cent to $51.16.
562;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-01-17T22:46:05Z;Flash could keep AMD in shadow;;Apple's announcement of a $499 Mac mini computer last week attracted considerably more publicity than Advanced Micro Devices garnered when it launched a similar sized PC, costing just $185, last November.But AMD is accustomed to living in the shadow of better known rivals and used this to good effect last Monday, putting out a profit warning knowing it would be eclipsed by the fourth-quarter results of its bigger Silicon Valley neighbour, Intel, a few hours later.AMD reports its fourth-quarter numbers today and, as it warned, operating profits will be down significantly from the $68.4m recorded in the third quarter. AMD blamed ?a competitive and challenging Nor Flash memory market?, which would drive its Memory Group into a fourth-quarter loss.AMD, better known for its microprocessors with brands such as Athlon and Opteron, ranks second globally to Intel, whose processors still dominate featuring in four out of every five PCs. However, AMD is credited with stealing a march on Intel by moving from 32-bit to 64-bit processing for desktop computers. And until recently it boasted beating Intel with world leadership in Nor Flash the memory commonly used in mobile phones.But there has been a dramatic reversal. Intel cut the prices of its Nor flash products and moved into the top position in the third quarter of 2004, commanding a 26.9 per cent market share according to iSuppli, which researches the electronics supply chain.In contrast, Spansion AMD's joint flash venture with Fujitsu saw market share fall from nearly 27 per cent to 22.6 per cent as sales shrank from $673m to $538m.?I expect Spansion's revenues to show about an 8 to 10 per cent decrease in the fourth quarter,? says Nam Hyung Kim, iSuppli semiconductor analyst.This is serious for a company that has depended on about half its revenues coming from its Memory Group and explains the 26 per cent fall in AMD's share price the day after its warning. By contrast, Nor flash is responsible for about 7 per cent of Intel's revenues, which means engaging in a price war is far less damaging.?AMD is relying on a more volatile memory business and has more exposure than Intel. We also predict that the Nor Flash market will have been overtaken by the Nand Flash market by 2007,? says Nan Kim.Nand Flash is a lower-cost, higher-density chip used typically for memory cards in digital cameras. Now that digital cameras are converging with mobile phones, Nand is invading that space and Samsung, which has about a 50 per cent share of the market, seems poised to be the biggest beneficiary.AMD's response has been to improve its technology and manufacturing processes. ?We are all about bringing value to our operators, we want to move away from being a commodity,? says Bertrand Cambou, Spansion chief executive.AMD's newest technology is Ornand, a combination of Nor and Nand, adding Nor's higher reliability and fast reading of data for mobile operating systems to Nand's high capacity and low cost.?We see Nor prevailing in mobile phones and we expect Ornand will be a disruptive technology combining the benefits of Nor with the cost competitiveness of Nand,? says Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive.Analysts say it is too early to tell what impact Ornand might have. ?That's not a near-term product, it will be more like 2006 or 2007 before we see any effects,? says Nan Kim.AMD's strategy with its mini-PC the Personal Internet Communicator or PIC also seems a long game designed to improve awareness of its brand in emerging markets that are being exploited by Intel. The PIC was launched first in India, Mexico and the Caribbean, with Russia and China to follow.In the short term, AMD will rely on its processor division to stay competitive. This month, it unveiled its Turion chips to challenge the success of Intel's Centrino platform in mobile computers.But it faces an uphill struggle, says Allan Mishan, semiconductor analyst at CIBC World Markets. ?You are still going to have Intel out there supplying corporate customers and consumers and exploiting emerging markets. It's Intel that controls the platform.?

Factory output rose 0.8 per cent in December and a total of 4.1 per cent in 2004, the biggest annual rise in four years.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 10,558.44. The S&P500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,184.52 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2087.91.Yesterday’s run capped a week of volatile trading that saw the leading US indices give ground, adding to frustration at last week’s declines.The Dow lost 0.4 per cent on the week, the S&P500 fell 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq was down fractionally over the five-session period.Profit-taking, inflation fears and a mixed start to the earnings season have confounded hopes of a bounce in share prices to kick off the year, after a traditional year-end rally eluded investors in the final trading sessions of 2004.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said sentiment on Wall Street was being driven by disappointment with a relatively small number of early earnings reports.“Of the five major companies that have reported so far, three or four of them have been disappointing. Within the next two weeks we are going to get a much larger sample, and I think it’s going to be more positive,” he said.The fourth-quarter earnings season got off to a stumbling start after the closing bell on Monday when Alcoa, the world’s biggest aluminium producer, said rising energy costs and the weaker dollar had led to a fall in profits.Shares in Alcoa, the first blue-chip company to report its fourth-quarter figures this year, fell 2.5 per cent to $29.90 for the week after a 2.7 per cent fall on Tuesday.Semiconductors suffered a tumultuous week after Advanced Micro Devices spooked the sector with a sales warning on Tuesday. Its shares fell more than 26 per cent on Tuesday and ended the week down 31 per cent at $15.16.Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, provided some relief on Wednesday after its earnings came in slightly ahead of estimates. Intel shares rose 1 per cent during the week to $23.02.Surging profits failed to boost shares in Genentech, the biotechnology group, after it reported falling sales of a key cancer drug after Monday’s closing bell. Genentech shares closed down more than 8 per cent for the week at $50.10 after a 7 per cent fall on Tuesday.Investors cheered a four-fold increase in quarterly profits at Apple, sending shares soaring on Thursday. Apple shares shot briefly past their all-time closing high before pulling back to end up 6.6 per cent. The shares were up just 1.3 per cent on the week, however, after profit-takers pushed shares more than 6 per cent lower on Tuesday. They touched a high of $72.09 in March 2000.Rising oil prices weighed on durable goods and automakers. Maytag, the appliance maker, ended the week down 2 per cent to $18.71 after crude futures broke back through the $48 per barrel mark.General Motors, the carmaker, fell 4.7 per cent to $37.13 last week after it lowered its 2005 earnings guidance on Thursday. Ford, GM’s chief rival among the big three US carmakers, fell 3.8 per cent to $14.08.Relief came on Friday as investors welcomed new data showing that producer prices fell slightly in December. The producer prices index fell 0.7 per cent last month, its biggest drop in 18 months.Boeing ended the week up 1 per cent after it said cancellation of its 717 jet line would result in a charge against fourth-quarter earnings.News that Hewlett-Packard, the computer group, plans to merge its printer and personal computer units was not enough to keep shares from sliding 3.6 per cent this week. Shares bounced 0.6 per cent on Friday to end the week at $20.07.
564;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-01-14T12:16:20Z;The week in technology: Chips are down...again!;;Chips are down...again!It was a gloomy week for the semiconductor sector after some of its leading lights gave a downbeat assessment of the Christmas quarter.But in a sign that in difficult times the strong get stronger, Intel, the world’s biggest manufacturer of chips, bucked the trend.STMicroelectronics, Europe’s biggest chipmaker, was the first off the block to issue a profit warning, rapidly followed by Advanced Micro Devices in the US and later Germany’s Infineon and China’s SMIC.The European duo both sought to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the declining dollar, while making some noises about higher-than-expected inventories and pricing competition.Shares of both companies slid on the news, although Infineon’s rebounded after some analysts said that despite the company’s warning its figures fell within their forecasts.On the other side of the pond, AMD shares lost 26 per cent in a day after it admitted to a damaging price war with Intel in the memory chip market.AMD, which has been credited with outmanoeuvering Intel in its processor business, appears to have suffered from its bigger rival’s aggressive bid to grab market share by cutting prices in the flash memory field.Meanwhile, SMIC, China’s top producer of made-to-order microchips, slashed its 2005 output targets by up to a quarter and said it would spend less than intended this year, in its first real taste of a sector downturn.The chip industry as a whole is experiencing a cyclical downturn that most analysts expect to be shallower than previous ones. But competition in certain sectors such as flash memory has become fierce.However, Intel eclipsed its rivals, announcing record quarterly and annual sales, boosted by record shipments of enterprise and mobile processors.But it also cautioned of a slowdown as personal computer and mobile phone makers clear inventories.Apple enjoys fruits of iPodApple was dancing to the sound of its own music this week after revealing an impressive 4.6m iPod sales over the festive season.The iPod frenzy helped Apple more than quadruple first-quarter earnings. Net income soared from $63m to $295m in the first three months as tech savvy shoppers rushed to get their hands on the must-have music gadgetThe news ended a week under the spotlight for Apple, which also unveiled its eagerly awaited new products at its annual Macworld trade show in California.The group tuned its sales pitch to the mass market, offering budget-conscious consumers the chance to get hold of its Mac computer and iPod in stripped-down formats.The stars of the show were Apple’s Mac mini, a no-frills desktop computer the size of a small biscuit, which will be sold without monitor, keyboard or mouse for about $499, and the iPod Shuffle, a slimmed-down music player that stores song files on flash memory instead of hard disc drives and costs between $99 and $149.Apple’s chief said the products were “priced so people thinking of switching will have no more excuses.”The “halo effect” from the unprecedented success of the iPod - sales rose 525 per cent over Christmas compared with 2003 - helped Apple also ship more than 1m Macintosh computer units during the first quarter of this year, up 26 per cent over the year earlier period.Google under the coshGoggle had its knuckles rapped by industry watchdogs for the first time since its flotation as it faced charges over breaking securities laws that threatened to disrupt its IPO last August.The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into an unfortunately timed interview with the entrepreneurial founders of the search engine, which was published in Playboy days before the group was due to come to market.Another enquiry was also triggered by claims that Google failed to publish required financial results in 2003.Both charges overshadowed the group’s float, which had already sparked controversy due to its unusual auction structure.But the search engine walked away from the investigations relatively unscathed - no action was taken by the SEC relating to the interview and the financial results inquiry was settled by Google’s pledge to “cease and desist” from overlooking such regulations in the future.
565;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Epcos shares tumble after warning;;Shares in Epcos opened 7.7 percent lower on Friday after the German electronics components maker said that it may miss its target of raising sales and earnings in 2005.The shares traded down 6.3 percent at 10.20 euros by 0809 GMT, making Epcos the biggest loser of Germany’s high-tech index TecDAX of which it is a constituent. The DJ Stoxx European technology index was up 0.1 percent.Epcos said late on Thursday that sales in the first quarter of its fiscal year to September 2005 were around 285 million euros ($377 million), less than forecast and well below the 344 million euros booked in the previous quarter.“The risk that Epcos may not reach its goals for fiscal 2005 as a whole, i.e. improvement of sales and earnings against the previous year, is increasing,” it said.The warning follows a string of gloomy statements from semiconductor makers in Europe, the United States and Asia that have stoked fears of a slowdown in the chip sector, which only recently emerged from one of the worst slumps in its history.Chipmakers Infineon – Epcos’s former sister firm –, Franco-Italian STMicroelectronics and U.S. peer Advanced Micro Devices all have said they would miss their targets for the December quarter.Epcos components are used to store electrical energy and regulate voltage in products ranging from car electronics, mobile phones and consumer electronics to trains and power stations. Many of its customers are also major users of semiconductors.Epcos blamed inventory adjustments, which it said were taking longer than expected, and disappointing Christmas sales affecting the consumer electronics and mobile phones sectors for the poor results.It expected earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to be ”more or less break even” in the first quarter, but forecast continuing revenue weakness.
566;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-01-13T18:29:25Z;Infineon misses market expectations;;Infineon, the German semiconductor maker, cast more gloom on the European chip market, saying it had missed analysts' expectations in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 because of the dollar's weakness and rising inventories.It came on top of a warning by STMicroelectronics, the continent's leading chipmaker, this week that margins would be hit for similar reasons, as signs of the impact of the downturn in the sector begin to surface.Infineon said it expected earnings before interest and taxation (ebit) and revenues in the three months to the end of December to be “below market expectations” at about €211m ($279m) and €1.8bn, respectively, while its core memory chip business would report ebit of €196m and revenues of €766m.The chipmaker, which reports first-quarter numbers next month, blamed a drop in shipments due to an expected rise in inventories as well as the weak dollar, but it was helped by a one-off gain of €118m from a licence dispute settlement with rival ProMOS.Analysts were divided over the warning. Some said they had already factored in the dollar's weakness into their forecasts while others highlighted disappointing performance in some divisions, such as its automotive and industrial unit. Infineon's shares fell initially to their lowest point for almost two years before recovering to close up 1 per cent.“I think the top line was light but the bottom line was not as bad as that suggested,” said Ulrich Pelzer at Lehman Brothers.Günther Hollfelder at HVB took a different line: “I was surprised at the profit warning as the numbers didn't deviate much from what we had expected.”The news added to the sense of gloom in the chip sector after Advanced Micro Devices of the US also warned on profits and saw its shares fall by a fifth.AMD also added to recent bad news from Infineon including the cancellation of the sale of its lossmaking fibre-optics division toFinisar of the US meaning further restructuringand charges for theMunich-based chipmaker.Analysts forecast achallenging year forchipmakers as the strong growth of previous yearsis checked and European chipmakers face continuing currency-related problems.Separately, Infineon on Thursday sold its venture capital unit to Cipio Partners, a private equity firm. The company did not disclose financial details.
567;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-01-13T13:29:08Z;Lex: Infineon;;Most people find it hard to stop after the first few potato chips. The same, it seems, holds for profit warnings from the world's chip-makers. Infineon had already stated on Tuesday that it scrapped the sale of its fibre optics business, partly because the unit's performance had deteriorated further. It has now joined STMicroelectronics and Advanced Micro Devices in issuing a full-blown profit warning for the Christmas quarter.The profitability collapse in chips for wireless applications underlines just how painful inventory corrections and lower capacity utilisation could prove in other areas. In memory products, the jury is still out on the impact of price deflation this year, but the euro's strength will make it even harder for Infineon to keep its cost base competitive. That threat makes the recent weakness of its most reliable money-spinner, automotive and industrials, all the more worrying.Unlike many others, Infineon had previously highlighted the risks. In blaming the dollar for recent setbacks, it is also on firmer ground than STMicro, which reports in dollars. Wolfgang Ziebart, Infineon's newish boss, seems laudably committed to profits rather than revenues. As the cancelled fibre optics sale illustrates, however, his room for manoeuvre is limited. Compared with rivals, Infineon may have its charms. But with the shares trading at 18 times, still rosy, consensus earnings, viewing it as an attractive momentum play is a bit like describing low fat potato chips as wholesome food.

The S&P 500 edged up 0.4 per cent to 1,187.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent higher at 2,092.53.US stocks have struggled in recent weeks after shaky economic data and a mixed retail outlook dashed hopes of a traditional post-Christmas rally to round out 2004. Profit-taking and inflation jitters have sent the leading US indices lower in the first trading sessions of 2005.Corporate news is set to guide share price movements on Wall Street over the next few weeks as the earnings season gets into full swing. But traders were also keeping a wary eye on the US trade deficit, which swelled unexpectedly to a record $60.3bn in November.Beleaguered technology investors breathed a sigh of relief after an upbeat earnings report from Intel, the world's biggest computer chip company. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $23.16 after fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations.The results came just a day after a sales warning by Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, which pushed stocks lower across the chip sector. AMD shares, which tumbled more than 26 per cent on Tuesday, rose 1.1 per cent yesterday to $15.02.One long-time tech-industry watcher said Intel's report might portend more good news to come, which Wall Street has not yet priced into chip stocks. ""I think the whole sector's turning around, and the forecast for sales this year are too low,"" they said.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, a basket of semiconductor stocks that has fallen 10 per cent since the start of the year, rose 1.4 per cent to 401.87.Apple added 1.4 per cent to close at $65.46 a day after the computer group revealed a raft of new gadgets at its annual Macworld expo in San Francisco.Transport stocks led decliners on the S&P 500 after a profit warning by United Parcel Service. The express shipper's shares fell 7.4 per cent to $77.18 after it said that fourth-quarter profits would be lower than expected. UPS is due to announce its earnings on January 27.Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, shrugged off confirmation of a record fine by the New York Stock Exchange to close 0.2 per cent higher at $55.28. The bank agreed to a $19m settlement with the exchange for failing to provide prospectuses and other violations of rules.Office Max, the office supply chain, fell 4.7 per cent to $28.88 after the company said it would delay its earnings report until it completed an inquiry into alleged improper billing.

Eighty new notebook computers will feature the chip at launch.On Tuesday, Intel beat analysts' forecasts in predicting sales of $8.8bn-$9.4bn in its seasonally weaker first quarter. Consensus estimates were for $8.9bn in revenues.The world's biggest chip maker also said it had closed out 2004 with record quarterly and annual sales of $9.6bn and $34.2bn respectively, beating market expectations of $9.4bn and $34.01bn.Tuesday's after-the-bell news translated into Intel becoming the biggest riser on the Dow on Wednesday, up 2.7 per cent by midday, although it did little to lift other semiconductor stocks. Investors fear the effects of Intel flexing its financial muscle against rivals.Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, had lost more than a quarter of their value on Tuesday after it admitted that Intel's savage price cuts for flash memory chips had forced its memory division, responsible for about half its revenues, into an operating loss.Stocks of chip equipment makers fared better on Wednesday, boosted by Intel announcing much higher capital spending in 2005 than expected $4.9bn-$5.3bn, compared with $3.8bn in 2004.AMD has been more competitive with Intel in its processor business and last week announced a Sonoma rival the 64-bit Turion processor for laptops, which should be available in the second quarter.Analysts at ThinkEquity Partners said that mobile units had grown 50 per cent year-on-year for Intel and had reached 50 per cent of all PC sales in the US.?The majority of upside seen by Intel [in the fourth quarter] and into Q1 2005 has been due to the tremendous success of the Centrino platform.?Intel plans to continue this growth with new, expanded offerings into 2005,? the analysts said.
570;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Lex: Intel;;Intel has again demonstrated its chronic forecasting weakness. For a change, it has also topped sales and earnings expectations. After a dismal third quarter, the world's leading chipmaker achieved a slightly stronger than usual 13 per cent net revenue increase, quarter on quarter, this festive season. That means annual sales have grown by 1.5 per cent since 2000, while profits have shrunk by 29 per cent. Of course, 2000 marked a cyclical peak. But looking back to 1997 shows that profits have grown by a miserly 1.1 per cent a year, with average sales growth of 4.5 per cent.Intel has not only been unable to grow profitably outside the maturing PC segment but, if nominal world economic growth is used as the yardstick, has been unable to grow period. Not that you could tell from its valuation: Intel still costs 19 times 2005 earnings and four times sales.Any short-term strength of the shares looks like a good opportunity to close tactical positions. Pricing pressures are neither new nor likely to go away soon. In spite of its stumbles, Advanced Micro Devices remains a threat. Indeed, Intel's aggressive capital spending increase partly seems to reflect its desire to match AMD in dual core processors. Intel's plans are likely to exacerbate overcapacity. That should dampen enthusiasm among equipment makers. After all, Intel's record hardly suggests it is especially good at gauging trends in end demand.

With this risk in mind, we have downgraded Hong Kong to underweight. Not only is it most vulnerable to dollar strength, but it appears fully valued versus the region,"" ABN said.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank believes Asian central banks may raise interest rates this year at a slower pace than investors have been expecting because inflationary pressures are easing in India, China, Taiwan and other regional economies.""Core inflation has backed off in most Asian countries,"" Deutsche Bank's Michael Spencer said."

The market was further unsettled by a trading update from the Franco-Italian semiconductor group STMicroelectronics.The company’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to €13.61 after it said it expected its fourth-quarter sales growth to come in at the high end of expectations but that profit margin would fall well below its target due to a weak dollar.But JP Morgan maintained its “overweight” stance on the stock. “We believe that STM will benefit from the improvements in cellular handsets, set-top boxes and hard disc drives,” said analyst Uche Orji.Elsewhere among the European chip stocks, Infineon fell 3.1 per cent to €7.71 and ASML shed 1.8 per cent to €11.19.Meanwhile, Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, fell 2.2 per cent to €11.65 after it said it would axe hundreds of jobs as part of a drive to cut research and development spending.The company said it would take a charge in the first quarter but added that it expected significant cost savings from the move.In the software sector, Germany’s SAP fell 4.1 per cent to €127.50 after it said fourth-quarter licence sales had risen by 8 per cent from a year earlier, slightly short of expectations.Traders said there had been hopes in the market that the figures would be better than expected.Tiscali, the Italian internet service provider, fell as much 13 per cent in early trade as investors fretted about the how the company would repay a €250m euro bond due in July. But the stock recovered to end 4.2 per cent off at €2.5710 after Tiscali said its debt repayment would be covered by measures already announced and by “other possible debt instruments”.Healthcare products group Beiersdorf saw a strong early rise for its shares fade away, although the stock still ended 1.3 per cent higher at €87.54.The maker of Nivea skin cream said it expected sales and earnings to improve again in 2005 after reporting a rise in operating profits for last year, largely due to a change in accounting rules.Financial sectors had to endure a difficult trading session, with the two insurance sectors, general and life, particularly vulnerable.The latter led the FTSE Eurofirst sector losers table after Morgan Stanley told its clients to take profits in the UK life sector.Of the non-UK constituents Italy’s Mediolanum lost 2.7 per cent to €5.392 and Alleanza 1.7 per cent to €10.0500, and Dutch group Aegon fell 1.6 per cent to €10.45.In the general insurers it was the reinsurers that took a buffeting. Hannover Re shares fell 2 per cent to €28.70 in the wake of news that Deutsche Bank had cut its recommendation on the shares to “hold” from the previous “buy” stance because of the stock’s outperformance.Munich Re also took heavy punishment, sliding 2.1 per cent to €92.60. The recent bid rumours in the banks arena refused to lie down completely.HVB Group, Germany’s second-biggest bank and a long-time takeover candidate, rose a further 1.2 per cent to €17.48, as recent suggestions that Italy’s Unicredito was considering a a link up with the bank continued to attract speculators to the stock.Traders said much of the buying of HVB stock had been triggered by the positive note on the stock issued by Merrill Lynch who hoisted their recommendation to “buy” with a price target of €22.Unicredito shares moved in the opposite direction, dipping 1.5 per cent to €4.17, as part of a general retreat by the Italian banking grouping which has been the target of widespread bid rumours in recent months.Top spot in the FTSE Eurofirst 300 went to National Bank of Greece, whose shares surged 2.6 per cent to €25.36 as Merrill Lynch’s banks piece highlighted the bank’s “growth and self help” potential.Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, was undermined by news of disappointing sales of a key drug made by its US unit Genentech.

Chinese import growth, while still phenomenally rapid, eased to 24.6 per cent in the year to December, from 38.5 per cent in the year to November; export growth slipped from 45.9 per cent to 32.7 per cent over the same period.Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street research says, once the figures are seasonally adjusted, exports are holding up well but the slowdown in imports since last April is marked. This seems to be borne out by the recent falls in commodity prices and the Baltic Freight Index, which measures shipping activity.This follows the December survey by JETRO (Japan’s External Trade Organisation) which showed business sentiment for the next 2-3 months was down in every East Asian nation. And recent purchasing managers’ surveys in the region have been weak, notably in Hong Kong, where the manufacturing index dipped below 50, indicating contracting activity.If Asia is slowing, one obvious stock market casualty will be the technology sector. The disappointing statement from Advanced Micro Devices on Monday seems to have related more to competition in a particular sector - flash memory chips - than in a general downturn. But fourth quarter trading statements will be watched closely.Then there is the effect on Asian stock markets generally. Thankfully, the economic impact of the tsunami disaster should be offset by increased aid. But if Chinese demand for imports is slowing, at a time when US interest rates are rising and the eurozone economy looks sluggish, the outlook for Asian exporters could be grim.The currency markets may also be affected by the Chinese numbers. With exports growing faster than imports, December’s trade surplus was a record $11.1bn. As Capital Economics notes “It is a safe bet that the largest bilateral surplus is with the US and this has probably hit another record high too.”The Chinese seem unlikely to bow to US pressure for a renminbi revaluation. But a high trade surplus also means the Chinese will have accumulated even more dollars and will thus be faced with an even heavier commitment to the US Treasury bond market. As time goes on, that bet gets bigger and bigger."
575;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2005-01-11T13:30:23Z;Lex: STMicro;;"The chips are down. Profit warnings from STMicroelectronics and Advanced Micro Devices sent shivers through the world of semiconductors, with shares in AMD dropping by a fifth. Alongside Intel, STMicro may have been one of the beneficiaries of AMD's market share losses in flash memory chips where a price war has probably eroded profitability. STMicro has tried to play up dollar weakness. But that explains at most half of the deterioration in its gross margins, pointing to broader problems.Sector capacity use has fallen since the third quarter for the first time in two years. That might seem odd. Investors have, for a change, refused to underwrite costly expansion plans. Lehman Brothers said the global sector returned a net $700m to investors in dividends and buybacks in 2004 although that includes $4.8bn from Intel. Without Intel, the sector raised capital amounting to only about 2 per cent of global revenues, at the low end of the historic range of 1-6 per cent.

But it says a lot about the sector, where burning slightly less money than usual is regarded as evidence of capital discipline. Moreover, many buybacks are needed merely to offset dilution from employee stock options. Even excluding those costs, sector valuations remain ambitious, if past cash generation is any guide. As a result, investing in much of the sector will remain a short-term gamble and hardly a tempting one."

The Nasdaq Composite was barely changed at 2,177.01.The stock market's sputtering performance confounded bullish investors seeking to extend Tuesday's rally, which led all three main US indices to fresh multi-year highs.By the end of Wednesday's session, the Dow was down for the week while both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher, stoking investors' hopes that the stock market would regain momentum to finish the year on a high note.Joe McAlinden, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said: ""It's possible that the strength we saw starting in late October and continuing to mid-December has sapped some of the potential of this final week before the new year.""Mr McAlinden stressed, however, that market fundamentals remained solid, with a ""pretty good"" outlook for corporate earnings in early 2005.Amid a quiet week for corporate news, investor attention remained fixed on oil prices, which edged higher after car bombs exloded in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Investors also digested an update on the US crude oil and distillate stockpile.Aerospace stocks led decliners after a string of downbeat reports from the defence and commercial aircraft sectors. Lockheed Martin, the defence group, fell 2.7 per cent to $55.25 after the New York Times reported that the Pentagon planned cuts in its F/A-22 stealth fighter programme. The US air force had planned to buy 277 fighters at $258m each.Boeing, the leading US aerospace group, fell 2.2 per cent to $52.09 after the Wall Street Journal reported that China planned to suspend new aircraft purchases.Airline stocks were also lower one day after the US government announced it would open an investigation into the severe delays and cancellations that affected flights over the Christmas holiday.US Airways fell 4.7 per cent to $1.22 after it called on employees to volunteer to work without pay at the weekend. The airline was forced to cancel flights and thousands of passengers lost their luggage after large numbers of employees called in sick over Christmas.Delta Air Lines, the parent company of Comair, which stranded thousands of passengers when it cancelled all of its flights on Christmas owing to a computer glitch, fell 1.3 per cent to $7.45.Semiconductor stocks led gainers. Advanced Micro Devices was among the best-performing stocks in the sector, rising as much as 2.3 per cent before falling back to close up 1 per cent at $21.96.Intel, the chip maker, gave up early gains to close down 0.1 per cent at $23.25 after it said it would invest in three companies developing digital devices for the home.Genzyme, the biotechnology group, rose 1.1 per cent to $58.16 after US regulators approved the company's leukaemia treatment.Satellite radio stocks continued their bumpy ride, with shares in Sirius Satellite Radio down 6.7 per cent at $7.29.Shares in rival XM Satellite Radio fell 3.2 per cent to $37.63. Both companies have garnered attention in recent months as they attempt to carve a niche in the market for radios that receive music broadcast by satellite.Toys R Us rose 2.6 per cent to $20.59 after the company said it would offer executives bonuses if they chose to stay on after the company completed its restructuring programme."

CSFB said in its report.The brokerage also suggested Intel and Advanced Micro Devices faced challenges next year as they transitioned to dual-core processors, the equivalent of putting two chips in one package.?We believe dual core will require heightened execution and yield risk (more complex architecture with two cores that need to yield) increasing the chance for an operational miscue in (the second half of 2005) from product delays,? CSFB said.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,150.91.A strong rally in October and November has left shares in the leading US indices hovering near their highest levels since 2001, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching 3½-year highs last week. The strong gains that came in the wake of the US presidential election have given way this month to slower progress on Wall Street, however, leaving stocks trading mostly flat in spite of a slew of year-end merger and acquisition activity.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said an expected slowdown in corporate earnings growth seemed to be the biggest factor keeping gains in check.Earnings among companies in the S&P 500 grew by 19 per cent this year, while forecasts for next year are 10 per cent.""I would argue that stock valuations still are relatively attractive, especially given the interest rate environment,"" said Mr Hogan.Most analysts predict that the stock market will continue to creep higher until the year's end, as bullish investors look to the first post-Christmas trading sessions for signs of sustained vigour. One analyst said he expected to increased volatility in share prices this week as Wall Street gradually empties ahead of the Christmas holiday.Transport stocks led gainers on what is traditionally the busiest shipping day of the year. FedEx, the biggest express shipper, rose 0.4 per cent to $100.53, while rival UPS climbed 1 per cent to $86.48.Railroad shares rallied as Union Pacific, the country's biggest independent rail operator, raised its fourth-quarter outlook. Union Pacific shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $65.67. Shares in Norfolk Southern, the third-biggest rail operator by market capitalisation, were up 3 per cent at $36.21, while CSX, the rail freight group, rose 2 per cent to $39.82.Railroads have seen record shipping volumes this year, driven by a booming harvest in the midwest and soaring demand for US exports.Semiconductor stocks jumped as investors welcomed a report from Gartner saying that worldwide chipmaker revenue should grow by 23 per cent this year in spite of a slowdown in growth in the second half. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7 per cent to 422.48. Intel, the world's biggest microchip company, received an additional boost following a Lehman Brothers upgrade. Intel's shares rose 3.5 per cent to $23.49. Intel's chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 0.5 per cent to $21.73.Pharmaceutical stocks remained in the spotlight after clinical studies raised new questions about the safety of two popular painkillers. Pfizer rebounded after falling more than 16 per cent following Friday's news that its Celebrex arthritis drug increased the risk of heart attacks in patients. Shares in the drugs group rose 2.8 per cent to $24.97 after US health regulators said that Alzheimer's patients taking Celebrex in a separate study did not show elevated cardiac risk. Merck, whose withdrawn Vioxx painkiller uses an active ingredient similar to the one in Celebrex, rose 1.5 per cent to $31.98.The US-listed shares of Bayer, the German drugs group, rose 0.5 per cent in spite of warnings that Naproxen, the active ingredient in Bayer's Aleve painkiller, had increased the risk of heart attacks in the same Alzheimer's trials.Elsewhere, IAC InterActivecorp, the media and travel group run by Barry Diller, jumped 5.9 per cent to $27.41 after it said it would spin off its Expedia online travel service.Investors were also focused on financial stocks on Tuesday after earnings reports by two big US investment banks. Morgan Stanley, the biggest US investment bank by volume, rose 1.6 per cent to $54.50 as earnings beat expectations. Bear Stearns gave up early gains to fall 1.7 per cent to $102.70 after it reported sharply higher quarterly profits.Energy stocks were the laggards among the S&P 500, with Sunoco shares down 0.1 per cent to $82.88.

The Nasdaq Composite pulled back from an early rally, falling 0.3 per cent to 2,127.85.The three leading US indices have notched modest gains this month following a rally that began in late October and gained steam in November in the wake of the US presidential election.Last week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both touched 3½-year highs, and yesterday, Standard & Poors, the investment resarch group, said that it expects operating earnings on the S&P500 index to top $160bn in the fourth quarter - a new record. .Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said that, although he expected Wall Street to continue to gain ground through the year-end, economic growth was likely to slow in 2005 as the effects of rising interest rates take hold and prices rise to make up for the falling value of the dollar.Bullish investors focused on the short term were cheered in early trading by upbeat reports from Intel and Nokia, two bellwether tech stocks.Semiconductors rallied in early trading after analysts at JPMorgan raised their fourth-quarter earnings forecast for Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker. But investor sentiment later soured, pushing Intel shares down 0.3 per cent to $22.70 by the closing bell. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, fell 2.6 per cent to $21.84, while National Semiconductor fell 1.3 per cent to $17.40.Chipmakers have been hit this year by sagging demand that left many companies with bloated inventories and reduced pricing power. Although some investors welcomed the improved earnings forecast for Intel, one trader cautioned that chipmakers would not be out of the woods until there were clear signs of an inventory correction in 2005.Telecommunications equipment stocks were also in the spotlight after the chief executive of Nokia told the Financial Times he was confident that the market for mobile phones would grow by 10 per cent in 2005. Nokia's US-listed shares rose 0.6 per cent to $15.24.Shares in Motorola, a Nokia competitor, fell 0.3 per cent to $16.95.The pharmaceuticals sector continued to reel from Friday's warning that Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis medication had increased the risk of heart attacks in patients in clinical trials. Pfizer, which fell 11 per cent after the announcement on Friday, fell 5.7 per cent to $24.94 after the company said it would stop advertising the drug.Merck, which withdrew its arthritis painkiller after studies revealed that it increased the chance of heart problems, fell 0.3 per cent to $31.51.Energy stocks were among the best performers yesterday, led by Exelon, the nuclear power company. Exelon shares rose 2.8 per cent to $43.05 after the company announced a $13.2bn deal to buy Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey-based rival. PSE shares jumped 7 per cent to $50.56.Monsanto, the life sciences group, rose 2 per cent to $52.49 after it said that operating profits should be better than expected in the first-quarter thanks to its booming trade in bio-engineered seeds.McAfee was the big loser among software stocks. Shares in the company, which specialises in anti-virus software, fell 6.8 per cent to $26.98 after Microsoft said it had chosen another company to provide virus-scanning services to customers of its Hotmail e-mail network. Shares in Trend Micro, the Japanese company chosen by Microsoft to replace McAfee, jumped 8.5 per cent to $54.78.Shares in Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, rose 0.4 per cent to $52.20 after it said sales last week had been stronger than expected. Kmart, a rival retail group, fell 1.9 per cent to $98.40, however, while shares in rival Target were flat at $50.54. Stephanie Hoff, analyst at Edward Jones, said that retailers had been forced to offer discounts to get people into stores following a week start to the holiday shopping season.""What that probably means is that margins [for the holiday season] will still be okay, but not as good as they could have been,"" she said.Fannie Mae, the embattled mortgage finance group, fell 1.3 per cent to $69.42 following reports that it had deferred a decision about whether to dismiss Franklin Raines as chief executive in the wake of an accounting scandal."

The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,189.24, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite overcame losses in chip stocks to edge up 0.1 per cent to 2,129.01.Volume was heavy, as more than 1.6bn shares changed hands on the New York exchange by early afternoon, with 17 issues advancing issues for every 15 that lost ground.The rally came despite a stream of disappointing corporate sales updates and a bevy of economic data that presented a mixed picture about the state of the US economy in the run up to Christmas.A bigger-than-expected rise in jobless claims added to last week's bleak news that the US economy created fewer jobs than expected in November.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said that the figures were disappointing, but cautioned against reading too much into them.""The immediate temptation is to pin the blame on the poor performance of retailers over the Thanksgiving weekend,"" he said.""But given the unreliability of these numbers from week to week, we cannot yet be sure that this rise in claims is anything more than noise.""The stock market's three main indices have stalled this month following a rally in late October and November that led the S&P 500 to a three-year high.Forecasts of an impending cold snap in the midwest and the northeast cast a further chill over the markets and helped push crude oil futures back above the $42 mark ahead of today's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.Oil prices, which are down sharply from the $56 per barrel high they hit last month, have been the centre of attention amid the slow trickle of economic news earlier this week.By the end of trading, crude futures had risen 59 cents to $42.53.Telecommunications stocks shot higher, led by news that Sprint and NextelCommunications had entered merger talks. Sprint rose 7.9 per cent to $24.28, while long-time rival Nextel rose 6.6 per cent to $29.81.Meanwhile, Ciena, the telecommunications equipment maker that has seen its shares plunge this year, shot up more than 23 per cent to $2.88 on an upbeat sales outlook.Semiconductor stocks fell after Xilinx and Altera, the programmable computer chip rivals, cut their sales forecasts. Xilinx shares fell 3.3 per cent to $29.72, while Alter a shares dropped 7.8 per cent to $20.47.Intel, the world's biggest computer chip company, fell 1 per cent to $22.76. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, fell 3.5 per cent to $22.10.California-based National Semiconductor rose 4.9 per cent to $16.79, however, after it reported improved second-quarter profits.One Nasdaq trader said: ""We've seen semis weak as a group. They're destined to stabilise a little but the news today is having an adverse effect on the whole group."" The trader said investors would be looking for chip companies to revive in the new year as inventories adjust.Among retailers, Costco, the bulk food club, fell 1.6 per cent to $48.10 as earnings fell short of analysts' forecasts. Discount rivals Wal-Mart and Target were also lower. Wal-Mart fell 0.5 per cent to $52.77, while Target was off 0.5 per cent at $52.77. Retailers such as Wal-Mart, which import the bulk of their goods from abroad, stand to be among the hardest hit by recent increases in prices of foreign goods.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products group, rose 2.5 per cent to $56.38 after it reaffirmed its second-quarter earnings outlook and said strong demand from China would lead to better-than-expected sales.Foundation Coal, the coal mining group, fell 1.1 per cent to $21.75 in its market debut after in its initial public offering raised more than expected.DreamWorks Animation, the animated film studio, fell 6.2 per cent to $37.69 on news that it would delay the release of Shrek 3 until May 2007.

At the Nasdaq, the gaining issues and the losing stocks were just about evenly split.Data showing that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week appeared to weigh on sentiment. However, traders and investors were expected to focus on Friday's monthly job creation figures for a clearer insight into the US labour market, whose erratic trends have vexed market watchers this year.In other economic news, factory orders rose more than economists had expected in October, helped by defence expenditures.Stocks continued to receive support from a steadily declining oil price. Nymex WTI futures lost more than $2 on Friday morning after a drop of more than 7 per cent on Wednesday that eased concerns about economic growth and bolstered bulls' hopes for a year-end rally.Airline stocks were broadly higher on Thursday as the falling price of oil eased cost concerns. The Amex airline index climbed 3.6 per cent.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, led gainers, rising 9.1 per cent to $10.70. Northwest Airlines rose 3.1 per cent to $11.32 and Delta Air Lines was 8.2 per cent higher at $7.90.Chris Watling, managing director at Longview Economics, said he expected the current rally in the S&P 500 to last through the first quarter. ""Beyond that, we expect equities to struggle next year as the corporate profit outlook worsens relative to current expectations, and as valuation pressure increases from a rising real interest rate, a worsening equity volatility trend and a diminishing profit growth outlook,"" he said.An improving economic picture could also lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again when it meets later this month.Intel fell 1.7 per cent to $22.71 ahead of its mid-quarter trading update, due after the close. The world's largest chipmaker was widely expected to raise earnings guidance.Shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, closed flat at $22.62. Semiconductors led Wednesday's rally and Mr Pado said this increased the pressure on the sector, especially on Intel.Some technology investors have warned that the sector has not adjusted to sluggish demand. Others have said the market was unprepared for higher interest rates and a possible dollar crisis. Stocks have largely ignored the greenback's latest decline.A host of retailers reported monthly same-store sales that painted a gloomy picture for the sector ahead of its vital Christmas shopping season.Albertsons, the grocer, slipped 6.1 per cent to $24.20 in spite of the retailer revealing higher quarterly profits boosted by stronger sales.Wet Seal, the clothing chain, said sales at stores open at least one year fell nearly 20 per cent in November. The company's shares rose 2.4 per cent to $1.68.Pier 1 Imports, the home goods retailer, fell 2.2 per cent to $18.30 after the company's earnings guidance disappointed investors. Same-store sales also fell as stagnant demand forced the imported furniture store to cut prices.Cendant, the travel and real estate group, slipped 1.2 per cent to $23.14 after it announced that it was set to buy Ebookers, the UK online travel group, in a deal worth at least $415m.Starbucks jumped 1.9 per cent to $58.65 as the world's biggest coffee chain unveiled same-store sales growth of 13 per cent in November.Away from the retail sector, Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment maker, edged higher after Scott Kriens, chief executive, said the company was considering using its $1.5bn cash pile to make acquisitions.

The Nasdaq Composite index gained 1 per cent to 2,099.68.There were slightly more than two advancing stocks for every losing one at both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, where 1.7bn shares were traded. A senior trader at the Big Board said this was a strong signal of buying by ""basket"" investors picking up S&P 500 stocks irrespective of the fundamentals underpinning the respective share prices.The late-afternoon retreat was caused by a rebound in crude oil prices following reports that heating oil reserves declined last week in the US. With winter fast approaching, the news trumped the rise in crude oil stockpiles. Crude settled near $47 as heating oil rallied.Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen, said: ""The market was just a little bit heavy, we're resting a bit and it's healthy.""He added that from a technical standpoint the market looks ""phenomenal"", as several resistance points have been broken.Some market commentators have said in the last week that the recent rally is in danger of getting ahead of itself on inadequate support from economic realities.However, another trader on Wednesday said the end of the year tended historically to be a positive period for the market. He added that there was evidence of significant new inflows of capital and of short-sellers getting squeezed and covering their positions.""The shorts are throwing in the towel, hopefully we'll carry this into next year,"" Mr Leone said.Corporate and economic news helped the market higher. Following news of a blockbuster merger in the retail sector, the US government reported that consumer price inflation rose 0.6 per cent in October owing to climbing energy prices. Investors appeared to be encouraged that US companies were able to pass on cost increases, reflected in Tuesday's producer prices, to consumers.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation was 0.2 per cent, double what economists had expected.Evidence of inflationary pressure fuelled fears that the Federal Reserve would continue to tighten monetary policy in December. The US central bank has already raised benchmark borrowing costs four times to put them at 2 per cent from 1 per cent.In addition, industrial production rose twice as much as economists had expected last month, further boosting the bulls case.On the corporate front, the retail sector continued to command the centre stage in corporate news as Kmart and Sears Roebuck announced an $11bn merger that will create the third-largest retailer in the US. Kmart shares rose 7.7 per cent to $109 while Sears Roebuck stock put on 17.2 per cent to $52.99.The deal was seen as an indication of confidence among US companies in the outlook for the economy.Shares in Martha Stewart Omnimedia gained 6.3 per cent to $18.49 amid optimism that the Kmart-Sears merger would help the company, which provided Kmart with branded merchandise.Vornado Realty Trust, which has recently increased its stake in Sears, saw shares edge off 2.6 per cent to $70.52.Technology stocks received support from Hewlett-Packard,which reported a 27 per cent increase in third-quarter profits and a 7.7 per cent rise in revenues. The news sent shares 2.6 per cent up to $20.20 and confounded expectations that technology spending by US companies and consumers was set to slow down.Shares in Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, which power most of Hewlett-Packard's personal computers, rose 2 per cent to $24.32 and 5.3 per cent to $21.99, respectively.The Dow received further support from Altria Group, up 5.6 per cent to $57.42 on news that the company and other tobacco producers asked a federal court to block a $280bn lawsuit against the industry.Also higher were shares in Network Appliance, a data storage company that reported a 14 per cent rise in profits thanks to strong demand.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3 per cent to 2,061.27.Trading was heavier than expected after bond markets were closed owing to a federal holiday. Even with one less source of guidance, stock investors traded about 1.4bn shares at the New York stocks Exchange, about the daily average volume for the year.Crude oil futures fell 2.9 per cent and erased most of the gains in the prior session as rising crude inventories offset concerns about possible shortages of heating oil this winter. The perception that Yassir Arafat's death overnight would help prospects for peace in the Middle East further undermined crude prices as supply worries eased.This offered support to stocks following their initially muted reaction to the widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which reiterated its upbeat view of the world's largest economy.The indices have been bound in a narrow range in the past few sessions, with intraday patterns hinting at a tense tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Some traders characterised the action as bullish consolidation.The bulls will be keen to tack on consistent gains following warnings from some market watchers that the current rally faces technical resistance and that several factors threaten to stop it in its tracks in a similar way to other failed rallies earlier this year.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, attributed much of yesterday morning's gains to the decline in oil prices and the upcoming dividend from Microsoft, set to inject about $30bn in the market.""I think we're coming to the end of it [the current rally] and next year's fundamentals continue to look pretty cloudy,"" Mr Boockvar said.On the corporate front, shares of PeopleSoft eased 1.6 per cent to $22.43 after the company rejected a final takeover bid from Oracle, whose shares edged off 1.8 per cent to $13.14.In other merger-and-acquisition news, Blockbuster launched a $70m offer for Hollywood Entertainment, a rival video rental company. Blockbuster shares were 11.1 per cent higher at $8.20 while Hollywood Entertainment added 11.5 per cent to $10.93.Another deal came in the retail sector, where Jones Apparel Group said it would buy Barney's New York for about $294m.

Agilent Technologies was also due to report results after the bell, and shares gained 2.5 per cent to $25.68.Semiconductor shares saw buying as RF Micro Devices rose 7.6 per cent to $6.69 following an upgrade to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"" by analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.5 per cent to $18.59 after Merrill Lynch analysts raised their rating for the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".National Semiconductor shares, up 2.5 per cent to $16.26, defied a downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" by analysts at UBS.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, gained 1.4 per cent to $23.17 after it named a new chief executive officer replacing Craig Barrett.A less positive note came from Nortel Networks, whose shares fell 5.9 per cent to $3.37 after the telecommunications equipment group delayed the filing of its quarterly results."
584;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-11-11T18:25:49Z;Intel appoints Otellini as new CEO;;In a carefully planned succession, Intel on Thursday named Paul Otellini as its next chief executive, taking over from Craig Barrett next May.Mr Otellini, 54, who joined Intel 30 years ago, will be the chipmaker's first chief executive without an engineering background.Intel said Mr Barrett would become chairman, succeeding Andy Grove, 68, who would assume the role of senior adviser to the board.Intel said directors had elected Mr Otellini, currently president and chief operating officer, at a meeting on Wednesday.The appointment had been a heavily signalled move following Mr Barrett reaching retirement age. Intel's policy is that the CEO should step down by the annual meeting, due on May 19, following their 65th birthday.Mr Otellini has degrees in economics and began in 1974 in a finance position, before moving on to product development and sales and marketing.He describes himself as “a product guy” and led the introduction of the Pentium processor in 1993.Intel has enjoyed seamless transitions at the top over the years, from Robert Noyce to Gordon Moore who coined the famous Moore's Law on processor power doubling every two years to Andy Grove and Craig Barrett.Mr Otellini has said he does not expect Intel to look any different under his stewardship.But he faces challenges in reinvigorating a company that this year Mr Barrett admitted had become “too relaxed”.While Intel still has more than 80 per cent of the market for PC processors, its shares are down more than 25 per cent this year after a series of design problems and delays for its latest chips. It has also been beaten by rival AMD to releasing next-generation 64-bit chips.Mr Barrett also joined the company in 1974 and became chief executive in 1998. He led Intel into new, less successful areas such as web hosting and communications chips and has since overseen its retrenchment into its traditional processor business.“Craig and Paul are the right team at the right time for Intel,” Mr Grove said yesterday.“Having worked closely with Craig and Paul for over 30 years, I know that Paul's vitality and deep knowledge of Intel's products, customers and global markets, together with Craig's stature as an industry leader and pre-eminent technologist, make them outstanding choices.”The announcement reassured the market, with Intel shares rising 1 per cent to $23.08 in early Nasdaq trading on Thursday.
585;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-11-03T03:43:35Z;Heated debate over savings;;The Linux world has long claimed that dramatic cost savings result from implementing its operating system. Microsoft sought to refute the figures and the resulting argument only served to detract from the real strategic issues surrounding modern flexible computer systems.Cost savings ranging from 40 per cent to 80 per cent have been attributed to implementing Linux. However, by far the largest saving results from hardware. Organisations are typically replacing an old server, with a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor running a version of the Unix operating system from the same vendor, to a server running Linux on an x86, architecture.This architecture uses the same microprocessors, produced by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, that power personal computers and are therefore produced in great numbers at low cost. But Windows, SCO Unix, HP-UX (Hewlett-Packard’s version of Unix) and Sun Microsystems’ Solaris also run on this architecture.“Moving to Linux can save a lot of money, but it is very easy to lose sight of the fact that they might have saved most of that money anyway simply moving from a dated RISC architecture to an Intel compatible architecture,” says Andy Butler, vice-president at Gartner. “Why throw away a stable, proven, trusted implementation of the operating system when you can get 80 per cent of the savings and still retain familiarity of the operating system?”Don Jenkins, director of product marketing for business critical servers at HP, points out that because Linux and Windows originated on the personal computer platform, they will run on smaller machines than HP-UX. This advantage for Linux is becoming less of an issue, he says, as Unix is adapted for smaller machines.Although unsupported copies of Linux can be downloaded at no cost, most organisations will purchase it with support at a commercial price. It is hard to compare the cost of operating systems, especially at the enterprise level where subscriptions apply, but the list price of Linux can often appear to be less than its competitors.“Big organisations especially, will find that Microsoft and Unix vendors will haggle,” says Mr Butler. “Although we would not generally encourage it, the reality is that often people will use Linux pricing as a lever to get a better deal.”It is not enough to look at just the cost of the operating system, but at the cost of the application software that will run on top of it. Open source software that runs only on Linux may be available at no cost. Mr Jenkins says that this applies in the technical market and in websites that can use very low cost web servers.Mr Butler warns that organisations need to look very carefully at various Linux added-value tools and utilities, such as failover, clustering, workload management and capacity-on-demand. “Even if an organisation could save money by running Linux,” he says, “by the time other software costs are taken into account, it could pay more for the Linux version of a software stack than for the same or a comparable products running on Windows.”Of course, some open source software runs on Microsoft Windows. Mr Butler points out that if an organisation wants to get significant financial benefits by running Open Office, it does not need to go to Linux, because it runs well on Microsoft Windows.Even looking at the total cost of buying hardware and software is not enough, as it makes up only about 20 to 30 per cent of the total cost of a system. “It is lifetime cost that matters, not a comparison of the two cheques you might write,” says Mr Butler. “There are many scenarios where the cost of administering and maintaining a Linux software stack may be much more expensive then the comparable cost of Unix or Microsoft Windows.”Chris Ingle, a systems consultant at IDC, notes that the main cost of a system is people. “You can get the Unix to Linux hardware savings by moving to Microsoft Windows,” he says, “but it still won’t affect the main area of savings, which is administration costs. If you end up employing the same number of staff, you will only be left with the hardware saving, whatever operating system is running.” He says the key ratio of administrators to servers is usually lower with Unix or Linux, but it is possible to get a comparable ratio with Windows, if it is configured correctly.Michael Hjalsted, director of servers at Unisys, the computer services company, points out that the initial cost of the operating system over a five-year life of an enterprise solution is almost irrelevant. He warns that experience of running enterprise Linux solutions is scarce, so organisations have to pay a premium.The cost savings claimed for Linux are almost entirely the result of hardware costs that can mostly be realised with other operating systems. Linux brings choice to the Intel-compatible platform, which is good for user organisations. Depending on circumstances, it may allow complete systems to be built and operated at either a lower or higher cost than other systems. The choice of Linux as operating system should be made as a strategic decision.
586;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-10-12T22:18:19Z;Intel?s profit margins squeezed;;The inventory build-up that shook investor confidence this summer continued to plague Intel in the third quarter, squeezing profit margins at the world's largest semiconductor company.However, Intel soothed fears by revealing that inventories declined slightly in the three months to September and forecasting revenue and margins in line with Wall Street expectations for the current quarter.The shares added 76 cents to $21.04 in after-market trading on Tuesday, a gain of 4 per cent.Intel has struggled in recent months to cope with an oversupply of personal computer microprocessors its core business and tougher competition from rivals, particularly Advanced Micro Devices.The company has also suffered a series of mis-steps including product delays and recalls. Craig Barrett, chief executive, in July sent a strongly worded memo to employees calling on them to improve their collective performance.Third-quarter revenue was $8.5bn, up 8 per cent from last year and in line with the $8.3bn-$8.6bn range predicted by the company in its mid-quarter update in early September. Gross margins were 55.7 per cent, compared with the 58 per cent predicted by the company.Mr Barrett blamed the margin squeeze on ?inventory adjustments at some of our major customers and lower than expected overall demand for PCs?.In an effort to reduce inventories, Intel has reduced output at many of its chip manufacturing facilities. This leads to lower profits per chip as fixed costs, notably depreciation, are spread across fewer products. Earnings per share were 30 cents, up from 25 cents last year, boosted by a one-off tax benefit of 3.6 cents. Analysts had been anticipating earnings of about 27 cents.Losses at Intel's communications chip business increased to $251m, against $208m in 2003 and $126m in the second quarter. Revenue was $1.3bn, up from $973m a year ago.Andy Bryant, chief financial officer, conceded that the communications business ?took a step backwards on the road to profitability?.Intel still hopes that the business will return to profit in 2005, he added.For the fourth quarter, Intel said revenues were likely to be $8.6bn-$9.2bn, in line with Wall Street expectations and a sequential gain of about 5 per cent. Fourth-quarter gross margin is expected to be 54-58 per cent.
587;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-10-12T20:34:03Z;Wall Street pares losses as crude eases;;"The same crude prices that had sent Wall Street blue chip stocks on a highway to hell with their earlier surge almost put the indices back in black in the last hour of Tuesday's session.Nymex crude gave in to aggressive profit-taking ahead of data on US petroleum inventories, settling at $52.51 per barrel after it had surged past $54 per barrel in overnight trading.The reversal sent blue-chip stocks into a rebound of their own in the last hour of trading to close within a whisker of positive territory.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was less than 0.1 per cent lower at 10,077.18, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent lower at 1,121.84. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index recovered much of its earlier losses and closed 0.2 per cent down to 1,925.17.Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck, said: ""We just can't ignore oil, because it has continued seeping into the overall picture of future economic growth and individual company earnings, and will act as a brake to some degree.""Despite Tuesday's retreat, crude prices remain vulnerable to supply worries in the face of unrelenting global demand as the winter begins in the northern hemisphere. Pumping capacity in the Gulf of Mexico remains impaired following hurricanes in the region, while the prospect of prolonged strikes in Nigeria and lower output from Russia could renew upward pressure on crude prices.Trading volumes picked up on Tuesday, conferring credibility on the rally. However, some traders said the statistical dead heat between the two contenders for the White House with only three weeks to go until the election is causing many investors to stay away from the market.Tuesday's rebound appeared to vindicate the view that last week's retreat in the face of dismal economic news would prove a short-term correction that would give in to the market's curent upward trend.The third-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, and by the end of this week about a third of the companies in the S&P 500 index will have reported results.Bullish investors have argued that the market has ignored upbeat corporate earnings all year and it will have to take them into account eventually. The inevitable slowdown in corporate earnings fuelled fears that by the time the market gets around to taking earnings into account, the news will have already become less exciting.Mr Suskind said the much-discussed fourth-quarter rally was only likely to happen after the election early next month and provided the oil markets become more stable, affording investors a chance to make more educated bets on the effects of expensive oil on the rest of the economy.""Oil is a moving target right now, once it becomes more stable, people might start looking at what 2005 is going to look like and discount anything that might happen until the end of this year,"" he said.Merrill Lynch shares were 2.9 per cent higher at $52.48 even after the Wall Street bank reported a 15 per cent decline in quarterly profits from the previous quarter. While Merrill exceeded analyst forecasts, the news underscored its vulnerability to trading in equity and fixed income markets.Also in the financial sector, State Street gave up 6.1 per cent to $41.16 following its news of below-estimate earnings last quarter.Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceuticals and healthcare group, reported higher quarterly profits thanks to higher demand for medical devices and drugs. Shares added 2.6 per cent to $56.82.In the technology sector, a downbeat assessment of semiconductor markets from Philips, the Dutch conglomerate, cast a pall ahead of quarterly results from Intel, due after the close. Shares in the world's biggest chipmaker lost 1.6 per cent to $20.28 by the close, while Advanced Micro Devices eased 1.8 per cent to $13.70. The semiconductor sector index fell 1.3 per cent.Fred Hickey, editor of the Hi-Tech Strategist newsletter, said he would not be surprised to hear Intel give a positive message with its earnings but warned: ""That won't address the real problem, which is high inventories"". Referring to the recent rally in chip stocks he said: ""It defies everything going on in the economy, there is very little logic behind the optimism.""Also reporting results after the close is Yahoo, the internet portal. Its results are seen as indicators of insights into trends in the global internet advertising and electroni c commerce market. Shares were up 0.6 per cent at $34.23.In the more traditional advertising segments, Gannett reported growth for its newspaper and television units but the media group's shares edged down 2.1 per cent to $83.25."
588;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Processors help AMD meet earnings hopes;;Strong sales of powerful, 64-bit microprocessors enabled Advanced Micro devices to meet third quarter earnings expectations despite disappointing results from its flash memory business.AMD is the only substantial competitor to Intel in the market for processors that power personal computers. The company's 64-bit Opteron processor, used in servers, has this year emerged as one of the hottest products in corporate computing.Shipments of 64-bit processors mainly Operton but also Athlon 64 processors used in some high-end PCs nearly doubled over the second quarter.For the group as a whole, revenues for the three months to September were $1.24bn, a 30 per cent increase over last year but a 2 per cent sequential decline.On Monday, AMD warned that sales would be below expectations due to flash memory weakness. The company had previously expected revenue to show a sequential increase.Memory sales were $538m, a 27 per cent increase over last year but a 20 per cent quarter-on-quarter decline. Processor sales overall were $672m, up 21 per cent sequentially and 34 per cent over last year.Net income was $44m, or 12 cents a share, up from 9 cents in the second quarter and a 9 cent a share loss in the third quarter of 2003.AMD said processor sales should remain strong in the fourth quarter, with flash memory sales expected to be at least flat. The result should be an overall increase in group revenues, it said.In addition to its Opteron and Athlon product lines, AMD recently launched Sempron, a family of low-cost processors aimed at PC manufacturers in emerging markets such as China. Sempron chips compete directly with Intel's Celeron processors.AMD stock gained 14 cents to $14.10 in aftermarket trading on Thursday following the announcement.Although the price stands well below the $18 peak reached last November, AMD stock has handily outperformed Intel over that period. The world's largest semiconductor company has been struggling to overcome a series of missteps including product delays, recalls and build-up of excess inventory.Intel reports third quarter earnings on October 12.
589;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;European bourses make tentative gains;;European stock markets built tentatively on their strong start to the fourth quarter on Tuesday, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index establishing itself in a growing comfort zone above the 1,000 level. It settled 0.2 per cent firmer at 1,015.76, its highest closing level since April 27.There were no worrying economic developments affecting the market yesterday, nor did the latest uptick in crude oil prices - to back above $50 a barrel - cause any significant ripples of unease.Financial stocks moved to the fore of the Eurofirst sector winners table, bolstered by the confident start to the quarter by global markets.But there was no shortage of losing sectors, especially retail stocks, both general and food, and forest and paper, one of last week's best performers.Information technology microchip and related stocks also came under fire after disappointing results from Advanced Micro Devices in the US on Monday evening.CS Group, the Swiss bank, was among the best of the banks, its shares advancing 1.5 per cent to SFr42, as the market reacted positively to a report suggesting the company was speeding up its restructuring plan and actively seeking a buyer for its Winterthur insurance arm. CS acquired Winterthur in 1997 but it proved a disappointment, suffering substantial losses after the sharp retreat in global markets.The stock was additionally lifted by a positive note published by Deutsche Bank which reiterated its bullish stance on the investment bank along with UBS. CS reports its third quarter results on November 4 and UBS on November 2.Deutsche said: “The US broker results season demonstrated the resilience of fixed income in spite of a difficult June to August quarter. For the European investment banks we expect similar fixed interest trends, albeit no equities improvement.“In addition, we remain upbeat on private banking and are also optimistic on the 2005 outlook for both banks”. UBS shares were 0.3 per cent easier at SFr89.90.The German banks all made progress but finished the session below their best levels of the day. Talk of further defections by senior staff at the investment bank and attempts to keep the division on track saw Commerzbank shares settle 0.4 per cent higher at €15.50.Bank Austria, Europe's top performer last week with a 9.6 per cent gain, featured in Monday's top ten in the FTSE Eurofirst 300, for much of the day eventually closing 1 per cent higher at €59.23, still benefiting from a series of bullish broker notes, focusing on the prospects for profits generated in central Europe. Erste Bank shares jumped 0.5 per cent to €34 for the same reason.Carrefour, the French retailer, was the worst performer among top European companies, its shares retreating 2.6 per cent to €37.28 after a survey by research group IRI revealed further a further sales slide by French supermarket groups.IRI's survey said sales in France had fallen in the last few weeks of the summer season.Carrefour shares have come under intense pressure in recent weeks amid talk of a sharp decline in sales. And only last Friday SG Securities, the French stockbroker, downgraded Carrefour to “sell” and said it expected weak third-quarter sales which could prompt a profits warning from the group.KarstadtQuelle, the German stores chain, saw its shares rocket 22.8 per cent to €14.05 late in the session, after a newswire report suggested that Blackstone, the private equity group, was considering a bid for the company, which has embarked on a substantial restructuring plan. The German company said it knew of no bid interest from Blackstone.Nokia shares closed down 0.3 per cent at €11.70. SG Securities cut the Finnish mobile phone giant's rating from “buy” to “hold” due to concerns over its handset portfolio and after recent stock outperformance. The bank also raised Ericsson to its preferred stock in the telecoms equipent sector in place of Alcatel, the French manufacturer.Huhtamäki, the Finnish packaging company, saw its shares slide 3 per cent to €10.46 after UBS downgraded its rating from “neutral2“ to “reduce2“ The bank also lowered its target price from €12 to €9.7 referring to the impact of increases in raw material costs.
590;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-10-05T16:00:46Z;Overview: Record oil prices pile on pressure;;"Oil prices rushed back up on Tuesday, reaching record highs and piling fresh pressure on world stock markets after their rebound over the two previous trading days.Nymex oil futures set their sights on $51 on news that production in the Gulf of Mexico was down by about 480,000 barrels a day, or 29 per cent, three weeks after Hurricane Ivan struck.Nymex crude for November delivery closed at a record high of $51.09 a barrel in New York trade, a rise of $1.18 on the day. Market attention was also turning to today's US crude inventory data, which many analysts believe would show a rise of about 1.1m barrels.Wall Street edged lower in morning trade as the market faced up to higher oil prices and data showing that the services sector grew more slowly than expected in September.Hewlett-Packard was also a drag on the market after JP Morgan cut its rating on the company, pointing to Hewlett's exposure to consumer PCs and printers.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent lower but the the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.2 per cent.Europe managed to hold on to slim gains as a good day for heavily weighted oil groups helped to mitigate losses in airlines and other companies that are heavily dependent on oil. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed 0.2 per cent to the good at 1,015.77, a second consecutive five-month closing high.Asia was less fortunate, finding itself trapped in narrow ranges as investors were rattled by an overnight announcement from Advanced Micro Devices, which became the latest chip maker to warn investors of weaker than forecast financial results.Jim O'Neill, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, has become more bearish about the world economy as leading indicators, including Goldman's own, have shown growth slowing.The preliminary reading of September's headline figure showed Goldman Sach's global indicator hitting a fresh 2004 low of 4.2 per cent, down from 4.4 per cent in August and from a peak of 6 per cent in April.""We think US productivity is in the early stages of slowing sharply and the Fed will have to keep tightening even though growth is slowing,"" he said.He pointed to recent data showing rising unit labour costs in the US despite a slowdown in growth.""In the next decade, there is a distinct possibility that we could go through a decade like the 1970s where developed countries were showing disappointing growth, but seeing a pick-up in inflation,"" he said.This does not bode well for equity investors in the near term. ""At the margin, bonds are more attractive than equities, but not that attractive given how low yields are,"" Mr O'Neill said.He expects alternative assets such as real estate, commodities and hedge funds to do well. ""I'm a big believer that the rise in commodity prices over the past 18 months is the beginning of a long-term trend."""
591;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-09-21T22:16:13Z;AMD extends IBM technology deal;;Advanced Micro Devices, chief competitor to Intel in the market for personal computer microprocessors, has extended a technology pact with International Business Machines until the end of 2008.The deal, which was due to expire next year, gives AMD access to chip technologies developed by IBM, in return for which it will pay fees of about $250m over four years.The arrangement should help AMD to remain competitive with Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker and dominant supplier of PC microprocessors, for the next three generations of chips. Income from the agreement will help IBM cover the cost of its substantial investments in semiconductor technology.
592;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-09-13T20:32:00Z;Tech shares start week with a rally;;"Technology shares outpaced the broader market on Wall Street on Monday at the onset of a week with a busy economic calendar.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 10,314.69. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,125.91 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,910.38.Some market observers have said that a far from clear picture of the US economy, combined with the imminence of the November presidential elections and stubbornly high energy prices, are keeping investors on the sidelines.On Monday, only 1.3bn shares exchanged hands at the New York Stock Exchange.This week brings a bevy of economic data on retail sales and consumer confidence, as well as consumer-price inflation and industrial production. But their impact on trading could be limited by the impression many market participants have that the recent data could be distorted by the hurricanes affecting the south-eastern US. In addition, the end of the week brings quadruple-witching, or the simultaneous expiry of options and futures for indices and stocks. The accentuated volatility normally caused by quadruple witching could be compounded by the observance of the Jewish new year on Thursday and Friday, which could keep many Wall Street employees at home. In all, the stage appeared set for more inconclusive trading, with some analysts pointing out that a decrease in oil prices or another similar event could breathe new life into a short-term rally lacking in both volume and pace.Tobias Levkovich's team at the Smith Barney unit of Citigroup wrote on Monday: ""We continue to be tactically cautious as we think earnings concerns could interrupt the widely anticipated fourth-quarter rally.""A high-profile acquisition in advertising dominated the morning's action. The shares of Grey Global added 4 per cent to $977.90 after the advertising agency agreed to be taken over by the UK's WPP for about $1.5bn in cash and shares. The transaction is aimed at putting WPP on a par with Omnicom, the global leader. The latter's shares were 0.4 per cent higher at $69.19.In other M&A news the shares of Metro-Goldwyn Mayer rose 4 per cent to $11.55 after reports that Japan's Sony raised its offer to buy the entertainment group to $5bn and was close to taking control of the company, as Time-Warner pulled out of the contest to buy MGM. Sony's NYSE-listed shares were up 1.5 per cent at $35.82. Time-Warner eased 0.4 per cent to $16.45.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks rallied once again. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 2.5 per cent, paced by a 9.4 per cent rise in Broadcom shares to $30.30. The company, which makes broadband semiconductors, said rising inventories would weigh on its sales but the market focused on its stronger products.Amid the broader chip rally National Semiconductor added 4.4 per cent to $14.86 while Advanced Micro Devices was 5.7 per cent higher at $12.90.Away from technology investors reacted vehemently to US Airways' second bankruptcy filing in as many years, sending its shares in a 30.1 per cent tailspin to $1.02. The airline failed to secure backing for its restructuring plans from unions. The damage appeared contained as the Amex airline sector index was flat, with Delta Air Lines shares gaining 8.1 per cent to $4.13 as it met bankruptcy lawyers in case it might also have to file.Shares in CKE Restaurants gave up 9.6 per cent to $11.19 after the operator of Carl's Jr and Hardee's fast-food restaurants reported a loss for the quarter due to one-time charges.Energy-related stocks saw a moderate reaction to reports that Hurricane Ivan could hit the Gulf of Mexico this week, prompting a shutdown of offshore drilling facilities there. Shell, which is evacuating non-essential staff from platforms, saw its NYSE-listed shares inch up 0.1 per cent to $51.75."
593;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-09-10T10:17:10Z;The week in technology: Msoft leaves prints on new technology;;"Microsoft leaves fingerprints on new technologyMicrosoft moved to make passwords a thing of the past this week with the roll-out of its latest range of PC keyboards and mice, featuring the group's first venture into fingerprint recognition technology.The world's largest software developer said the device would enable users to access favourite websites and PC systems quickly and easily, without having to remember countless different usernames and passwords.But the move could also mark the group's latest attempt to calm fears over its security standards.Microsoft has been a particular target of hackers and software pirates keen to exploit its dominant market position, and has repeatedly faced criticism that its security measures are not up to scratch.As well as facilitating web-surfing, the group said the new hardware was aimed at enhancing the comfort, convenience and mobility of PC users, who were spending a greater proportion of their lives in front of computer screens.It hoped to win over business customers by creating more ergonomically designed and efficient workstations, with a view to boosting employee productivity.The new range of nine mice and keyboards includes a small wireless mouse designed for portable PC users and new curved keyboards to ease typing. Several of the keyboards also incorporate a zoom slider bar, which enables users to quickly shrink or enlarge documents or digital photographs.The products with built-in fingerprint identification are expected to sell for between $55 and $110, while the portable mouse could cost about $45 and the zoom control keyboards $35.Intel launching new architectureIntel this week vowed it would launch a brand new microprocessor architecture onto the market next year in a new drive to persuade customers to replace existing computers.New 'dual core' chips for personal computers, laptops and servers will be available by the end of 2005, the company said.While other methods of increasing computer performance have reached a point of diminishing returns, dual core microprocessors combine two computing 'engines' on a single chip, speeding up the machines without needing much more power. This new technology strategy follows a period of uncertainty at the world's largest semiconductor company, which has suffered a number of product delays, manufacturing recalls and other errors. Last week the group warned of lower revenues and profit margins for the current quarter following weaker-than-expected demand for consumer PCs and electronics products. Although it maintained that sales of corporate information technology products remained strong, it became clear that he company had overestimated overall demand.Some market watchers took the news as confirmation that the ""back to school"" season for PCs would be weaker than forecast - with the effects likely to spread beyond Intel to affect other companies. However, others maintained that the season was on track and instead blamed Intel's strategy execution and excessive inventory. In addition, it is facing tough competition for the first time from rival AMD.Although Intel's warning echoed the cautious tone from Hewlett-Packard last month, Dell, maintained that its earnings guidance was unchanged.Capgemini cost crisisCapgemini shocked the Paris bourse early on Thursday when it reported an unexpected blow out in first-half losses following “significant“ cost overruns on contracts.Shares were briefly suspended when they tumbled downwards hitting exchange limits after France's biggest IT company said net losses ballooned to €135m - analysts had been expecting them to more than halve to about €40m.Capgemini said it had been hit by overruns on contracts signed in 2001 and 2002 “with terms that have proved difficult to meet“.The company also blamed problems in the US where revenues plunged 22 per cent, heavy investment for new proposals and a €30m one-off charge to drop the reference to Ernst & Young from its name.The board said it would replace chief executive officer William Bitan with Nicolas Dufourcq, currently responsible for central and southern Europe and previously chief executive of internet service provider Wanadoo.It also promised a shake-up in the top ranks and said chief executive Paul Hermelin would “strengthen the management team in the near future“.Capgemini directors proposed the sale of or disposal of heavily loss-making units as part of an “action plan“ that included “re-energising“ the North American business, and a efficiency programme and streamlining of costs in the technology business.However, the company offered some hope for its future prospects, saying its order book had more than doubled to €12.6bn compared to a year earlier.Capgemini's woes contrast with the healthier outlook from France's second largest computer company Atos Origin a day earlier.The company said operating profits climbed 29.1 per cent to €158.3m for the first half and it was upbeat about its prospects in the year ahead thanks to organic growth in France, The UK and the Netherlands."

We are moving from asking 'how many chips per computer?' to 'how many computers on a chip?',? he said during a keynote address to the Intel Developers Forum in San Francisco.Intel's new technology strategy follows a period of uncertainty at the world's largest semiconductor company, which has been plagued by a series of missed targets and manufacturing errors.Several products that were due to be launched in 2004 including a new line of chips for digital televisions and a high-performance version of the Pentium 4 processor for PCs have been delayed until 2005 or later.Last week, Intel surprised Wall Street by substantially lowering its revenue and profit margin targets for the three months to September.?We had some fumbles,? conceded Mr Otellini.He said that Intel had standardised the product development process across its divisions in order to prevent similar problems in future.Dual core microprocessors contain two computing ?engines' on a single chip, enabling computers to complete tasks more quickly without requiring substantially more power.Intel and other semiconductor companies are opting for this architecture because other methods of increasing computer performance such as increasing the number of instructions per second that a processor can handle have reached a point of diminishing returns.IBM already sells a dual core version of its Power 5 microprocessor, which is used in corporate servers. Advanced Micro Devices last week demonstrated a dual core version of its Opteron processor with it plans to launch in 2005.Sun Microsystems last year announced it was reducing investment in its Sparc series of processors to focus on a radical new architecture with up to 16 cores on a single chip.Mr Otellini also used his keynote speech to highlight Intel's commitment to Wi-Max, a technology that promises to deliver broadband internet access with a range of up to 10 miles.The company plans to introduce laptops with built-in Wi-Max capability during 2006, he said.
595;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-09-06T20:23:26Z;Wall St looks for fresh signs of Intel swagger;;Paul Otellini has some explaining to do this morning when he takes the stage at the twice-yearly Intel Developers Forum.The 5,000 customers and business partners gathered in San Francisco will be looking for evidence that Intel has regained its technological swagger after a series of product delays and unexpected changes to its ?road map? for future development. Wall Street will also be watching. The world's largest semiconductor company last week shocked investors by lowering its revenue and profit margin targets for the current quarter. Intel's stock shed 7 per cent, wiping $10bn from the company's market value.It is against this background that Mr Otellini president, chief operating officer and heir apparent to chief executive Craig Barrett needs to offer reassurance all round. The warning was puzzling at a time when sales of PCs seem strong. Designing and building chips to power PCs is Intel's core business. Its market share is about 80 per cent.?End demand [for PCs] is still pretty robust,? says Joe D'Elia, PC market analyst at research group iSuppli. ?If you look at the electronics industry I think 2004 will be a damned good year.?Industry analysts believe the PC market grew at a month-on-month rate of about 10 per cent during August, suggesting that this year's ?back to school? selling season will be a good one. For the three months to September, the consensus expectation is for worldwide PC market growth of 13-15 per cent.So how come the dominant supplier of PC chips is suffering? ?We believe Intel's execution is to blame,? said Tai Nguyen, semiconductor industry analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, in a research note. Execution in this context means the product delays, manufacturing recalls and other errors that have plagued Intel this year. For example, the delayed launch of a new chipset for PCs, codenamed Grantsdale, led to lost sales of a potentially high-margin product.Meanwhile, Intel built excessive inventory of both Grantsdale and high-end ?Prescott? chips. Clearing this backlog will require both price cuts and reduced output from its multi-billion dollar chipmaking facilities. Profit margins will be hit on both counts.To make matters worse, Intel is also facing tough competition for the first time in years from Advanced Micro Devices, the Texas-based chipmaker that is its only serious rival in the market for PC chips.AMD has always lived in the shadow of its much larger competitor. This year, however, it has hit its stride. Its Opteron processor, used in corporate servers, is taking sales from Intel's Xeon and Itanium lines. The success of Opteron even led Intel to mimic some of AMD's design features an almost unprecedented step.Last week, AMD again stole a march by demonstrating a ?dual core? version of Opteron that contains two processing ?engines? on a single chip. While Intel will bring its own dual core chip to market in 2005, the impression that AMD is setting the pace is bad news for the market leader.For the technologists in the audience at this week's developers forum, details of Intel's own dual core engineering strategy will be among the highlights of the meeting. When, exactly, does Intel plan to launch dual core versions of its Pentium, Xeon and Itanium chips?Investors will be looking for this and something more: evidence that one of the tech industry's giants still has the management talent to match its stature. Enter Mr Otellini, stage right.
596;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-09-03T16:23:27Z;Wall St shrugs off bad news in a quiet week;;Wall Street took some disappointing corporate news in its stride this week, with the weaker oil price tipping the balance in favour of the bulls.There was also relief that the summer's final “big event” the Republican National Convention in New York had passed without a terrorist attack.But it was the last week of the summer and activity was muted, in part because many investors and traders went on holiday to avoid the Republican gathering.But while markets were up over the week, they dipped on Friday amid disappointment over a warning from Intel late on Thursday and because solid job creation figures suggested the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates again later this month.By the close, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,260.20. However, the benchmark index was still up 0.6 per cent on the week. The S&P 500 had slipped 0.4 per cent to 1,113.63 on Friday, but it made a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.6 per cent to 1,844.48, for a 0.9 per cent weekly loss.Several strategists said the week's gains should be taken with a pinch of salt, because volumes were paper-thin.The week's economic data were largely tepid. August retail sales were extremely disappointing, with the much-anticipated back-to-school season stirring only modest interest in consumers.The data front took a turn for the better on Friday, with the eagerly awaited August non-farm payroll figures coming in at 144,000 just shy of analysts' expectations of 150,000 new jobs. But June and July figures were revised upwards by a combined 59,000.Although the figures suggest growth is more robust than feared, investors seemed to focus more on the implications for further interest rate rises.The closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the technology bellwether, was more than disappointing. The company said demand was weaker than expected and cut its forecasts for third quarter revenues and profit margins. Shares skidded 7.3 per cent yesterday to $20.05, making a new 52-week low and dragging down much of the chip sector with it. Semiconductors scored the week's worst performance on the S&P 500, down 7.2 per cent.Other losers included Advanced Micro Devices, off 6.6 per cent to $10.90 by the close, Xilinx, down 6.1 per cent to $25.59, PMC-Sierra, down 6.9 per cent to $8.69 and Applied Micro Circuits, 4.3 per cent weaker at $3.15.Intel's warning was only one of Thursday's disappointments. Wal-Mart, the retail giant, reported its weakest August sales in four years on the same day.Nonetheless, shares in the world's biggest retailer gained 0.7 per cent to $53.02 on the day, as investors were relieved that the 0.5 per cent same-store sales increase was not smaller.Gap, the clothing retailer, also reported a slimmer-than-expected drop in August sales. Shares climbed 5.7 per cent to $20.08, helping to lead the retailing sector to the session's best showing up 2.8 per cent. Taking the “glass-is-half-full” view to the extreme, markets sent shares of Ross Stores up 9.9 per cent to $23.53 after the company's August sales fell 8 per cent, rather than the 8.8 per cent investors had feared.Costco Wholesale, the membership warehouse chain, slid 1 per cent to $40.41 after the company reported August sales grew 4 per cent, missing analysts' expectations of 7.3 per cent growth by a wide mark.Energy stocks continued to prosper, in spite of the broader markets' relief at the recent pause in the crude rally.The S&P 500 energy group gained 3.9 per cent, the best performance on the week. Winners included Transocean, up 7.6 per cent on the week, Noble 7.9 per cent stronger and Occidental Petroleum, up 5 per cent.Woody Dorsey, a technical analyst at Market Semiotics, said investors' thinking about energy stocks had begun to shift, as they come round to the idea that oil prices may stay relatively high for some time.Although energy stocks have notched the S&P 500's best performance of the year, up 16.9 per cent, they have not kept pace with the soaring price of crude oil.
597;AMD;Adv Micro Devices;2004-09-01T20:40:41Z;Wall Street drifts as summer torpor continues;;US stocks were lacklustre on Wednesday as Wall Street dealt with one of its slowest weeks of the year. The main focus was on monthly employment data due out on Friday.The few market watchers who were not on summer vacation attributed the late rise in the Tuesday session to the so-called “window dressing” of portfolios by fundmanagers at the end of August.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eased less than 0.1 per cent to 10,168.83 while the S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,105.92. The technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,850.41.Blue-chip stocks were stoic in the face of news that manufacturing activity slowed in August slightly more than expected. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 59 last month, from 62 in June, to a level that still shows expansion for the industrial sector.While some economists said the data suggest growth in manufacturing has peaked, others noted that they still pointed to an expansion in industrial employment last month.Stocks also appeared to shrug off a sharp rebound in crude oil futures, focusing instead on their other obsession the jobs report due on Friday. The job creation data are expected to drive trading once investors return from their holidays next week. Amid evidence of slowing growth in the US, economists hope for a rebound in hiring after two disappointing months for job creation.Not only are the jobs data expected to set the tone of trading on Wall Street but also that of economic debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, his challenger. The two enter a decisive phase in their electoral campaign with Friday''s data being the second-last jobs report before the poll.On the corporate front, Fairchild Semiconductor added 3.7 per cent to $12.78 after the power-management chipmaker reiterated its sales outlook for the current quarter. While Fairchild said it expected no growth, the news assuaged fears of a slowdown in sales for the semiconductor sector.The outlook from Fairchild lifted Intel's shares 0.7 per cent to $21.43 on hopes the world's largest semiconductor company would also give an upbeat mid-quarter update to analysts and investors after Thursday's close.In the same sector, National Semiconductor added 1.8 per cent to $13.57 while Advanced Micro Devices was 2.4 per cent higher at $11.70. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 0.9 per cent.In the auto sector Ford Motor eased 1.5 per cent to $13.90 after it reported a 13 per cent decline in sales during August and announced a 6.8 per cent cut in fourth-quarter production. General Motors, which announced a 7 per cent drop in sales and its own output cut of 6.8 per cent, closed 0.2 per cent lower at $41.21.Declining auto sales follow news of declining consumer confidence and cast a pall over hopes that US consumers would continue to spend at a time when US businesses show no willingness to invest even though they have the capital to do so.Elsewhere, the shares of Forest Laboratories fell 8.4 per cent to $41.98 after the company said its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease failed to produce results in clinical trials.Meanwhile, Boston Scientific shares added 7.1 per cent to $38.28 after the maker of medical devices said it regained market share in the wake of a recall of its Taxus heart device.Among its competitors, Medtronic added 0.4 per cent to $49.99 and Guidant put on 3.1 per cent to $61.66.In the internet sector Ebay rose 1.3 per cent to $87.63 after the online auctioneer announced it had bought the part of its South Korean affiliate it did not already own for about $530m in a bid to expand its presence in Asia.Verizon Communications shares moved 0.6 per cent higher to $39.50 amid reports by US media that the company was selling its Canadian phone directory business to Bain Capital for more than $1bn.
