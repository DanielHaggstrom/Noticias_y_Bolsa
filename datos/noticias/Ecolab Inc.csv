0;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2014-07-30T10:39:26Z;Ecolab: a good merger?;What makes big mergers work well?;Everyone got it wrong. Three years ago, Ecolab (cleaning services) bought Nalco (water treatment) for $8bn, including debt. A big deal – Ecolab’s enterprise value was $14bn at the time. The initial response from pundits, analysts, and the market was poor. In the first month Ecolab’s shares lost a fifth of their value. The gloom did not last. The stock is now up more than 100 per cent since the deal.Ecolab’s management argued that there would be lots of cross-selling and cost cutting, and chemistry expertise would be shared. Is that how it has turned out? It is hard to track how growth and costs are affected by a merger. Many other factors are always in play (a nice hedge for dealmakers). But compare the two companies’ blended results from 2010, the last full year before the merger, with the combined company’s results over the past year. Overhead costs are about 2.5 percentage points lower, as a proportion of revenues, than in 2010. That’s worth more than $300m in operating earnings – good, but not enough to explain the price run.How about sales? They have grown at a nearly double-digit average annual rate, from the combined 2010 level. Not bad, but the key driver of the growth has been Nalco’s business with energy companies, which has little overlap with Ecolab’s operations. Ecolab bought a business that was about to go on a tear – a nice trick, but one that has little to do with efficiency or cross-selling.Another crucial change: the deal added a lot of debt. Ecolab has $7bn net debt today, twice as much as the old companies did. And the companies’ cost of debt has fallen steadily since the deal, helping make the deal very accretive to earnings.Cross-selling and cost synergies are all very well. But the growth potential of the target, and financing costs, are just as likely to determine whether a merger succeeds.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
1;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2011-07-20T20:54:44Z;Apple fails to lift US tech stocks;;Apple shares hit a record on Wednesday after its quarterly performance burst through expectations, but the good news did little to move the broader US markets.The iPad maker reported that profits rose 125 per cent in the quarter versus last year, citing sales of the iPad 2 and growing China demand. Earnings per share were $7.79, well above the consensus forecast of $5.87.The shares hit $396.27, an all-time high in early trading, before closing at $386.90, still up 2.7 per cent on the session.The sector was not cheered by the news, falling 0.43 per cent, after seeing its biggest one-day gain in a year earlier in the week.“Technology as a sector …is starting to splinter,” Nicholas Bohnsack, sector analyst at Strategas Research Partners, said. “Apple is a bellwether of a different stripe, generating the lion’s share from consumers. It speaks in part to consumer and discretionary shares have held up well over past several weeks. Apple is a very momentum, growth-driven stock …with a very specific product set that not generally a bellwether.”Citigroup analysts raised their one-year price target to $480 for the second time in a week, expecting “a steady stream of new product introductions and peak seasonal demand”. Apple is expected to release a new version of the iPhone before the holiday season. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their target to $525 a share.Sales of the iPhone exceeded estimates, with 20.3m units sold in the quarter. Over the same period, iPad sales were 9.2m versus 3.3m a year earlier.Cirrus Logic, a parts supplier for Apple, was up 4.4 per cent to $17.60.There were cautionary flags for tech investors after Yahoo said revenues slipped on falling advert sales, though quarterly income of 19 cents a share topped forecasts. Yahoo fell 7.6 per cent to $13.48.Shares of equipment makers tumbled after Riverbed Technology, a networking hardware maker, reported a sharp drop in profits. Its shares were down 22.5 per cent to $32.05.F5 Networks, a networking group that led gains on Tuesday, was down 6.1 per cent to $111.44.After the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 1325.84, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.43 per cent to 2814.23. Sentiment was damped by a 0.8 per cent dip in existing home sales, which was the third straight month of declines.Zillow, the real estate website, debuted on the Nasdaq, tripled in value in its first day of trading on Wednesday. Shares opened at $60 and closed at $35.77.United Technologies fell 1.8 per cent despite raising its full-year profit forecast from $5.35 a share to $5.45, citing strong performance in its Carrier unit.However, traders focused on UT’s unit Pratt & Whitney, along with Lockheed Martin, after they reported cost overruns in a programme to build the F-35 for the US military. The two groups will pay $283m to cover those costs. Lockheed Martinwas down slightly at $78.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.12 per cent to 12,571.91.American Airlines said it planned to upgrade its fleet, sending the shares 0.2 per cent lower. Boeing, which will split the 460-plane order with Airbus, added 2.2 per cent, raising its shares to $72.07.BlackRock added .44 per cent to $184.50 after it said it generated more fees on assets under management and expanded its assets by 0.3 per cent. Profits in the quarter were $3 a share, versus forecasts of $2.89.The financial sector led all S&P sectors, up 1.1 per cent, and the KBW Capital Markets index was up 1.5 per cent. Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent, Morgan Stanley added 3.5 per cent and Goldman Sachs was up 3.3 per cent. After positive earnings releases on Wednesday, US Bancorp was up 4.4 per cent – its largest daily gain since November – while PNC was down 0.4 per cent to $55.59.Despite Goldman Sachs’ disappointing earnings, investors have lifted capital markets groups, as BlackRock, State Street and Charles Schwab have reported a shift by investors out of active trading.Shares in E*Trade, the discount brokerage, led gains in the S&P 500. Citadel, the fund that owns a stake in E*Trade, wrote to the group asking it to call a special meeting and remove two directors. The shares rose 13.7 per cent to $14.72.Ecolab, a US sanitation technology group, led declines after announcing plans to acquire water technology group Nalco for $5.4bn. The shares fell 7.4 per cent to $51.31.
2;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2011-07-20T20:32:56Z;Ecolab / Nalco;The deal is less than pristine, in the market’s view;"While the world is unpredictable, it is likely to remain dirty. This explains the recent flurry of transactions involving companies that cut grime. Carl Icahn has made and raised an offer for bleach-maker Clorox; Switzerland’s Lonza picked up anti-microbials exposure by buying Arch; Sealed Air acquired cleaning products maker Diversey. Now Diversey’s competitor, Ecolab, is going from washing dishes and sheets to purifying water, buying industrial water treatment firm Nalco for $8.1 bn, including debt.The deal is less than pristine, in the market’s view: the acquirer’s shares were down 9 per cent the morning of the announcement. This despite Ecolab management’s argument that the stock and cash deal will be accretive to earnings per share, brings Ecolab into a market with strong secular growth potential and generates plenty of synergies over time, given the firms’ shared foundation in chemistry.The basic problem with these arguments, and likely reason for the tumble in Ecolab’s shares on Tuesday, however, is that Ecolab’s appeal to investors is less its growth than its stability and strong returns on invested capital. Adding Nalco’s $4.3bn in revenues to Ecolab’s $6.1bn threatens to dilute both these virtues. During the crisis year of 2009, Ecolab’s sales fell by under 4 per cent, for example; Nalco suffered an 11 per cent drop. Returns on invested capital at Ecolab were 15 per cent in 2010, according to Credit Suisse. At Nalco it was 9 per cent.The different financial profiles reflect how different the businesses really are. Chemistry may unite them, but Ecolab’s core customers are restaurants, hotels, food processors and hospitals; Nalco serves factories, paper mills and oil and gas firms. In a world where predictability is at a premium, a skittish reaction to change of that magnitude was inevitable.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
3;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2011-07-20T13:18:46Z;Ecolab agrees $5.4bn deal for Nalco;;Ecolab, the US disinfectant maker, has agreed to buy Nalco, the US water treatment company, for $5.4bn in a push to expand beyond its core food safety and cleaning businesses into water management.Ecolab is offering Nalco shareholders $38.80 in cash or 0.7005 Ecolab shares for every share in Nalco, representing a 34 per cent premium to Nalco’s closing price on Tuesday. Including Nalco’s $2.7bn of net debt, the deal values the company at $8.1bn.Douglas Baker, Ecolab chief executive, said: “Nalco’s water and oil and gas services end markets in particular represent excellent long-term growth potential, as the world deals with the quality, cost and availability of those key natural resources.”“We identified water management as a key growth segment for us, given its growth characteristics and importance to our customers,” he added.Ecolab’s business is currently centred around serving hotels and restaurants, with sales of about $6bn, while Nalco caters to manufacturing and energy companies, helping them treat and manage water for industrial processes. Nalco, which had sales of $4bn last year, also works with companies drilling natural gas shales, a fast-growing segment of the energy market.Analysts at Barclays Capital said water was an area into which Ecolab had signalled a interest in expanding and that the deal would add to the company’s emerging markets presence.However, investors gave the deal short shrift. Ecolab shares fell 7.6 per cent in morning trade on Wednesday to $51.18, as shareholders questioned the company’s move in branching out from its stable, core business.Analysts pointed to the relatively full price Ecolab was paying for Nalco, in an environment where investors are still wary of transformative deals by companies.Edward Yang, at Oppenheimer, said the price reflected a valuation of about 11 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, before synergies.“It is unclear whether Nalco makes Ecolab better,” wrote Mr Yang in a note. “Growth could accelerate but be more cyclical,’ he added, arguing that Ecolab’s results could become more susceptible to buffeting from raw materials prices.Ecolab said the takeover would lift earnings in 2012 and beyond. The company expects to be able to save $150m in annual costs – a relatively modest target relative to other deals in the sector, said people familiar with the matter, with much of Nalco’s workforce expected to stay in place.Ecolab said the tie-up would result in $1.5bn in revenue from emerging markets, which, Mr Baker said, offered “terrific potential for the combined companies”.Ecolab also announced on Wednesday that it raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share to $2.52-$2.56 from $2.49-$2.53.Nalco was advised by Goldman Sachs. Bank of America advised Ecolab.
4;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2011-06-01T19:26:19Z;Sealed Air wraps up Diversey deal;The acquisition provides Sealed Air with relatively cheap entry into a new area;Journalists seeking cheap puns about a bubble in mergers and acquisitions and spurious claims of diversification were handed a gift with Sealed Air’s agreement to purchase cleaning products company Diversey on Wednesday. Just as obvious, the maker of Bubble Wrap mentioned that the transaction would be accretive in the first year and it trotted out venn diagrams to highlight overlapping customers such as Walmart, Coca-Cola and Tyson Foods. But, in this era of ultra-low interest rates, nearly any deal with a substantial cash component should boost earnings per share initially and it is hardly surprising that two large companies would have customers in common in food manufacturing and retail.The acquisition does provide Sealed Air with relatively cheap entry into a new and not wholly-unrelated area. Though synergies are modest at just $50m per annum or just over 1 per cent of the $4.3bn purchase price, the adjusted trailing multiple of enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation is 8.7 times, about three-quarters of competitors Ecolab and Procter & Gamble. Diversey, which mainly sells hygiene products to large buyers, is less profitable than both, but margins have been on a clear upward trend under the guidance of penny-pinching private equity shareholders.Will Diversey do even better under new ownership or has it already been put in as flattering a condition as possible? That is unclear and Sealed Air’s own spotty record of shareholder wealth generation – essentially zero since the beginning of 2000 – does not inspire. Management would hardly admit that it wants Diversey for growth’s sake or because bankers were dangling cheap financing, but it is hard to avoid that impression. Much like Sealed Air’s most famous product though, the deal only provides a firm underpinning as long as bubbles stay inflated.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
5;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2009-08-31T21:11:45Z;Wall Street falls amid deals;;US stocks fell on Monday amid a flurry of deal-making as investors focused on a further steep decline in Chinese stocks.Walt Disney agreed to buy Marvel Entertainment, the group that created characters such as Spider-Man, for $4bn in cash and stock, sending the shares in the smaller company up 25.1 per cent to $48.33.DreamWorks, a rival of Marvel and maker of the Shrek films, was also up 6.5 per cent to $33.76 on speculation that it might become a takeover target.In one of the sector’s biggest takeovers for the past decade, Baker Hughes, the oilfield services provider, also revealed that it was buying rival BJ Services in a $5.5bn cash-and-stock deal.Shares in BJ Services were up 4.2 per cent at $16.08, while Baker Hughes was down 9.6 per cent to $34.42.But declines on the Chinese stock market set the tone for trading in spite of better-than-expected manufacturing data closer to home from the Chicago index.After the bell in New York, the S&P 500 was down 12.21 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,016.72. The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 27.46 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 2,001.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 90.09 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 9,454.11.Last week, the S&P 500 rose to a high for the year and ended August with a gain of 3.4 per cent. In spite of Monday’s fall, the S&P has recorded a sixth straight month of gains, its best run since June 2006 to January 2007.Oil companies were some of the market’s worst casualties as investors took note of China’s declines and fears about overvalued commodities. ExxonMobil closed down 1.1 per cent to $69.33, while Chevron fell 0.9 per cent to $70.03.Manufacturing and engineering stocks also fell. Caterpillar, which makes mining and forestry machinery, fell 3.0 per cent to $45.29. Boeing was also down 2.6 per cent at $49.70.Cooper Industries, the wrench maker, suffered further from news that it would be replaced by Airgas, the maker of industrial gases, on the S&P 500. Houston-based Cooper has decided to move its headquarters to Ireland, thereby making the company ineligible for the index.Shares in Cooper were 4.0 per cent lower at $32.28, while Airgas closed 1.1 per cent higher at $46.52.Financial stocks – the best-performing sector this month – also fell as August drew to a close.Shares in Citigroup closed down 4.2 per cent to $5.01 and AIG shares were down 10.3 per cent to $45.06 after sharp rises throughout August.Shares in Bank of America fell 2.1 per cent to $17.61 while Fannie was down 5.9 per cent to $1.92.After big rises during the month, Freddie Mac gave back 7.9 per cent to $2.21.Shares in KKR Financial Holdings, the private equity group, were up 18.5 per cent to $3.85 after it was upgraded by JMP Securities, which cited improved liquidity and trends in the credit market.As equity prices often fall in September, the focus is on whether the rally can be sustained. Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citi, said: “There is a tendency for investors to chase stocks higher near year-end and thus, a notable pullback in the September-October timeframe sets things up for a late-year rally.”In the pharmaceutical sector, AstraZeneca closed up 0.7 per cent at $46.61. A study by a British medical journal reported that a blood-thinning pill developed by the company worked better than Plavix, a rival drug made by Sanofi-Aventis.Sanofi was down 1.2 per cent at $34.11 as a result. A decision by the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday to grant Delcath Systems seven years of exclusive marketing for its liver cancer treatment sent the company’s shares up 18.4 per cent to $3.60.Faced with the global declines in stocks, investors looked to healthcare companies in the hope of finding a financial haven.Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, closed up 1.8 per cent at $54.12.Ecolab, which provides cleaning and sanitising products, also ended the day up 0.6 per cent at $42.32.
6;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2008-02-28T03:31:15Z;Henkel and BMW join job cut trend;;German consumer goods group Henkel has joined a growing roster of the nation’s companies cutting jobs to shore up profits as energy and raw-material prices rise and the economic outlook grows more uncertain.Henkel, the maker of Loctite glue and Right Guard deodorants, said it was looking to shed 3,000 jobs globally by 2011.BMW, the world’s largest luxury carmaker, has confirmed plans to cut 8,100 jobs, mostly in Germany.These moves come on top of similar ones by German industrial heavyweights Siemens and Continental, highlighting a – sometimes hard-won – flexibility that has allowed most to report steadily rising profitability in recent years.German companies remain upbeat about the country’s economic outlook as they fear little direct fall-out from the US subprime mortgage crisis or from a recession in the world’s biggest economy that some economists expect.The Ifo survey of the German business climate released this week reported an unexpected second consecutive monthly rise in optimism, indicating that the nation’s companies generally expect to hire rather than fire staff in coming months.Looking ahead, Ulrich Lehner, Henkel’s chief executive, said the group needed to save about €150m ($226m) per year over the next three years to cope with “ever stronger competition” and “markedly rising raw-material costs”.Henkel plans to sell some or all of its 29.4 per cent stake in Ecolab, the US cleaning company, a move that could net more than $1bn at Wednesday’s stock price.Mr Lehner did not specify how job cuts would be spread. But, with 80 per cent of the group’s 53,000 staff employed abroad, most cuts look set to fall outside Germany – a comfort not every chief executive can offer politicians in Berlin.BMW plans to lower purchasing costs by €750m from 2009 and save €500m per year on wages – the latter move breaking a taboo as the group has not resorted to mass redundancy in its home market before.“We realised if we wanted any of our productivity gains to go through to the bottom line we needed to cut jobs,” a supervisory board member said after Norbert Reithofer, chief executive, detailed plans first sketched in December.The company plans to shed 5,000 temporary workers in Germany and a further 2,500 of 80,000 full-time employees there. Abroad, about 600 of the 28,000 employees of the German carmaker will go.BMW aims to become as profitable as Mercedes-Benz after watching its rival pull ahead, and Henkel is emulating bigger rivals Unilever and Procter & Gamble of the US in cutting jobs.
7;ECL;Ecolab Inc;2004-10-07T17:48:03Z;Henkel swaps Clorox stake in US drive;;"Henkel of Germany on Thursday continued its US expansion with an acquisition and an agreement to swap its stake in Clorox, the US cleaning products company, for a combination of operating businesses and cash.Henkel agreed with Clorox to swap a 29 per cent stake in the US company for $2.1bn in cash, plus a stake in a Spanish joint venture and ownership of some Clorox brands.Together with a separate agreement to acquire Sovereign Specialty Chemicals, a US adhesives maker, for about $575m, the agreement boosts the German group's presence in the US following several acquisitions in the past year.Henkel makes Persil washing powder and Pritt Stick glues. Its US drive is key to efforts to reduce its exposure to western Europe, where poor consumer spending and fierce competition prompted it in July to warn that full-year sales would grow only 2 per cent, rather than 3-4 per cent.Henkel's biggest move in the US so far was the $2.9bn acquisition late last year of Dial, the maker of Dial soap and Purex detergents.That came shortly before Henkel paid $200m for Advanced Research Laboratories, a California-based hair care and styling business. Earlier this week, Henkel filed for antitrust approval to take over Orbseal, another US glue maker.Combined, Henkel's US moves will mean about one-quarter of the group's sales will come from North America, up from 12 per cent.Henkel had said it planned to finance the Dial deal in part by divesting its holdings in Clorox or Ecolab, another US cleaning products maker. The Clorox exchange removes the resulting uncertainty.Henkel yesterday confirmed it did not plan to sell its 28 per cent stake in Ecolab for the time being. The transaction also removes the need for Henkel to issue a bond to finance the Dial buy.The total deal is valued at $2.84bn, or $46.25 per Clorox share - a 12.6 per cent discount to the average share price over the previous 60 days. This is partly accounted for by the fact that Henkel expects the exchange to be tax-free.""Given that the deal …is not taxable, the discount of 12.6 per cent is negligible,"" said Christian Weiz at HVB Group."
