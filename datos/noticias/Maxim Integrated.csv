0;MXIM;Maxim Integrated;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Maxim: flame out;The US chipmaker should be thinking again about a sale;Flammable phones at Samsung are bad news for Maxim Integrated Products. The US chipmaker says that the components it supplies to the South Korean group are not the incendiary type.But it will still be hurt by Samsung scrapping the Galaxy Note 7 after repeated fires: Samsung accounted for 14 per cent of last year’s revenues and has been as high as 20 per cent in the past three years.It is a reminder that Maxim, whose enterprise value is $10bn, should be participating in the consolidation of the semiconductor sector — almost certainly as a seller, rather than a buyer.The market for smartphones is saturating and chipmakers need scale to retain pricing power against a concentrated customer base.A deal might already have happened. Last October, Maxim was reported to have received bid interest from Texas Instruments and its shares rose by more than a quarter within a few days. A price could not be agreed. The stock dropped but then recovered slowly.That might appear to give credence to Maxim’s maxim that it is a “growth” company and can thrive on its own. The g-word appeared 28 times during an investor presentation this year, after the sales process had foundered.But it is belied by the financials, which show Maxim bumping along at about $2bn of revenues for the past decade. The Samsung-dominated consumer division is a volatile part of that mix.There are areas of promising growth, however, including its automotive chip business. The prospect of connected cars helped Qualcomm shareholders get excited about a potential deal to buy NXP Semiconductors. But Maxim should focus on the fact that NXP, despite its greater heft, is cited as a potential target. Maxim’s shares, up less than 2 per cent this year, have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which is up 25 per cent. From a deal, and the ashes of Samsung’s doomed device, a bigger and more robust semiconductor company could emerge.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
1;MXIM;Maxim Integrated;2006-09-20T13:51:45Z;Wall Street dips on mix of negative news;;Wall Street finished lower on Tuesday as investor confidence was soured by data showing a precipitous drop in housing starts, a warning on profits from internet group Yahoo, and news of a possible coup in Thailand.Yahoo slumped 11.2 per cent to $25.75, erasing eight weeks of gains, after its chief financial officer said the company’s quarterly results would be at the bottom end of a previously forecast range, due to slowing advertising demand.The news also dragged down other internet stocks. Google shed 2.6 per cent to $403.81, and Ebay sank 3.3 per cent to $25.95.Crude oil prices tumbled, as high inventories helped ease supply worries. The front-month Nymex contract lost 3.2 per cent to $61.66 a barrel, its biggest single day decline since May. Valero slid 4.3 per cent to $50.10, and Devon Energy lost 3.8 per cent to $64.32.Mining stocks were also hurt by falls in copper and gold prices. Barrick Gold sank 4.1 per cent to $28.76, and Freeport McMoran also slipped 4.1 per cent to $51.26.Semiconductor group Maxim Integrated Products lowered its revenue and earnings guidance for the fiscal first quarter due to sluggish orders. Its shares fell 4.9 per cent to $29.84. The stock has fallen 17 per cent since the start of the year.Time Warner announced that its strategy of not charging its AOL broadband subscribers access fees was succeeding in attracting new internet users.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.1 per cent, or 14.09 points, to 11,540.91.The producer price index – a measure of inflation at the wholesale level – fell more than expected in August, boosting investor confidence that further interest rate increases were not on the horizon.However, housing starts fell 6 per cent in August, more than twice as much as expected. The steep decline in housing starts followed a report on Monday that sh owed confidence among homebuilders at a 15-year low.Uncertainty deepened after the Thai military was reported to have declared martial law and to have announced a suspension of the constitution.Pharmaceuticals group ImClone Systems tumbled 4.5 per cent to $29.16 after a New York judge ruled that three Israeli scientists from the Yeda research institute were the true inventors of a process used to create its cancer drug Erbitux.“Last night’s development is the worst possible scenario for ImClone, since Yeda, as sole inventors, might be entitled to large-sum damages,” said Yaron Werber of Citigroup, who reiterated a “sell” rating on the stock.

CSFB said in its report.The brokerage also suggested Intel and Advanced Micro Devices faced challenges next year as they transitioned to dual-core processors, the equivalent of putting two chips in one package.?We believe dual core will require heightened execution and yield risk (more complex architecture with two cores that need to yield) increasing the chance for an operational miscue in (the second half of 2005) from product delays,? CSFB said.
