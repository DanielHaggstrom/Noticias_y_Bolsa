0;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;US power producers: coal hearted  ;Mr Trump’s contempt for losers does not apply universally;President Donald Trump’s distaste for “losers” is well-documented. Yet his administration retains some sympathy for coal energy companies losing out to the growing demand for cheap natural gas, wind and solar power. FirstEnergy Solutions, a power generator based in Republican-voting Ohio, filed for bankruptcy over the weekend. But not before trying for a bailout.Before the financial crisis, so-called “competitive” or “merchant” power producers were Wall Street darlings. These businesses speculated on spot power prices, betting that they would keep on rising. But power demand collapsed during the crisis. In its aftermath, the focus on energy efficiency, weak demand growth, and explosion in natural gas production have all conspired to keep prices down. The likes of FirstEnergy, the parent of FES, have scrambled to re-jig operations around regulated activities of power transmission and distribution that are guaranteed a healthy return.FirstEnergy took a $2.5bn equity investment from an investor group led by Elliott Management to fund its transition to a fully-regulated company in January. The units that have filed for bankruptcy include several coal and nuclear plants. Crucially, the bankruptcy does not touch the regulated FirstEnergy business, whose market cap is $16bn. The parent company’s explicit and tacit support of FES had weighed on its shares and bonds over the years. Yet since the Elliott investment and the company’s clear goal of shedding the unregulated subsidiary, FirstEnergy shares are up nearly a fifth.Last autumn, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry proposed a bailout for coal and nuclear producers. Energy prices would be set in such a way as to ensure the profitability of legacy power plants. Earlier this year, the energy regulator declined to adopt Mr Perry’s plan. Unbowed, FirstEnergy last week asked for a state of emergency to be declared in FirstEnergy’s power market — thus allowing it be better compensated. The likes of FirstEnergy and the private equity firms behind the failed $45bn TXU buyout gambled and lost by not anticipating how radically America’s energy markets would evolve. Now they seek the protection of the government (and ratepayers). The immense innovation in energy in recent years makes such largesse unnecessary. Mr Trump should not ride to the rescue of FirstEnergy or any similar “losers”.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

1;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rising interest rates punish US power sector;Heavily indebted utilities shore up balance sheets as financing costs increase;US utilities, sustained for years in a warm bath of favourable financial conditions, are facing a cold shower.An expected rise in interest rates and the shake-up of the tax system passed into law at the end of last year are threatening to squeeze utilities’ finances. Already, the S&P 500 utility sector index has dropped 13 per cent from its peak in November.Duke Energy, one of the largest US utility groups by market capitalisation, on Tuesday gave an indication of the changing times, saying it planned to raise $2bn from selling shares this year and would cut its five-year capital spending plan by $1bn. Lynn Good, chief executive, said the share sale was needed “to maintain the strength of our balance sheet”.FirstEnergy, another large utility, last month announced a $2.5bn investment in shares and convertible preferred shares, backed by investors including Elliott Management and GIC, to pay off debt, contribute to its pension fund, and “strengthen the company’s investment-grade balance sheet”. The colder financial climate is expected to prompt other utilities to rethink their capital allocation, pushing some of them towards disposals or acquisitions.An immediate impact from expectations of rising interest rates has been to make utilities less attractive investment propositions. Listed utility groups generally make most of their income from regulated assets, which means that their earnings and dividend payments are steadier and more reliable. That makes their shares behave more like bonds.In a note on Wednesday, strategists at JPMorgan listed 50 “bond proxies” that were “stocks to avoid in a rising rate environment”. More than half of them were utilities, including Duke, Exelon, NextEra Energy and American Electric Power.Beyond the “bond proxy” effect, higher interest rates also threaten to disturb the cosy financial equilibrium that has supported US utility companies through a turbulent time for their industry. Demand for electricity in the US is stagnating: total power consumption was slightly lower last year than in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, there has been a dramatic shift in the fuel mix. Since 2010 the proportion of US electricity generated by coal-fired plants has dropped from 45 per cent to 30 per cent, while the proportion from gas rose from 24 per cent to 32 per cent and the proportion from renewables rose from 4 per cent to 10 per cent.But through all that, the US utility industry has been able to prosper. The sector index rose 82 per cent from the start of 2010 to November 2017. The relatively comfortable position of US utilities has been in sharp contrast to their European peers, which have undergone a gruelling decade of financial pressures and forced restructuring.A key reason for that has been the low cost of two of the US industry’s principal inputs: natural gas, and money. Utilities have been able to keep regulators happy with modest increases in rates, while increasing their earnings and dividends. Gas seems set to stay cheap but the cost of money is rising.Although many US utilities are heavily indebted, there is no imminent financing crisis looming. The utilities in the S&P 500 have debt with an average maturity of 14.5 years, JPMorgan calculates, and only 19 per cent of their debt matures by 2020. Over time, however, rising interest rates will put upward pressure on their costs. In their regulated businesses, the utilities should be able to recover those increased costs from their customers. But the more companies try to raise rates, the greater the risk that they will face challenges from regulators.The problem is compounded by the impact of the new corporate tax system. The changes are complex and will affect different companies in different ways, but one common effect of the system is that it squeezes the utilities’ cash flows.The main rate of corporate tax has been cut from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and regulators are expected to insist that customers benefit from that reduction with lower bills. In the long run, companies will be able to recoup the lost income, according to Todd Shipman of S&P Global Ratings. “Rates will be lower today and then higher in the future,” he says. In the short run, however, the loss of revenue means that cash flows will be squeezed. The result is likely to be that some utilities’ credit ratings will be cut, Mr Shipman says. “I don’t expect a lot, but there almost inevitably will be some.”Merger and acquisition activity in US utilities slowed sharply last year after a hectic 2016. This year, rising interest rates could help spur a revival in dealmaking, according to Kenyon Willhoit of PwC, the professional services group. Some companies will be prompted to sell assets to reinforce their balance sheets, while others will see opportunities to buy.“It provides another reason for utilities to look to the merger and acquisition market to supply additional growth,” Mr Willhoit says.
2;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2017-12-05T05:15:25Z;Investors fail to back votes on greater climate change disclosure;Vanguard, BlackRock and BNY Mellon have weak record holding US utilities to account;The world’s largest asset managers have failed to back motions seeking greater climate change disclosure at America’s biggest utility groups, putting a question mark over the depth of their commitment to combating the issue.Vanguard, BlackRock, BNYMellon and Invesco all voted against resolutions aimed at forcing the companies to report on how efforts to keep a global temperature rise this century to below 2 degrees Celsius will affect them, according to Preventable Surprises, a campaign group.The 2 degree limit, above pre-industrial levels, was the benchmark agreed by global leaders in Paris in 2015.Nine of the 10 big investors examined by Preventable Surprises are signatories to the UN’s responsible investment initiative, the Principles for Responsible Investment, which includes a pledge that they will “seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest”.However an analysis of shareholder votes at this year’s annual meetings showed they have a mixed scorecard when it comes to holding US utilities to account.Nine of the ten biggest groups — including FirstEnergy, Dominion Energy and Southern — had resolutions for greater climate change disclosure in the spring of 2017, eight of which failed to pass.Vanguard, BlackRock and BNY Mellon voted against all nine resolutions.“Some investment firms’ proxy voting lacks the sense of urgency required for transitioning to a 2°C economy,” the report said. “Public support of shareholder resolutions at laggard companies is critical because behind-closed-doors engagement lacks transparency, accountability and meaningful metrics.”Northern Trust was the only investor to consistently support increased disclosure on climate risk according to Preventable Surprises.Utility groups accounted for 63 per cent of CO2 emissions reported to the US’s Environmental Protection Agency last year, compared to 15 per cent from the oil and gas sector.There is increasing pressure on energy companies to spell out their financial exposure to climate change.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that investors face “potentially huge” losses due to tougher rules to curb climate change and a task force by the G20’s Financial Stability Board has recommended that listed companies disclose their exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities.Yet the voting record of big investors for utilities this year stands in contrast to that for energy groups.Rob Main, head of company engagement and voting for Vanguard, said the $4.7tn asset manager’s preferred approach was to press for change in face-to-face meetings with company executives. “It is important for us to see how companies are assessing this kind of risk,” he said. “We do believe we can have significant impact through engagement.”BlackRock also stressed its belief that engagement with companies can lead to positive changes.BNY Mellon Investment Management said each of its investment boutiques made “investment and proxy voting decisions that are in the best economic interest of the client, consistent with each particular client’s investment guidelines, rather than BNY Mellon’s,” but added that the group was “an advocate for climate change action”.Invesco declined to comment.BlackRock and Vanguard were among those earlier his year which stepped up pressure on US energy companies to address the risks associated with climate change. In votes at seven of the largest US energy companies, the 30 largest investors switched their votes to support disclosure on climate risk, having opposed similar resolutions a year earlier, according to a recent study.
3;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2017-11-04T07:00:43Z;Trump’s backing counts little for coal lobbyists;US president’s bailout is meeting resistance from unexpected sources, says John Dizard;There are so many burdens on the president of the US, from outside-counsel bills to jet lag. You would think he could be allowed more satisfying displays of power than handing out pens at signing ceremonies. Yet it appears Donald Trump will not even be able to order a regulatory bailout for his friends in the coal mining and generation business, along with their investors and lenders.Back in August, according to a letter from Robert Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy, to Rick Perry, the energy secretary, Mr Murray and Charles Jones, chief executive of FirstEnergy Corp, met with the president. They urged him to dictate that the federal government order grid operators to keep buying power from merchant coal plants.As Mr Murray memorialised, the president turned to Mr Perry and said: “Tell [White House economics tsar Gary] Cohn to do whatever these two want him to do.”The president, along with Mr Murray and Mr Jones, must have felt good at that moment. And the president’s command appeared to have worked, up to a point.The coal guys did not get the precise emergency order they requested. They did, though, get an order from Mr Perry to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to go through an urgent (60 day) rulemaking procedure that would consider “final action” to keep otherwise uneconomic coal and nuclear plants in service.The order from Secretary Perry read almost as though it was drafted by one of FirstEnergy’s lawyers, or former lawyers. Industry people say that 90 per cent of the proposed rule’s requirements would apply only within the PJM regional grid, where FirstEnergy’s merchant coal fleet operates.It uses the now politically correct term “resilience” as its goal, by keeping “fuel-secure” plants in operation. Those are defined as generators that keep at least 90 days of fuel on site. Smaller, older coal plants such as those owned by FirstEnergy’s failing merchant generation subsidiary meet that description, as do nuclear plants.According to Mr Murray’s letter (leaked by some Swamp person), if FirstEnergy’s coal plants shut down, the loss in coal sales would bankrupt Murray Energy. The private company’s condition did sound pretty dire, with just over $4bn in debt and $7bn in other obligations, $150m in near-term maturities and more than 5,000 dependent employees.Even the announcement of FERC’s rulemaking process brought the company closer to a normal existence. By the end of last month, those debt maturities no longer seemed to be much of a problem, and it acquired three more coal mines in Utah. I contacted Murray Energy to see how that had been done, but my call was not returned.In a recent analyst call, FirstEnergy’s Mr Jones expressed optimism about the outcome of the FERC rulemaking process, which has a December 11 deadline. Even if a FERC order keeps the plants open, making them more valuable, Mr Jones says FirstEnergy plans either to sell them or transfer them to creditors.I can understand why Mr Jones and Mr Murray would try to redeem their political promissory notes from Mr Trump. Requiring the public to buy your product can be an attractive solution to cash flow problems.However, I believe it is unlikely that the Trump-Perry-FERC play will work in the end. The proposed bailout rulemaking has generated, so to speak, too much countervailing pressure. I am not talking here about environmental activists, “Obama hold­overs” or renewable-energy developers, though all of those do of course oppose Mr Jones and Mr Murray.Rather, FirstEnergy and Mr Murray have already been sold out by their friends in the energy industry. Formally, FERC is seriously considering Secretary Perry’s proposed rule. I believe it would be more accurate to say that the commissioners are trying to figure out how to recycle all the useless paper and electron flows created by this exercise.Influential natural-gas producers, owners of gas-fired merchant generation and even some of the coal plant owners are intent on blocking the Perry proposal. The north-eastern US just has more electric generation capacity than it needs. If FirstEnergy’s old coal plants are kept in service, there is less energy demand left for everyone else.The PJM grid’s independent market monitor, Joseph Bowring, filed scathing comments with the FERC on the Perry rule. Secretary Perry claimed that when a “polar vortex” slips back down from Canada as it did in 2014, the north-east will need all that “resilient” coal plant, since gas capacity was forced out of service back then. Mr Bowring pointed to a chart that shows “the coal outage MW rise with the gas outage MW . . . all unit types are affected by extreme weather.”So no, we do not have to keep old coal plants, and the associated coal mines, for technical reasons. Mr Bowring recommends that: “The DoE proposal should be rejected.”While the nuclear industry’s lobbyists are nominally supporting the Trump/Perry bailout, they may not be entirely sincere. Less coal capacity in the north-east means more ratepayer money going to their employers.The lesson is that even large contributors with voting blocs the president really likes may not get what they bargained for. Trump’s coal guys are likely to wind up as momentary bubbles on the surface of the Swamp.
4;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Energy share rally shores up broad market;Technology sector under further pressure after Apple disappoints with earnings and sales miss;US energy shares strengthened for a second day, shoring up lacklustre performance in the broader stock market.The S&P 500 energy sector was up 1.7 per cent on Wednesday, and has risen 13.7 per cent so far this year, outperforming other big groups and the broad market. Producers and drilling companies continue attracting buyers on expectations that oversupplied petroleum markets may strike a balance later in the year.That view was supported on Wednesday from oil prices, which managed to shrug off a government report showing US crude stocks had ascended to the highest levels since 1929.Anadarko Petroleum, a large independent oil and gas producer, was among the biggest leaders in the sector, as its shares climbed 4.6 per cent to $54.78. Another large producer, Devon Energy, was 6.6 per cent higher at $36.91.Shares of some oilfield service companies also rose. Transocean, which operates offshore rigs on behalf of producers, shot up 8.1 per cent to $11.16. National Oilwell Varco, another service company hit hard by the oil price collapse of the past two years, rose 7.9 per cent to $31.70 after Morgan Stanley upgraded its stock, citing a “lack of further negative catalysts” and calling it a “top contrarian pick”.Utility stocks also rose, propelled by a positive earnings surprise from a leading power company. FirstEnergy, which transports and sells electricity across the eastern US, climbed 4.8 per cent to $36.05 after reporting better than expected results, while peer CenterPoint Energy added 1.6 per cent to $21.43 and NRG Energy rose 3 per cent to $14.98.The positive performance of companies producing and distributing energy were a bright spot on an otherwise sluggish day for US equities, weighed down by disappointing quarterly results from companies. Stocks also flucuated following the release of April’s Federal Reserve statement, which signalled the Fed’s concerns about global economic risks have eased.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,095.15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 18,041.55 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was off 0.5 per cent to 4,863.14.Among the steepest falls in tech shares was iPhone maker Apple, which dropped 6.3 per cent to $97.82 after reporting its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years. Google parent Alphabet dropped 0.5 per cent to $721.46, while Twitter sank 16.3 per cent to $14.86. Barclays said Twitter’s ability to make money from its popular messaging platform “continues to be a challenge as revenue growth continues to disappoint”.Shares of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange and futures bourses, was 0.4 per cent lower at $243.49 after UK competition authorities opened an in-depth investigation into its purchase of a European energy trading platform.Nasdaq, its biggest rival among equities exchanges, slipped 0.4 per cent to $64.13 after strong US equity trading volumes led to record first-quarter earnings.Makers of car parts weakened as Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 7.4 per cent to $30.34 a share after sales fell short of expectations. BorgWarner, which reports results on Thursday, slid 3.3 per cent to $38.64.
5;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2016-04-14T17:32:47Z;Norway’s oil fund jettisons coal-linked investments;Sovereign wealth fund will no longer invest in 52 companies that are too reliant on the fossil fuel;Norway’s $860bn oil fund will no longer put money into 52 companies for being too reliant on coal in one of the biggest ever fossil fuel-related divestment by a single investor.The world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund is no longer able to invest in a number of companies including Drax in the UK, AES, Dynegy and FirstEnergy in the US, Reliance Power and Tata Power in India, and a string of Chinese groups.The news sparked an angry response from Drax, which has spent the last four years converting nearly half its massive North Yorkshire coal-fired power station — the largest in the UK — so it can burn wood pellets instead of coal.“It seems simply wrong. We have implemented the largest decarbonisation project in Europe,” said Drax chief executive, Dorothy Thompson.“We have actually been very vocal in our view that the future of coal is finite and the future is renewable,” she said, adding Drax had been trying to talk to the Norwegian fund for some time but had failed to make contact.The oil fund, which has held shares in Drax since 2005 and had a $51m stake in 2014, said it had written to all companies affected by its decision. “We sent out 50 letters and only received five replies. Drax was not among those that replied,” it said.The move comes four months after a landmark global agreement on climate change in Paris and highlights how seriously investors are now taking the debate on fossil fuels and potential stranded assets. The Norwegian fund’s decision is all the more striking because it derives its funding from petroleum revenues.Norway’s parliament last year ordered the oil fund to sell out of companies in which more than 30 per cent of revenues or activities are derived from coal. The oil fund said it had sold out of 28 of the 52 companies last year as part of risk-based divestments. The oil fund on Thursday warned that “several more” rounds of exclusions would follow this year as it analysed all of its nearly 10,000 holdings. The latest decisions almost double the number of companies the oil fund is not allowed to invest in. Previous exclusions have included tobacco companies, nuclear weapons producers, and individual cases such as Walmart for serious violations of human rights. The oil fund has long been seen as one of the pioneers of responsible or ethical investing and it has stepped up its work in recent years. It now plays a more active role in the selection of board directors in many European countries and has begun to publish some of its voting intentions ahead of annual meetings, instead of just disclosing its votes afterwards. But its most visible symbol of responsible investing remains exclusions, as dictated by its owner, the Norwegian people via the local parliament. Among the exclusions on Thursday was Peabody Energy, the coal miner that this week filed for bankruptcy protection. Other exclusions include: China Coal Energy, China Power International Development, China Resources Power Holdings, China Shenhua Energy, Datang International Power Generation, and Yanzhou Coal Mining. Exxaro Resources from South Africa, Coal India and Gujarat Mineral Development from India, Hokkaido and Okinawa Electric Power from Japan, New Hope and Whitehaven Coal in Australia were also excluded. Norway’s parliament considered whether to stop investing in all fossil fuel companies — including oil and gas producers — but decided against it. Some opposition parties have called for it to ban investments in tax havens following the release of the Panama Papers.

7;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2015-08-31T16:29:32Z;Twitter lifted as bank’s analysts warm to prospects with upgrade;US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from Chicago and Texas;Twitter shares were buoyed on Monday by an upgrade from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, as analysts with the bank warm to the company’s prospects and depressed stock price.Shares in the San Francisco-based group advanced 3.5 per cent to $27.78 after Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust, lifted his rating.Mr Peck said that the recent all-time low in Twitter shares, which saw its stock drop below its initial public offering pricing in November 2013, “provide a buying opportunity with: sentiment at a low, potential leadership and board stabilisation, user and monetisation catalysts coming shortly, and an attractive valuation.”Twitter shares have moved erratically since the year began, as investors fret that it will fail to add new users at the same pace it did when it floated.In its latest quarter, the company reported a 61 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier, while its loss narrowed. However, user growth slowed to less than 1 per cent from the first quarter.Planet Fitness climbed 6 per cent to $17.81 after all nine investment banks that underwrote the initial public offering of the chain of budget gyms initiated coverage with ‘buy’ or buy-equivalent ratings, including Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Jefferies.Price targets from the nine banks ranged from $19 to $25 a share, compared to the $16 price the company sold shares for this August.Analysts with Baird said that Planet Fitness had created a “disruptive model” poised to take market share, while those with Jefferies said it was the “logical beneficiary of favourable industry trends given its extensive store base, compelling value proposition and brand strength.”“Planet Fitness disrupted the $23bn US health club industry when the company launched its high-value, low-price business model, helping to create a fundamental shift in how consumers are spending their exercise dollars,” said Jerry Gray, an analyst with Cowen & Company.JC Penney shares rose 2 per cent to $9.11 after analysts with Deutsche Bank upgraded the department store chain to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ on the view same-store sales and margins will improve.“New chief executive Marvin Ellison is now driving the next step of applying the science of retail to bring JC Penney up the curve in pricing and markdown optimisation,” said Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche.Rival chains fell on Monday, with Dillard’s down 0.3 per cent to $92.51 and Sears Holdings dropping 2.2 per cent to $26.71.Netflix shares slid 2 per cent to $115.35 after the company said it would not renew its licensing deal with Epix over the weekend, removing blockbuster titles such as Hunger Games: Catching Fire, World War Z and Transformers: Age of Extinction from its US service at the end of September.Utilities were the worst performing industry on Monday, with the S&P 500 utility index sliding 1.6 per cent to 214.28 following comments from policymakers on Saturday that the US central bank could raise rates in September.Duke Energy slid 2 per cent to $70.91, Exelon declined 2 per cent to $30.76 and FirstEnergy weakened 1.6 per cent to $31.96.Overall, US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from the Greater Chicago and Texas regions.The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,972.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 16,528.03.

8;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2015-06-18T16:17:48Z;Dragon Oil: minority retort;All is not well in the beast’s lair;"Dragon Oil drills for its oil where most do not, Turkmenistan. For those keen on this central Asian country’s hydrocarbon potential, the company’s shares provide a scarce direct investment opportunity. That perhaps explains why its largest shareholder (54 per cent), the Emirates National Oil Company of Dubai, has repeatedly tried to buy out the minority investors. On Monday, Dragon Oil accepted a cash bid from ENOC at 750p per share, 47 per cent above the undisturbed price.One of the minorities, Baillie Gifford, said on Thursday that the price was still too cheap. In 2009 it helped to block ENOC from buying out minorities for the same reason, at 455p. ENOC did not lose heart. In March it proposed 650p, which it increased to 735p in May. Baillie Gifford no doubt senses it has the upper hand and wants more.It makes the point that Dragon Oil has been improving production in recent years using enhanced oil recovery, which involves pumping water into the oil reservoirs. Dragon’s output by 2016 should rise by a third from 2014 levels, to more than 100,000 barrels per day, says FirstEnergy. Baillie thinks there may be potential beyond that. It points out that Dragon is installing large pipelines — far larger than current production requires — to transport oil from offshore wells, and that it is also building storage facilities.Yet there may be a more straightforward reason for the big pipes. Driving the oil out of the ground with water suggests that the reservoir pressure has waned; a peak in production should follow. By enhancing output this way, water mixes with the oil in rising proportions over time. That means more fluids need to be moved to onshore processing plants — to separate oil from water — over the coming decade. That would explain the need for the large pipes.Baillie Gifford have in effect pumped up ENOC’s bid and done all minority shareholders a favour. But, given the uncertain outlook for the oil price, 750p looks fair.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
9;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity.

10;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Big six energy suppliers lose out as customers switch allegiance;Independent operators are gaining market share from incumbent utility groups;As government ministers and regulators promote the notion of shopping around beyond the big six energy suppliers to cut household bills, the evidence is that consumers are voting with their feet.The market share of competitors to the UK’s big six gas and electricity suppliers has jumped from 3 per cent to 9 per cent since last year, according to industry body Energy UK. This suggests that – beyond the persistent criticism suggesting lack of competition in the sector – some structural change and challenge to incumbent suppliers has been brought to bear.In September First Utility announced it had breached the 1m mark of customer accounts giving it a 2 per cent market share, establishing it as the leading challenge to the big six providers led by Centrica. As recently as three years ago, major suppliers commanded more than 99 per cent of the household market. Higher volumes of consumers were switching then, but merely from one big six supplier to another.Ovo Energy, the second-ranked challenger to the big six comprising Centrica-owned British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, EDF, Npower and Eon, has also nearly trebled its customer base to 400,000 customers, operating 750,000 electricity and gas accounts over the past year.However, the surge in switching away from the big six and the market share gains by challengers has not lessened complaints from new entrants that incumbent suppliers – in effect a range of UK and foreign companies that have acquired Britain’s electricity retail businesses alongside former state monopoly British Gas – still have the advantage because customers, for whatever reason, fail to shop around.Darren Braham, founder and chief financial officer at First Utility, which is backed by Morgan Stanley and Shell, points out the paradox that switching rates between gas and electricity suppliers have been falling in recent years “not withstanding that savings are considerably bigger”.These potential savings have been consistently broadcast by the UK’s energy secretary Ed Davey and other ministers. However, government data also show that in spite of the occasional bout of account switching such as that provoked by last autumn’s round of inflation-busting tariff rises across the sector, two-fifths of the UK public have never switched supplier.Ian McCaig, First Utility’s chief executive, argues that recent retail market reforms introduced by industry regulator Ofgem to simplify billing and tackle confusion over tariffs has still left a flawed market requiring further correction.Large suppliers can still offer well-priced deals to those most prone to shop around – sometimes through “white label” offers marketed through supermarket chains – while leaving the bulk of their customer base on less competitive deals.Persistent attacks by politicians and concerns expressed by Ofgem itself promoted the UK’s energy supply market to be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority for full investigation earlier this year. That probe has also been asked to look at whether the power generation businesses owned by the big six also operate against creating a level playing field for the growing number of independent operators seeking to grow their presence in the retail market.Whatever the outcome of that probe, independents are determined to take advantage of the unpopularity of the big six while they can. While switching rates are down, the historical pattern of consumers switching between the big six has been broken, with half or more of customers now moving to one of 20 alternative suppliers.According to Guy Newey, Ovo’s head of policy: “People have got totally fed up with the big six – something has clinked in their heads. The political debate has driven switching.”Ovo is attempting to extend its reach with its own take on the “white label” tie-ups between the big six and retailers such as those between British Gas and J Sainsbury and SSE and Marks and Spencer.Last month, it launched Plymouth Energy Community through a tie-up with Plymouth Council, the first of a number of other promotional links it is seeking with local councils aimed at promoting Ovo over incumbents.Meanwhile, as the CMA deliberates on whether to take radical action to shake up the energy market, Ofgem has been left defending its own actions to encourage price competition while encouraging consumers to shop around.Neil Barnes, associate director of markets at Ofgem, says independents that until last year were taking just a sixth of customers switching suppliers, are now taking half or more.He also argues that in the past, a large percentage of switching was generated by over-aggressive doorstep selling by the big six – a practice that has led to multimillion pound penalties for those involved.“We want people switching to better deals and not switching to worse deals as has happened in the past,” says Mr Barnes. Overall churn rates should not be taken as a crude indicator of whether an acceptably competitive market exists, he adds.“A market with six players and switching rates at 10 per cent a year could well be effectively competitive,” he says. And yet less than half of people trust their energy supplier, notes Mr Barnes, while Ofgem has also expressed its concerns to the CMA over whether a number of barriers of entry still persist to restrict a level playing field in the market.“It’s too early to say whether there’s been the structural change in the market we would like to see,” says Mr Barnes.Energy UK, the body that represents both large and small suppliers in the sector, treads a delicate line in welcoming the gradual shift to independents. A report commissioned by it released in October shows the number of independent suppliers now stands at an all-time high of 25 and suggested a growing trend of competition as measured by academic measures of market concentration.According to Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK: “The growth of small suppliers is a clear sign customers are reacting to the range of choice on offer to them from companies large and small. In a sector with 27m customers, market shares don’t change overnight.”——————————————-This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
11;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2012-08-05T19:02:59Z;Gunvor coal mine venture hit by woes;;When Gunvor, one of the world’s largest energy traders, invested $400m in a troubled Montana coal mine, it looked like a promising deal. The plan was to sell much of the coal to the booming Asian market, where it was fetching far more than the prevailing price in the US.The deal in October 2011 delivered impressive profits to the mine’s previous owners, a rare financial success in America’s depressed coal industry. It also set the mine on course to more than double production this year compared with last year, at a time when total US coal production is falling.But shipping coal to the Asia-Pacific region was not as straightforward as it seemed. Gunvor expanded from its core of trading oil into other energy sectors just as the price of coal in the US, Asia and elsewhere tumbled in part because US power plants were burning cheaper natural gas. Now, the Geneva-based company is battling unexpected economic, political and legal headwinds in the US.Privately held Gunvor and the two other owners of the Montana mine, called Signal Peak, are embroiled in a legal dispute over royalty payments. The mine has also bid on federal and state coal tracts, thrusting Gunvor into a debate raging in America over whether governments are getting a fair price for US coal reserves.Industry experts say Gunvor bought the mine at the height of the market. “The timing of the deal was terrible,” said a senior coal trader with a rival trading house. “They overpaid.”In a statement last month, Gunvor defended “Signal Peak’s long-term value,” noting both the quality of the coal and the quantity – enough for the mine to keep producing for roughly 30 years.One of the trading house’s two principal owners is Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire who has known Russian president Vladimir Putin since both men were based in St Petersburg in the 1980s. Gunvor grew rapidly from a niche player in the Russian oil markets in the early 2000s to one of the largest global trading firms, reporting sales of over $80bn last year. Privately held Gunvor does not disclose profits, but trading houses generally have low margins.A big beneficiary of the Gunvor investment has been FirstEnergy, the utility based in Ohio, which had owned half the Signal Peak mine with privately held Boich Companies, also based in Ohio. Each company sold a percentage of its stake to Gunvor so that the three are now equal owners. FirstEnergy’s public filings show its gains from the sale to Gunvor: it acquired the mine for $133.5m in 2008. With its sale to Gunvor it booked a pre-tax profit of $569m and $260m in cash.The price for US thermal coal – the kind produced at Signal Peak and other mines in the Powder River Basin in the western US – has declined in key Asian countries. Federal energy agency data show China’s price per ton of US thermal coal in the first quarter of 2012 plunged to $56 from $121 in the first quarter of 2011.Gunvor became an equal partner with FirstEnergy and Boich by paying $400m for its third of the mine. Each must approve the hiring of key mining executives, can veto big financial transactions and is a co-guarantor on a credit extension, public filings show.Such details can determine whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS, reviews a deal. The federal panel, which examines the security implications of foreign investment in the US, considers factors including whether a foreigner has control over financial or managerial decisions. The government has broad powers to initiate a review and in the past has interpreted “control” to mean less than 50% ownership. In this case, the deal has not been reviewed, said FirstEnergy spokeswoman Tricia Ingraham. “The parties did not believe the deal rose to the level of requiring it,” she said.The US government has considerable flexibility in determining the kinds of deal meriting CFIUS review, according to lawyers who handle such cases. Some previous acquisitions of coal assets by foreigners, including one involving a Russian entity, have gone through the CFIUS process.Gunvor included “a substantial coal purchase agreement” in the deal, according to a statement by the company’s lawyers, and the mine has increased production. Signal Peak produced 3.82m tonnes in the first quarter of 2012, compared with just 4.66m tonnes in all of 2011, according to the US federal mine data.Gunvor’s purchase agreement with Signal Peak has riled former owners of the mine, who sold it to FirstEnergy and Boich and have been reaping royalties from coal sold from the mine since then. Those owners have filed suit in federal court to argue the fairness of the set price used to calculate their royalties.The royalty holders claim the Signal Peak price should be based on an arm’s length transaction. They contend the current owners have used insider transactions, which artificially lower the sale price and reduce the royalties. The current owners have filed for dismissal of the suit.Gunvor’s lawyers argue the claims are baseless in part because the company has “an extremely remote connection at best” to the litigation. Gunvor, they say, “has never and does not presently conduct business in the State of Montana.” Gunvor purchased Signal Peak through an American subsidiary.Signal Peak is pushing ahead with expansion plans, which has also made it part of an industry-wide debate over the price at which the government sells coal. Signal Peak recently paid $10.5m to the federal Bureau of Land Management for the right to lease a nearby tract containing 31.75m tonnes of coal.Critics had argued against the proposed lease, complaining the price was too low given the likely export of the coal.……………………………………………………………..This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
12;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2012-01-03T22:18:50Z;Miners rally on Chinese economic data;;Energy and material stocks gave Wall Street a new year bounce as miners and steelmakers rallied on economic data from China.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China for use in steelmaking, climbed 8 per cent to $22.07 after the official Chinese purchasing managers’ index moved back above 50 for December, suggesting China’s factories expanded output. US Steel Corp climbed 5.9 per cent to $28.03.The S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent to 1,277.05, led by financials, with Citigroup climbing 7.7 per cent to $28.33 and Morgan Stanley up 6.3 per cent to $16.08The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 12,397.31 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.7 per cent to 2,648.72.“Technically, stocks enjoy a seasonal tailwind early in the first quarter,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, who said the S&P 500 could be set for “an attack on the 1,300 area” if cyclical sectors rally.Oil explorers and producers gained as the price of crude oil rose after Iran made threats over a US aircraft carrier near its waters.Driller and oilfield services provider Nabors Industries jumped 9.7 per cent to $19.02 for the best performance in the S&P 500 and oil producer Denbury Resources climbed 7.9 per cent to $16.29.A rash of joint venture deals announced between US explorers and foreign companies provided more evidence of rising prices for drilling rights in booming shale plays.Chesapeake Energy closed up 5.9 per cent to $23.60, after announcing a joint venture with French oil group Total.Chesapeake’s Total deal comes on top of existing joint ventures with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation but, despite the company’s apparent ability to generate cash from its shale acquisitions, its share price has fallen significantly over the past year.Analysts point to the company’s failure to bring its debt level to less than $10bn.“The key now will be to see how much [of the Total deal] flows through to debt reduction,” said Tim Rezvan at Sterne Agee. “Spending has been out of control at Chesapeake without the transparency of other companies,” he added.Devon Energy climbed 6.6 per cent to $66.11 after announcing a transaction with Sinopec International, another Chinese oil company, which will take a one-third interest in five separate Devon ventures for $2.2bn.Oilfield services provider Halliburton was a rare faller, closing 1 per cent lower at $34.15, as BPproceeded with plans to recover all costs related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from the company.A Washington court’s decision to delay implementation of Environmental Protection Agency rules on interstate air pollution wreaked havoc among coal miners and utilities.The EPA rules, which were meant to be effective from January 1, aim to curb mercury and sulphur emissions from power stations.Coal miner Peabody Energy rose 8.8 per cent to $36.01, while Consol Energy, which operates coal-fired power stations, climbed 6.1 per cent to $38.93.But not all analysts were convinced by the rally. “This is just a temporary reprieve,” said Brandon Blossman, of Tudor Pickering. “Clean air regulations have been moving along for the last 30 years and this is just the latest incarnation. The industry is not going to reverse the trend.”Non-coal utilities had rallied strongly since the EPA first announced the new clean air rules on December 21, but gave up gains on Tuesday. Gas focused Public Service Enterprise Group fell 3.6 per cent to $31.81 and FirstEnergy fell 3.4 per cent to $42.81.Wynn Resorts climbed 3.2 per cent to $113.97. The casino and resort company was boosted by news that gaming revenues in Macao had surged in 2011.Fears that scarcer credit in China would lead to a fall in junket tourism by Chinese businesses to Macao had weighed heavily on Wynn in 2011.Shares in Tenet Healthcare slumped 3.3 per cent to $4.96 as Citigroup analysts downgraded the stock and told clients to brace themselves for “a long bear market in US entitlement spending”.Gary Taylor, of Citigroup, said Medicare-exposed companies could suffer revenue squeezes as healthcare spending becomes a target of government spending cuts.Barclays Capital analysts were bullish on semiconductor stocks, arguing that manufacturers have almost completed the process of running down excess inventory.“We expect demand trends to begin to outpace end-market growth beginning in [the second quarter of] 2012, enabling overall semi revenue growth of flat to 4 per cent in 2012,” said C.J. Muse of Barclays Capital. Micron Technology surged 7.3 per cent to $6.75, as Barclays Capital recommended that clients buy the stock.Shares in Californian rare-earth miner Molycorp climbed 4.8 per cent to $25.12 after the company said more than three-quarters of phase-one production at its flagship California manufacturing facility had been committed to customer orders or internal use.
13;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2011-08-29T15:44:17Z;Kurdistan has allure for risk seekers;;For retail investors willing to take a gamble, the benefits of investing in companies with substantial operations in Kurdistan are obvious, writes Christopher Thompson.“There remain few places in the world that allow energy companies access to significant resources under a relatively low-cost structure within a region that claims a better than average historical drilling success rate,” said Gerry Donnelly, vice-president of FirstEnergy Capital, the energy investment dealer. “But you need the stomach for the political, economic and, occasionally, geological risk.”Gulf Keystone Petroleum is the best known of the London-listed Kurdistan- focused miners. Since discovering oil at its Shaikan licence in 2009 – with a resource estimate of up to 10.8bn barrels – GKP has risen to become the fifth- biggest company on Aim by market capitalisation. It is currently considering a move up to the main board, which could be bolstered by exports projected for this year.However, its shares have fallen 27.5 per cent, or 38.2p, this month as investors have fled riskier equities.“Kurdistan is for the risk-seeking investor and when things go risk adverse [companies there] will get hit,” said Werner Riding, an analyst at Ambrian.Heritage Oil is a slightly different case. In May 2009 its shares rose by a quarter when it struck commercial volumes of oil in its Miran West licence. When, after an appraisal well was completed in January this year, it found the discovery to be predominantly gas, its shares tumbled 29 per cent on perceived difficulties in developing the reserves. Its shares have fallen 26.4 per cent since the end of July.Aim-quoted Sterling Energy, which drilled a dry hole in July and has seen a concomitant drop in its share price, reminds investors that not every Kurdistan well contains hydrocarbons. However, with Afren and Petroceltic International entering the region, investor appetite has not been sated.Mr Riding said that it could be some time before Kurdistan’s undoubted potential was realised: “The risk is there and you’ve got to take a view on that – but long term, the value is in the assets.”
14;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2011-08-28T22:02:36Z;US coal-fired power stations under threat;;The US power industry is facing its biggest shake-up since the Three Mile Island accident of 1979.That incident killed off investment in new nuclear plants for a generation. This time, it is coal-fired power stations that are under threat.New regulations governing pollution from coal plants that have been proposed by the US government’s Environmental Protection Agency could force up to 20 per cent of those plants to shut down, according to analysts and industry executives.The American Legislative Exchange Council, a free market campaign group, has described the impending upheaval as a “train wreck” that will cost jobs, send power prices soaring and lead to blackouts.Concern over these effects has led to several pieces of legislation being put forward in Congress to curb the EPA’s powers and stop the new rules.Whether the pollution limits will in fact have such a devastating impact is debatable. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service argued in a report circulated last week that the most alarming forecasts were based on exaggerated assumptions about the EPA’s plans.Nevertheless, the financial impact on US power companies could be significant.The new regulations, intended to reduce the damage to public health from industrial pollution, include tighter restrictions on toxic chemicals in power plants’ waste gases, on water use and on the disposal of coal ash.The first to take effect is the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which cuts the permitted emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, the gases that cause acid rain. It was set out in detail in July and will be enforced from the start of 2012.There are several ways that generators can meet the CSAPR’s requirements.They may be able to buy more pollution permits in the trading scheme for acid gas emissions.They can burn more low-sulphur Powder River Basin coal from Wyoming.They can invest in more flue gas desulphurisation equipment, or make more use of the equipment that is fitted already, or run their plants without it less often.However, all of those options have costs attached and ultimately it may not be worth keeping older and less efficient coal plants open.Those coal plants are likely to be replaced by a new wave of gas-fired plants, which have lower emissions and can take advantage of low fuel prices resulting from the shale gas boom.The consequences for electricity companies will vary.Daniel Ford, of Barclays Capital, says those with regulated businesses should be able to pass the extra costs on to consumers.For unregulated businesses, it will depend on their fuel mix. Companies that are predominantly gas-fired or nuclear will probably gain because the new EPA rules will raise power prices but the coal-heavy ones are likely to be losers.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein highlight Southern Company, American Electric Power and the combination of Duke Energy and Progress Energy as likely to have to close the largest amount of generation capacity in absolute terms.Scana, Integrys, GenOn, FirstEnergy, Southern and AEP face losing the most as a proportion of their total capacity.Companies have become increasingly vocal about their concerns.AEP said in June that the new regulations could cost it $6bn to $8bn before the end of the decade, adding that it planned to close five coal-fuelled plants.Michael Morris, AEP chairman and chief executive, last month called the timetable for compliance “as close to lunacy as you can get”.Probably the most sensitive issue is Texas, where the largest utility, Energy Future Holdings, is already struggling under the burden of the debt it took on in its $45bn leveraged buy-out in 2007.Concern over the threat of blackouts in the state is already high this summer, because of the strain created by high temperatures – which lead to heavier use of air-conditioning – and unexpected plant shutdowns.The issue has been given an extra political edge by the emergence of Rick Perry, the Texas governor, as possible Republican presidential candidate.Mr Perry has already struck out at EPA regulations for killing jobs and characterised the rules as “destructive federal over-reach”.EFH has also protested furiously, saying: “The severe and disproportionate impact on Texas is unjustified and the timeline unreasonable and will harm Texas jobs, prices, and power supply.“EFH and other companies have asked the EPA to delay implementation of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and are now waiting for a reply.If the EPA refuses, it is likely that some companies and states will take legal action.Brannin McBee, of Bentek Energy, a consultancy, says he expects the EPA will give the industry more time, perhaps by phasing in its new restrictions over a number of years.There is simply not enough capacity in the US to fit all the desulphurisation equipment and build the new gas-fired plants and pipelines that will be needed within the EPA’s timetable.However, he adds, the EPA seems determined to press ahead with its strategy.“The general consensus in the industry is that the new rules will have to be delayed somehow,” he says.“But we do believe the new limits will come in some way or another.”
15;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2011-05-03T20:51:55Z;Energy and materials lead Wall St lower;;Shares in Pfizer slipped back after its first-quarter revenues fell short of expectations, weighing on the healthcare sector and helping to lead the wider markets lower for the second consecutive session.The world’s largest drugmaker by revenue reported that sales had fallen slightly in the quarter to $16.5bn, which was short of the $16.6bn expected by analysts.This left shares in the company down 2.8 per cent at $20.44 as investors chose to focus on this revenue miss rather than the company’s 10 per cent increase in net income, which was ahead of what analysts had expected.The market’s disappointment over the results weighed on the healthcare sector with Watson Pharmaceuticals falling 1.2 per cent to $62.63 and Mylan losing 2.5 per cent to $24.23.The S&P healthcare index was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 12.3 per cent this year and one of the best-performing sectors on Wall Street.These losses helped pull the wider markets lower, with the S&P 500 index closing 0.3 per cent softer to 1,356.62.But the biggest drags on the index were energy and material stocks as many commodity prices lost ground.Within the energy sector, Halliburton, the oilfield services company, was down 2.1 per cent to $47.89 while Noble Energy fell 2.9 per cent to $90.60.Disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy also helped to weigh on the sector, with shares in the energy group falling 5.7 per cent to $31.33 after it reported a drop in first-quarter earnings.The S&P energy index fell 2.4 per cent, by far the worst performance of an S&P sector.The materials sector also lost ground, although not by as much, edging back 1 per cent. Massey Energy, the coal miner, fell 3.6 per cent to $65.25 while Consol Energy lost 3.5 per cent to $52.26.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was broadly flat at 12,807.36 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 2,841.62.In the previous session, the markets were given an early boost following news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed by US forces in Pakistan. But the benchmark indices still closed the day slightly lower as investors began to worry about where the market was now heading following the lofty technical highs reached in previous few sessions.Last week, the S&P achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“A lot of technicians are saying we are overbought here and we should move back for a while,” said Linda Duessel, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors.JPMorgan released a downbeat note on Tuesday saying they expected “turbulence” in the equity markets during the coming months because of the turmoil in the Middle East, fallout from the Japan earthquake, US budget deficit concerns and growing inflationary pressures.However, a survey from Charles Schwab, the retail brokerage, found that investor sentiment was at its highest point since late 2009 with 47 per cent of traders surveyed saying that they were feeling optimistic about the market compared with 28 per cent a year ago.In another positive sign on Tuesday, US factory orders rose in March for the fifth consecutive month, in the latest sign of strength in US manufacturing.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in MetroPCS Communications jumped 10.1 per cent to $18.14, the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, after the wireless provider reported a doubling in its first-quarter earningsThis helped to lift the telecoms sector. American Tower advanced 1.9 per cent to $52.52 while AT&T added 2.1 per cent to $31.86. The S&P telecommunications index was up 1.5 per cent.In the utility sector, FirstEnergy put on 6.1 per cent to $42.02 after the power company gave an earnings outlook that surpassed expectations.The gains came despite the fact that the company’s reporting a fall in profits as it booked costs related to its $4.7bn purchase of Allegheny Energy in February.Anadarko Petroleum, the US oil and gas company with a minority stake in BP’s disaster-hit Macondo well, reported a 12 per cent fall in underlying earnings for the first quarter because of a decline in natural gas prices and a rise in costs. The stock declined 2.3 per cent to $78.51.
16;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2011-03-08T17:59:29Z;Spotlight turns on stakes in Arab banks;;The Libyan regime’s diversification of business interests in the Middle East, particularly in banking, broadens the financial options of Muammer Gaddafi as he battles rebels on the ground and financial sanctions in the US and Europe.Only two months before Libyans revolted against their repressive ruler, the regime further diversified its asset portfolio into friendlier Arab jurisdictions.The Libyan Investment Authority, the $65bn sovereign wealth fund, for many years has had vast holdings in the Middle East. Its Lafico subsidiary owns hotels in Morocco and Jordan, and large shares in companies ranging from agriculture to pharmaceuticals. But as attempts to block financing to the regime gain momentum in western capitals, the spotlight is turning to the regime’s stakes in banks in the region.According to Zawya, the information provider, the government has stakes in a dozen banks in the Arab world, including 99.5 per cent of the Lebanon-based north Africa Commercial Bank and 50 per cent of Tunisia’s Banque Arabe Tuniso-Libyenne de Développement et de Commerce Extérieur. Smaller stakes are held in banks in Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.In December, Libya’s central bank increased its stake in Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation, a wholesale conventional bank, to 59.3 per cent, after buying out the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the emirate’s sovereign wealth fund. The remaining shares are split between the Kuwait Investment Authority, with 29.6 per cent, and the public.Libya recently boosted its stake in First Energy Bank, an Islamic bank also based in Manama. The Libyan Investment Authority has about 16 per cent of the bank, up from 10 per cent last year. Mohammed Shokri Ghanem, son of Shokri Ghanem, head of Libya’s state-run National Oil Company, is acting chief executive of First Energy.ABC says it is continuing its normal operations. UN sanctions have focused on the Gaddafi family and US sanctions do not extend to banks under other countries’ laws. “Neither ABC nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to asset freezes as a result of developments in Libya,” said the bank said. First Energy could not be reached for comment.The increased investments in Bahrain-based banks come amid buying interest in regional real estate. Bankers say the Libyan Investment Authority was considering investments in Dubai last year, including in distressed property. One businessman said he was recently approached by a UK company to purchase real estate in Bahrain. After due diligence, the company said its client represented people close to the Libyan government.Bankers say ABC is the main vehicle for the Libyans’ trading activities and has a custodian role with the Libyan Investment Authority, whose top executive, Mohammed Layas, is also chairman of ABC.But some people familiar with ABC say that, mindful of its reputation, it could have imposed discrete limitations on withdrawals from any Gaddafi family member irrespective of the sanctions.ABC’s behaviour could depend on instruction from Farhat Omar Bengdara, the Libyan central bank governor. Bankers who have been in touch with the central bank say Mr Bengdara is out of Libya but whether he remains loyal to the regime is unclear.A US Treasury official said the sanctions exemption from which ABC was benefiting was not intended to allow it to act as a conduit for funds to sanctioned parties, such as the central bank of Libya or the Libyan Investment Authority.“To the extent we’re seeing that type of behaviour, we will be moving very quickly to stop it,” said the official.
17;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2010-10-23T03:15:12Z;Cyber attack conspiracy? I think not;;From Mr Ed Kimball.Sir, Stephen Lange Ranzini ( Letters, October 16) claims that a cyber attack contributed to the 2003 electrical blackout in the US.In a detailed 228-page final report, the North American Electric Reliability Council found that a complex combination of events caused the failure, but found no evidence of cyber attack. The NERC report explains that the root cause of the outage was the failure of a utility company to trim trees close to high-voltage power lines in Ohio. The contact of the lines with the trees caused the initial failure. The only cyber contribution was a failure in an alarm and logging system that prevented FirstEnergy from responding quickly enough to the outage to prevent it from spreading.Similarly, the 128-page final report of the Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity clearly finds that a cyber attack did not cause the 2003 blackout in Italy. According to CNN, Florida Power Light attributed the 2003 Florida blackout to the human error of an engineer, not to any cyber attack.Does Mr Ranzini assert that the NERC, UCTE and FPL are part of a conspiracy to hide cyber attacks? If so, does he have evidence (other than anonymous reports and rumours) that contradicts the official reports?Ed Kimball,Ann Arbor, MI, US
18;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2010-02-12T00:22:33Z;US power groups to merge in $4.7bn deal;;"FirstEnergy agreed on Thursday to acquire Allegheny Energy for $4.7bn in an all-stock deal that would create one of the largest utility groups in the US.The combined company would have 10 regulated power utilities across seven states; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia. It would have 24,000 megawatts of generating capacity from coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil and renewable power.Some analysts think a deal between FirstEnergy and Allegheny could lead to more tie-ups in the utility sector, which they say is ripe for consolidation. Karl Miller, founder of MMC Energy, noted that the US has more than 250 mid-size and large utilities and distribution companies.But regulators have scuttled previous merger attempts by utilities. FPL, which owns Florida’s largest utility, abandoned a $11.4bn takeover attempt of Constellation Energy group in 2006 after a face-off with regulators in Maryland, where Constellation is based. Exelon, a utility based in Chicago, dropped its plan in 2006 to buy Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey amid concerns by regulators in that state.In both cases, legislators raised concerns that the combined utility groups could lead to higher power rates.Anthony Alexander, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer, said he did not anticipate any problem with regulators, given two of the six states involved do not require formal approval, and in the other four the companies have good relationships with regulators.“We have very strong …customer satisfaction ratings in those states. We are active in the communities,” Mr Alexander said.FirstEnergy said it expected to close the deal with Allegheny in 12 to 14 months. They expect the combined company, which would have more than 6m customers, to have $16bn in annual revenue and $1.4bn in annual net income, combining year-end 2009 figures.Under the agreement, Allegheny shareholders would receive 0.667 shares of FirstEnergy common stock for each share of Allegheny they own. Based on the closing stock prices for both companies on Wednesday, Allegheny shareholders would receive a value of $27.65 per share, or a total of $4.7bn. FirstEnergy also will assume about $3.8bn in Allegheny debt.The offer represents a premium of 31.6 per cent to the closing price of Allegheny on Wednesday, and a 22.3 per cent premium to the average stock price of Allegheny over the last 60 days."
19;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2010-02-11T22:03:11Z;Positive corporate results lift Wall Street;;Wall Street bounced back on Thursday after positive corporate results distracted the market from lingering uncertainty over Greece.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent at 1,078.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,144.19 and the Nasdaq rose 1.4 per cent at 2,177.41.US stocks were down for the first two hours of trading after Europe’s rescue plan for Greece failed to satisfy investors, owing to its lack of detail.But encouraging unemployment data and better-than-expected corporate results gave support to the market.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits dropped sharply last week.Economists had been expecting about 465,000 new claims but the labour department reported that initial jobless claims had dropped from a revised 483,000 in the previous week to 440,000.PepsiCo doubled its profit in the last quarter thanks to strong international sales but the soft-drink manufacturer’s results were broadly in line with forecasts. Its shares gained 1.3 per cent to $61.19.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, VF Corp rose 2.6 per cent to $74.35 after the apparel group posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit owing to tight inventories. However, the group, which owns brands such as The North Face and Wrangler, warned that the consumer spending climate was still “exceptionally difficult”.AutoNation, the country’s largest car dealership, also beat its quarterly estimates. The group reported its first quarterly increase in revenue from new vehicle sales for five years. However, its shares were down 3 per cent to $17.69.3M rose 2.1 per cent to $80.27 after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the diversified manufacturer from “market-perform” to “outperform”. They cited better margins and the potential for growth in multi-industrial groups.“These individual stories are able to provide a little bit of support but the issue of Europe continues to hang over the market,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.He added that investors were waiting for greater clarification of the rescue plan, expected next week.Viacom, which owns the MTV Networks and Paramount film studios, posted quarterly profit above consensus estimates thanks to the popularity of movies such as Transformers 2 and Star Trek. Profits rose almost fourfold in spite of declining advertising revenue from its cable channels. But after early strength, the shares were down 0.7 per cent to $30.04.Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, posted better-than-expected results and announced its first dividend.The group’s holiday release, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, has helped it to shrug off lingering concerns in the sector. Activision’s shares jumped 9.6 per cent to $11.07.Tekelec, which provides network equipment, posted better-than-expected quarterly results following strong demand and lower expenses. The company also announced the retirement of its chief financial officer, Bill Everett. Tekelec added 13.5 per cent to $16.89.Boston Scientific, the world’s second-largest maker of heart devices, weighed on the market after giving a disappointing forecast for this year.The group said it would also cut up to 1,300 jobs, or 10 per cent of its non-manufacturing staff. Shares in the company dropped 9.9 per cent to $7.47.Allegheny Energy jumped 12 per cent to $23.55 after FirstEnergy agreed to buy the power company for $4.7bn. The takeover is set to create one of the country’s largest utilities, serving more than 6.1m customers.The acquisition faces both state and federal regulatory hurdles but First-Energy said it expects to close the deal in just over a year’s time. FirstEnergy shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $39.59.Elsewhere in the sector, Hornbeck Offshore Services fell 9.5 per cent to $18.31. The provider of marine transportation to the offshore oil and gas industry gave a disappointing forecast for 2010.
20;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2007-02-27T20:18:11Z;TXU and green power;;The US’s green lobby finds itself facing an unusually happy conundrum. Namely, what has been its greatest achievement this week, winning an Oscar or shaping the biggest leveraged buy-out ever?The gold-plated statuette handed to Al Gore for his eco-documentary An Inconvenient Truth on Sunday is tangible. Environmentalists’ role in pushing Texan utility TXU into the arms of a private-equity consortium the day after is more tangential. Pressure on TXU to scrap plans for 11 new coal-fired power plants in Texas did not help the company’s prospects. Yet TXU might well have struggled anyway to deliver those plants on-time and on-budget. The takeover just agreed, at a healthy price and cancelling most of the planned plants, makes such considerations moot.That is not to dismiss the green lobby’s growing influence. Even in the immediate absence of federal measures addressing climate change, uncertainty over what might happen will affect investment decisions. TXU no doubt feared for returns earned on its new fleet of plants if and when regulations took hold.All of which is good news for TXU’s potential new owners. Wood MacKenzie, a consultancy, thinks half the new capacity planned in the US by 2012 is coal-based. Increasing the proportion of gas-fired capacity is cleaner but, in turn, will keep power prices higher and more volatile. That would boost the economics of TXU – and other generators with coal and nuclear capacity, such as Ohio’s FirstEnergy, for that matter.There is another opportunity here too. Witness the flurry of publicity generated by UK venture capitalist Sir Richard Branson’s $3bn environmental investment pledge announced in September. With the political climate clearly changing already, unfurling one’s green credentials, while waving a wad of green in the other hand, does three things: it provides a seat at the debating table, buffs up one’s public image and puts pressure on competitors to do the same.
21;FE;Firstenergy Corp;2005-12-19T14:10:29Z;FPL to buy Constellation for $11bn;;FPL Group on Monday agreed to acquire Constellation Energy in an $11.1bn all-stock transaction which analysts expect will trigger further consolidation in the US power-generation market.Shareholders in Florida-based FPL would hold 60 per cent of the enlarged entity, which would adopt the Constellation Energy brand and have pro forma annual revenues of $27bn, ranking it third in the US market behind the products of two other takeovers announced over the past 12 months.The new Constellation Energy would retain both well-regarded management teams and have a diversified mix of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power stations serving more than 7m customers.The two companies said a combination would also create the largest power producer in competitive markets, reflecting the complexities of the partially-deregulated US system and the pressures faced in regulated markets where retail and commercial prices are often capped in long-term supply agreements.“What you see here is a clear trend,” said Mark Williams, an energy expert at Boston University. ”FPL’s business is about 80-90 per cent regulated, and Constellation’s is about 75 per cent unregulated.”The two companies estimated the proposed deal would generate $200m-$250m in annual synergies after three years and expect regulatory approvals to take 9-12 months.Recent legislation and regulatory decisions have also increased the likelihood of further consolidation, and the stock prices of potential takeover candidates such as First Energy and Northeast Utilities have climbed in their wake.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently approved the planned purchase of PSEG by Exelon to create the largest US power producer, though the deal still has to secure other clearances. Ferc also backed the purchase of Cinergy by Duke Energy and MidAmerican’s acquisition of PacifiCorp.The new energy bill has added to the momentum, said Mr Williams. “Congress lifting the ban on interstate mergers lifts the flood gates. If you’re a medium to small-sized utility, watch out. If you’re a bigger utility, watch out, there might be ones that want to expand into your area.”The terms of the proposed FPL/Constellation deal are in line with media reports last week, with each common share of Constellation converted into 1.44 shares of the enlarged entity, a premium of 15 per cent on the average exchange ratio in the previous 20 days.FPL would have nine of the 15 board seats, with FPL head Lewis Hay taking on the chief executive role while Constellation’s Mayo Shattuck would become chairman.
