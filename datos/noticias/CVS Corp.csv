0;CVS;CVS Corp;2019-11-06T13:09:44Z;CVS quarterly results lifted by higher prices for brand name drugs;US drugstore chain raises earnings outlook sending shares higher;CVS Health boosted its full-year earnings outlook as it reported quarterly results that exceeded expectations, boosted by higher prices for brand name drugs.The Rhode Island-based company said revenues jumped 36.5 per cent from a year ago to $64.8bn, eclipsing analyst expectations for $62.99bn, according to Refinitiv survey of Wall Street analysts. The boost came primarily from the company’s $69bn acquisition of Aetna last November as well as higher prices for brand name drugs, despite criticism from politicians over the sky-high price of many drugs.Revenues in the company’s pharmacy services division, which includes pharmacy benefit management services to employers, climbed 6.4 per cent from a year ago. Meanwhile sales in its retail unit, which includes pharmacy prescriptions, a wide range of general merchandise and healthcare services through walk-in clinics, rose 2.9 per cent.CVS has been working to reorient some of its stores to focus on so-called “health hubs” — where customers can obtain a broader range of healthcare services — and away from candy aisles.The company said its net income climbed to $1.5bn in the three months ended in September, up from $1.39bn in the year ago quarter. That translated to earnings of $1.17 a share.Adjusting for one-time items — like the loss on the sale of pharmacy chain Drogaria Onofre and charges related to closing stores — the company reported earnings of $1.84 a share, higher than analyst expectations for $1.77.CVS is trying to broaden its customer base with the use of drone delivery systems to bring it closer to rural communities or those who cannot access its stores because of their limited mobility. The company has teamed up with United Parcel Service and at the start of this month successfully completed its first revenue generating drone delivery of a medical prescription from a CVS pharmacy to a residence in North Carolina.The results come a day after the FT reported rival Walgreens Boots Alliance has been exploring the possibility of a $70bn take-private deal.CVS Health also raised its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $6.97 to $7.05 a share, up from its previous outlook of between $6.89 to $7 a share. That compared with analysts’ expectations for $6.98 a share.Shares in the company, which are up 3 per cent year-to-date as of Tuesday’s close, climbed more than 2 per cent in pre-market trade to $68.95.
1;CVS;CVS Corp;2019-06-11T14:28:01Z;Digital health breakthrough as US insurers agree to pay for insomnia app;Deal with CVS Health means digital treatment can be paid for in same way as sleeping pills;Hundreds of thousands of Americans will be able to access an app to tackle sleeplessness after CVS Health, which administers health benefits for insurers and big employers, set up a way for the treatment to be paid for in the same way as a drug. On Tuesday, CVS said it was partnering with Big Health, a San Francisco-based company that has developed the Sleepio app to treat insomnia. The agreement means that employers or health plans will be able to add Sleepio to the list of solutions they reimburse, and check patients’ eligibility, using the same systems and processes used for drugs.The Sleepio programme is based on cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users make changes to improve their sleep. It has been studied in eight randomised controlled trials.Troyen Brennan, CVS Health chief medical officer, said poor-quality sleep and insomnia affected about 30 per cent of American adults, and could “impact a wide variety of mental health conditions”.The tie-up marks a significant step forward for digital therapeutics, which use software to prevent, manage or treat a medical condition, often at less cost than conventional medicine.“Digiceuticals”, as they are sometimes called, have yet to gain widespread traction in the US healthcare system, partly because of uncertainties about whether health plans will pay for them. According to a recent report on digital therapeutics from Rock Health, which invests in digital health, health plans were most sceptical about the potential benefits of digital treatments. Megan Zweig, director of research at Rock Health, said that “not a single health plan leader” interviewed for the report had mentioned digital therapeutics as a potential treatment on its own.Peter Hames, co-founder and chief executive of Big Health, said the partnership with CVS “allows digital therapeutics to be reimbursed and administrated at scale using the same underlying infrastructure as drugs for the first time”.He said this would “radically reduce the barriers to digital therapeutics being adopted at scale across all segments of the US healthcare market, including employers and health plans”.The tie-up would also open up the prospect of being able to identify and target people currently taking sleeping pills, to offer them the digital alternative, he added. Big Health declined to divulge the cost of its treatment, but Mr Hames said it “compares very favourably to the cost of untreated insomnia”. He said that based on an analysis of claims data from US employers, conducted by the company, “those with an insomnia claim cost, on average, $7,000 more per year than those without”. Concerns about the potential risks of sleeping pills amid the opioid addiction crisis have prompted the US medicines regulator to enforce stronger warnings on packets. CVS said that guidelines published by the American College of Physicians recommended CBT as “the first line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults, ahead of sleeping pills”. Derica Rice, president of CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefit management business of CVS Health, said health plans had “begun looking beyond the standard medical, pharmacy, dental and vision health benefit offerings”, and were increasingly considering “supplemental benefits to help improve health outcomes and reduce overall medical spend”.CVS said other digital and non-digital solutions that might be offered in future included “smoking cessation and substance abuse support, care management solutions, medication optimisation and adherence, and tools that help members navigate their benefits”.
2;CVS;CVS Corp;2019-04-09T17:34:02Z;Pharmacy benefit managers face bipartisan criticism;Republican and Democratic senators accuse industry intermediaries of harming consumers;Republican and Democratic senators joined together at a hearing on Tuesday to accuse pharmacy benefit managers of harming consumers as both parties prepare to make soaring drug prices a key issue for the 2020 US elections.Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance committee, said healthcare industry mergers are “increasingly prompting concerns” and questioned whether they help patients or could open the door to “anti-competitive activity”.Pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, bridge the gap between drugmakers and insurers, deciding which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and negotiating rebates and discounts.But the three biggest players are now part of broader healthcare conglomerates. Last year, health insurer Cigna bought PBM ExpressScripts for $54bn, pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health bought insurer Aetna for $69bn, and United Healthcare, which already owned PBM OptumRX, added smaller pharmacy chains.PBM profits are based on making a slice of the prescription drug pie more expensiveThe Federal Trade Commission is already looking into competition in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The three leading companies count 71 per cent of Medicare patients enrolled in prescription drug plans as their customers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research institution.Rising drug prices have become a key issue in the run-up to the 2020 polls, with both President Donald Trump and leading Democratic candidates trying to appeal to voters who feel they face higher out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions.Many senators spoke of meeting constituents who were skipping doses to try to control their drug bills. The price of insulin has come under particular scrutiny after some diabetics died from not receiving the vital hormone.Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, accused PBMs of being more secretive about pricing than HBO is at guarding the end of Game of Thrones — calling them as “clear a middleman rip-off as you are going to find”.“PBMs actually make more money when they pick a higher priced drug over a lower priced drug,” he said. “PBM profits are based on making a slice of the prescription drug pie more expensive.”Five executives from the PBMs testified on Tuesday, insisting they operate in a very competitive market with over 60 players. Steve Miller, chief clinical officer of Cigna, said it was “wildly competitive” with many regional or local rivals, and that the consolidation of the industry helps them take better care of patients.The PBMs insisted that they passed all rebates on to consumers. But they pushed back on full public transparency, saying it would hamper their ability to negotiate effectively with drugmakers.When drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck appeared in front of the Senate in February, many blamed a complex system where pharmacy benefit managers do not pass rebates on to the patients.Alex Azar, health and human services secretary, has put forward a proposal to ban the complex system of rebates in the two major government-backed health plans — Medicare, for seniors, and Medicaid, for the poor — because of fears they are not passed on to the patients.But on Tuesday, pharmacy benefit managers pointed the finger at drugmakers, criticising them for deliberately delaying when lower-priced generics can come on to the market. John Prince, chief executive at Optum RX, said manufacturers continue to raise list prices because of a “lack of meaningful competition”.The executives also cited the rising cost of speciality drugs, only used by 2 per cent of patients, but which they said were set to account for about half of all drug costs by 2022. They pushed for drugmakers to consider more “value-based pricing”, where a drugs costs are dependent on successful treatment.Shares in Cigna rose 1.4 per cent to $169.83 in midday trading in New York, while United Healthcare ticked up 0.3 per cent to $249.56. CVS was flat at $54.10, while Humana was flat at $273.42.
3;CVS;CVS Corp;2019-02-20T18:20:22Z;CVS shares eye biggest drop since October on weak 2019 outlook;;CVS Health swung to a net loss in its fourth quarter owing to $2.2bn impairment on its long-term healthcare operations and further ruffled feathers with a disappointing outlook for the group, setting shares up for their biggest one-day drop in four months.The company’s forecasts come as it juggles weakness in some of its operations and the integration of Aetna, the health insurer it bought last year for $69bn, which it hopes can drive a radical overhaul of how customers use its pharmacy stores.CVS took a $2.2bn charge on its long-term healthcare unit, Omnicare, during the December quarter, taking impairments over the full year to $6.1bn. That is nearly half the $12.7bn it paid for the nursing-home pharmacy company in 2015.Additionally, it said operating income at Omnicare declined due to higher operating expenses, and again pointed to a challenging industry backdrop, such as low occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, and the bankruptcy of a number of customers.For 2019, Rhode Island-headquartered CVS said it expects to report diluted earnings in the range of $4.88 to $5.08 a share, or $6.68 to $6.88 on an adjusted basis, lower than mean forecasts of $6.52 and $7.41, respectively, among analysts in a Refinitiv survey.That overshadowed an 11.5 per cent rise in adjusted earnings to $2.14 a share for the fourth quarter, which came in 9 cents ahead of market expectations. The $1.99-a-share impact from the Omnicare impairment, as well as higher interest expense related to financing the Aetna acquisition, saw CVS swing to a reported net loss of 37 cents a diluted share from $3.22 a year ago.Revenue of $54.4bn came in about $160m below Wall Street forecasts.CVS hopes to use the Aetna deal to turn its network of 9,000 stores into “healthcare hubs” where pharmacists and other trained specialists will offer medical advice and services rather than just dispensing prescription drugs. The company predicted such “lower-cost sites of care” could help bring down the soaring cost of healthcare in the US, while some analysts also suggested it could be a defensive move in case Amazon muscled into low-cost healthcare by selling prescription drugs online.Larry Merlo, CVS chief executive, described 2018 as a “milestone year” for the company as it completed the “transformational” merger with Aetna.“With the completion of the Aetna acquisition, we have set the stage for CVS Health to excel in a market that is rapidly transforming. We strongly believe in the long term value that the full breadth of our capabilities can provide,” he said.Still, CVS shares were down 7.5 per cent at lunchtime in New York on Wednesday, and eyeing their biggest one-day drop since mid-October. That has wiped out its year-to-date gains, leaving it down 1.4 per cent for 2019.Shares in insurer Cigna — which took a leaf from CVS’s playbook by last year acquiring pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts for $67bn including debt — were down 1.5 per cent on Wednesday. Walgreens Boots Alliance were down 3.6 per cent versus a 0.1 per cent drop for the broader S&P 500.
4;CVS;CVS Corp;2019-01-29T14:37:39Z;Apple and Aetna team up on new healthcare app;Latest push by Silicon Valley tech company into healthcare sector;Apple will gain access to a huge trove of detailed health data as part of a new Apple Watch tie-up with US insurer Aetna. CVS-owned Aetna and Apple have jointly developed a new app called Attain, set to launch in the coming months. Attain will use the Apple Watch to provide personalised recommendations to users, based on both their health history and live data generated by the wearable device, which offers heart-rate monitoring and workout tracking. To comply with US data protection regulations, Apple and Aetna have entered into a “business associate agreement” that includes assurances that no personally identifiable information will be shared with the iPhone maker and that it will not be sold, revealed to employers or used for making coverage decisions by Aetna. The health information will be collected on a voluntary basis and only used to support the Attain programme, the companies added. The deal marks the latest incursion by Silicon Valley into the healthcare sector, while insurance companies look to technology to improve preventive care that can ultimately reduce their payouts. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said on CNBC earlier this month he believed Apple’s “greatest contribution to mankind” would come from its work in healthcare. Other tech companies share that ambition. Last year, Amazon acquired online pharmacy PillPack and partnered with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to create a not-for-profit healthcare company for employees. Earlier this month, Alphabet’s life sciences unit Verily raised $1bn from investors including Silver Lake to expand its work in healthcare. Using Attain will be voluntary for Aetna members but they will be provided incentives to join, including earning back the cost of the Apple Watch that is required to participate. Spurring sales of wearable devices including Apple Watch and AirPods is becoming more important for Apple at a time when iPhone revenues are slowing. Users will be able to opt in to sharing Attain data and their broader health history with Apple, providing fuel for analytics and machine learning that the companies need to improve the service. Attempting to head off potential privacy concerns, the companies said that users’ health data will be encrypted and will not be used for underwriting or calculating premiums. “We believe that people should be able to play a more active role in managing wellbeing,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “As we learn over time, the goal is to make more customised recommendations that will help members accomplish their goals and live healthier lives.”Alan Lotvin, executive vice-president of transformation at CVS Health, said he hoped the app would appeal to people with any level of fitness. “We’re designing Attain to be personalised and clinically relevant to where each individual is in their health journey,” he said. “This is an ambitious challenge, and we will adapt and improve over time to create the best experience for our members.”Aetna is not the first insurance company to use technology to promote healthier living. South Africa-based Discovery has partnered with a number of insurers around the world to offer the Vitality programme, which offers rewards — including lower premiums — to people who exercise.Insurance companies are hoping to use technology more broadly as a way to prevent losses from occurring. For example, they are hoping to use “internet of things” technology in the home such as leak detectors that can alert homeowners at the first sign of a problem. And motor insurers have for some years installed so-called black boxes in cars to analyse how well the driver is performing. They hope that such schemes will not only cut payouts but also lead to improved customer loyalty, which is a big problem in an industry where many people choose their insurer based only on price. 
5;CVS;CVS Corp;2019-01-15T15:07:27Z;Walmart to split from CVS pharmacy network;Companies disagreed over reimbursements for filling prescriptions;CVS Health said Tuesday it expects Walmart drugstores to leave its pharmacy network amid a disagreement over costs.Walmart had sought higher reimbursements for filling prescriptions at its in-store pharmacies for CVS Caremark members, according to CVS. CVS Caremark, the healthcare giant’s pharmacy benefit management business, handles drug benefits for millions of customers in the US.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said it is “committed to providing value to our customers across our business, including our pharmacy, but we don’t want to give that value to the middle man.”“This issue underscores the problems that can arise when a [pharmacy benefit manager] can exert their unregulated power to direct members on where to fill their scripts, disrupting patients’ healthcare. Walmart is standing up to CVS’s behaviors that are putting pressure on pharmacies and disrupting patient care,” the retailer added in a statement.The Arkansas-based company said it will continue discussions with CVS Caremark and attempt to find a solution.“At a time when everyone is working hard to find ways to reduce health care costs, Walmart’s requested rates would ultimately result in higher costs for our clients and consumers,” said Derica Rice, president of CVS Caremark, adding that CVS “simply could not agree” on providing a reimbursement increase.If the split is finalised, CVS plans would not pay for drug prescriptions that members fill through Walmart. With pharmacies in most of its 4,600 US stores, Walmart is one of the nation’s largest drugstore operators.CVS said it has asked Walmart to continue filling prescriptions as an in-network pharmacy through April 30. Sam’s Club, the Walmart-owned warehouse chain, remains in the CVS Caremark network. Walmart also will continue to participate in CVS’s Medicare Part D pharmacy network.Walmart’s departure is not expected to have a material impact on 2019 financial results, according to CVS. It said less than 5 per cent of affected Caremark members use Walmart exclusively to fill prescriptions.Shares of CVS were down 2 per cent on Tuesday morning. Walmart was trading 1.3 per cent higher.
6;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-11-06T13:09:47Z;CVS Health says Aetna acquisition to close before Thanksgiving;;CVS Health said on Tuesday that it expects its $69bn industry-changing deal for health insurer Aetna to close before Thanksgiving — news that sent its shares higher in pre-market trading.CVS, the largest US drugstore chain, received preliminary approval from the Department of Justice last month to move ahead with its acquisition of Aetna.While the company still needs approval from a number of states — including New York, where officials are considering blocking parts of the deal — it expressed confidence on Tuesday that the merger would close before the end of the month.“To date, the company has received approval from 23 of the 28 states and we are well down the line with the remaining five,” it said. “The transaction is expected to close before Thanksgiving.The comments come as CVS reported stronger-than-expected revenue and earnings during the third quarter thanks to solid growth in prescription drug sales and lower taxes.The $75bn company reported net revenue of $47.27bn for the three months to end of September. That is a 2.3 per cent increase from the prior year period and a hair above a consensus estimate of $46.2bn.The gains were driven by 2.6 per cent sales increase in CVS’s all-important pharmacy services unit, which manages pharmacy benefits and handles the fulfilment of prescriptions on behalf of major insurers and employers. The division, which posted sales of $33.8bn during the quarter, accounts for more than 71 per cent of total group revenue.Revenue from CVS’ retail pharmacy segment reached $20.9bn, up 6.4 per cent from the year-ago quarter. That was largely thanks to an 8.7 per cent increase in same-store pharmacy sales. Revenue from front-end sales, which includes goods like greeting cards and household items, grew just 0.8 per cent.Net income jumped more than 8 per cent to $1.39bn as the company also benefited from a lower tax rate.Shares in CVS rose 3.5 per cent ahead of the bell.
7;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;US authorities clear CVS’s $69bn takeover of Aetna;Approval for huge healthcare combination after agreement to sell prescriptions business;The US Department of Justice has approved CVS Health’s $69bn takeover of Aetna, clearing the way for the creation of a huge US healthcare group.The deal, which combines the country’s largest drugstore chain with an insurer that has almost 40m members, was cleared by the DoJ with the condition that Aetna’s Medicare prescription drug plan business be sold.Aetna had already announced the sale of that business, which provides prescription drug plans as part of Medicare, the US federal health insurance programme, last month to WellCare, another health insurer. “The purchase price is not material to Aetna,” the company said in a filing at the time.Aetna has more than 2m prescription drug plan members and directly competed in that area with CVS’s pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark.“Today’s settlement resolves competition concerns posed by this transaction and preserves competition in the sale of Medicare Part D prescription drug plans for individuals,” Makan Delrahim, the justice department’s antitrust chief, said in a statement.The approval gives fresh insight into the Trump administration’s approach to antitrust matters. Lawyers had worried that the justice department would take a tougher approach to “vertical” deals, in which two companies in different parts of a supply chain combine.Those concerns were sparked by Mr Delrahim’s decision to challenge AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner, which is under appeal after a court allowed the deal.In June, Mr Delrahim said “these concerns are misplaced” in comments that appear to have been borne out by the approval of the CVS/Aetna and, last month, Cigna’s $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts, which merged a health insurer with a pharmacy benefit manager.Shares in Aetna rose 1.3 per cent while CVS traded 0.9 per cent higher. The deal still requires approval from state authorities. The settlement on Wednesday was joined by state attorneys-general representing California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington.CVS said the deal remained on track to close early in the current quarter. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the DoJ that maintains the strategic benefits and value creation potential of our combination with Aetna. We are now working to complete the remaining state reviews,” said Larry Merlo, chief executive, in a statement.“The divestitures required here allow for the creation of an integrated pharmacy and health benefits company that has the potential to generate benefits by improving the quality and lowering the costs of the healthcare services that American consumers can obtain,” he added.
8;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-09-17T19:15:45Z;DoJ clears Cigna’s $67bn acquisition of Express Scripts;;The US Department of Justice has cleared Cigna’s $67bn takeover of Express Scripts, the companies announced on Monday, sending shares of major insurers higher.The approval clears a key obstacle to the deal, which still requires approval from regulators in 13 states before it can be completed. “We are another step closer to completing our merger,” said David Cordani, chief executive of Cigna, in a statement.Cigna, a health insurer, announced the takeover of Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, in March. Activist investor Carl Icahn criticised the deal last month but quickly dropped his opposition to the merger. Shareholders approved the transaction in August.Shares in Express Scripts jumped 4.2 per cent on the news while those for Cigna were 1.9 per cent higher.CVS Health and Aetna, which are also awaiting regulatory approval for their own $69bn tie-up, also got a boost to their shares. CVS is up 1.5 per cent while Aetna gained 1 per cent.A justice department spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.
9;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-08-08T12:11:15Z;Stronger prescription drug sales boost CVS revenues;;Higher prescription drug sales helped to bolster quarterly revenue at CVS, the largest US drugstore chain, which is aiming to close a potentially industry-changing deal for health insurer Aetna later this year.CVS said that net revenue for the three months ending June 30 grew 2.2 per cent from a year ago to $46.7bn. Same-store prescription volume growth of 9.5 per cent year-over-year helped to offset pricing pressures from Medicare reimbursements and recently introduced lower-priced generics, the company said.A $3.9bn goodwill impairment charge related to its long-term care business pushed the company to a quarterly net loss of $2.6bn, or $2.52 a share, although adjusted earnings per share improved to $1.69 a share from $1.33 a year ago.Analysts had been looking for revenue of $20.65bn and net income of $1.24bn, or $1.26 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings were tipped to come in at $1.48 a share.CVS said that it expects to close its $69bn acquisition of Aetna by the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2018. It is still awaiting approval from antitrust regulators at the US Department of Justice.When and if the transaction closes, CVS said it will transform its network of 9,000 stores into “healthcare hubs”, adding a new mix of medical services and advice in an effort to increase access to lower-cost points of care for customers.Larry Merlo, CVS president and chief executive, said:Our solid performance both in the quarter and year-to-date demonstrates our ability to drive value. It also builds upon a strong foundation for a seamless integration of CVS and Aetna with one goal: to transform the consumer healthcare experience and, by doing so, deliver long-term profitable growth for shareholders.CVS shares were up 2.2 per cent in pre-market trading following the results. Since the start of the year, the company’s shares are down 9.7 per cent, following an 8 per cent decline in 2017.
10;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-07-12T17:47:35Z;CVS, Aetna shares lifted by report that DoJ may clear $69bn deal;;Shares of US pharmacy chain CVS and health insurer Aetna got a leg up on Thursday from a report that the US Department of Justice may be preparing to wave through their $69bn deal in the coming weeks.CVS shares were up 2.5 per cent to $69.03, while Aetna shares ticked higher to trade up 2.3 per cent at $191.82.The moves come after a report from trade publication Reorg Research, cited by Bloomberg, that said US antitrust enforcers might not challenge the deal. US Department of Justice staff are expected to voice their support in a recommendation to senior officials, Reorg Research reported, according to Bloomberg.If US officials decline to challenge the deal, it will come on the heels of their defeat in a challenge to the tie-up between AT&T and Time Warner.Shares of two other health companies with similar merger plans also moved higher on the report. Insurer Cigna — which has struck a $67bn deal to buy Express Scripts, a large pharmacy benefits manager — was up about 0.88 per cent, while Express Scripts rose 2.35 per cent.
11;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-06-29T17:10:17Z;Amazon’s unparalleled power over markets;When the US internet retailer sneezes, entire industries catch cold;By spending $1bn, Amazon made $14bn disappear. The money that went missing was not Amazon’s, though. That sum was the loss in market value at the biggest players in US drug distribution and retailing, after Amazon announced on Thursday that it would spend that billion to buy online pharmacist PillPack. Shares in those six companies (Walgreens, Boots Alliance, CVS Health, Express Scripts, Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen) had been depressed last year by the very suggestion that Amazon was coming into their territory. Proof positive trimmed their values by as much as 10 per cent.It is hard to think of any other company in the modern era that could have that kind of impact on a market that it is not even in yet, just by the industrial equivalent of clearing its throat — not even IBM, General Electric, or Microsoft in their heydays.And yet the market is not overreacting. Amazon’s success in colonising other branches of retail, and even some big non-retail businesses, justifies the wariness. What is more, there are good reasons for everyone to be grateful that Amazon has such tremendous power.The business of getting pharmaceuticals to consumers is complicated, capitally intensive, and surrounded by regulatory barriers to entry. As a result, the big companies that dominate it — distributors, pharmacy benefit managers, and retail pharmacies — face limited competition and have opportunities to extract economic rent. This is exactly the kind of situation where Amazon thrives: investing prodigiously, pricing aggressively, and offering customers better service. Where Amazon goes, margins compress and stock prices fall. The corollary to that is that consumers pay less — and not just at Amazon itself. In 2015, Walmart, by far the biggest retailer in America, was forced to concede that in the era of Amazon its old margin structure was simply impossible to maintain. It would have to cut prices, improve service at its stores, and produce lower profits. It was forced, in other words, to do better by its customers.The main reason that Amazon can have this impact is that its investors do not expect it to make much profit. Concluding (with some reason) that Amazon is the company of the future, shareholders bid up the stock despite razor-thin margins. This is what allows Amazon to invest so heavily in both intellectual property and hard assets — it spent $34bn on technology, content, and capital expenditures last year.So: Amazon competes hard and invests heavily, just the things that make capitalism work as it should. Worries that Amazon is a threat to competition — and many people do worry about this — may therefore seem quixotic. The concern is that when the Amazon steamroller has flattened the industrial landscape, it will be free to raise prices and, more importantly, either crush or buy out any innovative rival to its established franchises.To waive this away on the grounds that one day a new competitor will unseat Amazon, just as Amazon unseated Walmart, seems naive. Amazon has not only a huge edge in physical infrastructure, as Walmart once did. It also enjoys technological network effects to rival Microsoft’s and a trove of consumer data that would make Mark Zuckerberg blush.For now, most of us reap the benefits of Amazon’s unprecedented market muscle. But there may come a moment when the balance shifts, and Amazon’s size and power do more harm than good. The really scary possibility is that, after years as happy customers, we may not even recognise that moment when it arrives.I want to keep real shops, particularly bookshops / From Antony Black, Dundee, UK
12;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-06-29T04:05:16Z;Amazon kick-starts campaign to disrupt pharmacy sector;PillPack deal offers the US group a launch pad for a hallmark full-frontal assault;In 1940, the late Karl Hanke took a job as a delivery boy at the Corner Drug store, an independent pharmacy in Woodland, California, fetching medicines to patients on his bike. He eventually joined the military and trained as a pharmacist before taking over the business.“At one point we also had a liquor licence, so we delivered alcohol alongside prescription drugs,” recalled his daughter Lisa Shelley, who bought the store from her father in 1999.These days, retailers deliver everything from clothes and groceries to flat screen televisions to consumers who order them online, in a shift that is battering traditional companies used to selling their wares in physical stores.But something strange is happening in the US healthcare industry: the trend has gone in the opposite direction. Last year, about 88 per cent of prescriptions were collected at bricks-and-mortar pharmacies, compared with 82 per cent in 2009, according to Goldman Sachs.Amazon is hoping to change that with its first major foray into the $560bn market for prescription drugs in the US. It is paying roughly $1bn to acquire PillPack, a mail-order pharmacy that packages tablets into daily portions before delivering them by post.9.9%Fall in Walgreens Boots Alliance share price on day of Amazon-PillPack dealThe deal follows the appointment earlier this month of Atul Gawande as chief executive of the independent healthcare company funded jointly by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase for their employees. The non-profit venture aims to cut health bills for their employees and “potentially all Americans”.PillPack specialises in serving patients who suffer from one or more chronic illness and, therefore, take a lot of medication every day. Although this group is small in number, it represents a lucrative part of the healthcare industry. Express Scripts, a large pharmacy benefits manager, says “super spenders” who spend $50,000 or more on medicines every year account for roughly 20 per cent of overall drug costs.Still, few observers think Amazon will limit its ambitions to this corner of the market. Instead, they see its acquisition of PillPack as a chance to gain a toehold it can use to launch the kind of full-frontal assault that has become its hallmark.Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help people reduce their drug bills, says buying PillPack will allow Amazon to move more quickly than if it had launched its own pharmacy from scratch.“This is a play for speed — it takes a lot of time and work to get a pharmacy started, and to get all the proper licensing,” said Mr Rea, a former pharmacist.Eric Kinariwala, chief executive of Capsule, a pharmacy start-up, agreed. “They’re buying regulatory permits and contracts with health insurers, and that accelerates their market entry.”If Amazon hopes to apply its formula for digital disruption to the pharmacy industry, it will first have to work out why the proportion of people fulfilling their prescriptions at drugstores is on the rise even as other trips to physical shops are falling.It is certainly not because drugstore chains are nice places to spend time in. Many of them are dingy, suffering from years of under-investment with long queues caused by understaffing.One reason is that existing mail-order pharmacies are just not very convenient. Express Scripts, one of the largest operators, takes eight days to deliver after receiving an order, and up to two weeks for new prescriptions.The process of getting a prescription fulfilled in the US has also become more complex in recent years, as health insurers introduce measures designed to control soaring drug prices.Many patients turn up to the pharmacy counter only to discover that the medicine they have been prescribed is not covered by their policy, or that they must make an unaffordable personal “out of pocket” contribution.[Pharmacies] are reinventing themselves by refocusing the real estate around population health and trying to become this stickier one-stop shopMore often than not, the drugstore will then ring the doctor’s surgery to find out if they can prescribe a cheaper alternative. About 30 per cent of prescriptions result in a “pharmacy callback”, leading to more than 900m calls a year, according to a report from the US Department of Health and Human Services.Although the back-and-forth process is often torturous, patients who attend a drugstore in person can at least try to make sure that they leave with their medication in hand.If Amazon wants to expand the market for mail-order prescription drugs, it will have to solve these problems, said Mr Kinariwala.His company is trying to tackle the “pain points” with software that allows the doctor and pharmacist to communicate more effectively. And the start-up has a team of couriers who deliver medicines to patients within two hours of receiving the prescription.If Amazon can make the process of ordering drugs online quicker and less cumbersome, the biggest losers will be the large drugstore chains. Shares in CVS Health, the largest operator, had shed 6.1 per cent by the close of trading on Thursday, when Amazon announced the PillPack deal. Walgreens Boots Alliance’s stock price fell 9.9 per cent.“Amazon is already eroding their retail business and this is definitely another threat,” says Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink.The large chains have responded with plans to turn their stores into health clinics, where patients can see a doctor or nurse before getting their prescription. This month, Walgreens announced a partnership with Humana, a health insurer, to launch clinics for senior citizens. And CVS Health has said its $69bn acquisition of Aetna, another insurer, presages a push to turn its stores into “ healthcare hubs”.“They are reinventing themselves by refocusing the real estate around population health and trying to become this stickier one-stop shop,” said Ms Gupte.Not everyone is convinced the strategy will work. “Who wants to see their doctor in a drugstore chain?” said Mr Kinariwala. “It’s an awful, uninviting setting.”If Amazon succeeds in disrupting the pharmacy market, then more patients could soon get their medication delivered to their door — just as Corner Drug’s customers have been for all these years. Today the bicycles have been replaced by a pair of small city cars and the drugs arrive without the booze. “We sold the liquor licence in the 1980s,” said Ms Shelley. “It was worth quite a lot.”
13;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-05-28T09:18:34Z;Organic tampons escalate battle in feminine care;Retailers clear way for upstarts as mainstream brands come under scrutiny;CVS stores are making room in the feminine care aisle for L Inc’s organic tampons and pads for the first time this month, escalating the battle for shelf space with mainstream brands such as Always and Tampax, whose ingredients have come under heightened scrutiny.Just as consumers are becoming more conscious about what they eat, there is a growing movement among women to question the make-up of the intimate products they use during menstruation. According to health lobbyists, common ingredients used in traditional disposable tampons and sanitary pads may be linked to higher rates of cancer and reproductive diseases.As a result, US retailers such as CVS and Target, two of the country’s largest chains, have expanded their offerings over the past two years to include newer alternative and organic brands such as L, Seventh Generation and Sustain Natural.Procter & Gamble-owned Always and Tampax continue to wield a commanding share of the $3bn industry in the US with frequent product updates. But as sales sag at brands such as Playtex and Kotex, which are seen as less innovative, retailers are seizing the opportunity to offer new products, according to Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman.“That shelf space could be up for grabs,” she said. “If retailers want to differentiate in an interesting way and keep consumers coming back in stores, they may want to look at the organic brands.”Alternative brands make up only 3.3 per cent of the US tampon market and 1.2 per cent of the sanitary pads market in 2017, according to Nielsen. But they have notched up explosive growth, with sales in tampons jumping 70 per cent and pads climbing 86 per cent.Previously L products were sold only online, but since retailers have stocked the brand in-store, demand has scaled quickly, according to Talia Frenkel, L founder and chief executive. “Now that it’s in Target, it’s flying off the shelves,” she said. “Every time we think we have it covered, we’re out of stock again.”Annual revenue at the group has not yet surpassed $100m but it grew tenfold last year, giving L the number one growth rate of all tampon and pad brands, according to market research group IRI. In April, L’s run ratewas 20 times that of the same month last year, Ms Frenkel said.L and its peers hope to pose the same threat to the sector’s incumbents as Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s did for men’s razors.Wendy Nicholson, an analyst at Citi, said Gillette and Schick razors are still struggling to recapture the market share they lost after they overlooked the niche players online, which were offering customers new purchasing and delivery models.“So far, we are not seeing a huge attrition of share from the incumbents in fem care — the small guys are still pretty small. But this doesn’t mean that could not change, especially if some of the small guys do indeed get shelf space,” she said.Organic feminine care brands are not new. Seventh Generation entered the market more than 13 years ago, but in the past few years there has been a dramatic shift in consumer sentiment, said Hanneke Willenborg, chief marketing officer. Younger women, more willing to broach a previously taboo subject, are leading the charge.“It had been quite a niche product until very recently when all of a sudden this category has really blossomed,” she said.Feminine care sales at the company, which Unilever acquired in 2016, have grown 200 per cent in the year to date compared with the same period the year before.“Millennial women and Gen Z, which is a big part of the target group, is so much more aware of the products that they use,” Ms Willenborg said. “You would have expected it to take off sooner but what we’re seeing with more smaller players is that sometimes it takes more than one brand to tell a story.”That story revolves around the possible negative health effects associated with ingredients such as chlorine, rayon and fragrance. Hazardous ingredients may contain dioxins and furans, in addition to pesticide residues and harmful adhesives, according to Women’s Voices for the Earth, a non-profit lobby group. Exposure could lead to an increased risk of cancer, reproductive harm and endocrine disruption, it says.Both Always and Tampax have maintained their products are safe. Giving into the tide, however, Procter & Gamble launched a Pure and Clean line for the two brands in February, which is free of chlorine, rayon and fragrance. It continues, however, to use non-organic cotton, synthetic fibres and other chemical compounds.As such, organic brands are positioning themselves as the safer bet.“Why would you put something inside you, if you don’t know what’s in it,” said Meika Hollender, co-founder of Sustain, which makes condoms, as well as panty liners and tampons. “We don’t feel that it’s worth taking the risk and that is the key difference between organic and non-organic offerings.”
14;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Pharma and healthcare companies braced for Trump shake-up;US president expected to outline plans in speech to lower drug prices;"Pharmaceutical and healthcare companies are bracing themselves for new regulations designed to lower drug prices in the US as President Donald Trump tries to fulfil his pledge to stop them “getting away with murder”.Mr Trump is expected to give a speech outlining his plans as early as this week, after charging his health secretary and advisers with devising policies to shield patients from soaring healthcare costs.The most radical proposal under consideration would effectively outlaw drug rebates, according to two people briefed on the speech, who cautioned that plans had not been finalised and were still subject to change.If enacted, such a policy threatens to plunge the industry into a protracted period of uncertainty and to scramble the business models of pharmacy benefits managers such as Express Scripts, CVS’s Caremark and UnitedHealth’s Optum, which act as middlemen during pricing negotiations.It could also hurt the bargaining power of some drugmakers that offer hefty rebates to ensure they are reimbursed for their products.In the US, pharma companies tend to set a high list price for their medicines before subsequently offering large discounts in the form of rebates to insurers, employers and government-sponsored schemes, commonly known as “the payers”.In exchange for giving the rebates, the drugmakers demand the payers guarantee to reimburse them for their medicines and allow them access to a broad swath of patients.However, rebating has come under growing scrutiny from policymakers amid claims it stokes drug price inflation: as payers have demanded larger rebates, pharma companies have protected margins by raising their list prices.PBMs and insurers have also been accused of hanging on to a portion of the rebates to boost their profitability rather than passing the savings through to patients.In a speech last week, Scott Gottlieb, the US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, raised the possibility that the practice could effectively be outlawed. Drug rebates are protected by federal law via an exemption that shields them from anti-kickback legislation, but he suggested that could change.“What if we took on this system directly, by having the federal government re-examine the current safe harbour for drug rebates under the anti-kickback statute?” he asked.Such a policy could be achieved through regulatory changes and would not require new legislation or an executive order from Mr Trump, according to one source briefed on the proposal, which means it could be implemented relatively quickly.One person familiar with the plans said Mr Trump had demanded his advisers come up with a high-profile policy that would make a splash and match his fiery rhetoric and tweets on high drug prices.The real negotiated price of a drug after it has been rebated is a fiercely kept secret, known only by the payer and drugmaker, which critics say makes it impossible for a free market to operate.“This is the single biggest legislative action that could make a difference in bringing down drug prices,” said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help people cut the amount they spend on medicines.He added: “It helps remove the complexity and chaos that has fuelled unsustainable price increases and allows an actual free market to take hold.”Although the outlawing of rebates would prompt a big change in the way the system operates, pharma lobbyists say they are reasonably confident they have seen off the introduction of their nightmare scenario.The three measures most feared by the industry were caps on drug prices, allowing the government to negotiate prices on behalf of retirees in the Medicare scheme and a loosening of regulations that make it impossible to “re-import” cheaper medicines from countries such as Canada.In a statement last week, Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, said the plan would “take aim” at four problems: “high list prices for drugs; seniors and government programs overpaying due to lack of negotiating tools; burdensome out-of-pocket costs for consumers; and foreign governments freeloading off of American innovation”."

16;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-03-22T05:01:04Z;Death of Texas teacher highlights true cost of US drugs;Flu victim should have paid much less for her medication, data show;When Heather Holland, a primary school teacher, went to collect her flu medicine at a local drugstore in Texas in January, she balked at the price. The pharmacist said she would have to pay $116 out of her own pocket, so she left empty-handed.Her husband returned to the pharmacy the next day to pay for the medicine, a generic version of Tamiflu, and Mrs Holland starting taking the drugs. But her condition continued to deteriorate. A few days later she died in hospital. She was 38.There is no way of knowing whether Mrs Holland, who was in otherwise good health, would have survived if she had taken the medicine sooner, although the delay cannot have helped.A Financial Times analysis of confidential and public pricing data has found that Mrs Holland should have paid much less for her flu medication.Her story captured the attention of a US public already outraged by the soaring cost of healthcare, and prompted many to ask the same question: how is it that a common flu drug — which is on the world’s list of essential medicines — can end up costing so much in America?The answer lies in part in the miserly health insurance policies now held by millions of Americans, but also in the way that access to drugs is managed by for-profit “middlemen” such as CVS Health’s Caremark, Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum.These middlemen, officially known as pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs, are unique to the private US healthcare system. Their business model involves amassing millions of patients from different health insurance plans, before using the combined heft to demand big discounts from drugmakers.Pharmaceutical companies that refuse to discount their medicines can find themselves frozen off the lists of drugs that PBMs are willing to pay for, which can have a chilling effect on their sales. More often than not they agree to the price cuts.But critics allege that PBMs have opaque business models that boost their profits while pushing up costs for patients.If Mrs Holland had not used her insurance card and instead paid outright herself, she would have been charged roughly $107 for 10 tablets of generic Tamiflu, according to several pharmacies contacted by the Financial Times.The cost would have fallen further still if she had foregone insurance and printed off a savings coupon from the website GoodRx. A 10-tablet pack of generic Tamiflu, also known as oseltamivir phosphate, can be bought without insurance for about $52 with a coupon at Walmart, the grocery chain.“What’s the point of having insurance, if it means you end up spending more than if you were uninsured,” asks John Norton from the National Community Pharmacists Association.In Mrs Holland’s case, it is hard to lay the blame for the $116 charge at the door of the pharmaceuticals industry, which has borne the brunt of anger over soaring drug prices in recent years.The list price for a 10-tablet pack of generic Tamiflu is about $129, according to figures seen by the FT, but the real negotiated price is significantly lower.According to confidential invoices seen by the FT, pharmacies can acquire a pack of Tamiflu for $45.46 if they contract with the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development, a large purchasing organisation that supplies its own stores, other big chains and independent pharmacists.Other large drug purchasing consortiums such as Red Oak, of which CVS is a member, and an alliance of Walmart and McKesson, the wholesaler, can source the drug for a similar sum, according to people briefed on the negotiations.That means the real amount being booked by generic drugmakers that sell the medicine is often below $45.46, after allowing for a cut taken by the wholesaler.So why did Mrs Holland end up paying $116, and what happened to the roughly $70 difference?Mrs Holland had such a high out-of-pocket charge because she was enrolled in a meagre health plan offered by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS), which charges families a monthly premium of roughly $1,300.The state of Texas contributes just $75 per member each month, a sum that has remained constant since 2003, even as healthcare inflation has risen at an average of around five per cent a year over the past 14 years.The TRS health plan has what is known as a high deductible: members have to cover all expenses until they hit a predefined limit of either $5,000 or $10,000 per family, at which point the insurance kicks in and covers 80 per cent of their drug bills.TRS outsources management of its health plan to two companies: Aetna, a health insurer, which looks after medical benefits such as visits to the doctor and hospital procedures, and CVS Caremark, a PBM, which controls access to medicines. The companies recently announced plans to combine in a $69bn deal.When Mrs Holland’s husband filled her prescription, a large chunk of the $70 difference was paid by the pharmacist to CVS Caremark, which kept an undisclosed cut before handing the remainder back to the Texas health plan.A spokesperson for CVS Caremark said it could not comment on Mrs Holland’s case for privacy reasons, but added: “Our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one under these circumstances.”CVS Caremark and other PBMs have touted their ability to secure discounts from drugmakers, as proven by the case of generic Tamiflu: pharmacies can acquire the drug for 64 per cent lower than list price.But they have come under increasing scrutiny over what portion of these discounts they keep to boost profits, especially at a time when patients are struggling with rising healthcare costs.“The vast discrepancy in what a drug costs the pharmacy and the amount it is sold for to the patient is pure profit for someone in the supply chain,” says Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help employers and patients cut their drug bills.Stung by claims that drugmakers are solely to blame for soaring prices, the pharmaceuticals industry recently launched an advertising campaign with the slogan “Share the Savings”, arguing that discounts negotiated by PBMs should be handed back to patients.“I don’t let pharmaceutical companies off the hook, but it’s true what they’re saying,” says David Mitchell, a pricing campaigner at Patients For Affordable Drugs. “The amount being paid by the PBM for the drug is much lower than the list price, and they are taking a huge piece of the action on the way through.”PBMs insist their practices have a deflationary effect on drug spending overall. Although they do not disclose how much of the negotiated discount they keep, they insist the vast majority is returned to health plans.However, the Trump administration recently signalled that its long-promised push to lower drug prices will focus on PBMs. At an event this week, Alex Azar, the US health secretary, said he would bring forward proposals in a month to explore “how we bring discounts that the middlemen right now are getting to our patients”.The largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, which operates its own PBM, Optum, said this month that it would pass on the “overwhelming majority” of discounts to some of its clients.CVS also offers “point-of-sale” rebates to 12m of its 94m plan members, meaning that negotiated discounts feed through to the patient. Ultimately, it is up to plan sponsors such as TRS whether they offer the feature to their patients.If others follow suit, it could mean a hit to profits for some companies in the healthcare supply chain. But it might also go some way to lowering the soaring drug bills being paid by patients such as Mrs Holland.It is a bizarre feature of the broken US healthcare system that insured patients can sometimes end up paying more for medicines than people without coverage.Some pharmacists say their contracts with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers can prevent them from informing the patient they could buy the drug at a lower price.“We need to remove those constraints, so the pharmacist can be more proactive — they can help the patient find the best price by asking the right questions,” says John Norton from the National Community Pharmacists Association.A group of bipartisan senators have introduced legislation designed to stop these “gag clauses” being included in contracts, while several states are also pushing new laws that target the practice.PBMs and insurers say they back legislative change, and insist that such contractual arrangements are not commonplace.“We support the patient always paying the lowest cost at the pharmacy counter,” says a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the trade association for PBMs.They add: “To the degree this issue was ever rooted in more than anecdotal information, it has been addressed in the marketplace.”
17;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-03-08T19:38:09Z;Cigna grabs vital scale with $67bn deal for Express Scripts;Takeover of pharmacy benefits manager to provide clout when buying drugs and services;With its $67bn takeover of Express Scripts, health insurer Cigna is sending a signal that it will have to get bigger to deal with the most pressing malady of US healthcare: soaring costs.Express Scripts was the last large independent pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, which acts a middleman in negotiations between drugmakers and the payers — the employers, insurers, and government, which buy medicines in the US. By buying the PBM, Cigna hopes to gain more scale so it can drive a harder bargain when buying drugs and services, not just from pharmaceutical companies, but also the doctors and hospitals that provide patient care. Since employers started funding healthcare during the second world war, the US system has fragmented into hundreds of for-profit companies, from insurers and private hospitals to blood-testing labs, pharmacies and drugmakers. Although all these companies insist they put patients first, they also have a competing duty to provide shareholder returns, and all have benefited in different ways as US healthcare expenditure, adjusted for inflation, jumped from $221bn in 1960 to $3.4tn in 2016, growing on average 5 per cent annually over that period.“The healthcare ecosystem puts tremendous pressure on our society, and by expansion on far too many individuals and families,” said David Cordani, chief executive of Cigna, on an investor call on Thursday, adding that the deal would make it “more affordable” for its customers to access care. With total US health spending forecast to hit $5.7tn by 2026, large employers from Walmart to IBM have started to worry that spiralling costs will eat into their profits and are demanding change. “The impetus behind this is that major corporates are really angry that insurance vendors like Cigna have been unable to contain the increase in costs,” says Roger Longman, chief executive of Real Endpoints, a health analytics company. “One of Cigna’s points is that they’ll have a lot more buying power after this deal,” he adds. That anger has prompted the formation of various alliances between large companies. Most recently Amazon announced it would start a new venture with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway with a mission to lower costs. And 40 large employers including American Express, Verizon and Coca-Cola have joined the Health Transformation Alliance, which is tasking the companies that provide healthcare to find ways to do more with less. So far, the response of companies such as Cigna and CVS Healthcare — the drugstore chain that recently agreed to buy health insurer Aetna for $69bn— has been to get bigger through megadeals, arguing that consolidation will give them the power they need to push down costs. Although the fragmented US healthcare system is still a far cry from the UK’s National Health Service, these deals are at least in part designed to emulate some of the huge power wielded by “single payer” healthcare systems. If a drugmaker wants to sell its medicines to patients in the UK, it must agree to sell those products at a price deemed acceptable by the country’s powerful gatekeeper, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or forgo those sales entirely. More often than not, pharmaceutical companies agree to sell their drugs at a considerably lower price in the UK, but insurers such as Cigna and Aetna can only dream of having such power. Drug costs, though, are only part of the problem: although spending on medicines has been rising well above inflation — especially for medicines prescribed by specialist doctors — drugs still only account for roughly 15 per cent of total healthcare costs. A far bigger chunk of the cash — about 60 per cent — goes to doctors and private hospitals, which earn more when spending is high. To tackle that part of healthcare spending, Mr Longman predicts that companies such as Cigna and UnitedHealthcare, the largest insurer, will start buying hospitals and clinics, and change their business models so they are incentivised to bring down costs. One of the driving forces behind the CVS and Aetna deal was a plan to turn CVS’s pharmacies into healthcare hubs, where Aetna’s patients could be directed to receive low-cost care. UnitedHealth has also moved into the “provider” sector, and in December spent $4.9bn on DaVita, which operates a network of clinics. It is still unclear, however, whether antitrust regulators in the US will agree that the megadeals being pursued by Cigna and CVS really are necessary to lower costs. Health insurers made much the same argument in 2015 when they tried to merge with each other in 2015 through big-ticket takeovers, but the Department of Justice blocked the deals.
18;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-03-07T02:56:11Z;CVS Health completes world’s third-largest corporate bond sale;US pharmacy chain raises $40bn to fund purchase of health insurer Aetna;CVS Health completed the third-largest corporate bond sale in history on Tuesday, underlining the market’s ability to absorb sizeable debt issuance at the right price, despite a backdrop of rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.The pharmacy chain’s $40bn sale — to fund its proposed acquisition of health insurer Aetna — attracted $120.7bn of orders, according to four people with knowledge of the sale.Investors said the debt’s reasonable pricing supported the record demand, and advance notice from underwriters gave fund managers the chance to set aside cash for the offering.Bankers and investors said the sale suggested the US bond market was comfortable with two key risks: rising yields on global government debt, and uncertainty about regulators’ approach to so-called vertical mergers, or tie-ups between companies that are not direct competitors.CVS sold nine bonds across seven maturities to fund the deal. Most of the securities face a mandatory redemption if the acquisition is not completed by mid-2019, according to Moody’s, which assigned the debt a Baa1 rating.Investors submitted more than $110bn of orders for $46bn of bonds issued by Anheuser-Busch InBev to fund its acquisition of SABMiller, and $101bn for the $49bn of bonds issued to fund Verizon’s acquisition of Verizon Wireless.Spreads between yields of the new securities and benchmark government debt were mostly similar or wider than spreads offered in other large bond sales.The new five-year CVS bonds were sold at a yield of 3.899 per cent, a spread of 125 basis points over Treasuries. To compare, five-year spreads were 120 basis points in the Anheuser-Busch InBev deal.CVS’s new 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of 4.475 per cent, 160 basis points higher than benchmark Treasuries, giving them the same spread as the Anheuser-Busch deal.Some commentators have questioned the market’s resilience — investor Bill Gross, for example, in January predicted the start of a bear market in bonds. Spreads widened for the corporate debt market as a whole in February, according to ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices.“We anticipate an uptick in M&A activity, so the success of today’s transaction is important to show the marketplace there is still plenty of liquidity,” said Dan Mead, head of the US investment-grade syndicate desk at BofAML.Some bond tenors were offered with steeper-than-normal price discounts, which investors said was to compensate for the risk that regulators may block the deal. The Justice Department’s challenge to the tie-up between AT&T and Time Warner has fuelled uncertainty about the CVS-Aetna deal.However, bullishness about the prospects of the combined company fed demand for the bonds.“They’re going to be a dominant player in multiple areas, assuming they’re able to execute,” said Matthew Brill, a portfolio manager with Invesco.The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year, pending regulatory approval. The bond offering is being run by Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.

That figure could still rise.The largest bond deal on record remains a $49bn issuance from Verizon in 2013 that the telecoms giant used to fund its purchase of Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless.CVS marketed new 10-year notes to investors on Tuesday with a yield 175 basis points above similarly maturing Treasuries, or roughly 4.65 per cent.All of the notes except the new 30-year bond will include a special mandatory redemption clause that requires CVS to withdraw the debt at 101 cents on the dollar if it does not complete its takeover of Aetna by September 3, 2019.The deal is being led by Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.
21;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CVS, Aetna shares lower as DOJ seeks more info on deal;;Shares of US health insurer Aetna and CVS Health, the pharmacy chain, trudged lower on Friday after the companies said their proposed $69bn deal would undergo more scrutiny by US antitrust regulators.The companies disclosed in regulatory filings that the US Department of Justice had requested additional information as part of its antitrust review of the deal, which was announced late last year.Shares of CVS were down 2.44 per cent to $76.87, while Aetna shares were off 0.77 per cent to $185.94.While the majority of deals are cleared by US regulators after a preliminary review, it is not unusual for deals as large and complex as the CVS-Aetna one to be subject to a so-called second request.CVS said in a regulatory filing late Thursday that it still expects the transaction to close in the second half of this year.CVS and Aetna aren’t the only companies looking to shake up the US healthcare sector — earlier this week, Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway joined forces to announce a healthcare venture in a long-term effort to lower bills.
22;CVS;CVS Corp;2018-01-30T18:17:09Z;Healthcare stocks lead fall in US benchmarks;Global bond sell-off pressures equity markets around the world;US equities took a sharp turn lower at the start of trading on Tuesday, driven by a fall in healthcare stocks after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan announced plans to create a company with the aim of cutting costs and improving services for their US employees.While the announcement is short on details, news of the partnership was enough to send health insurance stocks lower in morning trading on Wall Street.UnitedHealth moved down 3.2 per cent to $239.46, Aetna fell 2.2 per cent to $189.50 and Cigna lost 5.7 per cent to $211.54. UnitedHealth, the biggest US health insurer by market value, may also be facing a blow because it also runs a large health services unit called Optum. CVS Health, which agreed in December to acquire Aetna, traded down 4.4 per cent to $79.87.It came as the US stock market added to losses on Monday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.8 per cent to 2,829, alongside other big indices hit by a global bond market sell-off that has pressured equities markets around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 300 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell more than 0.7 per cent to 7,414, with consumer tech giant Apple coming under selling pressure following concerns about demand for its iPhone X.The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 index was one of the worst performing for the day, down 1.6 per cent.Healthcare costs in the US have skyrocketed in recent years, something that has driven up the cost of subsidising employee health insurance. In fact, the premium for a single person rose 4 per cent in 2017 to $6,690, and is up about 50 per cent over the past decade, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average worker contribution towards the premium in 2017 was $1,213.“From the provider side you have this competitor lurking out there,” said Joanne Wuensch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “We are dealing with a new consortium of companies that are saying they are going to try and manage this better.”The fall for healthcare companies follows a positive start to 2018. The group of shares stood as the best performing of the year so far until Tuesday’s dip, when the consumer discretionary sector moved into top spot. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index moved down 1.1 per cent on Tuesday but remains almost 10 per cent higher for the year.“Medical technology has had a very good start to the year,” said Ms Wuensch. “You have had a number of companies announce stronger than expected fourth quarters. Really what drives these stocks is better than expected revenue.”
23;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Business is becoming a battle of the giants;The rise of Amazon, Facebook and Google means antitrust rules need to be rewritten;"The biggest influence on this week’s $69bn deal by CVS Health, the US pharmacy chain, to acquire the insurer Aetna, went unmentioned. The threat of Amazon selling prescription drugs is shaking up the US healthcare industry.The same goes for US entertainment, with Walt Disney holding talks with 21st Century Fox to buy its film studio and cable entertainment channels. Lurking in the background are Amazon and Netflix, which are revolutionising the way people watch films and television.The common theme — one causing consolidation across a swath of industries — is the belief that to compete with internet giants, companies that are losing revenues to them must turn into giants themselves. The oligopoly of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix (and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China) is begetting others.Australia’s competition authority has launched an investigation into the market power of platforms such as Facebook and Google, which the media buying agency GroupM estimates will attract 84 per cent of digital advertising excluding China in 2017. But this is only one aspect of a broader antitrust challenge — the fact that corporate giants are emerging everywhere.Competition enforcers need to find a way to address it coherently. They are struggling not only because the new economy is a revolutionary phenomenon but because it defies the framework of antitrust law. As Richard Posner, the former US federal judge, once wrote: “This problem will be extremely difficult to solve; indeed, I cannot even glimpse the solution.”The framework rests on the idea that the task of antitrust is not to protect small businesses from big ones, but to maximise “consumer welfare” by reinforcing competition. Robert Bork, the judge and legal theorist who pioneered this in 1978, dubbed it “the antitrust paradox” — large enterprises can be good for economic efficiency.We are experiencing the result of Bork’s paradox. Since Penguin and Random House merged in 2013 to gain the heft to negotiate with Amazon over ebook royalties, there has been a stream of mergers prompted by a need to bulk up against internet platforms.CVS-Aetna is an example. The market values of US retail pharmacies such as CVS and Rite Aid have fallen, along with those of other chains, because of the growth of ecommerce. Their margins will be squeezed if Amazon becomes a cheap retailer of prescription drugs.The merger is an attempt to exploit physical presence by transforming the combination’s more than 9,700 stores and clinics into what it winsomely calls “America’s front door to quality healthcare” — centres at which Aetna members can get medical advice.It is also an effort to strike a deal that will be passed by US antitrust authorities, which have blocked horizontal mergers of healthcare companies in the same section of the market. These included Aetna’s $37bn attempt last year to merge with Humana, another health insurer, and the proposed merger of their rivals Anthem and Cigna, which was barred in April.US antitrust law has been friendlier to vertical mergers among companies in different businesses, such as CVS-Aetna, which Bork did not regard as much of a problem. But the US government is becoming more wary: the Department of Justice is attempting to block AT&T’s proposed $85bn takeover of Time Warner. An approval of CVS-Aetna is by no means assured.This makes for a strangely ambivalent approach towards corporate giants. The US is doing little to curb the biggest internet platforms but is taking action against medium-sized companies that aspire to compete with Amazon, Netflix and others at a more equal scale. Bork’s paradox is starting to bite.The school founded by Bork tends to regard new economy oligopoly as a self-correcting problem. Profitable networks are not “particularly secure against competition” because “the more valuable a hoard of buried treasure is, the more rapidly it will be recovered”, Judge Posner wrote. Companies such as Facebook will eventually be displaced, just as MySpace once was.But as time goes by, Amazon grows stronger, and Facebook acquires competitors such as Instagram before they make enough money for antitrust authorities to care, such confidence looks misplaced. Even if it turns out to be true, it simply involves one internet giant being replaced by another — Facebook’s advertising franchise being captured by a Facebook II.The way in which competition law works in the US gives antitrust officials only two choices. They can leave internet oligopolies alone and hamper the efforts of old economy companies to grow bigger too, or can allow an unfettered battle of oligopolies across industries. Neither of these approaches really suits bodies that are supposed to be against business trusts.Governments have another choice — to recognise that technology has hugely changed the terms of business and that antitrust enforcement must evolve in line with it. This implies a fundamental rethink of how the law promotes competition in the internet age. We cannot submit entirely to giants.john.gapper@ft.com"
24;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-12-04T19:07:29Z;CVS looks to create new model with $69bn Aetna deal;Drugstore chain hopes to win business by passing on savings to insurer’s clients;CVS Health, the largest drugstore chain in the US, has said its $69bn acquisition of health insurer Aetna will create a powerful company with enough heft to bring down the spiralling cost of healthcare in America.CVS says it will turn its network of 9,000 stores into “healthcare hubs”, where pharmacists and other trained specialists such as nutritionists will offer medical advice and services rather than just dispensing prescription drugs.By encouraging patients to access these “lower-cost sites of care”, CVS predicts it can reduce the rate at which people use more expensive services such as hospitals and urgent care centres, leading to big savings for Aetna and its clients.Larry Merlo, CVS chief executive, says billions of dollars are being wasted on healthcare, especially on chronic conditions such as diabetes, because patients do not following instructions given by their doctors.“We can help [patients] achieve their best health, and at the same time, reduce the cost of care that we’re incurring today,” says Mr Merlo.$5.5tnAmount the US is forecast to spend on healthcare by 2025One person briefed on the deal says owning an insurer will change the incentives for CVS. Whereas a standalone drugstore profits by serving as many customers as quickly as possible, an insurance company would want pharmacists and other staff to spend more time with patients so they do not end up accessing more expensive services, they add.CVS believes the new model will also lead to efficiencies for the combined company, which will have annual revenues of more than $221.4bn and roughly $18.5bn in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.The company is predicting $750m in cost savings in the first full year after the deal, announced on Sunday, closes.CVS hopes to win business by passing on some savings to Aetna’s clients — the companies that pay a large proportion of their workers’ health costs, and the US government, which foots the bill for retirees and the poor. Healthcare costs in the US hit $3.3tn last year, a figure that is expected to rise to $5.5tn by 2025.It also says the deal will lower prices for consumers, who are being asked to contribute an increasing share to the cost of healthcare out of their own pockets.Some analysts have interpreted the move as a defensive measure amid rumours that Amazon is planning to bring its low-cost model to healthcare by selling prescription drugs online.“CVS needs to overcome . . . the threat of Amazon’s entry into pharmacy,” says Ms Ana Gupte, healthcare analyst at Leerink.However, one person briefed on the deal says CVS first considered making an offer for Aetna several years ago, long before any suggestion that Amazon would disrupt the pharmacy market.The person says CVS shelved its earlier plans after health insurers tried to implement a round of consolidation in 2015 that would have seen Aetna buy smaller rival Humana. Aetna and its rivals abandoned those deals following opposition from government regulators, who were worried about the impact on competition.Analysts say the CVS transaction and the spectre of Amazon’s entry into the market is likely to prompt other companies to explore similar cost-cutting deals.Ms Gupte suggests Walmart, the grocery giant that has pharmacies in many of its stores, could follow suit by offering to buy Humana, for instance, and that drugstore chain Walgreens might make a bid for WellCare Health, an insurer.Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager that negotiates drug prices on behalf of insurers, said last week it was open to a deal with a health insurer or some kind of partnership with Amazon.CVS said it was confident of securing approval for the deal, which bankers describe as “vertical” because it involves combining two different types of company.However, some observers note that the US Department of Justice has been taking a tougher line on such deals, pointing to its recent decision to try to block the takeover of broadcaster Time Warner by telecoms group AT&T.“CVS wants to get more control over the flow of prescriptions from insurers, and that is why the government is likely to oppose a merger,” says Erik Gordon, a business academic at the University of Michigan.“The companies will argue that a merger is vertical and will cut costs,” he adds, “but the government has shown in its opposition to the AT&T-Time Warner merger that it will challenge vertical combinations that could impair competition, and it will be doubly vigilant in healthcare mergers.”One person briefed on the deal says there is some nervousness inside CVS and Aetna that President Donald Trump could also oppose the takeover on competition grounds.Analysts have also asked whether some of the health insurers who are customers of CVS’s PBM division, such as UnitedHealth, might take their business elsewhere if the company were to own a competitor outright.And while Moody’s, the credit rating agency, has hailed the combined company’s “potential to reshape the entire health plan market”, it also says the $45bn of debt that CVS is taking on to finance the transaction would result in a “significant weakening” of the company’s credit metrics.Given the risks surrounding the deal, some analysts question whether CVS could not have achieved its aims by signing an agreement with Aetna that stopped short of a full-blown takeover.“We await greater answers as to the rationale and advantages of an outright purchase as opposed to other potential combinations, such as a joint venture or partnership,” says Erin Wright, a healthcare analyst at Credit Suisse.
25;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-12-04T17:46:22Z;CVS/Aetna: vertically challenged;Health group bounced into a pricey deal by fear of Amazon’s disruptive power;We all have our demons. US healthcare groups fear Amazon, which is one reason CVS Health is buying Aetna in a $77bn deal. US trust busters may fear vertical integration, embodied in the combination of a pharmacy chain and an insurer. But the biggest bogey menaces CVS investors. This is the spectre of value destruction, with or without the intervention of Jeff Bezos.US television bears testimony to the high frictional costs of US healthcare. The proliferation of medical advertising includes a cable channel entitled “Prostate Discomfort? Get Relief Now!” Compared with this, even a repeat viewing of Justice League is alluring. US healthcare is, meanwhile, bottom for efficiency in a ranking of developed economies from The Commonwealth Fund, a Washington think-tank.Cometh the disrupter? Amazon has applied for licences to become a wholesale drugs distributor. It takes an imaginative leap to see the online group extending its scorched earth campaign from the retailing of cheap goods to that of expensive medicines. However, the moves helped end CVS’s vacillation over a long-mooted takeover of Aetna.The deal terms show previous qualms were well-founded. CVS is paying $207 per Aetna share in cash and its own equity. That represents a 32 per cent premium to the insurer’s three-month undisturbed average price, which is not covered by expected cost savings. Taxed and capitalised, these would be some $5bn.The forward earnings multiple of 21 times is only a nose ahead of the stretched US market. But once CVS assumes Aetna’s borrowings and has added to its own, net debt will be a hefty 4.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. CVS will suspend buybacks while it reduces leverage.Potential for greater pricing power may worry regulators instead. Their distaste for vertical deals is reflected in a challenge to AT&T’s $85bn takeover of Time Warner. Investors should ask whether up-and-down integration will help CVS in the first place.It worked for Carnegie Steel, which owned mines and railways in the 19th century. Other exemplars of a supply chain in a single entity have sometimes struggled. These include supermarket chain Wm Morrison and energy group Centrica, both of the UK. Vertical integration can trap value, as well as release it. Mr Bezos would still have plenty to disrupt.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

26;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CVS Health to buy Aetna for $69bn;Prescription drug deal seen as move to head off Amazon’s entry into pharmacy business;CVS Health, America’s biggest drugstore chain, has agreed to acquire the healthcare insurer Aetna for about $69bn, in a deal that will create a new giant in the prescription drugs industry and is likely to spark further consolidation in the sector. The combination, which is set to shake up the US prescription drugs business, is seen as a defensive move by incumbents before the speculated entry of Amazon into the pharmacy business. In the past few months Amazon has received wholesale licenses with US state pharmacy boards, prompting rumours the ecommerce behemoth could start selling prescription drugs via its powerful online platform. Under the terms of the agreement shareholders of Aetna, the third-largest health insurer in the US by sales, will receive $207 per share, comprising $145 in cash and $62 in CVS stock. Including the assumption of Aetna's net debt, the total value of the deal is $77bn.The offer, which will see Aetna shareholders own about 22 per cent of the combined company, represents a nearly 30 per cent premium to Aetna’s share price in late October when news of a potential deal was first reported. Aetna was forced to drop its $37bn takeover agreement with rival Humana last year after being blocked by regulators, who said the deal would hurt competition and consumers. For similar reasons, the Department of Justice also blocked the $54bn merger between Anthem and Cigna. Analysts speculate that Humana, Anthem and Cigna are likely to explore mergers with large retailers as they seek to fight rising drug prices and ballooning costs related to the Affordable Care Act.Large US retailers such as Walgreens and Walmart are viewed as potential suitors of these health insurers, according to analysts and bankers in the sector. Some of them have held informal talks with health insurers in recent weeks, according to multiple advisers, as they too prepare for the entry of Amazon into the pharmacy sector. The CVS-Aetna combination would give the newly formed company better leverage in striking deals with drugmakers, analysts say. CVS, in addition to its nearly 10,000 pharmacy stores, operates a pharmacy benefits management business (PBM) that negotiates prices for medicines with big pharma groups. The deal would “diversify CVS profit streams ahead of an Amazon entry and set the stage for a new healthcare-retail delivery model,” said Ricky Goldwasser, analyst at Morgan Stanley. The deal is expected to generate up to mid-single-digit revenue accretion by late 2019, including the ability to deliver $750m in near-term synergies, the companies said.Larry Merlo, CVS Health president and chief executive, said the goal of the deal was to remake the consumer healthcare experience in the US by bringing various strands of the industry under one roof. The combined company aimed to become “America's front door to quality healthcare, integrating more closely the work of doctors, pharmacists, other healthcare professionals and health benefits companies to create a platform that is easier to use and less expensive for consumers”, he said.Mr Merlo will keep his current role in the combined company. Mark Bertolini, chief executive of Aetna, and two other Aetna directors will be added to the CVS Health Board. Mr Bertonlini will not have operational role, but other members of Aetna’s management are expected to stay on and run the company as a stand alone unit.The combination of a vast drugstore chain with an insurer is a first in the US, and although it will not consolidate either sector the deal is still likely to be closely scrutinised by antitrust regulators, which are concerned about any one company amassing too much consumer power.The DoJ has become sceptical of so-called vertical deals such as CVS-Aetna, fearing a buyer may use its distribution power at one stage of the value chain to gain leverage in other stages — for example, by excluding competitors offering a similar service to the company they acquired.Historically, regulators have addressed antitrust concerns in vertical mergers with behavioural remedies, where the buyer agrees not to act in an anti-competitive way with rivals. However, Makan Delrahim, the DoJ’s newly confirmed head of antitrust, said last month that behavioural remedies were hard for regulators to monitor, suggesting that structural remedies, which can include large divestitures, are preferable. Late in November, the DoJ moved to block AT&T’s $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner, which is a vertical deal.Barclays and Goldman Sachs advised CVS, while Shearman & Sterling, Dechert, and McDermott Will & Emery provided legal advice. Lazard and Allen & Co advised Aetna, while Davis Polk & Wardwell provided legal advice.Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are providing $49bn of financing commitments to CVS to complete the deal.This story has been amended since publication to clarify who is advising CVS and to correct a description of Mark Bertolini’s role in the combined company.

28;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Pharmacies are set for a big dose of Amazon;A complex, opaque and concentrated market could use a shake-up;One can only admire Amazon’s ambition. It expands into ever more distant parts of the retail landscape: industrial supply, streaming video, groceries, fashion. It provides supply-chain services to other retailers. It operates physical stores. It is the biggest cloud services company in the world. When an experiment fails — as its foray into mobile phones did — its appetite for future ventures is undiminished.It is surprising, then, that Amazon has not already dug into the US pharmacy market. It is a more highly regulated market than any of Amazon’s current markets. That aside, though, it has several features that put it right in Amazon’s sweet spot. It is heavy on both digital and physical logistics: getting the right drug in the right amount to the right person at the right time, with little room for error, is the essence of the industry. The business is dominated by a few companies that make very respectable returns, an invitation for Amazon’s characteristic undercutting strategy. And it is very, very big.Amazon has only gone as far as meeting with a few industry figures and hiring a few executives in the field. This alone has been enough to set the industry on edge.The US pharma value chain has four links. At the top are drugmakers themselves who (for the foreseeable future) have little to fear from Amazon. Then there are the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which have three roles: negotiating drug prices with manufacturers, processing pharmacy benefit claims, and operating home-delivery pharmacies. Next are the wholesalers, who physically distribute drugs to pharmacies and hospitals. Finally come the retail pharmacies.The PBM, wholesale and retail pharmacy industries are all highly concentrated, after decades of unchecked consolidation. Three PBMs, Express Scripts, Caremark and Optum Rx, control three-quarters of that market, according to Barclays’ research. The first is an independent company valued at $44bn. The latter two are owned by CVS Health, the largest US pharmacy chain, and UnitedHealth, the biggest health insurer, respectively. Unsurprisingly, the industry boasts strong returns. Express Scripts’ percentage return on invested capital is in the mid-teens, well above Amazon’s level, and it earns about $5 in operating profit for every prescription it processes.There are three dominant wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, with a total market value of $77bn. They distribute 90 per cent of the drugs sold in the US. The two largest retail pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have almost 18,000 outlets between them and control half of the market. At both the distributors and the pharmacies, returns on capital are, again, solidly ahead of Amazon’s.Join us on November 21 for a conversation about the lessons the global HIV epidemic has had for other areas of medicineIf Amazon shook up this cozy industry, competing profits away while improving service — as it has in other parts of retail — consumers would have reason to be thankful. All the middlemen say they are fighting to keep drug prices low, but drug price inflation continues to outstrip consumer price inflation more broadly.There is just one little question. At what point do we stop thanking Amazon for the invigorating competition it brings to one industry after another, and start worrying about a single company dominating so many industries? At its current rate of growth, Amazon will be selling more stuff than Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, in less than a decade. Today, as Amazon expands, it makes the economy more competitive, and consumers benefit. It would be naive to think that pattern would persist forever.This article has been amended since it was first published to correct the owners of Caremark and Optum Rx
29;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-11-15T04:00:36Z;Fears of Amazon drug push rattle US healthcare industry;Speculation grows that company will sell prescription medicines and drive down prices;"The US healthcare industry has become gripped in recent months by the possibility that Amazon will start selling prescription drugs, creating a powerful new competitor in a sector worth $450bn a year.Amazon has not said anything about its intentions, leaving analysts and investors to engage in a kind of corporate Kremlinology, seizing on titbits of information to gauge whether the company is plotting a move.But the mere suggestion Amazon wants to enter the market is already proving consequential.Many analysts cite the competitive threat as the primary motivation for a mooted tie-up between CVS Health, one of the largest drugstore operators, and Aetna, the health insurer.Recent moves by pharmacy chains to offer next-day home delivery for medicines have also been linked to the possibility of Amazon entering the market.It is not just the size of the opportunity that might prove tempting for Amazon, but also the chance to lower prices and disrupt an opaque industry in which it is hard to know who to blame for the soaring cost of drugs.Just about everyone in the US agrees medicines are too expensive, but the industry is torn on who is responsible, whether it be pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers, or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who act as “middlemen” between drugmakers and their customers.“I think there’s plenty of opportunity for impactful efficiency measures to be put in place to control drug prices in this country,” says Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings, which makes software to help employers and their workers cut the amount they spend on medicine.“A new entrant like Amazon would put pressure on the pharmacies and the PBMs to do more with less.”The Amazon speculation has made an already torrid year even worse for US drugstore chains, with investors wiping more than $40bn from the market value of the biggest operators — Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS and Rite Aid — since the start of 2017.Their problems include the falling price of generic drugs, which has crimped the amount the companies make per prescription, and a woeful environment for bricks-and-mortar retailers as customers move online.“The drug retailers have a good deal to worry about because, if Amazon plays its cards right, it could offer generic drugs materially cheaper than the large players,” says Alex Schmelzer, chief executive of Mesa Rx, a pharmaceuticals cost savings consultancy.Although Amazon has kept quiet about its plans, it has become increasingly interested in healthcare in recent months, holding meetings with industry executives and making several senior hires from insurers and PBMs.The online retailer has cast a wide net in its search for talent; in the summer it hired Christine Henningsgaard, formerly chief operating officer of Hometeam, a New York start-up that offers in-home nursing and caregiving services for the elderly.Amazon confirmed the appointment of Ms Henningsgaard, who has worked in healthcare since at least 2007, but declined to elaborate on her role. Her LinkedIn profile says she works on “strategic initiatives”.The group has also invited several executives from companies operating in the pharmacy sector to its Seattle headquarters, according to two people who attended the meetings, in which participants talked about the challenges facing the industry and the high price of drugs.Many of the conversations concerned the company’s own health plan, which covers roughly 260,000 Amazon employees, and on the options for the 90,000 workers who joined the group following its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain.But one person who attended the meetings said Amazon executives see the company’s health plan — which ranks among the largest in the US — as a “testing ground” that would prove useful if the company entered the pharmacy sector.Amazon declined to comment on the private meetings.The company has already started selling professional medical equipment, and a person briefed on its strategy said it was this part of the business that recently applied for wholesale pharmacy licences in several states.Analysts and investors had initially interpreted the award of those licences as a firm sign the company was planning to sell drugs online, but Amazon said: “Wholesale licenses are required . . . to sell professional-use only products to healthcare customers, from medical and dental offices to hospitals.”In the absence of hard facts, analysts and executives have speculated as to what an Amazon push into prescription drugs might look like.Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink, anticipates that Amazon will take on wholesalers at first, using its significant warehouse capacity and logistics experience to undercut traditional players such as McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health.“The conventional wisdom is that wholesale margins are thin, but Amazon operates on even thinner margins,” she says.Ms Gupte thinks Amazon will then quickly turn to selling drugs to consumers, using its heft to increase the low proportion of prescriptions that are delivered through the mail, which stands at roughly 10 per cent.“If Amazon makes the experience as transparent and friendly as it is for their other goods and services, then I think they will increase that penetration from a low base,” she says.The company could also dispense medicines through retail pharmacies in its more than 450 Whole Foods stores, says Ms Gupte.Join us on November 21 for a conversation about the lessons the global HIV epidemic has had for other areas of medicineHowever, she believes Amazon will stop short of setting up its own PBM because of the significant medical expertise needed for such an endeavour. PBMs have a huge influence on the drugs that patients end up taking in the US because they control the “formularies”: the master lists of drugs that employers and the government will pay for.By giving preferential treatment to some medicines over rivals on the formularies, while excluding other drugs entirely, the PBMs play a powerful if indirect role in the doctor-patient relationship. “I don’t think Amazon is going to get into the clinical stuff,” says Ms Gupte.Ian Read, chief executive of Pfizer, the largest standalone drugmaker in the US, appeared to agree when he discussed the possibility of Amazon entering the market on a call with investors last month.“Any system of distribution that can cut costs and get a wide availability of products to patients is something that the whole industry would be interested in,” he said. But he warned that entering the PBM space was a “somewhat more difficult proposal” because Amazon would be deciding on whether patients could access specific drugs.However, some large US employers want to see Amazon do exactly that, arguing it is not possible to bring down the aggregate cost of medicines without having the power to ensure patients are actually prescribed cheaper alternatives in the first place, such as generics or rival branded drugs that cost less.“The problem in the US pharmacy system is that too many prescriptions are being written that are not right for the patient,” says Rob Andrews, chief executive of the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 40 large employer-sponsored health plans, including IBM, American Express and Verizon.“Getting the wrong drug to the patient more efficiently is not the answer to that problem,” says Mr Andrews. “We don’t want to buy a discount seat on the Titanic.”If Amazon does decide to enter the pharmacy industry, some observers expect the online retailer’s biggest challenge to come from Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire and chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance.Mr Pessina sits atop one of the biggest forces in healthcare, having engineered a string of deals over several decades that saw him turn his small Italian wholesaler into a drugstore giant that owns the Walgreens chain in the US and Boots in the UK.A former associate says it would be “wrong to count him out” if the pharmacy market were to enter a period of upheaval, pointing out that the consummate dealmaker had to recently abandon a takeover of Rite Aid after it was thwarted by regulators. (Mr Pessina had to content himself with buying a chunk of his smaller rival’s stores instead.)Another person who has advised Mr Pessina says the 76-year-old regards his foray into the US healthcare market as “unfinished business”. Although Mr Pessina has signed a string of agreements designed to consolidate the drug supply chain, he has not yet completed the kind of transformational deal that has become his hallmark.“Stefano is a visionary guy who engages in a lot of deal activity,” adds Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.A spokesperson for Mr Pessina declined to comment."
30;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;CVS Health sales top estimates on pharmacy growth;;Growth in its pharmacy business helped CVS Health deliver better-than-expected sales during the third quarter even as higher generic drug dispensing rates kept a lid on profit margins.The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager reported revenues of $46.18bn for the three months to end of September, a 3.5 per cent increase from the prior year period and just a hair above a consensus estimate of $46.17bn.The gains were driven by the 8.1 per cent sales increase in its all-important pharmacy services unit. The division, which posted sales of $32.9bn during the quarter, accounts for more than 71 per cent of total group revenue.Strong demand for its high-margin specialty pharmacy services helped offset a 2.8 per cent decline in same-store sales of general merchandise like toothbrush and beauty products at the front end of its stores. It also helped take the sting out of a 3.4 per cent drop in pharmacy comparable sales. Although prescription volumes rose during the quarter, the sales of more generics eroded the overall value of total drug sales.Weaker margins, along with costs related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma and pension settlements dragged net income 16.6 per cent lower to $1.28bn, or $1.26 a share. Stripping out these one-off items, adjusted net income was $1.50 per share, ahead of the $1.48 analysts had predicted.“The solid third quarter results we posted today keep us well on track to achieve our full-year targets,” said chief executive Larry Merlo. “While operating profit in the Retail/LTC Segment was impacted by the devastating hurricanes, operating profit in the Pharmacy Services Segment was in line with expectations.”CVS also narrowed and raised the mid-point range of its full-year earnings. It now expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $4.98 and $5.02, compared to its prior forecast of $4.92 to $5.02.The relatively solid results come amid revelation that CVS has held high-level talks about a combination with health insurer Aetna which would create one of the most powerful forces in the prescription drugs industry.The two companies have been exploring a number of deals across the industry in recent months and there is no certainty anything will come of the discussions, after premature revelations.Shares in CVS, down more than 12 per cent so far this year, edged 0.2 per cent higher in pre-market trading.
31;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-10-26T23:35:56Z;CVS Health holds deal talks with Aetna;Shares in health insurance group rise on takeover reports sending valuation to $60bn;CVS Health, one of the largest US pharmacy retailers, has held high-level talks about a combination with health insurer Aetna which would create one of the most powerful forces in the prescription drugs industry.The talks come at a time of potentially tectonic shifts in the pharmacy industry, which is abuzz with rumours that Amazon plans to enter the sector. Earlier on Thursday, it emerged the retail giant had received wholesale licenses from at least 12 US state pharmacy boards.However, CVS and Aetna have been exploring a number of deals throughout the industry in recent months and there is no certainty anything will come of the discussions, after premature revelations. CVS is working with bankers at Evercore Partners and Barclays, while Aetna is working with Lazard.A CVS-Aetna deal would combine the third largest health insurer in the US with the two planks of CVS’s business: a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) that negotiates the prices of medicines with pharma groups, and the country’s biggest drugstore chain with almost 10,000 stores.Investors sold off shares in PBMs, drugstore chains and pharmaceuticals wholesalers on the speculation of a possible deal and the Amazon move, with Express Scripts, Walgreens, RiteAid and McKesson shedding between 3 and 6 per cent. Shares in Aetna jumped by 12 per cent, giving the company a market capitalisation of almost $60bn, while CVS lost around 3 per cent, putting its stock market value at $74.5bn.Some other insurers also have an integrated model that combines an insurer with a PBM, such as UnitedHealth, which cuts deals with drugmakers through its OptumRx division, and a consortium of Blue Cross Blue Shield state health plans, which negotiate via Prime Therapeutics. Anthem, the second largest health insurer, also entered the PBM sector recently by launching a new operator called IngenioRx. But a CVS-Aetna deal would stand out if consummated because it combines a large drugstore chain with an insurer for the first time, and also because it would put the pharmacy group rather than the insurer in pole position. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said they viewed the talks as a direct response to fears that Amazon plans to enter the pharmaceuticals industry by selling drugs online, setting up a PBM, or doing both. Although the licenses Amazon has applied for do not necessarily mean the company plans to sell prescription drugs, the company has hired several executives and managers from the healthcare industry in recent months. CVS and Aetna declined to comment on what they described as rumours and speculation. The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.It is far from clear that the CVS-Aetna combination would be approved by regulators: the Department of Justice recently torpedoed a tie-up between Cigna and Anthem as well as Aetna’s takeover of Humana, warning that both transactions would harm consumers by reducing competition.However, CVS and Aetna could present a deal as consumer-friendly because the combined company would potentially be able to extract better deals from drugmakers and help to contain the soaring price of medicines, according to one person briefed on the companies’ plans.President Donald Trump has described the prices charged for drugs by pharmaceutical groups as tantamount to “getting away with murder”.Drugmakers already say that PBMs, insurers and wholesalers are collaborating in ways that is hurting their margins, and generic drugmakers such as Teva and Mylan have blamed more powerful customers for price deflation that is roiling the industry.

The report said that CVS had proposed a price of more than $200 a share for Aetna, which would value the insurer at more than $66bn.

34;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-10-18T19:06:40Z;Anthem to launch own pharmacy benefits manager, shares hit new high;;Anthem shares hit a fresh all-time high before trimming their gains on Wednesday after the health insurer said it would launch its own pharmacy benefits management company that would result in annual savings of $4bn.Shares in the Indianapolis-based company jumped as much as 6.4 per cent to $199.23 before trimming back those gains to trade abut 3 per cent higher at pixel time.Anthem said it will begin offering a “full suite” of pharmacy benefits manager solutions from 2020 when its current contract with Express Scripts expires. PBMs act as middlemen between insurers and large employers. The company had previously indicated that it might not renew its contract with Express Scripts.“Through the process of evaluating many PBM options in preparation for the expiration of our current contract, we determined that our scale and experience best position us to deliver an innovative solution, and the launch of IngenioRx will allow us to break through what is now a complex and fragmented landscape,” said chief executive Joseph Swedish.Anthem also announced a five-year agreement with CVS Health, which rivals Express Scripts, that would work in collaboration with IngenioRX.“It appears as though the two companies will team up to leverage their combined scale to receive favorable drug pricing from manufacturers,” Michael Baker, analyst at RaymondJames said of the news.The new contract is expected to result in savings of more than $4bn a year once Anthem has fully migrated to the new platform, said Brian Griffin, executive vice president on a call with analysts. That is up from previous forecasts for savings of $3bn. The company expects that 20 per cent of the savings will accrue to shareholders and the rest will “work its way to help with the affordability of healthcare of our customer base”.Policymakers in the US have rebuked pharmacy benefit managers for a lack of transparency on drug prices and questioned whether the savings are passed on to customers. Pharmaceuticals and PMB’s have pointed fingers at each other for driving up healthcare costs.The move comes after Anthem — which has previously considered whether to extend its deal with Expess Scripts and that is set to expire at the end of 2019 — filed a suit against Express Scripts last year to recover damages alleging that it had been overcharged.CVS Health shares rose 2 per cent to $74.13, while Express Scripts shares rose 1 per cent to $57.85.Read more: Pricing row shines spotlight on US pharmacy benefit managers
35;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;US pharmacy chains slide on report of Amazon eyeing prescription-drug push;;Shares of pharmacy chains took a hit on Friday after a report that Amazon is nearing a decision on whether to make a big move into the online market for prescription drugs.Rite Aid shares dropped nearly 5 per cent to $1.98, shares in CVS Health declined 3.9 per cent to $77.74, shares in Walgreens dropped 4 per cent to $73.91 and Express Scripts shares slid 2.3 per cent to $62.55.The moves come after a CNBC report said Jeff Bezos’s e-commerce juggernaut will determine whether to move into the market before the Thanksgiving holiday next month.Americans spend nearly $1bn a day on prescription drugs —a figure that is expected to grow 6.3 per cent a year on average over the next decade, according to a report by The Brookings Institution.Amazon shares were up 1 per cent to $990.10 at pixel time.
36;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-10-06T15:07:10Z;Investors Chronicle: CVS, Stanley Gibbons, Indus Gas;Companies analysis from our sister publication;"The shares trade on 31 times forward earnings, which certainly doesn’t leave much room for error, but we don’t think this should spook potential investors, writes Megan Boxall.Veterinary practice group CVS continues to defy those who doubt the sustainability of its growth. Over the past five years its shares have risen eightfold and, despite a continually demanding price-to-earnings ratio, another two-thirds have been added to the group’s value in the past 12 months.Full-year results from the Suffolk-based company have, once again, proven why the shares are so coveted. Like-for-like revenue growth of 6.3 per cent was compounded by £65m of sales from the 129 practices bought in the 2016 and 2017 financial years. Meanwhile, adjusted cash profit rose by 28 per cent to £42m, helping spark operating cash inflows of £37m, £3.6m up on the prior year.Aside from the excellent headline figures, CVS added another 53,000 animals to its Healthy Pet Club scheme, taking the total number of members to 306,000. As a result, monthly subscription revenue rose 35 per cent to £33m and now makes up over 13 per cent of monthly practices revenues. These high-margin, reliable revenues helped send gross margins up slightly to 79.9 per cent.Acquisitions have long been core to CVS’s growth and the spending spree has continued in the current financial year. Just three months in, and the group has already spent £13.5m on 10 new vet’s practices, which are expected to add £1m to adjusted cash profits in the year to June 2018. Thus, broker N+1 Singer has upgraded full-year forecasts and now expects pre-tax profit of £39m, giving adjusted earnings per share of 48p (from £34m and 42p in full-year 2016).But these forecasts exclude the potential for more acquisitions which are inevitable in the highly fragmented British veterinary marketplace. The group is also looking to build on its initial expansion into the European market — where competition for acquisitions is lower than in the UK — after buying nine vet’s practices in the Netherlands in the 2017 financial year. CVS retains significant financial firepower for acquisitive growth given its £153m debt facility and strong free cash flow, which is expected to rise to nearly £40m in the 2018 financial year.The market capitalisation of Stanley Gibbons was £120m in 2014; it has now shrunk to £14m. We are concerned by the uncertainty around future financing and the fact the auditor could not access “sufficient appropriate audit evidence” for various aspects of the statements. Sadly, we reckon a sale is the only way out for Stanley Gibbons, writes Harriet Clarfelt.Shares in Stanley Gibbons plummeted after the company reported a 28 per cent decline in revenues and widening pre-tax losses. A 48 per cent fall in net assets to £18m in the year to March 31 followed difficult trading, one-off costs from the group’s restructuring and guaranteed buybacks for some older investment contracts. With net assets below £20m, and a qualified audit report, the troubled stamp and coin company is now in default — it is dependent on its bank’s ongoing support.At the year-end, its bank loan was £8.3m, to be amortised at £500,000 per quarter from December 2017 until the repayment date in May 2018. A £10m revolving credit facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland is due for repayment at the same time.Management is discussing short-term liquidity needs with the bank. Alternatively, the group said other sources of finance might be available to them, via further asset disposals or from an alternative finance provider. Despite its dire financial position, executive chairman Harry Wilson, asserts “there is a market there for what we do”.There were small signs of progress. The restructuring programme reduced annualised operating costs by over £10m to £53m. Meanwhile, the group announced this week that it had sold Dreweatts 1759, part of its interiors auction business, to Gurr Johns for £1.25m in cash, with a further £0.4m due over the next two years. In addition, its total debt fell to £16.5m from £21.9m a year earlier.Stanley Gibbons launched a formal sales process in June, and private equity company Disruptive expressed an interest. However, no further updates have yet been announced.On balance, we’re not convinced that Indus should be a public company. Half-year results will arrive in two months, after which we don’t expect to hear from the group until next September. Chief executive Ajay Kalsi would probably argue that the stock should be held for the long term, although as an 83 per cent shareholder, liquidity is not his issue. Indus has a nice business, but a detached approach to its listing that prevents us making a recommendation, writes Alex Newman.The last time we heard from Indus Gas was in the lull between Christmas and New Year’s Eve 2016. With the publication of preliminary results, the narrative has edged forward to March 2017, accompanied by another series of brief revelations: the period saw further appraisal drilling at the SGL field, while production wells and field development “continued as planned to meet contracted and planned gas sale requirements”.Shareholders are entitled to expect more detail, particularly in light of the “extremely challenging and volatile conditions facing the global oil and gas sector” seen in the year. The top line dropped, and gross profit only picked up following the receipt of $15.5m in compensation for a contract that went wrong. That could be a worry, given $46.6m of debt repayments are due in the current fiscal year — up from $34.2m in 2017.Arden Partners expects pre-tax profit of $44.7m and adjusted earnings per share of 24 cents in the year to March 2018, up from $38m and 21 cents in 2017.Is the party almost over for mining stocks? They’ve had a fantastic run, more than doubling since early 2016. But one indicator is warning of possible trouble ahead.The growth in China’s money stock is slowing down. The annual increase in the M1 measure of the stock has slowed from over 25 per cent last year to 14 per cent now, and next week’s figures could show a further slowdown.China’s M1 growth has been a leading indicator of changes in commodity prices, as measured by the S&P GSCI. Accelerations in monetary growth in 2006, 2009 and 2015 all led to commodity price booms a few months later, while slowdowns in 2007-08, 2011 and 2014 led to falls in commodity prices. There’s a simple reason for this. China’s monetary growth predicts the country’s industrial production, which in turn is a big influence on demand for commodities and hence their prices.The current slowdown in China’s M1 therefore warns us that commodity prices might be heading down soon. This matters for miners simply because falls in commodity prices are highly likely to be accompanied by falls in the FTSE mining sector — since January 2000 the correlation between annual changes in the two has been 0.63, which is a lot for volatile data.Putting this another way, if we control for changes in the All-Share index then each percentage point of annual change in commodity prices has been associated with a 0.65 percentage point change in the FTSE mining sector. This might not sound much, but because commodities are so volatile they can do a lot of damage. A one standard deviation drop in them over 12 months, for example, cuts miners’ share prices by 17 per cent.It’s not just miners that are vulnerable, though. The All-Share index generally is positively correlated with commodity prices, and not just because miners are a big part of the index.Worse still, mining stocks tend to move in the same direction as emerging markets — for annual changes in sterling terms since 2000 the correlation has been a whopping 0.82. For example, emerging markets fell with miners in 2015, and have recovered with them since. The same Chinese slowdowns that hit commodity prices and mining stocks also depress growth and appetite for risk in emerging markets.The slowdown in China’s monetary growth therefore warns us of possible double losses — on miners and emerging markets.Now, there’s no case for immediate alarm. M1 growth is for now well above the rates that led to horrible losses in 2008 and 2015. What we have here is an amber warning light rather than a red one. And with miners and emerging markets both still above their 10-month moving averages, a good historic rule tells us there might be a little more juice to be squeezed out of them.Nevertheless, investors in miners and emerging markets should at least consider their exit strategies, or at least ways of protecting themselves from possible losses. This is especially the case for those of you with big positions in both, as you are less diversified than you might think.Chris Dillow is an economics commentator for Investors ChronicleThe Financial Times and its journalism, including Investors Chronicle content, are subject to a self-regulation regime under the FT Editorial Code of Practice: FT.com/editorialcode"
37;CVS;CVS Corp;2017-06-26T19:49:25Z;Rite Aid shares surge on report FTC could greenlight Walgreens deal;;Shares in Rite Aid jumped more than 29 per cent to $4.02 on speculation Walgreens Boots Alliance would gain approval in its bid to takeover the US pharmacy chain.The combination of the second and third largest drugstores in the country would surpass the largest, CVS Health, and had prompted concerns from regulators who have been reviewing the deal for months.However, a report from CTFN — a news service specialising in mergers — citing former anti-trust practitioners, said the Federal Trade Commission was expected to approve the deal in a decision that could come this week.The share price increase was the company’s largest since 2015 and helped narrow its year-to-date losses to 52 per cent. In the revised terms of the deal, Walgreens had offered to pay $6.50 to $7 per share and had proposed divest between 1,000 and 1,200 stores to Fred’s pharmacy chain.Shares in Walgreens were 1.5 per cent higher at $77.46 on the day, while Fred’s shares increased 20.5 per cent to $12.35.
38;CVS;CVS Corp;2016-11-08T18:55:35Z;US companies report bad news on election day;Hertz shares drop by nearly half after car rental company slashes profit guidance;Earnings downgrades, weak profits and unexpected accounting moves were some of the announcements pushed out by US companies as Americans voted for the next US president.Hertz, the car rental company, saw half its market value disappear at one point on Tuesday after it reported third-quarter earnings late Monday night that fell well short of Wall Street estimates, leading it to slash its profit guidance for the year.Net income at Hertz plunged to $42m during the September quarter, compared with the $237m recorded during the prior year period. The drop was all the more notable given that revenue declined just 1 per cent during the quarter to $2.5bn.The company attributed the loss to a “substantial depreciation adjustment” it had to make on its fleet of cars and warned that it might have to make more adjustments in the next quarter.As a result, it cut its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of 51 cents to 88 cents a share, down from the $2.75 to $3.50 range it gave in August. The cut caught the market by surprise, with analysts at Deutsche Bank saying the move raised more questions than answers.Investors also dumped shares in retail pharmacy chain CVS, which warned that slowing prescription growth would hit earnings. The company projected the loss of 40m retail prescriptions next year as a result of restrictive new pharmacy networks that could benefit rival Walgreens Boots Alliance at its expense. As a result, it expected to see falling retail operating profit growth in 2017, and narrowed and lowered its profit guidance for the full year. CVS shares fell more than 13 per cent in morning trading.$42mdrop in net income at Hertz during the September quarter compared with $237m recorded during the prior year periodShares of home construction company DR Horton fell more than 7 per cent after it reported a sharp slowdown in order growth during its fiscal fourth quarter. The Texas based company said net sales orders, a closely watched indicator of future revenue, rose 3 per cent in the three months ended September. That was down from the 19 per cent pace logged during the fourth quarter of last year and much weaker than the 9 per cent increase analysts had expected.Online furniture retailer Wayfair, whose shares have been faltering in recent weeks under pressure from competitors such as Amazon, took another hit on Tuesday after it announced another quarter of losses despite increasing revenue. Its shares were down more than 10 per cent in morning trading, extending a drop that has seen the company’s shares fall more than 34 per cent compared with a year ago.
39;CVS;CVS Corp;2016-08-02T11:41:43Z;CVS logs mixed quarter despite pharmacy gains;;CVS Health revealed better-than-expected quarterly profits on Tuesday but said that its sales grew at lower pace than Wall Street analysts had forecast despite strong growth in its pharmacy services division.The group said revenues climbed by 17.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the quarter to the end of June to $43.7bn, shy of analyst estimates of $44.3bn.It came as revenues in its pharmacy services unit jumped 20.7 per cent to $29.5bn on the back of new business as well growth in its specialty pharmacy, which sells drugs that treat rarer diseases that are often more expensive than those sold in the regular pharmacy.Sales growth in its retail division rose at a lower clip of 16 per cent to $20bn in the second quarter, helped by the addition of long-term care pharmacy operations acquired from Omnicare in August 2015, in addition to pharmacies and clinics that are part of Target, the US retail chain, that it bought in December 2015.Pharmacy same-store sales, an important metric for the retail division, climbed 3.9 per cent, but were weighed down by the introduction of new generic medications.Same-store sales in the front of the store that sells assorted items from bandages to candy, fell 2.5 per cent, as a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday, as well as “softer customer traffic” offset an increase in the amount each customer purchased.“I’m very pleased with our solid second quarter results across the enterprise. Operating profit in the [retail and long-term care division] was in line with expectations while operating profit in the pharmacy services segment exceeded expectations,” said chief executive Larry Merlo.Net income fell to $924m from $1.3bn in the same three-month period in 2015. Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of $1.32 topped Wall Street by two cents.CVS said that it now expects full-year profits, on a reported basis, of $4.92 to $5 a share, from $5.24 to $5.39, pressured by an early payment of debt and acquisition-related integration costs. On an adjusted basis, the group tweaked its forecast to $5.81 to $ 5.89 a share, from $5.73 to $5.88 a share, compared with analyst forecasts of $5.82 a share.CVS, which was down by 4.4 per cent for 2016 as of Monday’s close, was little changed in pre-market trading.
40;CVS;CVS Corp;2016-02-24T13:23:33Z;Cheap-chic focus powers Target turnaround;;Target’s turnaround continued apace during the fourth quarter as its renewed focus on “cheap-chic” helped the retailer regain its standing among middle-class shoppers.Like-for-like sales rose 1.9 per cent for the three months to end of January, easily trumping expectations for a 1.4 per cent rise.Since taking over as Target’s chief executive in August 2014, Brian Cornell has made investment in e-commerce and designer collaborations his priorities – and the effort has been paying off.Much of the quarter’s growth was once again driven by gains in Target’s so-called “signature” categories – which includes baby products, fashion and furniture. The company said in a statement that like-for-like sales in these categories grew more than three times faster than the company average. Perhaps most encouraging for Target, which has been trying to shed its reputation as being laggard in e-commerce, online sales surged 34 per cent and contributed 1.3 percentage points to comparable sales growth.Nonetheless, total sales for the quarter dipped 0.6 per cent to $21.6bn as the increase in same store sales was more than offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses in December to CVS Health.Net earnings came in at $1.4bn, compared to a loss of $2.6bn in the prior year period. One blemish in what was an otherwise solid set of results was gross margin which fell to 27.9 per cent from 28.5 a year earlier as Target stepped up discounting and promotions during the holiday shopping season.Mr Cornell said:With traffic growing for five consecutive quarters and our signature categories of Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness leading our growth, Target’s results demonstrate that we are focused on the right strategic priorities.The focus on selling low-priced designer gear has helped shield Target from much of the gloom that has engulfed the wider US retailer sector. Just yesterday Macy’s reported a 4/8 per cent drop in fourth quarter like-for-like sales while Wal-Mart saw a meagre 0.6 per cent rise in same store sales.Shares in Target, down 3.8 per cent over the past year, fell 1.6 per cent in pre-market trading.
41;CVS;CVS Corp;2016-02-09T12:23:45Z;CVS boosted by Omnicare acquisition;;CVS Health delivered robust sales and earnings gains during the fourth quarter as contributions from its Omnicare acquisition gave a boost to business and helped offset the impact from its decision to stop sales of tobacco products.The US pharmacy chain bought nursing-home pharmacy Omnicare for about $12.7bn last May. Gains from Omnicare, particularly in drug sales, helped drive net revenues for the December quarter up 11 per cent to $41.1bn while net income rose by a similar amount to $1.5bn.As is the case with rival pharmacy operators, CVS is benefiting from rising drug sales, with demand being driven by newly insured Americans following the overhaul undertaken by President Barack Obama.Like for like pharmacy sales was up 5 per cent and was enough to offset the 0.5 per cent decline in front store sales caused by lost revenue from cigarette sales. That, along with strong gains in the long term care (LTC) operations following the Omnicare acquisition drove overall revenue in the retail pharmacy/LTC business up 12.5 per cent to $19.9bn for the quarter.In addition to operating retail pharmacy stores around the US, CVS also manages pharmacy benefits, handling the fulfillment of prescriptions on behalf of major insurers and employers.Here Omnicare also helped turbocharged business. The pharmacy service unit saw revenues surge 11.1 per cent to $26.5bn.Shares in CVS, down 11 per cent over the past 12 months, were unchanged in pre-market trading.
42;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;WebMD eyes sale to potential pharma or media buyers;Digital health publisher could attract interest from pharma or media groups;WebMD, the internet’s best known consumer health publisher, is exploring a sale that may attract interest from the pharmaceuticals and media industries, people familiar with the matter said.The digital company, which was founded in 1996 to provide data and advice about illnesses, has held talks with a number of potential buyers. Some of these people said bidders might include retail pharmacy chain Walgreens and insurance provider United Health.WebMD said it was “not currently in any negotiations to be acquired” after the Financial Times reported the company was exploring a sale.Shares in WebMD initially jumped as much as 9.5 per cent, but were down more than 8 per cent to $48.5 after the company released a statement during late-morning New York trading.WebMD and Walgreens already collaborate on a number of initiatives, including a virtual wellness-coaching programme that can be downloaded as an application on smartphones. Other companies that may be interested include CVS, a US rival to Walgreens, and health insurer Aetna.A deal would value WebMD at more than its $2bn market capitalisation. The company could also opt to form partnerships instead of an outright sale, people close to the situation said. They added WebMD last year hired bankers to explore a sale but later chose to remain independent.WebMD now averages 201m unique users per month. The company ranks as the 104th most visited site in the US, according to data from Alexa, the web analytics provider.Analysts said traditional media companies looking for a big digital audience could also target the site. The company’s dominant footprint in the consumer and physician web market gave it “scarcity and strategic value”, analysts at RBC said.“We believe the company could command a value significantly greater than its current enterprise value based on the strong profitability and cash flow dynamics of the business,” RBC said, adding that it could receive more than $65 a share in a sale.The news of deal talks comes as the healthcare industry is gathered in San Francisco for the annual JPMorgan conference.At the gathering, WebMD told investors that online traffic during the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 6 per cent year on year. WebMD’s smaller rival Healthline Networks signed a partnership with private equity group Summit Partners to develop its own offerings further.
43;CVS;CVS Corp;2015-12-23T15:41:13Z;Dynamic ads become new normal in podcasts;New technology aims to boost ad and audience growth as podcast industry matures;"When Serial, the 2014 podcast that led the revival of the format, launched its second season this month focusing on the case of Bowe Bergdahl, a US soldier charged with desertion, it also brought back a spin-off success.An advertisement for Mailchimp, the email marketing provider, became an unlikely internet hit last year thanks in part to a mangled pronunciation of its name as “Mailkimp”. In addition to becoming a popular meme, the advertiser got a deal on its sponsorship of the show, which reached 1m downloads in its first month — the fastest growth for a podcast at that time.Mailkimp has returned, but if you do not listen to this season’s episodes within the first few days of them being published, you may not hear the ad. The spot gets switched out for other advertisers including Audible, Amazon’s audio content company, and pharmacy chain CVS Health.This will become a more common practice in the coming year as dynamic ad insertion becomes standard practice for many podcasters. The new approach is just one of a number of efforts to accelerate the decade-old medium’s growth by supercharging audience and advertising growth.Dynamic ads make it possible to change commercial spots in an episode in the days, weeks and even months after it is first published. This lets advertisers run timely ads, such as a promotion for a movie release or a holiday weekend coupon, and target ads to different listeners.“Dynamic ads will benefit everyone: the programme creators because they will be able to have fresh ads for older episodes, the advertisers because they will not pay for out-of-date ads, and new advertisers who can get in on [a show] that remains popular six weeks after it comes out,” says Andy Bowers, chief content officer at Panoply, the podcast network owned by Graham Holdings.It is not yet clear what impact dynamic ads will have on podcast ad rates, which tend to fall in the range of $15 to $30 per 1,000 listeners — about five times the cost of a traditional radio spot — with the most popular shows commanding $100 or more.A recent report from Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism noted that Serial sparked the interest of advertisers and publishers looking to get into podcasting. But it concluded that “while Serial generated much media attention, it did not prompt a spike in podcast audience growth, which has remained steady for years”.Alphaville’s Cardiff Garcia talks to Financial Times media reporter Shannon Bond and Buzzfeed’s Nick Quah about the podcast renaissance, and they also recommend a few of their favourite podcasts to FT listenersTo change that, companies including Clammr and Sweden-based Acast, which the Financial Times works with, are working on ways for listeners to share snippets or specific moments of a podcast episode, in the hope of making audio more shareable on social networks.“Every media format has a short-form social flavour or tool,” says Parviz Parvizi, co-founder of Clammr, which makes a tool to create, share and discover 24-second audio clips. “Text has Twitter, pictures have Instagram and Pinterest, video has Vine. It’s clunky and hard to find great audio.”Facebook has begun showing audio previews from National Public Radio and Serial directly in its users’ news feeds, allowing them to listen to clips while they browse the social network.But whether short audio clips will convert more people into podcast loyalists is a “very promising but still unproven theory”, says Mr Bowers. “I haven’t seen that happen yet.”Podcast companies say the industry’s maturation will require the development of new shows and styles.Panoply scored a big hit this year with The Message, a co-production with General Electric, that was both a piece of fictional entertainment and a long-form advertisement. The company plans to release more audio dramas in 2016 and try other styles.Every media format has a short-form social flavour or tool. Text has Twitter, pictures have Instagram and Pinterest, video has Vine. It’s clunky and hard to find great audio“Our biggest priority is not to fight over existing listeners but to find shows, formats and personalities that will bring new audiences into the medium,” says Mr Bowers.Johan Billgren, chief technology officer at Acast, says that the increasing professionalisation of the industry, both from a technological and revenue-generating standpoint, will spur the production of “more high-quality shows”.He adds: “People will be willing to invest more in making them because they’re getting a better return on their investment.”shannon.bond@ft.com

Both figures were broadly in line with the consensus estimate among Wall Street economists.Dave Cote, chief executive, said the company would “plan costs and spending conservatively” while continuing to invest in high-growth areas and technologies.The upbeat news comes a day after 3M, another large diversified manufacturer, cut its 2015 profit guidance, “reflecting the realities of a continued slow-growth global economy”.Honeywell shares rallied 5.7 per cent on Wednesday to $104.08.ConAgra Foods climbed after Jefferies gave the company a “buy” rating and a price target that implied a 26 per cent upside.Analyst Akshay Jagdale said the market was “undervaluing” the company’s underlying assets.He cited involvement from Jana Partners, an activist investor, a new chief executive and substantial cost-cutting efforts as bullish catalysts that could drive the stock higher.ConAgra shares rose 3 per cent to $40.80, pushing the gain this year to 12.5 per cent.The S&P 500 energy sector was the worst performer by a wide margin after a US government report showed an unexpected swelling of crude inventories last week.US crude oil prices swooned more than 4.4 per cent to $35.69 a barrel.Among the laggards were oil exploration and production companies.

45;CVS;CVS Corp;2015-10-30T22:02:35Z;Valeant severs ties with pharmacy group;Drugmaker ends relationship with Philidor as it fights to restore investor confidence;Valeant Pharmaceuticals is severing ties to a pharmacy group at the centre of allegations that have helped wipe roughly $50bn from its market value, as the Canadian drugmaker tries to arrest a crisis of confidence among its investors.Michael Pearson, chief executive, said on Friday that he had lost faith in Philidor, a pharmacy group that Valeant has controlled since late last year, when it purchased an option to buy the group.Philidor, a “speciality pharmacy” which used aggressive sales techniques to boost sales of some of Valeant’s top-selling medicines, said the move would force it out of business and that it had started winding down its operationsPhilidor’s fate was sealed late on Thursday evening when three of the biggest forces in US healthcare said they would refuse to do business with the pharmacy group.Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and UnitedHealth’s Optum said they would not reimburse prescriptions dispensed by Philidor. Together, the three pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, serve 215m US patients, meaning Philidor could not have continued to operate without their support.In a statement early on Friday, Mr Pearson said: “We understand that patients, doctors and business partners have been disturbed by the reports of improper behaviour at Philidor, just as we have been.”Valeant’s shares fell 15.9 per cent on Friday, as investors fretted about the affect of Philidor’s demise on its revenues: sales through the pharmacy have helped drive the drugmaker’s growth and accounted for 6 per cent of revenues in the first nine months of the year.Sales through Philidor are even more important for Valeant’s second best-seller, the toenail fungus cream Jublia, which derives 44 per cent of sales through the Philidor channel.The links between Philidor and Valeant came to the fore last week following research notes from a short seller that alleged the pharmacy was part of an accounting fraud constructed to inflate the drugmaker’s sales.Valeant shielded its relationship with Philidor and its option to buy the pharmacy from investors until earlier this month, when short sellers started asking questions about the arrangement.The Canadian company’s management has dismissed the short sellers’ allegations as “completely untrue”, although it has failed to address questions over the strength of its ties to Philidor and its liability should the pharmacy turn out to have broken the law.Valeant’s rejection of Philidor on Friday was part of a co-ordinated effort to arrest the precipitous decline in its share price, which has been buffeted by fears the company is too reliant on an unsustainable mix of aggressive sales techniques, sharp price increases and persistent dealmaking that has pushed net debt to $30bn.On Friday evening, Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, downgraded Valeant’s debt, lowering its rating on the group’s secured and unsecured bond by one notch to B+ and B-, respectively, with a negative outlook.“Given the multitude of legal, regulatory, and reputational issues that Valeant faces, we are revising our assessment of management and governance to ‘weak’ from ‘fair,’ which is the primary driver of the ratings downgrade,” said Standard & Poor’s credit analyst David Kaplan.Reports of wrongdoing at Philidor “further [harm] the company’s already tarnished reputation” and could affect its ability to market its products to doctors, S&P added.Valeant also announced it had hired a former US deputy attorney-general, Mark Filip, to advise a committee set up by the company’s board to investigate the drugmaker’s relationship with Philidor.In a synchronised show of support, Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager who is one of Valeant’s biggest investors, launched a staunch defence of its business model.However, he sharply criticised the way the drugmaker had handled the crisis, saying it had made a “costly mistake” by underinvesting in media and government relations, and that it had not adequately disclosed its ties to Philidor.As the company has recently found, investors’ perceptions can change fast in this environmentRead moreHe singled out Laurie Little, Valeant’s head of investor relations, as one employee who was overstretched.In an interview with the FT earlier this year, Mr Pearson touted the company’s low-cost structure and said this about Ms Little: “She is in charge of government affairs, investor relations, meeting the press, and probably a couple of other jobs. There would be 25 of her somewhere else.”Mr Ackman spent $200m acquiring shares in Valeant last week and on Friday he said he would have bought even more if he could: “My only disappointment is we didn’t have a lot of money — we had to scrape it together.”Mr Ackman bought a 5.7 per cent stake in Valeant earlier this year when shares were trading between $160 and $200, making him the company’s third-largest shareholder. The stock’s 40 per cent fall in the past two weeks has wiped $1.4bn from the value of that stake.The Philidor scandal is the latest and most serious setback for Valeant, which has been contending with investigations from various US authorities. It is also among the pharmaceutical companies that have drawn the sharpest criticism from US politicians about how much it charges for drugs.
46;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Pharmacy groups cut ties to Valeant unit;Shares slump further 15% as concerns over business model spiral;Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, two of the biggest forces in US healthcare, have stopped doing business with a pharmacy group controlled by Valeant, prompting a fresh sell-off in the struggling drugmaker’s shares.The so-called pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, who run prescription drugs programmes on behalf of US health insurers and employers, said they had terminated their contracts with Philidor, a pharmacy that dispenses Valeant’s drugs.It is the latest setback for Valeant, which has been battling concerns that its business model is unsustainably reliant on sharp price increases, aggressive sales techniques, and persistent deal making that has seen its net debt soar to $30bn.Shares in the company fell almost 15 per cent in after-hours trading, in addition to a 5 per cent fall during the day, to $95.80, valuing the group at $38.3bn.Roughly $50bn has been wiped from the company’s market capitalisation since the start of August, leaving its biggest shareholders — including hedge funds managed by Bill Ackman, Jeff Ubben and John Paulson — nursing huge paper losses.Valeant’s relationship with Philidor has been in the spotlight in recent weeks, amid claims the pharmacy uses aggressive techniques to boost the drugmaker’s sales, sometimes by circumventing systems put in place by Express Scripts and other PBMs to control the cost of medicines.Express Scripts said it was “in the process of terminating the Philidor pharmacy from our network”, and that it was evaluating four other pharmacy groups with which “Valeant has a similar relationship”.CVS said it had ditched Philidor after an audit found the company had not complied with the terms of their agreement.As the company has recently found, investors’ perceptions can change fast in this environment, writes John GapperRead onTogether the companies manage prescription drugs for 150m patients — a large chunk of the US healthcare market.Last week, Valeant revealed it had acquired an option to buy Philidor at the end of last year and has since been incorporating the group’s revenues into its own financial reports while keeping the arrangement hidden from investors.Philidor in turn has an option to buy a string of smaller, regional pharmacies.Express Scripts said it was reviewing its relationship with all such “captive pharmacies”, which “derive the vast majority of their prescription volume from one manufacturer”.Short-sellers sparked a rout in Valeant’s stock earlier this week by claiming Philidor was at the centre of an accounting fraud that had inflated the drugmaker’s revenues.Valeant has dismissed those allegations as “completely untrue”, though it has struggled to fully explain its ties to Philidor and to assuage fears that it will be ultimately liable if the pharmacy’s employees have broken any laws.Investors fret that Valeant’s revenues will suffer if Philidor dispenses fewer prescriptions: medicines sold through the pharmacy accounted for 7 per cent of the drugmaker’s revenues in the third quarter.Philidor also accounted for 44 per cent of third quarter sales of Jublia, a cream for toenail fungus that is Valeant’s second best-selling medicine.
47;CVS;CVS Corp;2015-10-28T20:10:44Z;Walgreens’ $17.2bn bid for Rite Aid faces regulatory hurdles;Stefano Pessina’s US ambitions reflect industry hopes that consolidation can offset price pressures;"Stefano Pessina, the Italian chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, has made his name — and fortune — sealing pharmacy deals across the globe.His latest move, to buy Walgreens’ smaller US rival Rite Aid for $17.2bn including debt, is unlikely to be his last, he says in an interview, as he pursues his ambition of creating a dominant pharmacy and drug wholesaling company that spans several continents.Walgreens already has 13,200 stores in 11 countries. “There will be some additional opportunities,” says the billionaire septuagenarian. “I’m sure the market will present opportunities. Now it depends whether I will be able to catch them or not.”Yet before he can look to any further deals in the US he must first get the Rite Aid acquisition past competition regulators.Mr Pessina had made no secret of his desire to secure a US deal at a time when he sees the healthcare industry in the world’s largest economy as one undergoing tremendous upheaval.“There is a wave of consolidation because margins are lower and people have to find additional ways to compensate for loss of profit, particularly in the US where the market is not particularly rational [and is] high priced. If squeezed, people have to find ways to survive,” he said on Wednesday.The high price of drugs in the US coupled with the intensifying push from Washington to reduce costs in a bloated industry has hurt margins and triggered consolidation throughout the supply chain: from drug manufacturers to insurers and drugstore chains like Walgreens.“Smart acquirers have used consolidation to drive efficiencies into the system while lowering costs and improving returns,” says Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI.CVS Health agreed in June to buy Target’s pharmacy business for $1.9bn, and Walgreens — before it completed its purchase of Boots Alliance last year — bought domestic drugstore Bioscrip, a specialty and mail-order pharmacy, in 2012.That was just one year after Walgreens acquired the Duane Reade drugstore chain. It also entered the distribution business in 2013, buying a stake in AmerisourceBergen and signing a decade-long brand and distribution deal with the company.The shake-up is highlighted by data showing merger and acquisition activity across the US healthcare industry is already at a record $447.8bn in the year to date, higher than any previous full year of announced deals, according to Dealogic. Pharmacy deals alone have reached $19bn this year, by far the biggest amount on record.We will see what the regulators will say; it depends very much on them. Whatever we think could be wrongWalgreens’ Rite Aid offer is the latest deal driven by pressure on margins in the industry. The tie-up would generate $1bn in cost synergies, it reckons, in areas such as procurement. But it also it intends to invest in improving Rite Aid’s stores, which analysts say is much needed.“The key will be revamping Rite Aid stores and footprint which has been underinvested in for many years, and driving [its] beauty [and] private label [products],” Evercore’s Mr Muken says.Some bankers and lawyers, who are not directly involved in the deal, say that antitrust obstacles will be substantial as combining the companies will create a de facto duopoly in the US, between Walgreens and CVS.Analysts have also raised some concerns, but so far have only suggested that a sale of some drugstores might be required in regions on the east and west coasts, where the two companies overlap. Some note that the market is already “highly competitive”. They add that pharmacy benefit managers — the companies that reimburse pharmacies for dispensing prescriptions — are already consolidating and have been pushing down the level of reimbursements drugstore chains have been receiving.Mr Pessina is reluctant to be drawn on the issue of regulatory approval. Asked whether he expects to have to sell some stores he says: “This is the public wisdom. We will see what the regulators will say; it depends very much on them. Whatever we think could be wrong.”Walgreens and Rite Aid would control 22 per cent of revenues from prescriptions, compared with 23.7 per cent for CVS, according to Pembroke Consulting.The remainder of the industry is made up of many smaller players, such as Express Scripts, which has a mail-order pharmacy business as well as being a pharmacy benefit manager, with market shares ranging from 12.4 per cent to as little as 0.5 per cent.Despite this fragmentation, Mr Pessina does not expect more merger activity between pharmacies. His view suggests that further consolidation could instead focus on deals between different types of companies within the supply chain.Walgreens’ investors initially welcomed the proposed acquisition, sending shares sharply higher when it was first reported on Tuesday. But on Wednesday the stock fell 11 per cent to $84.95, below where it started the week, after the company said it was suspending share buybacks to help fund the Rite Aid deal.The company is also using debt to fund the purchase. This prompted Moody’s to put Walgreens’ credit rating on review for a downgrade, highlighting the speed at which it was making another acquisition, not even a year before it closed the deal with Boots.If Mr Pessina’s future is anything like his past, however, investors may not have to wait too long for the next deal to come along."
48;CVS;CVS Corp;2015-08-04T16:35:57Z;CVS Health dips on retail setback;US stocks slip on call for September rate rise;CVS Health shares weakened on Tuesday after the US drugstore chain warned sales growth in its retail stores had cooled and narrowed its earnings outlook for the remainder of the year.The US pharmacy group said same-store sales, a closely scrutinised metric of underlying growth, rose 0.5 per cent in the quarter, down from a 1.2 per cent gain in the first three months of the year.Net profits in the quarter rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn, or $1.12 per share, on a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $37.2bn.CVS, which also manages pharmacy benefits and the fulfilment of prescriptions on behalf of large insurers and employers, said it expected adjusted earnings to range between $5.11 and $5.18 a share, compared with a previous outlook for $5.08 to $5.19 a share.Analysts on Wall Street expect the company to report full-year results of $5.17 a share.John Heinbockel, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said pressures on the company’s gross margins nonetheless did not “call secular growth into question”.“We view CVS Health as the rare large consumer company that can generate 10 per cent secular earnings before interest and taxes growth, driven by strong underlying growth,” he said.Shares of the company fell 3 per cent to $108.81 in midday trading, wiping more than $4bn off the company’s valuation. CVS Health recovered later in the trading day to close at $109.96. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 0.25 per cent to close at $95.67.Apple shares fell another 3.2 per cent on Tuesday, compounding a fall of 2.5 per cent the previous day, on investor concerns about its growth in China. Shares closed at $114.64 compared with their pre-earnings high of $133 two weeks ago.Shares of Coach, the entry-level US accessories maker, climbed 3.2 per cent to close at $31.41 after the company said it expected sales at its namesake brand to grow in its current fiscal year.Revenues in its fourth quarter, which ran to June 27, slipped 12 per cent from a year earlier to $1bn, while profits tumbled 84 per cent to $11.7m, or 4 cents a share.Analysts on Wall Street had expected the handbag maker to report a profit of $67.5m on sales of $973m.Time Inc advanced 2.6 per cent to $22.43 after cost cuts helped the magazine publisher swing to a profit in its latest quarter.The company, which owns the People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune titles, said sales fell 6 per cent from a year earlier to $773m, ahead of consensus forecasts. The group swung to a profit of $24m, or 22 cents a share, from a loss of $32m a year ago.Baxalta, the Illinois-based biotech recently spun off from Baxter, gained nearly 12 per cent to close at $37.10 after UK-listed, Dublin-based Shire made an approach to take over the maker of treatments for haemophilia and other bleeding disorders.TriNet shares tumbled almost 39 per cent to $16.33 after the provider of human resources services to small- and midsized businesses swung to a surprise net loss in its latest quarter.The group said it lost $1.3m, or 2 cents a share, in the three months to the end of June. Analysts on Wall Street had expected the company to report a profit of $10.1m.TriNet blamed a “higher than expected number of large medical claims” for the loss.Overall, US equity markets slipped after Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said it was “appropriate” for the US central bank to raise rates in September, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.The S&P 500 slipped 0.22 per cent to close at 2,093.32 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27 per cent to close at 17,550.69.

49;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Cigna rejects raised $53.8bn Anthem move;Groups in US healthcare insurance sector jostle for position;Cigna on Sunday rejected an increased $53.8bn bid including debt from Anthem, describing it as inadequate, as its rival seeks to emerge on top of a complex web of takeover attempts in the US healthcare insurance sector.Anthem had announced its raised offer of $184 per share over the weekend, amid a race to consolidate following the introduction of “Obamacare”.The offer, almost $29 per share above Cigna’s closing price on Friday of $155.30, represented the fourth and highest offer by Anthem, whose initial move to acquire Cigna on June 3 was worth $174.Cigna said on Sunday: “The Cigna board has unanimously determined the proposal is inadequate and not in the best interests of Cigna’s shareholders.” However, it kept open the door to a possible deal “under the right circumstances”.The new offer came as Aetna, the industry’s number three, is considering a bid to acquire Humana, and UnitedHealth, the market leader, is exploring its options. If Cigna had agreed to a deal it would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, and beat CVS’s $26bn takeover of Caremark in 2006.A deal would also have seen a combined Anthem and Cigna become the top player in the sector, depending on whether UnitedHealth bought a rival.Investors and analysts say the industry is reacting to changes introduced by the Affordable Healthcare Act, which has provided health insurance plans to 16m previously uninsured Americans, prompting predictions that the current crop of five large groups will shrink to three.The decision by Anthem to make its offer public came amid wrangling over whether David Cordani, president and chief executive of Cigna, would become chief executive of a merged company.The Cigna board has unanimously determined the proposal is inadequate and not in the best interests of Cigna’s shareholdersBefore Cigna’s rejection of the offer, Joseph Swedish, president and chief executive of Anthem, said in a public letter to Cigna’s board: “We were stunned that the Cigna board continues to insist on a guaranteed CEO position for Mr Cordani over choosing to allow its stockholders to realise the significant premium being offered.”In a statement he added: “With the co-operation of Cigna management and board of directors, we expect that we could reach a mutually agreeable and negotiated transaction by the end of June 2015.”Cigna hit back at Anthem on Sunday, criticising Mr Swedish, who would have become chief executive, president and chairman of the board under Anthem’s most recent proposal, as well as leading the integration team.“Your insistence that one person (Joseph Swedish) assume four roles …is disconcerting and risky,” said Mr Cordani in a letter to Anthem’s board co-signed by Isaiah Harris Jr, Cigna chairman.However, Cigna remains open to the two companies joining.“A combination involving Anthem and Cigna under the right circumstances has the potential to bring together our complementary strengths in a manner that would provide substantial benefits to both consumers of healthcare services and healthcare professionals, while delivering immediate and sustainable economic returns to shareholders,” the letter said.UBS and White & Case are advising Anthem.

50;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Anthem makes $45bn offer for rival Cigna;Health insurance industry consolidation spurred by Obama reforms;Anthem has started a complex takeover war in the US health insurance industry by making a $45bn approach for Cigna as the sector prepares for a wave of consolidation spurred by the introduction of “ Obamacare”.Anthem has tentatively offered $175 a share for Cigna, a premium of 27 per cent over the company’s closing price on Friday, valuing the fourth largest health insurer at almost $45bn excluding debt, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Cigna rebuffed the offer, one person said.A deal would torpedo a possible tie-up between Cigna and Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, which has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn. Aetna, the industry’s number three player, is also said to be interested in Humana, while UnitedHealth, the market leader, is exploring its options.The flurry of takeover talks comes as analysts predict the US health insurance industry will shrink from five large groups to three, as companies try to position themselves for changes being ushered in by the Affordable Healthcare Act, the signature reforms of President Barack Obama.If consummated, a takeover of Cigna by Anthem would be the biggest ever transaction in the managed healthcare industry, trumping the $26bn that CVS paid for Caremark in 2006. Anthem’s offer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Insurers have shied away from big-ticket mergers and acquisitions since Mr Obama outlined his healthcare reforms in 2009, preferring to wait and see how the new legislation would affect their prospects.Since then, investors and analysts have said the enrolment of more than 16m uninsured Americans into health insurance plans has created opportunities and challenges. Shares in Anthem have increased 55 per cent in the past twelve months, while Cigna’s stock was up about 51 per cent before news of the offer emerged.Investors have largely shrugged off the spectre of a Supreme Court decision that could invalidate government subsidies for Americans who signed up through a federal insurance exchange, prompting millions to lose their health cover.However, the second aim of Obamacare — to reduce inexorably rising healthcare costs — could prove trickier for insurers to navigate. Faced with the prospect of lower reimbursements, hospitals and other healthcare providers have been consolidating, prompting health insurers to explore bulking up too.Health insurers are also contending with a new class of customer: the 16m individuals who are insured through the exchanges are more price conscious than those who get cover via their employers, prompting them to look for better deals.The health insurance industry has not traditionally had to deal with a large number of individual shoppers looking for the best value, and some executives fear they will not be able to protect profits unless the industry shrinks from a “big five” to a “big three”.Rampant inflation in the cost of medicines is also spurring consolidation among pharmacists and the pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of health insurers and other “payers” such as employers and trade unions.On Monday, CVS Caremark said it would buy Target’s pharmacy business for $1.9bn, helping it extract a better deal from pharmaceuticals groups. In March, UnitedHealth said it would pay $13bn for Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager.

The pharmacy chain will also be included in all-new Target stores that offer pharmacy services.CVS Health said the deal would help expand its retail presence and lower healthcare costs for consumers.Analysts at Stifel said they liked the news as its supports “a few core themes” that have emerged over the year.David Schick, an analyst at Stifel, said: “First, retailers need to focus on maximising what they really do better than others, rather than believing they can simply expand into dominant roles in adjunct categories or geographies; second, retailers don’t need more footage; and third, return on invested capital matters.’’Mr Schick said the deal has the potential to work along these themes. “Of course, execution and consumer seamlessness will matter — but on paper this makes a lot of sense,” he said.CVS Health and Target plan to develop five to 10 small, flexible format stores over a two-year period after the deal is closed. The stores will be called TargetExpress and include a CVS/pharmacy.Shares of Target, which gained 41 per cent over the past year, rose 1 per cent to $80.48. CVS Health shares rose 0.4 per cent to $102.58.Shares of United Technologies fell 3 per cent after the Hartford, Connecticut-based company said it would exit its helicopter business subject to board approval. United Technologies said it would either spin off or sell its Sikorsky Aircraft business after a decision has been made by the end of the third quarter.“Separation of Sikorsky from the portfolio will allow both United Technologies and Sikorsky to better focus on their core businesses,” Gregory Hayes, chief executive, said.Including Sikorsky, the company expects 2015 earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.85 a share, lower than its previous forecast for $6.85 to $7.05 a share. The reduction reflects 10 to 20 cents of one-time separation costs.Shares of Lumber Liquidators declined as much as 3 per cent after the company terminated the employment of its chief merchandising officer, William Schlegel.Lumber Liquidators said it would integrate its merchandising and marketing departments, which would be headed by Marco Q Pescara, who has been the chief marketing officer since 2006. The news comes a month after Robert Lynch, the company’s then chief executive, unexpectedly resigned and two months after the company announced that chief financial officer Daniel Terrell would step down in June.The Virginia-based company has come under pressure since a 60 Minutes segment earlier this year alleged that its laminate flooring had excessive levels of formaldehyde — a chemical compound that has been linked to cancer. By the close of trading in New York, shares in the company had pared back losses at $21.48.Shares of Standard Pacific advanced 6 per cent to $8.83, while shares of Ryland Group gained more than 5 per cent to $45.02 after the homebuilders announced that their respective boards had approved a merger to create a single company with a market valuation of $5.2bn.A breakdown in Greek debt talks hurt sentiment on Monday and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 declined 0.5 per cent to 2,084.43, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.6 per cent to 17,791.17.

So when an opportunity appears, good companies do not fool around. On Wednesday, US healthcare group CVS Health announced it would buy Omnicare for $12.7bn in cash.CVS has two parts: one manages large US companies’ drug benefit plans; the other is a chain of retail pharmacies. In the last five years its shares are up 200 per cent. This is unexpected. The idea of combining benefit management and drugstores was once mocked as pointless. Now the model has credibility and a $100bn market value. That value along with enthusiastic credit markets (Barclays is providing a meaty $13bn bridge loan) has enabled CVS to make a bold deal.Omnicare also has two segments. The larger provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities such as nursing homes. The smaller, faster-growing unit markets, distributes and administers rare, complicated and expensive drug therapies for diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.The CVS core businesses are high volume and low margin (filling prescriptions for consumers or administering drug benefit plans in return for a tiny cut of the money that flows from them). The company has been trying to move into more parts of the healthcare supply chain so it can have more influence on costs and quality. Omnicare fits into that plan.It is not coming cheap, however. CVS’ $98/share offer is more than double than where Omnicare shares traded just two years ago. Still, CVS shares inched up 4 per cent, adding $4bn in equity value. The higher leverage the deal brings — CVS’s ratio of debt to earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation will rise to 3 times — is not too troubling when interest rates are low.Yet the canniest operator here may be Omnicare. Plentiful cheap debt, deep-pocketed buyers and an easy-going equity market make this the perfect moment to sell.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
53;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;UnitedHealth: changing the channel;The drug supply chain is becoming even trickier;There may be no more complicated supply chain than US healthcare delivery. And that complexity is becoming trickier to manage as the industry consolidates. On Monday, UnitedHealth, best known as an insurer, bought the pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran for $12.8bn. PBMs run prescription drug plans for insurers and companies. They have been actively sought as acquisition targets. But the buyers come from a variety of health subsectors, leading to the question of which companies are the most appropriate owners.PBMs once belonged to drugmakers. Medco, for example, used to be part of Merck. But because Medco might have been perceived to favour Merck treatments, it was spun off. That type of “channel conflict” has become a recurring theme.With an enterprise value of $70bn, the largest PBM today is Express Scripts, which bought Medco for $34bn in 2011. Express Scripts is a pure-play PBM. However, its chief rival CVS Health employs a more controversial business model — it owns a retail pharmacy chain and a PBM, Caremark. As a result, CVS once had difficulty reaching a PBM agreement with Walgreens, which is the arch-rival of the CVS pharmacy chain.For now, there is little concern about conflict questions in the UnitedHealth/Catamaran deal. UnitedHealth shares rose 2 per cent, as the all-cash deal will immediately boost earnings. UnitedHealth’s existing PBM combined with Catamaran will process 1bn prescriptions, just behind the 1.3bn that Express Scripts has now. That scale is becoming important to hold down the costs of expensive speciality drugs.Catamaran, however, generates a third of its revenue from Cigna, an insurance rival of UnitedHealth, which may not be thrilled about sending money to a competitor. The Cigna contracts runs until 2023. It may take that long to disentangle and resolve who is aligned with whom.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
54;CVS;CVS Corp;2015-01-05T23:09:08Z;Gilead hepatitis-C drug wins CVS/Caremark backing;Agreement follows withdrawal of Express Scripts support;One of the largest US pharmacy groups has said it will make a $1,000-a-day pill the exclusive treatment for hepatitis-C sufferers, boosting Gilead, the drug’s maker which recently lost the backing of America’s largest pharmacy benefits manager.CVS/Caremark, the number two pharmacy benefit manager, said that Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni pills would be the preferred treatment for sufferers of the disease, lifting Gilead shares by 2 per cent on Monday.CVS’s larger rival, Express Scripts, last month granted exclusivity to a competing drug made by AbbVie. That move wiped $20bn off Gilead’s market capitalisation in a single day and sparked a broader sell-off in the biotech sector, due to fears that healthcare groups would start forcing down the prices of expensive new drugs.Gilead’s once-a-day hepatitis-C pills are extremely effective, with success rates of between 94 and 99 per cent, but their cost has sparked an outcry among doctors and health insurers and triggered questioning from senators. A 12-week treatment of Harvoni costs $94,500 — or $1,125 a pill.Some pharmacy benefit managers, which manage prescription drug programmes on behalf of insurers, employers and other healthcare providers, had threatened to ditch Gilead’s drug when AbbVie started selling its rival hepatitis-C medicine, Viekira Pak.Express Scripts was the first to follow through last month, when it said it would make Viekira Pak the exclusive treatment for hepatitis-C sufferers among the 25m patients whose employers deal directly with the company. It said it would also encourage representatives of a further 65m patients to switch.Viekira Pak has a success rate of up to 96 per cent and carries a price tag of $83,319 for a 12 week treatment — although Express Scripts secured a big discount in exchange for granting the drug exclusivity.However, Abbvie’s drug requires the patient to take between three and six pills a day, compared to just one for Gilead’s Harvoni, making it a much more cumbersome treatment. Given that many hepatitis-C patients are either vulnerable or ageing, doctors say a complicated regimen could have a negative impact on success rates.A spokesperson for CVS/Caremark said it had decided to make Gilead’s drugs the preferred treatment from Wednesday following “a thorough evaluation of the existing and new hepatitis C therapies”.They added: “Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C.”The company did not say what discount it had received from Gilead in exchange for exclusivity.Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said CVS/Caremark’s decision had removed an “overhang for Gilead as it achieves near-guaranteed access to a large [patient] population”. He also said the move reduced concerns that AbbVie would be better able to win significant market share by offering big discounts.Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said he did not regret doing an exclusive deal with AbbVie. “There would be no discounts if we hadn’t done what we did,” he said.“We found a partner in AbbVie that changed the whole dynamic. Today’s decision from CVS is a natural extension of the good work that we’ve done.”Shares in AbbVie closed 1.9 per cent lower in New York trading.
55;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-10-27T18:12:58Z;CVS and Rite Aid block Apple Pay mobile payments service;Move sets stage for showdown between technology group and major US retailers;Apple’s new mobile payments service has been blocked by US stores including CVS and Rite Aid that have signed up to a rival wallet app, setting the stage for a showdown between the technology giant and some of the largest US retailers. The two pharmacy chains are part of a consortium called the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), which includes Walmart and Best Buy, the electronics retailer, that plans to introduce an alternative mobile payments system called CurrentC in the coming months. “Given that we are still in the process of evaluating our mobile payment options, Rite Aid does not currently accept Apple Pay,” the company said. “We are continually evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies, and are committed to offering convenient, reliable and secure payment methods that meet the needs of our customers.” CVS said its stores “cannot accept Apple Pay or other mobile payments that use NFC technology. We are in the process of evaluating mobile payment options for our customers.”Gap also confirmed customers were unable to use Apple Pay in its stores. “The mobile payment space is rapidly evolving and that’s why we are constantly looking for new ways to . . . leverage mobile device payments,” the retailer said of the decision.MCX did not respond to a request for comment. Apple launched its payments service just a week ago and has touted the large number of retailers that accept it as a key selling point. At a demonstration of Apple Pay’s installation at the AT&T Park baseball stadium with MasterCard and Major League Baseball on Friday, an Apple representative said that “one big advantage” was that the service used standard NFC technology, ensuring widespread compatibility. “Most modern point-of-sale devices [installed] in the last couple of years have contactless capability,” he said. Many US retailers are set up to accept contactless payments, he said “but most of them didn't have a good enough reason to make that matter and have it be functioning”. Apple has said that more than 220,000 stores in the US would accept its payment service, including many that are not listed among its launch partners, such as Walgreens, Foot Locker and Macy’s. Gerry Granovsky, payments analyst at Moody’s, said the move by CVS and Rite Aid was a sign that the mobile wallet industry was “getting closer to the finality of the battle lines being drawn”, after previous efforts from mobile operators, Google and PayPal. “When [CurrentC] launches we think that's probably the last entry into the field – that will really start the battle,” he said. Reports emerged on Twitter and Apple blogs in recent days that iPhone 6 owners who were trying to use Apple Pay at CVS and Rite Aid were being prevented from doing so. This was despite the fact that the retailers’ payment terminals already supported the wireless technology used by the service, called near-field communications. Turning off support for Apple Pay also means that other contactless payment services, including Google Wallet, can no longer function.Mr Granovsky said the decision could harm companies on all sides of the market, by frustrating iPhone owners and making them go back to using plastic credit cards, while also running the risk of angering the relatively small number of early-adopters of the new technology. “Is the average Walmart shopper walking into Walmart with an iPhone 6 and demanding to make that purchase? Walmart is making the bet that this is not their target demographic,” he said. Walmart and Best Buy had previously said they would not accept Apple Pay, making it surprising that it had ever worked for other members of the MCX group, Mr Granovsky said. “I don't know if it was a technical glitch or a period of trial and error,” he said. Unlike Apple Pay, CurrentC is tied to store cards or directly to a bank account, and so does not support credit cards. The group is expected to use special offers or other incentives to persuade customers to sign up to the service, which will involve scanning QR codes to pay. “There are a lot of questions on that,” Mr Granovsky said. “[Scanning QR codes] doesn't really work as seamlessly.”

Management raised its full-year guidance to $3.44 to $3.54 per share, from prior guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per share.The company also received a boost on Thursday following reports that it was considering a merger with Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals.“An interesting question is why Mylan chose to pre-announce this news as opposed to wait for its earnings . . . and is it related to the merger speculations in the sector,” Aaron Gal, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein said. “Chief financial officer John Sheehan believed a beat of this magnitude requires disclosure.”Mylan is scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings later this month.Salix Pharmaceuticals advanced 1 per cent to $152.87 after the drugmaker said its deal to buy Cosmo Technologies, the Irish arm of an Italian drugmaker, had crumbled.Analysts on Wall Street have speculated that Salix could be a takeover target if it did not go through with the deal.US companies have taken advantage of inversions to lower their tax bills. It was expected that Salix would move its corporate base to Ireland once the acquisition was complete.Salix said: “The changed political environment has created more uncertainty regarding the potential benefits we expected to achieve.”Walgreens shares climbed 2 per cent higher to $60.77 after the company reported better than expected same-store sales growth in September.The country’s largest drugstore chain said comparable sales increased 7.9 per cent during the month, ahead of consensus expectations for a 5.3 per cent gain.Shares of rival CVS rose 2 per cent to $81.33 while Rite Aid advanced 1 per cent to $5.03.RadioShack shares advanced 35 per cent after a report, later confirmed, that it had reached a refinancing agreement with a consortium led by Standard General.Apple shares slipped after analysts with Deutsche Bank dimmed their view on company and warned investor sales expectations would be “difficult” to eclipse.Deutsche Bank forecasts iPhone unit sales will reach 65.4m in the key holiday sales period, which runs through December – a 28 per cent year-on-year gain.But that growth has already been priced into Apple shares, Deutsche says, evidenced by the company’s 25 per cent advance this year.“We believe expectations for sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are high and that it will be difficult for Apple to outperform these expectations over the next two quarters,” Sherri Scribner, an analyst with Deutsche, said.The investment bank lowered its rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’.Overall, US equity markets rallied after a report showed an acceleration in hiring. The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 per cent to 1.967.90 while the Dow Jones climbed 1.2 per cent to 17,009.69.

57;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
58;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Rite Aid cuts profit forecast as medications come off patent;;Rite Aid, the third-largest US drugstore chain, cut its full-year profit forecast, saying its margins would be squeezed as a number of medications come off patent, sending shares down by as much as 19 per cent on Thursday.The company, which has about 4,600 stores in the US, said full-year profits would come in as much as 25 per cent lower than earlier estimates. They now expect between $223m-$333m in profits on sales of $26bn-$26.3bn. Rite Aid had previously projected sales between $26bn-$26.5bn.Investors drove down shares in Rite Aid by 18.5 per cent to $5.41 by close of trading in New York.Rite Aid executives blamed higher costs for the introduction of generic medications, which squeezed margins at the company’s pharmacy business by almost 2 percentage points in the quarter ended August 30.“We also had some newer generics that lost exclusivity, that didn’t come to market as profitably as we thought, honestly, in part because they’re just weren’t as many manufacturers as we expected,” chief executive John Standley said on a call with investors.He added the company would hopefully “catch up a little bit as those items bring us some profitability into next year”.The introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has boosted revenues for US drugstore chains as more Americans gain insurance. But the chains have struggled to forecast costs associated with their prescription drug businesses.In June, Walgreens reported a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit due to a slowdown in the introduction of high-margin generic drugs and lower reimbursement by insurers. Its chief financial officer, Wade Miquelon, and another executive left their posts last month after a $1bn forecasting error in the chain’s Medicare-related business.Prescription sales currently account for 70 per cent of total Rite-Aid sales. However Rite-Aid and other rivals have been attempting to reduce exposure to these headwinds by broadening its offering of “retail healthcare services” such as over-the counter medications, wellness and personal care items as well as food and beverages.As a result of these efforts, Rite-Aid revenue for the second quarter was up 4 per cent to $6.5bn, driven largely by an improvement in same store sales.In February, rival CVS said it would open 1,500 in-store MinuteClinics by 2017 that would offer basic services such as immunisations and minor wound treatment alongside its drugstore product offerings.
59;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-09-18T17:30:29Z;US Drugstores: Bitter pill to swallow;Drug retailing in the US is a race to the bottom;Is selling pills a dreadful business? That seems to depend on the way pills are sold. On Thursday, US pharmacy chain Rite Aid cut its earnings view by a fifth, sending its shares down 19 per cent. And last month Walgreen slashed its operating profit outlook also by a fifth. Both cited unexpectedly weak drug reimbursement rates from private and public insurance. Walgreen also called out higher drug costs. But the problems have not rattled CVS, a company that both runs pharmacies and acts as a middle man between insurers, drug companies and consumers.In 2007 CVS acquired Caremark, a so-called pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), for $27bn. PBMs, by administering drug plans for multiple health insurers, negotiate cheaper prices from Big Pharma. The deal was massive and there were worries about channel conflict (CVS retail pharmacies nominally compete with drugs mailed out by Caremark directly). CVS shares lagged behind in the years after. But since August 2010, its shares are up 170 per cent, double the S&P 500. In its latest earnings, its retail business didn’t reveal any of the weakness of its rivals and the PBM business exceeded expectations. It was also confident enough to raise its profit outlook.With Caremark’s two closest PBM peers, Medco and Express Scripts combining in 2012 (its market cap is now $55bn) there isn’t a good PBM option for either Walgreen (market cap $60bn) or Rite Aid (market cap of $5bn). Walgreen has tried to build scale both through the acquisition of Alliance Boots and a drug sourcing arrangement with wholesaler AmerisourceBergen (Rite Aid has a similar deal with McKesson). Regardless, just selling pills looks like a bad business. In early summer, an unexpected drop in US medical care spending was driven by a 0.6 per cent fall in prescription drug spending. For the industry’s future, look at CVS again. It is now rebranding itself – not as a simple retailer, but as a one-stop consumer healthcare provider.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
60;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-09-18T16:55:59Z;Peabody sinks after Goldman downgrade;;Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, led the laggers on the benchmark S&P 500 after brokerage Goldman Sachs dimmed its view on the company as pressure on global coal markets persist.Weak Chinese demand and high Australian supply of coal is expected to weigh on the price through the remainder of the year, analysts with the investment bank said.Lower demand from US utilities is also expected to depress coal prices.Spot metallurgical coal prices have hovered near $115 per metric ton this year, below average levels over the past three years.Goldman on Thursday subsequently cut its fourth-quarter price target for met coal to $120 from $132 per metric ton.“Many investors have been surprised by the lack of volatility in met pricing – with prices effectively unchanged for six months,” Neil Mehta, an analyst with Goldman, said.“We attribute the flatlining of pricing to the role of China, which is significantly less active in the seaborne market, and typically acts as the swing driver of pricing.”Mr Mehta lowered his rating on Peabody to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’, sending its shares 5 per cent lower to $13.49.Rival Consol Energy declined 2 per cent $37.98 while Arch Coal slipped 5 per cent to $2.65.Goldman becomes the second investment bank this week to downgrade Peabody to ‘sell’ or sell-equivalent, following Nomura.Rite Aid, the third-largest US drugstore chain, cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as a number of medications came off patent, weighing on the retailer’s margins.The company, which has about 4,600 stores in the US, said full-year profits would be as much as 25 per cent lower than earlier estimates, ranging between $223m and $333m on sales of $26bn-$26.3bn.Rite Aid had earlier projected sales between $26bn and $26.5bn.Executives with Rite Aid blamed a delay in the introduction of generic version of some medications as well as lower insurer reimbursement rates on the introduction of new generic drugs for the profit warning.Rite Aid shares slumped 19 per cent to $5.41, the worst performing stock on the Russell 1000.Rival Walgreens fell 1 per cent to $63.18 and CVS declined 1 per cent to $81.18.Kohl’s shares climbed after analysts with Citi lifted their rating on the retailer to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, as chilly weather and encouraging back-to-school sales lift the company’s third-quarter prospects.“We expect an improved product assortment, loyalty programme leverage and prudent inventory management to drive comp store sales and margins,” Oliver Chen, an analyst with Citi, said.Kohl’s shares rose 2 per cent to $62.50.ConAgra shares led the S&P 500, advancing 5 per cent to $33.48, after the company reported first-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.The packaged foods producer, which owns the Hunt’s ketchup and Hebrew National hot dog brands, said profits rose to $484.5m in the quarter.When adjusting for certain items, the company said it earned 39 cents a share, two cents ahead of consensus forecasts.Overall, US equity markets climbed to record highs following Wednesday’s Fed decision. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 2,011.36 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.6 per cent to 17,265.99.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 0.7 per cent to 4,593.42.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
61;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;US officials urge pharmacies to drop tobacco products;;US officials are calling on five of the biggest US retailers to drop tobacco products from their pharmacies, following the decision by CVS Caremark to stub out cigarette sales this year.“Pharmacies and drugstores, which increasingly market themselves as a source for community healthcare, send a mixed message by continuing to sell deadly tobacco products,” said Eric Schneiderman, New York attorney-general, in a statement on Monday.Mr Schneiderman and Mike DeWine, Ohio attorney-general, are leading a group of attorneys-general from 28 US states and territories that sent letters to the chief executives of Walmart, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Safeway and Kroger on Sunday asking them to remove tobacco products from their pharmacy shelves.“There is a contradiction in having these dangerous and devastating tobacco products on the shelves of a retail chain that services healthcare needs,” the letters said.They added: “The normalisation and easy availability of tobacco products represent a significant threat to youth, who are particularly susceptible to social and environmental encouragements to use tobacco. Moreover, the sale of tobacco products in retail chains weakens the effect of media campaigns whose objective is to de-normalise the use of tobacco products.”Rite Aid said: “We appreciate that the attorneys-general took the time to share their views. We are always evaluating options and programs for our stores and our customers.” It added that it sells a variety of smoking cessation products and offers counselling for people who want to quit smoking.Walmart, Walgreens and Safeway said they had received the letter and were reviewing it. Kroger did not respond to a request for comment.The group of attorneys-general also sent a letter to CVS chief executive Larry Merlo commending him for the second-largest US pharmacy chain’s announcement last month that it would give up $2bn a year in tobacco sales at its 7,600 stores.Drugstore sales account for a small fraction of the $90bn US tobacco market, analysts say, with most purchases being made at convenience stores.Mr Merlo told the Financial Times that his decision was influenced by the death of his father, a smoker who died of cancer at 57, but that it was also a reflection of a shift in pharmacies’ business model towards healthcare.Companies are seeking to capitalise on a growing demand for so-called “retail healthcare” services as more Americans gain insurance under President Barack Obama’s healthcare overhaul and the country’s elderly population grows.CVS, Walgreens and others are opening convenient care facilities staffed by nurse practitioners and pharmacists who can provide preventive care and minor medical treatments.But as CVS sought to build relationships with hospitals and doctor’s offices, it found that its sales of tobacco were “a sticking point”, Mr Merlo said, and ultimately decided to phase out cigarettes by October.
62;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-02-28T08:09:06Z;Random acts of shopper boycott;Exercising my right to prejudice makes little difference to the businesses I choose to avoid;"As individuals, we cannot do much to change the course of the world, but we can at least make statements of what we feel strongly about. These may be prejudices, which often are not noble, but at least they are our prejudices.One of mine has long been to not shop at any of the chain pharmacies that increasingly dominate and homogenise America, in the process turning it into a nation of hypochondriacs. That means, where I live in Washington, CVS, Walgreen’s and Rite Aid, but the pattern holds all over. There seems to be one of them on every third corner. On Route 301, the direct but not scenic road to our weekend place in southern Maryland, two of them stare balefully at each other from across the highway at most traffic lights.CVS Caremark, its corporate name, has long been my particular bête noir. I am pretty sure it deliberately seeks to drive small independent drug stores out of business by suggesting, for example, that prescriptions under government health insurance, such as Medicare, or other forms of coverage can only be filled at CVS stores, which is a flat out falsehood. At least my local independent continues to fill mine, without putting me in a long queue for pick up.But now CVS is being hailed, from the White House down, for its “selfless courage” in announcing that later this year it will stop selling tobacco products at a cost of $2bn a year in revenues, out of total sales of about $120bn. It also said, to much approbation, that it would expand its “minute clinics” where basic medical services can be obtained, from qualified nurses etc, without recourse to a doctor’s office. Given the shortage of physicians nationwide, it is hard to say this is not a good thing.After all, CVS says half the customers at these retail walk-in clinics do not have a regular primary doctor and those that do can wait for days or weeks to get an appointment for a complaint not immediately life-threatening, which is why hospital emergency rooms get overwhelmed. Medicine, after all, ought to be preventive and, within reason, can be provided by those who have not done seven years in medical school and hospital residencies.Still, I will not shop at CVS – or the other chain pharmacies – and not because it never sold the small Dutch cigars on which, to my shame, I still puff. It may be incalculable but I suspect that whatever good comes from taking tobacco off the shelves is more than offset by the bad – the aisles full of obese-making junk food, candy, sodas and other “convenience” items that form formidable barriers before the customer ever waddles to the pharmacy counter in the back.As I said, these are my prejudices. Therefore, when we go to Maine in summer, I do not patronise the state’s most famous outdoors retailer, L.L. Bean because its founding family has long helped to fund the anti-abortion cause. Nor will I buy a lobster roll from one of the proliferating Linda Bean’s Perfect Maine shacks because I fear she is trying to take over the lobster business (of course, she could be trying to modernise and rationalise it, but some things are better left alone).Briefly, I tried to boycott Whole Foods Market, the upmarket grocery chain, after its chief executive compared Obamacare, the US president’s healthcare reform, as “fascism”, but I was overruled by the better half, who thinks the produce is superior, if expensive, and, er, full disclosure, happens to be a shareholder, too.But I am increasingly drawn to Costco, the discount warehouse that sells stuff in bulk, because, according to no less an authority than Barack Obama, it treats its employees relatively well, better, for example, than Walmart. There is a downside to this, however; closets full of vast packages of toilet rolls, rotting fruit and vegetables in the fridge, enough lightbulbs to illuminate a small city, etc.Still, in the greater scheme of things, exercising my right to prejudice, rational or not, makes little difference. I am not hurting myself, because I have purchasing alternatives, nor, frankly, given the picayune amount I spend, the businesses I choose to boycott.Of course, sanctions in general are back in fashion as a tool of diplomacy, as threatened against Ukraine, or even its oligarchs, before events in the streets of Kiev rendered them moot, at least for the moment. It seems to me they are most likely to work if carefully targeted, as when sport was included in the sanctions against apartheid-era South Africa. Mine are just random. Long may they stay so.onohana@aol.com"
63;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-02-11T21:56:43Z;CVS Caremark gains on rising sales;US equities broadly rise as Fed’s Yellen promises continuity;Shares in CVS Caremark climbed on Tuesday as the company reported rising sales within its pharmacies, underscoring its recent decision to stop selling tobacco at its storefronts and recast itself as a health-focused group.The US chain said net sales increased 4.5 per cent in the final three months of 2013 to $32.8bn, while profits rose 12 per cent to $1.3bn, or $1.05 per share.CVS said pharmacy same-store sales rose 6.8 per cent, offsetting a 1.9 per cent decline in the company’s front of store business, where it sells products such as toilet paper, greeting cards and Kit Kat chocolate bars.CVS largely expected advancing sales in its pharmacies to continue. Its Caremark business, which manages prescription benefit plans for employers and insurers, is expected to show revenue growth of 4.5 to 5.5 per cent in 2014, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. The company estimated its decision to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products would cost the company $2bn in sales a year.“Despite the near-term headwind from lost tobacco sales, management guided very strongly for [the first quarter],” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Ajay Jain said. “The performance from 4Q also suggests very strong execution, particularly in the [pharmacy benefit management] segment.”CVS shares rose 2.7 per cent to $68.77 by the close.Sprint said on Tuesday that revenues climbed 1.5 per cent from a year earlier to $9.1bn in the final three months of the year, beating Wall Street expectations as the company saw a surge in tablet wireless plans.The carrier, majority owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said it added 58,000 monthly subscribers during the period. For the fourth quarter, Sprint lost $1bn, or 26 cents per diluted share, compared to a $1.3bn loss in the same quarter a year earlier.“We would characterise these results as better than feared,” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said. “The positive momentum in tablets . . . is especially surprising to us given the weaker porting trends.”The results come as Sprint seeks to win share in a market in which AT&T and Verizon have had a strong hold, and executives pressed the case for further industry consolidation on a call with analysts. The company has explored a bid for rival T-Mobile USA.Shares in the carrier rose 2.7 per cent to $7.90, after rallying as much as 8 per cent earlier in the day.Zoetis, the animal health group spun off from Pfizer last year, sank 6.4 per cent to $29.13 after delivering guidance that was shy of Wall Street expectations. Zoetis said it expected sales to range from $4.65bn to $4.75bn in 2014, compared to forecasts for $4.77bn.The outlook came as the company reported a 7 per cent rise in fourth-quarter sales from a year earlier to $1.3bn. Zoetis swung to a profit of $105m, or 21 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss of $10m in the year-ago period. Quarterly results in 2012 were hampered by restructuring costs.US equity markets broadly rose on Tuesday, as Janet Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, promised continuity at the central bank and indicated there was still more to do to aid the US recovery.TD Securities strategist Millan Mulraine noted that Ms Yellen remained “quite upbeat” about the economy and that recent volatility in financial markets did not pose a threat to the US.“Nothing has changed in the Fed’s view on the economy and the near-term conduct of monetary policy, which is to say that tapering is still on track,” Mr Mulraine said.The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 per cent to 1,819.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent to 15,994.77. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite was 1.03 per cent higher to 4,191.04.
64;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;CVS Caremark: no ifs, ands or butts;Kicking habit of cigarette sales makes business sense;"There was a cloud of smoke hanging over Tuesday’s earnings report for CVS Caremark. The US drugstore chain/pharmacy benefit manager last week said it would stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products by October to support the wellbeing of its customers. Since its 2007 tie-up with Caremark (the PBM that negotiates drug prices with insurance companies and employers), CVS has become more health provider than drugstore. Kicking the habit makes business sense then – and over time the company appears poised to offset the lost revenue and profit.Last year’s results reveal a company that is growing the top-line slowly, but proving that it can squeeze out more profits on the dollars it brings in. For 2013, revenue at the retail pharmacy segment increased by 3 per cent while operating profit rose by 11 per cent on cost leverage. The pharmacy services segment processed 2.4 per cent more prescriptions, but operating profit rose by 15 per cent. The company estimated it would lose about $2bn in revenue on an annual basis from tobacco shoppers (2013 revenue was $127bn), and about 17 cents a share in earnings. The impact for 2014 would be 6 cents to 9 cents; adjusted EPS is forecast at $4.36 to $4.50, the company has confirmed since the tobacco announcement. In a sign of investor confidence, shares rose by 3 per cent on Tuesday.Operating leverage bodes well when sales are threatened, but it raises some questions about how much more can be squeezed out. A good thing, then, that CVS Caremark stands to benefit over time from new US healthcare laws as more people move into the system. There are other offsets including a 10-year joint venture with Cardinal Health, which will form the largest sourcing entity for generic drugs in the US. At $69, the shares trade at 15 times forward earnings – in line with the market and, perhaps, relatively cheaper than that pack of smokes.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
65;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-02-07T23:22:22Z;Companies take pre-packaged news to another level;Treat the corporate trend with the same scepticism as for political ads;This week saw an escalation of the new corporate trend toward pre-packaging the news. Rather than simply sending out a press release, big companies are putting together websites, complete with video interviews, slideshows and “asset packs” of relevant documents ahead of big announcements.While other companies have tried it, Microsoft took this technique to a new level on Tuesday with its announcement of a new chief executive, new chairman and the partial return of founder Bill Gates to active management. There were three slickly done videos, two lengthy emails to employees and a series of photos that appeared to position Satya Nadella as an older version of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, complete with hoodie. CVS Caremark, the US pharmacy chain followed up a day later with a “multimedia press release” package about its decision to stop selling tobacco products, complete with three videos and a Twitter hashtag.The appeal of the method is easy to see. Videos and emails allow groups to speak directly to their customers without the intervening filter of a sceptical reporter.Microsoft’s video of Mr Nadella had been seen by 342,000 people on YouTube by Friday morning and the actual reach of these press packages is far bigger. In a world of shrinking newsroom resources and rapid response websites, many reporters and bloggers are only too happy to accept information they do not have to hunt for. The Microsoft photos and videos were widely linked to and reused during the coverage, and Mr Nadella’s email to staff was instantly dissected and republished.But there are pitfalls. Burberry’s video last October, in which its chairman interviewed both its incoming and outgoing chief executives about the newly announced transition, is a study in awkwardness. “I’m sure you are as delighted as I am,” the conversation begins. There is a reason why Microsoft’s online interview with Mr Nadella is conducted by someone who acts like a journalist.Some companies go even further. Coke has been experimenting with what it calls brand journalism, shooting its own videos and writing its own news stories. This week the “Coca-Cola Journey” site features articles on cool co-working sites and a photography spread about a US Navy aircraft carrier – as well as more predictable items about Coke’s Super Bowl advertisement and a new corporate tie-up with Keurig, the coffee pod maker.Company-shot interviews by their nature shy away from difficult questions. But what they avoid can be as instructive as what they include. Microsoft’s video package positioned Mr Nardella as a poetry-loving champion of the company’s culture. Cynics might wonder if the company was trying to shift attention from its failure to recruit a big-name outsider.Burberry’s decision to have outgoing chief Angela Ahrendts brag about her strong team – “I am proud of what we have built” – seemed to be aimed squarely at investors’ doubts that her successor Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer, had the financial and management wherewithal to take over.Customers and investors would do well to approach these pre-packaged news stories with the kind of scepticism usually reserved for political advertising.brooke.masters@ft.com
66;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;CVS chief shakes up business model of US pharmacies;;For Larry Merlo the decision to stop selling cigarettes at US pharmacy chain CVS Caremark was not just about business. “My father was a smoker and died of cancer at the young age of 57,” said the former pharmacist, who rose through the ranks to become chief executive of the company.Mr Merlo captured headlines this week for shaking up the business model of US pharmacies. From October, the chain’s 7,600 stores – which offer Marlboro cigarettes and Budweiser beer alongside NyQuil flu medicine and Maybelline make-up – will no longer sell tobacco products.“Everyone has a personal story, a friend or loved one who was killed by smoking,” said Mr Merlo of the leading cause of premature death in the US.CVS expects to lose about $2bn in annual revenues from the decision, just a fraction of its total 2012 sales of $123bn. Although the financial stakes are not large, Mr Merlo’s move sets his company apart from its peers by choosing to forgo short-term profits for a long-term vision of the company as a healthcare provider.“Tobacco was always a sticking point when it came to building relationships with hospitals and physicians’ practices,” said the mustachioed 58-year-old chief, who has helped turn CVS into an immense retail presence with a near-$80bn market capitalisation.“They asked if we were really committed to this vision as we sold tobacco products. It had become a complete contradiction to the health outcomes we were trying to achieve,” he added.CVS is looking to take advantage of a growing demand for health services as tens of millions of Americans gain insurance as a result of President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform and as the country’s elderly population balloons.As more people need medical care, the US is facing a shortage of doctors. That is where CVS sees an opportunity. The company plans to open 1,500 in-store ‘MinuteClinics’ by 2017 that offer basic services such as immunisations, minor wound treatment and preventive care for chronic illnesses.October 2013: Bernard Tyson, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, America’s largest HMO, tells the FT’s US managing editor Martin Dickson that Obamacare is forcing the industry to ‘rethink how’ it does things and will ‘ultimately help drive down the cost of care’“Pharmacies are an extension of a physician’s office,” Mr Merlo said. “It’s about more than just dispensing a prescription.”Mr Obama – a former smoker – was among the cheerleaders who lined up to praise CVS, alongside former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the charge to ban smoking in public places.A cultural shift has taken place in the US, said Mr Merlo. “Twenty years ago you could smoke on an aeroplane. Many things that were commonplace are not today. As a company we decided now was the right time to make this decision.”Mr Merlo, who started out on the frontline of the retail pharmacy business, is pushing a strategy that takes him back to his roots.The only child of a homemaker mother and Corning Glass factory worker father, he grew up in Pennsylvania and was the first person in his family to go to university. He initially had ambitions to become a doctor, but was persuaded by his chemistry teacher to study pharmacy.A University of Pittsburgh graduate, Mr Merlo began his career at Peoples Drug, a regional chain later bought by CVS, and moved up the corporate ranks. The US pharmacy industry has seen massive consolidation since his early days in a white coat, with most independent and local chains being absorbed into market leaders CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid.CVS’s own acquisitions have helped to propel sales and earnings and since Mr Merlo became chief executive in March 2011, the company’s share price has doubled.As for whether CVS will continue to sell alcohol and junk food as the company pivots towards health and wellness, Mr Merlo said those indulgences were fine in moderation. “But no amount of tobacco is safe.”
67;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;CVS takes big strides into walk-in clinics;;CVS Caremark provides more than just cough drops for that sore throat that will not go away. A growing number of the US retail chain’s pharmacies are being equipped with clinicians who can treat common infections and immunise against flu.CVS, which announced on Wednesday it would stub out tobacco sales as it focuses efforts on healthcare, believes its walk-in clinics are a convenient alternative to long waits at the doctor’s surgery.With more than 7,600 locations across the US, CVS is seeking to expand the number of its in-store MinuteClinic facilities from 800 to 1,500 by 2017, leading the charge by pharmacy groups into medical treatment and preventive care.These so-called convenient care facilities, staffed by nurse practitioners in addition to pharmacists, diagnose and treat common illnesses from eye infections to minor wounds.As tens of millions of patients enter into the healthcare system under President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform and the country’s elderly population rises, the number of retail clinics are expected to surge even amid a backlash from some traditional healthcare providers.Their popularity, alongside walk-in “urgent care” centres that carry out minor procedures, reflects rising demand for well-located medical treatment options that sidestep long waiting lists and avoid the heavy costs of emergency room care.The trend also corresponds with a broader shift by cost-conscious healthcare providers to move more procedures from hospitals to cheaper outpatient care facilities.“Former Blockbuster video stores and other vacant retail spaces are increasingly being transformed into retail clinics or urgent care facilities. Non-acute care is moving out of hospitals,” said Jeff Piehl, director of the healthcare practice group at property broker Cushman & Wakefield.The number of retail clinics in the US is expected to more than double from 1,418 in 2013 to 2,868 in 2015, according to a report by Accenture, the consultancy.More than 90 per cent of about $1tn healthcare properties in the US – from assisted living facilities to medical offices – are in the hands of hospitals and medical systems, but the number of non-traditional owners are rising.CVS, rival Walgreens and others that operate in the convenient care space have battled criticism that they are taking the place of doctors. But those championing these facilities say walk-in clinics may relieve pressure on the system amid a shortage of primary care physicians that is only set to worsen as more people demand healthcare.Analysts such as Frank Morgan at RBC Capital Markets said retail clinics may carry out more complex procedures in the future. With the right clinicians and technology they will over time “gradually add more intensive service lines”, he said.Ross Muken, analyst at ISI Group, said that while it was “very possible” MinuteClinic could provide treatments in the future such as stitching up a bad cut or mending a broken arm, expansion in the near term is more likely to tilt towards preventive healthcare for illnesses such as diabetes and obesity.Michael Kulczycki, executive director of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, which has approved CVS’s medical services since it acquired MinuteClinic in 2006, said that although the sector is poised for growth, it is unlikely that MinuteClinic will expand its healthcare offerings past chronic disease care.“There is a lot of scope for expansion in this space alone,” he said. “Even though CVS and others have the real estate footprint, it would add a level of complexity that doesn’t make sense economically.”Retail clinics are also reluctant to tread on the toes of traditional healthcare practitioners. “They have been striking alliances with healthcare systems and hospitals, so any further steps would fracture these relationships. Convenient care is politically marred.”
68;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-02-05T22:11:14Z;Casino operators drop as Macau revenues slide;Figures underscore concerns that Chinese growth is slowing;Casino and resort operators declined sharply on Wednesday as gaming revenues in Macau, the world’s gambling capital, grew at their slowest pace in 15 months.Total casino revenues rose 7 per cent from a year earlier to 28.7bn patacas, or $3.6bn, according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.The results underscored heightened concerns that Chinese growth is slowing, although demand is typically depressed ahead of the Chinese new year, which began on January 31.Wall Street analysts said the figures were a disappointment, with Jake Fuller of FBR Capital Markets noting weekly data had pointed to “mid-teen” growth in January.“The Street was racing to bump estimates, targets and rating on the Macau-centric gaming stocks around year end, pushing market growth expectations to fairly aggressive levels,” Mr Fuller said. “The shortfall in January will be a concern and lead to questions over the market’s ability to reach the +18 per cent consensus for the year.”Shares in Las Vegas Sands fell as much as 8 per cent at one point but pulled back to close down 1.40 per cent to $73.98, while Wynn Resorts declined 1.87 per cent to $209.55.The two companies, which operate the Sands Macau and Wynn Macau resorts, respectively, have increasingly shifted their focus to Asia, with Wynn at work to open a new hotel and casino on the Cotai strip in 2016.Cognizant Technology Solutions shares weakened after the company said sales in 2014 would be below Wall Street estimates.The IT provider and consulting service said it expected net revenues to be at least $10.3bn and adjusted earnings to top $5.02 per share, 6 cents below expectations. Cognizant shares fell 4.29 per cent to $92.85.News that one of America’s largest pharmacy and convenience chains will stop selling cigarettes pressured shares of Lorillard and Altria.Shares in cigarette manufacturer Lorillard slid 2.33 per cent to $47.76 as Altria dropped 1.25 per cent to $34. CVS Caremark announced on Wednesday it would drop tobacco products from its shelves as it tries to recast its relationship with health-conscious consumers.The decision, which is expected to cut some $2bn in annual sales from the drugstore chain, won applause from President Barack Obama. CVS said it would try to recoup some of its lost revenues in other ways. CVS shares fell 1 per cent to $65.44.Estée Lauder shares were among the worst performing on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said profits slid 3 per cent in the fourth quarter to $432.5m, or $1.09 per share.Management said they anticipated fiscal third-quarter profits to range between 52 and 55 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts, as it sees “a slowing of the near-term growth trend in China and Hong Kong”. Sales in Asia-Pacific dipped 6 per cent in the three months to December.The company logged better results in Europe and the US. Sales in the UK rose at an almost double-digit rate, while those in the Americas, where the US accounts for the bulk of revenue, rose 5 per cent to $1.19bn.Estée Lauder shares fell 5.5 per cent to $65.36 in New York trading.Overall, US equity markets broadly declined before paring their losses, following weaker-than-anticipated job growth in January. ADP, the payroll processor, said the workforce expanded by 175,000 people in the month, led by small and medium-sized business growth.A separate survey of the US service sector showed some improvement in January later in the day, with rising new orders and employment levels.The S&P 500 declined 0.2 per cent to 1,751.64 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged down to 15,440.23. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite slid as much as 1.6 per cent, touching its lowest level since last November, before recovering to 4,011.55.
69;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-02-05T20:03:40Z;CVS stubs out $2bn tobacco business;;CVS Caremark, the second largest pharmacy chain in the US, is giving up its $2bn-a-year cigarette business as it shifts its focus away from general retail towards healthcare.CVS said that it will stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products at its 7,600 US stores by October “in support of the health and wellbeing of . . . patients and customers” – a move that will cost it $2bn of its $123bn annual sales.President Barack Obama, a former smoker, said CVS’s decision set “a powerful example” and would help bring down healthcare costs. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who banned smoking in the city’s public places, welcomed it as “a major milestone” that would encourage other companies to follow suit.US drugstores, which can sell everything from prescription medicines to beer, are a retail staple for millions of Americans, but have come under fire for selling tobacco alongside healthcare products.Ending tobacco sales was “the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health,” said Larry Merlo, chief executive. “Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose.”Many US pharmacies are pivoting from general retail to add basic healthcare services such as flu shots and consultations with nurse practitioners. Demand for such offerings is expected to rise with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which is bringing millions of formerly uninsured Americans into a healthcare system plagued by a shortage of medical practitioners.Walgreens, the largest US pharmacy chain, said that it would “continue to evaluate” selling cigarettes.CVS said that exiting tobacco retail would not affect its operating profit guidance or earnings per share guidance for 2014, or its company’s five-year financial projections.An expected 6-9 cents reduction in its 2014 earnings per share would be offset by “identified incremental opportunities”, CVS said. The company plans to launch a national programme to help customers quit smoking.The American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society and other health groups have all opposed tobacco sales in stores with pharmacies. San Francisco, Boston and other cities have banned cigarette sales at pharmacies.Tobacco companies including Altria, the maker of Marlboro and US market share leader, and Imperial Tobacco, the world’s fourth-largest tobacco company by market share, said that it was up to retailers whether they sold their products.Adult smoking rates in the US have fallen from 42 per cent in 1965 to 18 per cent in the past decade in the face of high taxes, bans on public smoking and antismoking campaigns. Cigarette sales have been declining an average 3 per cent a year, according to industry executives.Still, smoking is the biggest cause of premature disease and death in the US, killing more than 480,000 people every year.CVS shares closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday.
70;CVS;CVS Corp;2014-02-05T18:14:40Z;Tobacco sales at US pharmacy go up in smoke;;A trip to the average US pharmacy can leave you with a basket full of goods from shower gel and cold medicine to beer and cigarettes.But shoppers at CVS Caremark will soon see shelves of Marlboro and Camel packs replaced with nicotine gum, patches and other tools to help them quit smoking.The decision by the US’s second-largest pharmacy chain to stop selling tobacco comes as it and its peers refocus their business on healthcare, after years of establishing themselves as a one-stop shopping destination for everything from cosmetics and pet food to laundry detergent and sweets.“The nature of the drugstore has been evolving and these companies, particularly CVS, have sought to reinvent the box,” says Ross Muken, analyst at ISI Group. “The old model of a pharmacy as a convenience store is changing and companies are shifting to have a greater role in the healthcare continuum.”Two trends in the US are behind this shift. Like all brick-and-mortar retailers, drugstores are facing competition from online rivals such as Amazon, which offer a wide range of products delivered directly to consumers’ doorsteps overnight or even on the same day.At the same time, discount chains including Dollar General and Family Dollar have made a push into tobacco sales in the past few years in an attempt to boost visits to their stores.These pressures have “meant the pharmacy has had to reinvent itself as a centrepiece in healthcare”, says Mr Muken. “Although CVS will not give up on convenience altogether there will be a shift from beauty, personal care and household cleaning goods, for example, towards products targeting chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and smoking.”While CVS expects that quitting tobacco will cost it $2bn in annual revenues, the decision is not altruistic. The company’s broader strategic shift towards health comes amid a shortage of primary care physicians in the US, particularly as millions of Americans gain insurance under the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform that became law in 2010.Many people already get flu shots and treatment for common ailments from pharmacies and CVS is betting on growth in this segment.The nature of the drugstore has been evolving and these companies, particularly CVS, have sought to reinvent the box“There is a demand for very basic, rudimentary healthcare, from immunisations to physicals, and a shift by companies such as CVS would take some pressure off the system. Obviously more people qualifying for healthcare coverage is a positive for CVS and others with retail clinics,” said Frank Morgan, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.CVS was a first mover in creating in-store clinics and employs 26,000 pharmacists and nurse practitioners at its stores. But other companies are making similar shifts towards health and could follow suit.“Walgreens has said this is something they’ve contemplated, particularly with their emphasis on ‘wellness’ in recent years, so we’d expect them to follow a similar route,” says Mr Muken.The change will put US pharmacies more on par with their international peers.Shane MacGuil, a tobacco analyst at Euromonitor, says: “In the UK, the idea of a drugstore/pharmacy selling cigarettes seems completely anomalous, so to a certain extent this goes down alongside China banning smoking in schools last week as something which simply begins to bring a market into line with wider norms.”He and other analysts noted that drugstore sales account for a small fraction of the $90bn US tobacco market, meaning that cigarette makers will not see much of an impact from CVS’s move.“Over 75 per cent of tobacco sales come from convenience stores, so the drug channel is not that big,” says Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.CVS does not sell electronic cigarettes, devices that have exploded in popularity as many cities and states have enacted public smoking bans.E-cigarette manufacturers say their products are alternatives to smoking and have resisted their classification with other tobacco products.“We applaud CVS for their bold and thoughtful decision to no longer sell traditional tobacco products, like combustible cigarettes,” says Andries Verleur, chief executive of VMR Products, which makes V2 e-cigs. “We are also pleased that CVS will continue to emphasise the importance of alternatives to tobacco and hope that they will ultimately recognise the impact of electronic cigarettes, which do not contain tobacco, in this category.”
71;CVS;CVS Corp;2013-12-02T17:30:08Z;Big companies in end-of-year bond rush;;Large corporate borrowers seeking to raise the last batch of funding for 2013 could sell close to $30bn in investment-grade bonds this week in the US, taking advantage of low borrowing rates and renewed appetite for high-quality corporate debt.Johnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest seller of healthcare products, Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, drugstore and pharmacy CVS Caremark and auto-lender Ally Financial led a flurry of investment-grade offerings in the US on Monday.The start of the month was also strong in Europe, where food giant Nestlé and Italy’s second-biggest bank, Intesa SanPaolo, raised funds in the euro and sterling markets.The rush of bond offerings comes after a sharp slowdown in activity in the US last week as markets remained closed for Thanksgiving holiday. But the pace is bound to accelerate in coming days as companies try to squeeze in as many debt sales as possible ahead of a capital markets shutdown towards the end of the month around Christmas.“When you consider all the holidays, the capital markets will be open effectively for only 15 or 16 days in December. For corporate borrowers, if they still have to come to markets, it is better to come at the start of the month,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.Corporate borrowers and bond investors are also banking on the Federal Reserve maintaining its policy of easy money at its next policy meeting on December 18. A recovery in risk appetite among fixed income investors has helped pull yields lower since the central bank decided not to start tapering its monthly bond buying in September.The combination of low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher-yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds has pushed corporate debt sales in the US to record levels.There’s a large group of investors mandated to buy only high-grade debtAverage yields on US investment-grade corporate bonds stood at 3.15 per cent on Monday, while those on US Treasuries were 1.24 per cent, according to Barclays indices.Global corporations have sold $1.05tn of high-grade bonds so far this year, compared with $1tn in the same period of 2012, according to Dealogic.Funds investing in investment-grade corporate debt saw inflows of $220m in the week ending November 27, according to RBS data. So far this year investors have poured $52.2bn in funds betting on the securities.“Money keeps coming in to high-grade funds even though yields on the bonds have already declined a lot. But there’s a large group of investors mandated to buy only high-grade debt,” said Mr Miller.In one of the week’s highlights, Johnson and Johnson is breaking a two-and-a-half-year absence from capital markets, offering at least $1bn in triple A rated bonds spread across several maturities.
72;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;McKesson / Celesio: piggyback deal;After two revolutionary mergers, US pill distributors have to build scale;McKesson’s $8bn purchase of Celesio is ho-hum in the annals of recent drug supply chain deals. Sure, it is a nice add-on for McKesson, which, with an enterprise value of $35bn, is the largest US drug wholesaler. It gets a beachhead into Europe and, with cheap debt and synergies, the purchase will increase its earnings by more than a 10th. But the deal just piggybacks on other moves that consolidated the drug supply chain vertically and horizontally. And despite the complexity of those deals, they appear to have worked.Distributing pills is now a better business than developing them. Pharma’s troubles are well known. Innovation has slowed, and former blockbusters have gone off-patent. At the same time, governments are cutting healthcare spending. On the plus side, US healthcare reform and richer emerging nations are creating customers. The imperative for the companies that stand between drugmakers and their customers has become to build scale, since profits have been squeezed out of the broader supply chain.The two revolutionary transactions were the merger of retail chain CVS and pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007, and the 2012 partial tie-up between the US retailer Walgreens, UK retailer Alliance Boots, and McKesson rival AmerisourceBergen.The hang-up to these deals has been so-called “channel conflict”. Drug distributors, benefits managers and retailers compete and co-operate with each other. The benefits manager business of CVS struggled to overcome the alleged favouritism it showed towards its own physical stores. AmerisourceBergen customers wondered if Walgreens would get preferential pricing. But a look at stock price performance of the companies involved shows the market believes in these deals. AmerisourceBergen is up nearly half this year. And CVS is up 70 per cent in the last two.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
73;CVS;CVS Corp;2013-04-17T20:26:50Z;Big Pharma says Olá to Brazil;;"By Pan Kwan Yuk and Thalita CarricoBrazil’s burgeoning middle class might have helped propel the country to the top of the consumer league tables.But as Brazilians have gotten richer, they are also succumbing in ever greater numbers to so-called diseases of affluence – namely obesity, diabetes and cancer. It’s a development that has not gone unnoticed among the world’s top pharmaceutical companies.With withering pipelines, patent expiries and cuts to government healthcare spending flattening sales in the US and Europe, major pharmaceutical groups are shifting their focus to emerging markets.While much of the attention has so far been on China, Brazil, where the retail pharmaceutical market hit R$49.6bn ($24.8bn) last year, is starting to attract its share of outside interest.Last year, Merck announced a partnership with two Brazilian drugmakers, Supera Farma Laboratórios and Eurofarma, to sell and distribute its drugs in Brazil.More recently, CVS Caremark, the US drugstore chain, made its first foray overseas in February with the acquisition of Drogaria Onofre, Brazil’s eighth largest pharmacy chain by sales. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, a report in Valor Econômico said CVS paid R$670m for an 80 per cent stake in the business.The same month, the UK’s Reckitt Benckiser, struck a $482m license deal with the US’s Bristol-Myers Squibb to sell a number of BMS’s over the counter drugs to sell in Latin America, namely Brazil and Mexico.And then, there are the persistent rumours that the world’s top pharmaceutical companies – including Pfizer, Novartis and Abbott – are all weighing bids for Aché Laboratorios Farmaceuticos, one of Brazil’s biggest drug makers.While the privately-held Aché has categorically denied that it was for sale, interest in the Brazilian drugmaker is understandable.This from Reuters:Ache ranks fourth in terms of overall Brazilian drug sales but is the leader in prescription medicines and is also active in the rapidly expanding over-the-counter (OTC) business.“Every large pharmaceutical company wants to get into emerging markets and Ache is the crown jewel asset in Brazil,” said one industry banker, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not allowed to speak to the media.Indeed, while increased spending power and government pledges to invest in healthcare have made Brazil the world’s seventh largest drug market and second only to China among emerging markets – pricing pressure, a myriad of regulations and strong local competition mean that partnering up with or acquiring a local player is often the best way to get into the Brazilian drug market.Ten years ago, only one of Brazil’s 10 biggest pharmaceutical groups was national, Ivo Bucaresky, executive secretary of the Drug Market Regulation Chamber (CMED) in Brazil, told beyondbrics.Today, five are considered national, he said.Generics, which account for 22 per cent of total drug sales, is the fast-growing segment, with sales up 17 per cent last year. Amgen, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer have all made acquisitions in this area in Brazil.With Brazil’s healthcare spending accounting for close to 8 per cent of GDP and demand for pharmaceutical products growing at a clip of 10 per cent a year, expect more pharma executives to go hunting for deals in Brazil.Related reading:

74;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Delay to shop rate revamp a ‘tragedy’;;"A decision by ministers to delay a revaluation of business rates from 2015 to 2017 has been described as a “tragedy for the high street” by Mary Portas, the government’s own adviser on saving town centres.Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, delayed the move by two years on the basis that it would help small businesses and prevent unexpected rate increases.But the government is facing a chorus of criticism from property experts, retailers and MPs who argue that the move is unfair because it will leave tenants paying a levy based on “top-of-the-market 2008 rents” for longer.Ms Portas, the retail expert and TV personality who led a review into the high street for the government last year, said she was “hugely disappointed”.The British Property Federation said the decision was a “shot in the foot” for the retail industry as it would “embed injustices in the current system”. Colliers, the agents, called the move “nothing short of a scandal”.Key to the criticism is that rents in poorer parts of the country have slumped by as much as 40 per cent since the credit crunch, while remaining high in the prosperous south-east. But business rates – because they are based on historic rents – have not moved.“A revaluation should shift the burden from those who are suffering to those who are prospering,” said Liz Peace, chief executive of the BPF. “By postponing, the government is not allowing the downward adjustment that would otherwise take place for suffering retailers.”The government insists a revaluation would have helped 300,000 companies but left 800,000 with higher bills, according to estimates by the Valuation Office Agency. “Tax stability is vital as business rates are the third biggest outgoing for firms,” it said.But Jerry Schurder, an expert on business rates at consultants Gerald Eve, said the government’s claim that the move would help businesses was “preposterous”.Research by the company suggests retailers and office tenants in many towns and cities have been denied a drop in business rates of 20 per cent or more because of the delay. “Rochdale is being penalised to keep rates down in Regent Street,” said Mr Schurder.He said if the revaluation had gone ahead, Plymouth, Derby and Canterbury could have seen rates bills drop by more than 20 per cent; and Bristol, Leeds, Nottingham, Sheffield, Blackpool and Wolverhampton could have seen drops of at least 10 per cent.CVS, Britain’s largest business rates advisory firm, has written a letter to Brandon Lewis, the local government minister, urging him to overhaul the business rates system.Mark Rigby, CVS chief executive, said the delay would create more problems than it solved, because “2008 values are so dramatically mis-aligned to current property rents”. He also urged the government to tackle the backlog of more than 240,000 rates appeals – meaning that many tenants had to wait months for any rebate.“The announcement compounds a dysfunctional business rates system,” he said. CVS estimates that the backlog of 2010 appeals places the equivalent of a £1.8bn burden on business.The government has introduced discounts on business rates and is letting many companies delay their payments as part of its response to help business through the economic downturn.But MPs are increasingly worried about the impact of the revaluation delay, with Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, saying that the move would have a “major adverse effect” on companies in every region apart from the south-east."
75;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Argentina: seizing the currency printer;;"Another Argentine expropriation. Another which the government confidently expects “won’t cost the state a penny”.After Cristina Fernández’s government took over energy company YPF in April (Congress approved the expropriation of 51 per cent of the company in early May), for reasons of national interest (and for which it hopes not to have to pay anything), now it is the turn of banknote-printing firm, Compañía de Valores Sudamericana (CVS).Cristina Fernández, the president, used an emergency decree on Tuesday to place the company (usually referred to using its former name, the ex-Ciccone Calcográfica) under state administration and has sent a bill to Congress to expropriate it. Hernán Lorenzino, the economy minister who seems to have been usurped from his own job by his powerful deputy, Axel Kicillof, was dispatched on Wednesday to defend the move in public and to provide assurances that it won’t cost the state anything extra, after, of course, the company’s “large” debts to the tax agency are taken on board.The bill will go before the Senate on Thursday. Voices from the government camp have been arguing, variously, that it is a sovereign act to have banknote production controlled by the state; that the company had a great deal of idle capacity that could be put into service; that there was a plan afoot to outsource services and favour another company.All ignore the rather large elephant in the room: the company is at the centre of a criminal lawsuit involving Amado Boudou, the Argentine vice president. Oh, and the government would like to expropriate CVS, even though who it would be expropriating from is unclear since the identity of the owners is not public information.Government critics see little more than a manoeuvre to protect Boudou; after all, the government did not see fit to intervene in the company earlier, and did nothing even when Argentina, forced by inflation to pump out more banknotes, outsourced production of some 100-peso bills to Brazil and they, embarrassingly, came back faulty.Aníbal Fernández, a government Senator and former cabinet chief, noted – with no trace of irony – that the government “permanently” needed to make banknotes and said the government had “taken the bull by the horns” to sort out CVS’s debt situation and turn it into a company able to be responsible for currency printing.But the Boudou scandal is not over yet. The investigating judge, Ariel Lijo, is pressing on with his examination of all the evidence and has applied for Boudou’s latest sworn statement about his personal finances.Whether the expropriation move will torpedo the investigation remains to be seen. But it looks untransparent, and politically expedient, to say the least.Related reading:

76;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Walgreens and Express Scripts end dispute;;Walgreens and Express Scripts settled a heated dispute over fees, ending a breach between the biggest US pharmacy chain and the country’s largest pharmacy benefits manager.Walgreens stopped filling prescriptions for millions of Express Scripts customers in January after the two companies failed to renew their agreement over how much Walgreens is paid for the prescriptions it fills.Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers administer prescription drug plans for insurers and big companies, negotiating for lower prices from drug companies and pharmacies in a bid to bring down healthcare costs for consumers.Financial terms of the new contract were not disclosed on Tuesday, but the companies said it was a multiyear deal, and that Walgreens would begin filling Express Scripts orders again on September 15. Walgreens said the terms were consistent with the fees it paid other pharmacy benefits managers.The dispute eroded investor confidence in Walgreens, with analysts estimating the loss of Express Scripts customers could cost the pharmacy chain revenues of $10bn a year or more. Express Scripts customers accounted for 88m, or more than 10 per cent, of prescriptions filled at Walgreens last year.Sales at Walgreens began to slide, as customers took not only their drug buying but impulse purchases for groceries and home care products to other stores.In the seven months since the dispute began, Express Scripts customers have turned to rival pharmacy chains such as CVS Caremark and Rite Aid, which sought to take advantage of the dispute by advertising that they still worked with Express Scripts.“Whether [Express Scripts] prescription customers will all switch back to [Walgreens] now remains to be seen, but it seems likely that many have been lost permanently,” said Carol Levenson of Gimme Credit, the research group.Walgreens’ losses could have grown had the dispute not been resolved, as Express Scripts just completed its $29bn acquisition of Medco, another pharmacy benefits manager. Medco clients were never prevented from filling prescriptions at Walgreens, but analysts speculated that could have happened soon.Walgreens last month paid $6.5bn for a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots, the UK pharmacist. The two-stage deal will allow Walgreens to take full control of Alliance Boots, which was taken private five years ago in a £12bn deal led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the company’s chairman, Stefano Pessina.News of the deal sent Walgreens shares up 10.3 per cent to $34.16 by mid-afternoon in New York, while Express Scripts shares rose 1.9 per cent to $58.79. CVS shares were down 5.1 per cent to $45.97 and Rite Aid was down 5.5 per cent at $1.21.
77;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Gadflies gain wings in activist revolt;;Pershing Square, the $11bn New York hedge fund run by Bill Ackman, last week won a resounding victory at Canadian Pacific when shareholders backed the activist investor’s campaign to replace half the board.It was a victory for the argument that the North American railway operator should be doing better, and one that Mr Ackman must prove now that the company’s chief executive, chairman and four other executives have stood down.However, smoothing the way with Canadian investors and politicians behind the scenes were also the bankers of Blackstone, the alternative asset manager which counts Brian Mulroney, a former prime minister, as a board member.The well connected advisory group, which says that as a director, Mr Mulroney would not advise Pershing directly or be involved in fee-generating business, has tiptoed around cross border sensibilities before, advising Canada’s Thomson family on the merger with Reuters in 2008.Yet such a role for Blackstone, on the side of an activist in a situation that involved no takeover or financial engineering, reflects the shifting sources of power on Wall Street.Bankers historically tended to avoid working with hedge fund agitators for fear of alienating corporate clients. However, as investors have grown more assertive about their rights as owners, the gadflies have become more respectable and more powerful.John Studzinski, head of Blackstone’s advisory practice, says: “There is no question we are entering a new period of governance where activist shareholders are prepared to rattle the cage of boards to create value.”The tactic in Canada was to avoid making the contest one of Bill Ackman versus management, he says. “This is institutional, not personal, about Pershing Square as an institution, and Canadian Pacific as an institution.”Blackstone has advised Pershing before. It was there for Mr Ackman’s 2008 pharmacy campaigns to attract a bid for Walgreens and then an attempt to force CVS to pay a higher price for Longs Drugs, as well as his recent effort to turn around JC Penney, the department store chain.Such business brings with it new conflicts. Blackstone’s advisory group was the founding part of what is now a diversified alternative asset manager with almost $200bn under its care, and Pershing also happens to be one of the funds owned by Blackstone’s funds of hedge funds business, a “top performer” recommended to its investment clients.The victory at Canadian Pacific had many parents, however. Those involved in the campaign point to Paul Hilal, partner at Pershing and a key man behind the analysis of the railway company and its peers that was presented to a ballroom in Toronto packed with hundreds of investors and analysts.He was helped by Brian Welch, a junior analyst who joined from Blackstone’s private equity business in September.Stephen Fraidin, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis and a longtime adviser to Pershing described by others as Mr Ackman’s consigliere, says that “the decisive facts were that the Pershing Square platform and board were both viewed as compelling by the Canadian Pacific investors”.Also helping were lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell and Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg, while on the public relations side were Global Strategy Group, a specialist in political and corporate campaigns, and Navigator, their Canadian equivalent.Meanwhile, the slate of seven directors proposed by Pershing included four respected Canadian businessmen, and the hedge fund has lined up Hunter Harrison, an experienced industry executive, as a possible chief executive.Canadian Pacific, meanwhile, tried a defence that at one point claimed differences in weather patterns helped explain underperformance relative to peers. The company declined to comment.Irrespective of where the credit lies, it suggests that advising activists may become more mainstream as plain vanilla merger and acquisition work remains scarce. Mr Studzinski says: “It’s extraordinary today that there are many boards that appear to be unaccountable to their shareholders.”
78;CVS;CVS Corp;2012-05-15T18:34:13Z;Cardinal bows to US drug agency;;US efforts to crack down on the illegal use of prescription pain pills have picked up pace as Cardinal Health, one of the country’s largest pharmaceutical wholesalers, agreed to suspend shipments from one its distribution centres.An investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Agency had found that 7.2m doses of oxycodone were distributed by Cardinal to two CVS pharmacies in a Florida city of just over 50,000 people during a three-year period.The DEA said the supply “grossly exceeded” the needs of the population and that the company missed obvious signs of fraudulent prescriptions.Florida has become the centre of the US “pill mill” problem and several recent arrests have highlighted the role doctors and pharmacists have played in the illicit distribution of prescription narcotics.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said deaths from prescription drug abuse have surpassed deaths caused by cocaine and heroin overdoses and have become more frequent than fatalities from car crashes.The settlement with Cardinal comes as the US has expanded its pursuit of global drug companies and distributors to stem the flow of addictive pain medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, which have become a leading cause of accidental death.A US Senate committee last week launched an investigation into the practices of drug groups such as Purdue Pharma, Endo Pharmaceuticals and Johnson & Johnson. The committee suggested the companies, which produce powerful pain drugs, have improper financial ties with doctors and hospitals and that “dubious” marketing practices could be behind the recent surge in deaths from painkillers.On Tuesday, Cardinal agreed to stop distributing controlled medicines from the facility in question for two years and to improve its “anti-diversion” procedures. Cardinal was not subject to a financial penalty under the settlement. The company said the DEA is not planning to take additional measures against its other facilities.“Cardinal Health will continue its efforts to help stop prescription drug abuse,” the company said in a statement.In 2008, Cardinal was fined $34m for selling hydrocodone to “rogue” internet pharmacies.A DEA spokeswoman had no comment on the settlement.CVS Caremark, a US drugstore operator, continues to face litigation from the US government, which argues that the company should have known that a large number of prescriptions for controlled substances were not for legitimate medical purposes.CVS was not immediately available to comment.

The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."
80;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall. Shares close down 0.2 per cent to $31.93 after Carnival lowered guidance for 2012 earnings.Zynga, the online social game developer, enjoyed its first day of gains since a $10bn IPO last week.Its shares were up 2.1 per cent to $9.24, still 76 cents below their debut price.In after-hours trading Oracle shares tumbled 10 per cent to $26.26, after the software reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. That knocked the S&P 500 futures by 5 points suggesting the benchmark index may open lower on Wednesday.
81;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-11-14T23:08:07Z;Buffett reveals $10.7bn stake in IBM;;Berkshire Hathaway has taken a stake in IBM worth more than $10bn, its first big investment in a sector historically shunned by Warren Buffett.In a CNBC interview on Monday, the 81-year-old billionaire disclosed that he had secretly amassed a 5.5 per cent stake worth $10.7bn in the US information technology company since March.“I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” Mr Buffett said, citing the company’s unusual five-year plan outlining earnings per share, cash positions and shareholder-return goals until 2015.IBM, which had not been previously informed of Mr Buffett’s stake, declined to comment. Its shares ended the day unchanged at $187.The move further vindicates the strategy adopted by Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, who will step down next month after nine years in which he transformed the company from a hardware manufacturer into an IT services and consulting specialist.Mr Buffett had previously avoided the sector, saying he did not understand tech companies or their products well enough to take large stakes.Under Mr Palmisano, IBM has provided a level of disclosure rare for such a large public company. It intends to generate operating earnings per share of at least $20 by 2015, while spending $20bn on acquisitions between 2011 and 2015.Last month,IBM reported $26.2bn in third-quarter revenues, with most of the growth coming from emerging markets. It also forecast full-year profits of $13.35 per share, up 14 per cent year on year.Since 2000, the company has disposed of commodity businesses, including its PC and hard-drive divisions, and increased software’s earnings contribution from 25 to 44 per cent last year. Software is expected to account for half of IBM’s business by 2015.IBM recently announced that Ginni Rometty will succeed Mr Palmisano from the start of next year, making her IBM’s first female chief executive.Speaking ahead of Berkshire’s disclosure of its equity holdings, Mr Buffett added that he was not investing in European banks as he did not feel he knew enough about the industry and had not come across an interesting investment opportunity.The company later disclosed five new investments made during the quarter. At the end of September Berkshire owned stakes valued between $195m and $232m in Intel, drug store chain CVS Caremark, broadcaster DirecTV, Visa, and defence group General Dynamics.Mr Buffett also sold about a 10th of his holdings of Kraft Foods and Johnson & Johnson during the quarter, leaving Berkshire with positions worth $3.2bn and $2.4bn respectively.
82;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-10-17T19:38:10Z;Retailers face £1bn rise in rates bill;;Retailers are stepping up pressure for reform of the business rates system, as companies brace themselves for an expected £1bn increase to bills in April.The annual increase in business rates, due in the spring, is determined by September’s retail price inflation figure, which will be published today. The retail prices index has been running at 5 per cent as the cost of living rises, indicating that next year’s overall business rates bill for England will surpass £21bn, up from £20.3bn this year.Trade bodies, including the British Retail Consortium, are lobbying George Osborne, the chancellor, to reform the system and reduce the rate of increases to help businesses ride out the sluggish economy.Ministers are under pressure from Mr Osborne to generate initiatives for a “growth review”, to be published at the end of next month. The BRC has warned that rising rates bills and a backlog of appeals was falling disproportionately on small companies at a time when many were already struggling.A £300m backlog of business rates appeals has built up at the Valuation Office, the agency in charge of calculating the rates in England and Wales, research from the consultancy CVS said on Monday. Of the 328,000 appeals lodged with the Valuation Office by June 30, CVS, a business rates specialist, claimed a third dated back to the 2005 commercial property rating revaluation.The majority of appeals relate to the 2010 rating revaluation, which has been hotly contested by businesses in light of the commercial property slump, which saw rents and property values plunge.Don Baker, national head of rating at CVS, said: “The Valuation Office’s speed of processing business rates appeals is unacceptably slow. The delays are harming businesses’ ability to invest and contribute to local economic growth.”The £300m figure assumes that half of the backlogged appeals will achieve a 10 per cent reduction to bills, an average of £11,000.Ministers are increasingly concerned some companies are not getting appeals heard fast enough, says the Department for Communities and Local Government. “Ministers are clear the Valuation Office Agency must make every effort to deal with them as quickly as possible,” it said.
83;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

But a strong rally petered out late in the day, with bank stocks paring gains, as German and Dutch politicians demanded greater private sector participation in a second bail-out.Banks have tended to lead Europe-linked relief rallies, but global-facing industrial, material and energy stocks had the most momentum on Tuesday, mirroring a rally in commodity markets.Metals producer Allegheny Technologies Inc was up 7.4 per cent to $41.62 and oil and gas explorer QEP Resources jumped 6.2 per cent to $29.58. Mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global was up 8.1 per cent to $71.49.But concerns about global growth lingered. Metallurgical coal miner Alpha Natural Resources, whose market capitalisation fell by a third last week after the company warned of falling demand from China, fell 0.8 per cent to $21.26. It had been up as much as 8 per cent early in the day, when hopes of a comprehensive European deal were strongest.“The headline risk from across the pond has been weighing heavily on US stocks,” said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, “But for the first time in this crisis over the past 18 months it appears that European leaders finally get it.”In morning trading Mr Orlando allocated more funds to a US ETF tracking the German Dax index, and bought S&P 500 futures to profit from any rise in the benchmark index.“Stocks are just so cheap after last week’s fall, and we’re starting to see some positive news flow. You have to start buying or you’ll miss out on what could potentially be a significant rally,” he said.But not all investors climbed on board. Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors, initiated a position in oil company Suncor on Friday but has stayed on the sidelines on Monday and Tuesday, questioning the sustainability of the rally.“The liquidity issues at European banks might be solved quickly, but resolving the wider sovereign debt crisis will take much longer,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 1,175.42, although it had topped 1,190 for much of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 11,190.69 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.2 per cent to 2,548.83.Financial stocks were the second worst performing sector in the S&P 500, up only 0.4 per cent. Bank of America fell 1.8 per cent to $6.48 and JPMorgan fell 0.3 per cent to $31.57, but Citigroup, up 1 per cent to $26.99, and Morgan Stanley, up 2.5 per cent to $14.37, both managed to hold on to gains.Department store Sears Holding was up 6.6 per cent to $57.51, the second best performer in the S&P 500, up 14.1 per cent to $61.57, although analysts were at a loss to explain the jump.Reports suggest the company is moving to maximise revenue from its under utilised property assets, but that does not seem to justify Tuesday’s pop.The Vix index of volatility was down to 38, a fall of 3 per cent from Monday. Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” had been above or near 40 for almost a week.Shares in Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, fell 6.3 per cent to $33.77, even though the company posted unexpectedly strong results for the quarter ended August. Earnings per share were 87 cents, a jump of 79 per cent from the same quarter last year.But Walgreen said there has been “no substantive progress” in contract renewal talks with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager whose prescriptions account for up to $5.3bn of Walgreen revenue.Walgreen suggested losing the Express Script contract would cost it between 7 and 21 cents in per-share earnings next year. Walgreen’s rival CVS Caremark was up 0.8 per cent to $34.69.But Steven Halper at Stifel Nicolaus wrote in note to clients: “We are more pessimistic about the potential impact,” and that without the Express Scripts contract, “Walgreen will have increasing difficulty expanding gross margins at the same rate we have seen over the past two years”.Netflix continued a torrid trading period, down 3.6 per cent to $127.49.The stock is in negative territory for the week, despite the strong performance of the broad index, even though the company is reported to be on the verge of signing a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content.Family Dollar was down 1.2 per cent to $54.18. The discount retailer has been on a bullish run, as more cyclical stocks suffered, up 3 per cent for the month, while the broad S&P 500 has declined.
85;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Retail shares buffeted in Irene’s aftermath;;The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since August 4, despite poor consumer confidence data and a rough day for department stores.Retail stocks were volatile as analysts picked winners and losers from Hurricane Irene.Kohl’s was down 2.2 per cent to $46.63 and JC Penney shares were off 1.8 per cent at $26.97.“We believe the department stores were negatively impacted by the hurricane as consumers stocked up on consumables ahead of the storm, rather than focusing on back-to-school items,” Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, told clients.That also hurt Staples, the stationery retailer, which was down 1.7 per cent to $14.60.But Edward Kelly said drug stores probably experienced heavy traffic in preparation for Hurricane Irene. CVS Caremark was up 0.6 per cent 35.76, although shares in Walgreen and Rite Aid were both flat.Overall, consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 were up 0.4 per cent, outperforming consumer staples stocks by 0.2 per cent in what is normally a sign of heightened expectations for economic growth.But it was hard to discern that much confidence from retail movers, with defensive stock, discount store Family Dollar, the biggest retail riser, up 4.2 per cent at $51.06.Randal Konik, retail analyst at Jefferies, said he was cautious about calling a strong rally in retail.“But it is hard to recommend going short on many [retail] stocks, simply because expectations for the back end of the year have already been downgraded and a lot of bad news priced in.”Overall, the S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent at 1,212.89, its third consecutive day of gains rise, ending the day above 1,200 for the second day running.Although stocks have bounced back from lows, previous rallies this month have fallen back after 1,200, and traders were relieved that the latest rally had not shrivelled.“The next stop is whether there is a major breakdown at 1,250. I think there will be major resistance if we get there,” said Paul Zemsky, head of multi-asset strategies at ING.The rally was again based on light trading volumes. Aggregate volume in US markets on Monday was the second lowest this month. Only Monday’s aggregate level had been lower.Monster Worldwide, which operates the job-search site Monster.com, led gainers, jumping 21.5 per cent to $9.91, after SEC filings revealed three executives had exercised options to buy more than 85,000 shares shares between them.The shares were purchased at $8.17, one cent higher than Monday’s closing price. Monster shares had hit a 28-month low of $7.00 on Friday.PulteGroup, the homebuilder, was up 7.1 per cent at $4.95 after better-than-expected house price figures. The Case-Schiller home price index was down only 0.1 per cent month on month in June.Pulte’s share price – an indicator of confidence in the construction sector – had briefly topped $5 for the first time since August 5.Insurers fell as financial stocks in the S&P 500 dropped 0.8 per cent, one of only two sectors to fall on the day. Hartford was off 0.3 per cent to $19.26, a partial correction to a strong rally on Monday, when Hartford had gained 10 per cent on relief that insurance companies would not have to make big pay-outs after Hurricane Irene inflicted less damage than expected.Bank of America shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $8.12. But the stock remains strongly up on the week after the shares rose 8 per cent on Monday on news of the $8.3bn sale of a 5 per cent stake in China Construction Bank.On Tuesday, analysts weighed in positively on the deal. Baird estimated that, when combined with other recent disposals, the CCB sale would increase BofA’s Basel I tier one capital, an important tool regulators use to measure the financial strength of banks, by 50 basis points to 8.75 per cent.Regional bank First Horizon was down 4.1 per cent at $6.99.Alpha Natural Resources was down 2.6 per cent at $34.02. JPMorgan initiated coverage on the coal supplier, giving it a neutral rating. But the stock was also retreating from the $35 mark that it reached yesterday, a level at which the stock has faced resistance all month.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,576.11, despite shares in NuPathe falling 34.6 per cent to $2.65. At one point, NuPathe stock had lost more than half its value after the company failed to win regulatory approval for the first skin patch to treat migraines. The Food and Drug Administration asked for more information.The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was tracking up 0.2 per cent to 11,559.64, closely following the S&P 500.
86;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-08-24T14:31:35Z;BofA rallies but Wall St flat;;A strong rally in Bank of America helped Wall Street record a second day of gains.BofA rose 11 per cent at $6.99, recovering all of their losses for the week. The stock had touched a low of $6.01, not seen since 2009, on Tuesday, as investors fretted about the bank’s capital adequacy levels.Glenn Schorr, director of US financial equities at Nomura, said the “sell-off [in BofA] may be overdone” and set a target price of $11.But Mr Schorr said the stock still compared unfavourably to Citigroup, citing Citi’s better tier one capital ratio – 6.7 per cent to BofA’s 5.1 per cent – smaller mortgage portfolio ($431bn to $1,600bn at BofA) and less legal risk from continuing claims relating to mortgage mis-selling and trading.Citigroup was up 4.1 per cent per cent at $28.45, Goldman Sachs climbed 3.2 per cent to $110.31 and Genworth Financial put on 6.7 per cent to close at $6.55, as financial stocks in the S&P 500 strongly outperformed the index, up 2.8 per cent. The broader KBW bank index gained 3.3 per cent to close at 37.72.The main S&P 500 index climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,177.60, now up 4.8 per cent for the week. But defensive utility stocks were up 2 per cent in a sign of continuing investor nervousness.Traders are hoping the index will break through the 1,200 level, which has proved a barrier since market volatility heightened at the start of August.McGraw-Hill companies, whose businesses include Standard & Poor’s and several media companies, rose 7.4 per cent to $41.30 after JPMorgan said shareholders could gain $5bn if the parent company was split and individual businesses sold.CVS Caremark, was up 3 per cent at $34.44, after the pharmacist announced plans to buy back at least $1bn in shares by the end of the year, as part of a larger $4bn programme.Wednesday saw good economic data. Orders for durable goods were up 4 per cent month-on-month in July, the biggest climb in four months, and well above expectations of a 2 per cent rise.House prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent month-on-month in June, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The homebuilder PulteGroup climbed 4.2 per cent to $3.76.Stock exchange operators gained after Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James, tipped them to benefit from rising transaction volume in volatile markets.The New York Stock Exchange was up 4 per cent at $27.28, and Nasdaq OMX climbed 3.1 per cent to $23.05. Alex Kramm at UBS upgraded Nasdaq to buy, targeting $28, also on high transaction volume.Sprint Nextel lost 3.9 per cent to $3.45. Reports the mobile phone network will be able to offer the iPhone 5 handset by the end of the year had led shares to rise 10.1 per cent Tuesday.But UBS telecoms analyst John Hodulik warned that, while the Iphone would attract new subscribers, higher upfront subsidy costs would drive down margins.Research in Motion put on 3.9 per cent to close at $34.44, on reports its new Blackberry models will be able to run applications built for Google’s Android operating system.Semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers slipped after JPMorgan forecast lower demand for the industry, due to the weak macroeconomic situation.Micron Technology, which supplies computer manufacturers, led fallers in the S&P 500. Its shares slid 6.4 per cent at $5.30, after it gave advance warning of lower revenue.Cisco Systems was the second worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.1 per cent to $15.46. The broad index gained 1.3 per cent to close at 11,320.56.Volterra Semiconductors lost 7.9 per cent to close at $20.10, after Collins Stewart lowered its forecast, citing expected weak demand from Intel, a key Volterra client.The Nasdaq composite index underperformed the S&P 500, up 0.9 per cent at 2,467.69.Applied Materials, which supplies parts for solar panels as well as computer semiconductors, was boosted by a bullish Goldman Sachs note on the solar industry.Its shares were down 0.7 per cent on the day at $11.36, but were still up 5 per cent for the week, before an earnings report after the bell on Wednesday.Avago Technologies, a San Jose-based manufacturer of semiconductors for phone handsets, was up 10.3 per cent to $32.27 as it reported quarterly revenue of $603m and earnings per share of 68 cents, a 4 cent increase on the previous quarter.Terence Whalen, analyst at Citigroup, added the stock to his top picks and said the company was outperforming by winning key contracts from handset manufacturers including Apple rather than because of broad demand for semiconductors.Energy shares underperformed, up 0.4 per cent, after recording strong gains on Tuesday. Shares were led down by domestic oil producing companies.Refiner Tesoro put on 5.9 per cent to $21.30 after Benchmark Company analyst Mark Gilman upgraded the company, and predicted Tesoro will reinstate its 40 cent annual dividend, suspended in 2009.
87;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-08-10T21:55:39Z;Case study: Walgreens;;The challenge: The competitive context for Walgreens began to change in the early 2000s. First, mass merchandisers such as Walmart started undercutting the company’s prices on generic drugs – historically a major profit centre.Second, employers began to mandate that employees in their health insurance plans fill their prescriptions via mail order to cut costs.Third, a major competitor, CVS, merged with one of the largest managers of pharmacy benefit plans to provide a more comprehensive offering to consumers, employers and health insurers. As a result, some customers were worried that health insurers would stop reimbursing prescriptions filled at Walgreens.The strategy: After almost three decades at Walgreens, Greg Wasson became the president of the company in 2007 and chief executive in 2009. Moving with the legitimacy of someone with deep roots in the institution, he tried to quickly reposition Walgreens as an indispensable partner to employers and insurers.First, the company acquired the two biggest workplace health clinic businesses and established itself as the clear market leader in that industry. As part of this process, it used its retail locations to serve employees outside of working hours and to help care for their dependants. This cemented relationships with employers who otherwise might have asked employees to get their prescriptions filled by mail order.At the same time, the company developed new ways to leverage its convenient locations to serve health insurers. For example, in-depth, multisession counselling by pharmacists was offered to people with chronic diseases.It also rolled out walk-in clinics in hundreds of its stores to aid customers with minor ailments at a much lower cost than physicians or emergency rooms offered.Far from steering consumers away from Walgreens, insurers began incentivising people to use the company’s services.The results: The new businesses have derived big competitive advantages from the core pharmacy business, while simultaneously protecting that business from key threats.Company revenue and operating income have grown over the past four years, even while the recession weakened merchandise sales at the front of the stores. Walgreens has become the in-house supplier of healthcare services at hundreds of large companies and has developed into a partner to major health insurers in counselling their most costly members.It has also expanded its share of prescriptions and developed new revenue streams from services such as counselling.The lessons: A company facing competitors with asymmetric advantages needs to find ways to change the game. The seemingly vulnerable core business may contain hidden assets – such as underused pharmacists, long opening hours and convenient locations – that could boost new offerings.By stepping outside of how its industry has traditionally defined itself, a company can evaluate the broad range of challenges faced by important customers or business partners, and it can leverage hidden assets to meet these needs in ways that few others can.The writer is managing director of New Market Advisors, and the author of ‘Capturing New Markets: How Smart Companies Create Opportunities Others Don’t’
88;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-07-21T17:27:23Z;Express Scripts to buy rival for $29bn;;Express Scripts has agreed to buy Medco Health Solutions in a $29.1bn deal that will create the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the US, fuelling the debate around competition and costs in the country’s healthcare industry.Medco stockholders will receive $28.80 in cash and 0.81 of an Express Scripts share for each Medco share, the companies said on Thursday. The $71.36-a-share offer represents a 28 per cent premium to Medco’s Wednesday closing price.The combination is expected to face rigorous antitrust scrutiny because it brings two of the industry’s “Big Three” together. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, process and pay prescription drug claims for health insurers and employer programmes.Medco shares were up only 12 per cent in morning trading at $62.52, a sizeable discount to the offer price.George Paz, chief executive of Express Scripts, said on a call with investors: “We are going to work very hard to show the government the value this brings to patients and members as we drive those costs out of the [healthcare] system,” adding that companies believed the deal had a “very good chance” of getting approved by the Federal Trade Commission.People familiar with the matter suggested that while the national market was consolidated, large PBMs faced strong competition from a range of smaller operators at the state and regional level.Medco said separately on Tuesday that it will lose its pharmacy benefit agreement with insurer United Healthcare from 2013. With United expected to take its PBM business in-house, that raises the prospect the combined company could also face competition from the biggest healthcare insurers.The healthcare industry is under pressure following reform in the US, with more patients expected to leave the employer-sponsored health plans served by the PBMs and purchase insurance through government-run exchanges.“The cost and quality of healthcare is a great concern to all Americans,” said Mr Paz. “Companies like ours have a responsibility to provide the leadership and resources required to drive out waste in healthcare and provide the best care in the world.” The companies believe they can save $1bn in costs through combining.The deal comes four years after Express Scripts failed in its $26bn attempt to buy Caremark, a large rival. Caremark instead opted for an offer from pharmacy chain CVS – in part because of fears that antitrust issues would stymie an Express-Caremark combination.Antitrust experts said that the industry was extremely complicated to analyse. PBMs negotiate favourable deals with pharmaceuticals companies and retailers for their clients – leading to concerns over buyer power – as well as competing with them through mail order. The companies also act on behalf of a wide variety of state and government entities keen to see healthcare costs pushed down.PBMs expect to see a boost in profits in the next two years as some of the most widely used prescription drugs face patent expirations, allowing them to switch patients to generic alternatives.David Maris, analyst at CLSA, notes there is a looming drought of new generics coming in 2014 after the next wave of expirations passes. When that is combined with the potential of greater government price controls on drugs, PBMs are wise to seek greater scale.The takeover is the second-largest deal in the US this year after AT&T’s planned acquisition of T-Mobile USA.Shares of Express Scripts rose about 3.8 per cent to $54.50 in midday trading on Thursday.Credit Suisse and Citigroup Global Markets advised Express Scripts. JPMorgan and Lazard advised Medco.
89;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-05-27T00:15:28Z;Google reveals mobile payment plan;;Google and a group of partners including Sprint Nextel, Citibank and MasterCard plan to jump-start the mobile payments market in the US with a system based on a free ‘Google Wallet’ app and a technology called NFC (Near Field Communications.)“Today, we’ve joined with leaders in the industry to build the next generation of mobile commerce,” said Stephanie Tilenius, Google’s vice-president for commerce and payments. “With Citi, MasterCard, First Data and Sprint we’re building an open commerce ecosystem that for the first time will make it possible for you to pay with an NFC wallet and redeem consumer promotions all in one tap, while shopping offline.”While the outlines of the Google NFC scheme had been widely expected, Google also revealed that Google Wallet will also come pre-configured with the internet advertising group’s daily-deal coupon service called ‘Google Offers.’ This service will compete directly with rivals including Groupon and LivingSocial and will provide Google with a new mobile revenue stream.Google said it will not derive any revenue from financial transactions made using its secure mobile wallet system which will enable consumers with some Android-based handsets to ‘tap and pay’ for goods and services instead of swiping a traditional credit or debit card. Retailers, restaurants and other service providers will need new or modified NFC-enabled readers to accept payment.Google Wallet will launch in New York and San Francisco this summer where many retailers including CVS, Jack in the Box, Sports Authority and Sunoco as well as Coca-Cola vending machines and taxis are PayPass-enabled. It will be offered initially to Sprint Nextel customers with the NFC-enabled Samsung Nexus S 4G smartphone.At launch, people who already have a PayPass eligible Citi MasterCard will be able to add it to Google Wallet ‘over the air’ – PayPass cards are currently accepted by about 124,000 merchants across the US. Alternatively Google Wallet will also come with a virtual Google prepaid card that can be topped up using a bank payment card.Ms Tilenius emphasised that while Google is launching the Google Wallet and the NFC service in conjunction with a set of partners, it is an open system, “that others are welcome to join.” She said Google hopes to offer the mobile payments system outside the US and that it will eventually be expanded to include “everything you find today in your wallet.” Google Wallet will start with offers, loyalty and gift cards but some day items like receipts, boarding passes and tickets will all be seamlessly synced to your Google Wallet.In the US, the Google Wallet partners will compete directly with another NFC initiative called Isis that brings together three of the top four US mobile network operators – Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile – and plans to launch with multiple payment networks and banks when it goes live in 2012.“There seems to be a clear land grab in terms of owning the digital money space right now,” said Fred Huet, analyst at UK-based Greenwich Consulting. “A lot of players are serious about making it happen. Mobile operators are creating digital wallets, handset makers are creating digital wallets, PayPal has a digital wallet.”Separately, PayPal on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming the search group misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal’s mobile-payment business, according to the AP.
90;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-05-05T22:12:23Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities continued to retreat from the multiyear highs reached last week, led lower by energy and material stocks as risk appetite was sapped by disappointing economic data and a mixed set of earnings reports.The big corporate news of the session was from General Motors, the largest of the Detroit carmakers, which reported a tripling in first-quarter earnings to $3.2bn.But this hefty growth in profits failed to impress investors as much of the improvement was due to one-time gains from the sale of stakes in former affiliates. The stock was down 3.1 per cent to $32.02 and the larger S&P auto index fell 0.4 per cent.In the wider markets, sentiment was weaker after weekly employment data showed that the number of jobless claims had unexpectedly surged to the highest level in eight months, raising concerns about the strength of the US labour market.This disappointing data followed weaker-than-expected ADP jobs data on Wednesday and bodes badly for the all-important official non-farm payroll data set to be released on Friday.These concerns left the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,335.03, the fourth consecutive losing session on the index.The losses over the past week have been led by energy and material stocks as commodity prices have softened. This theme continued on Thursday as commodity prices plummeted.In the energy sector, Murphy Oil was down 6.4 per cent to $68.57 while ExxonMobil lost 2.6 per cent to $82.62. The S&P energy index fell 2.3 per cent, adding to the 5.1 per cent drop already this week.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 2.5 per cent to $49.85 while Peabody Energy was down 3.6 per cent to $61.27. The S&P materials index was 1.3 per cent lower.Transport stocks were given a boost by the tumbling oil price, however, and the Dow transport index was up 1.1 per cent.But the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent to 12,583.11 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,814.72.The recent downturn follows a raft of technical highs achieved by large benchmark indices last week. In the final few days of April, the S&P rose to a 35-month high, the Nasdaq reached a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“It is not clear yet if this is just a traditional correction following some technical highs, or it is the beginning of something more significant,” said Jonathan Lewis, chairman of the investment committee at Samson Capital Advisors.“Some unsettling questions have been raised of late by weak data on housing, manufacturing and gross domestic product growth,” he added.Late last month, government figures showed that US GDP growth slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 as rising oil prices weighed on consumer demand and government spending fell.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in JDS Uniphase bounced 6.9 per cent higher to $21.38 after the maker of optical communications reported a swing into a third-quarter profit, beating expectations with both its earnings and revenues.This helped the wider technology sector record some of the smallest losses on Wall Street. Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker, was up 3.8 per cent to $24.98 while Juniper Networks added 0.7 per cent to $37.54. The S&P technology index was down only 0.5 per cent.In other positive news, Whole Foods Market, the natural and organic grocer, reported a 33 per cent rise in second-quarter profit and lifted its full-year earnings forecast. Shares in the company were up 0.4 per cent to $59.95.Since the earnings season began, however, the number of companies that have beaten expectations with their results has been in decline.Two weeks after the start of the season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent with slightly more than 100 companies left to report.Elsewhere, Kindle International soared 57.7 per cent to $14.98 after privately held INC Research agreed to buy the clinical research company late on Wednesday for $232m.Shares in CVS Caremark added 1.9 per cent to $36.79 after the drugstore and pharmacy company reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, although profits were down and margins were slimmer.
91;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-05-04T21:56:05Z;Case study: Australian Gold;Switching the emphasis to a personal connection;The story. Established in 1985, Australian Gold is a fast-growing suncare brand. Sold in more than 50 countries, it is recognised by its mascot “Sydney”, a koala bear riding the waves on a golden brown surfboard. The Australian Gold brand is owned by New Sunshine, a manufacturer of tanning and skincare products, based in Indianapolis, US.The challenge. Australian Gold decided to extend its outdoor suncare products to the mass market this year. But there were already more than 100 established sunscreen brands including Banana Boat, Coppertone and Hawaiian Tropic, as well as private labels such as Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid. The goal was, as chief executive Stephen Hilbert put it, to introduce the brand to the American market “in an entertaining, modern, and memorable way”.The strategy. Australian Gold’s strategy had two components: develop a distinct brand message and communicate it to the public. To differentiate its brand, Australian Gold developed a campaign, ”Live the gold life”, which epitomised beaches, sun and fun. Such lifestyle branding was believed to be more effective than emphasising functional benefits of the product, such as UVA/UVB protection, water resistance and purity.To ingrain the image of Australian Gold as the “gold life” sunscreen in the minds of consumers, the company took the unorthodox step of partnering with Donald Trump’s popular television show Celebrity Apprentice. Australian Gold sponsored an episode of the show last month in which celebrities developed a campaign for the sunscreen based on the “gold life” concept.Walmart, Walgreens and CVS carried Australian Gold displays featuring Celebrity Apprentice.The outcome. The publicity campaign generated significant buzz and media coverage. The TV episode was watched by more than 8m viewers. As a part of the show, Australian Gold sponsored AIDS Project Los Angeles (the charity of choice of the winning team), creating further viewer goodwill toward the brand.But was positioning Australian Gold as a lifestyle brand a viable strategy? Lifestyle branding has gained popularity among companies, which view it as a way to sidestep competition and connect with customers in a more personal way. This is especially appealing when increasing commoditisation makes product differentiation more challenging.The problem. Despite its intuitive appeal, lifestyle positioning is not without drawbacks. As more brands adopt lifestyle positioning, they risk of satiating consumers’ need for self-expression. Because this is not product-specific, lifestyle brands can end up competing not only within their own product category but also with lifestyle brands in unrelated product categories. For Australian Gold, this means that it will now compete not only with sunscreen brands but also with apparel brands such as Quicksilver, Rip Curl and Hollister. And, just as the wallets of most consumers have limits, so does their need for self-expression through lifestyle brands.Key lessons. Lifestyle positioning is a viable way to circumvent product commoditisation by enabling brands to connect with consumers more personally. The main concern is that by choosing lifestyle positioning, brands might trade in-category competition for even fiercer cross-category competition for a share of the “consumer self”.The success of lifestyle branding depends on a company’s ability to create, differentiate and sustain its lifestyle positioning. If a brand fails to carve a unique niche in a consumer’s mind, its lifestyle strategy might backfire, making it largely irrelevant to consumers.Competition is no longer bound by product categories: all lifestyle brands compete across categories for a share of consumer identity.

92;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-03-22T20:35:09Z;US stocks pause for breath after 3-day rally;;Walgreen tumbled after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets traders paused for breath following three straight sessions of strong gains.Shares in Walgreen, the largest pharmacy chain in the US by sales, lost 6.6 per cent to $39.21 after reporting earnings that only met analysts expectations.Investors had been hoping for better margins and same-store sales growth, but this failed to materialise. The stock suffered its sharpest one-day fall since December 2008 and was the worst performer on the S&P 500 index.CVS Caremark, another pharmacy chain, was down 0.9 per cent to $33.41 while the S&P retail index was down 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 edged 0.4 per cent lower to 1,293.77 in a low-volume session, as traders paused to take stock of the recent rally that has seen the S&P index pare nearly all of the losses sustained following the earthquake in Japan.Fears of a nuclear catastrophe following the natural disaster left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in the first three days of last week. But as these worries subsided traders sought to pick up bargains pushing the S&P close to pre-tsunami levels.“The market wants to climb higher as the data show the US economy is largely on the right track,” said Harvey Neiman, manager of the Neiman Largecap Value Fund. “But every time we get a good run some disaster hits and we see a lot of volatility,” he added.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, spiked up 46.4 per cent early last week following the earthquake and tsunami, but has also calmed down as fears have eased. The index was down 2.4 per cent in the session, adding to the 29.9 per cent decline in the last few days. The measure of fear on Wall Street is back where it was before the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan.US equities have largely recovered from the effects of Japan, but the S&P 500 is still down 3.7 per cent since before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East in February. The Vix is up 22.5 per cent in the same timeframe.The 3.7 per cent loss on the S&P has been the first substantial retreat since Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his speech at Jackson Hole in late August 2010, where he hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The market subsequently gained 28 per cent in 5½ months until the rally was derailed by the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. “The market was in a position where it needed a correction,” said Robert Haber, the chief executive officer of Haber Trilix Advisors. “But there is a pretty good chance we have seen the short-term lows,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,018.63 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,683.87.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Jefferies Group, the investment bank, reported first-quarter earnings up 21 per cent in what the bank said was the second most profitable quarter on record. Shares in the company had added 4.6 per cent in early trading, but ended just 0.2 per cent higher at $24.48.Anadarko Petroleum signed a $1.55bn deal with the Korea National Oil Corporation for one-third of its interest in the Maverick Basin assets in Texas.The deal, which is the second-largest purchase of US oil and natural gasfields this year, will see KNOC pay all of Anadarko’s 2011 capital costs in the basin and then 90 per cent of costs subsequently until the $1.55bn is spent. The news sent shares in Anadarko up 1 per cent to $80.79.Elsewhere in the sector Newfield Exploration, the US oil group, was up 0.5 per cent to $75.58 while EOG Resources added 1.8 per cent to $113.36.Shares of Dollar General, the retailer, rose 1.5 per cent to $30.84 after the retailer reported that fourth-quarter earnings per share had more than doubled to 64 cents from 26 cents in the same period last year.Netflix gained 4 per cent to $221.39 following a note from Credit Suisse entitled “Don’t Stop Believing,” which upgrades the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Sprint Nextel, the number three US wireless carrier, was up 2.3 per cent to $4.47 following a 13.6 per cent loss in the previous session on news that AT&T was buying T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom.
93;CVS;CVS Corp;2011-02-03T21:46:16Z;Wall St rises amid mixed results;;"Stocks made modest gains after promising economic data and strong January sales figures from retailers, but mixed earnings reports and worries about Egypt and other countries limited gains.Merck lost 2.7 per cent to $32.90 after the drug group posted a fourth-quarter loss and forecast that full-year earnings would come in below expectations.Much of the loss was because of a writedown after it had to stop trials in an experimental heart drug due to safety concerns.For the fourth quarter, Merck lost $531m, or 17 cents a share, after the $1.7bn writedown, falling back from a $6.5bn profit, or $2.35 a share, a year earlier.Dow Chemical reported that fourth-quarter earnings had nearly trebled. The largest US chemical company reported profits of $511m, or 37 cents a share, up from $172m, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. The results were only slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts and so the shares were up 0.3 per cent to $36.74.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,307.11 after strong economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 12,062.26, its fourth consecutive session of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,753.88.Figures from the Labor Department showed that the number of j obless claims had fallen by 42,000 to 415,000 in the last week of January, surpassing the 31,000 drop forecast by economists.“Initial claims are trending down as the labour market recovers,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “We would expect the downtrend in claims to continue.”Data also showed that the productivity of US workers had unexpectedly risen in the fourth quarter. Separately, figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US service sector had seen strong growth in January, with the index moving 2.3 points higher to 59.4. A reading above 50 signals expansion.But market reaction to the statistics was muted as traders looked nervously at the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East after Yemen became the latest country to face anti-government protests.“The focus …seems to have turned towards Egypt because this higher ISM number is really strong (approaching a booming pace) but the market is simply not trading on it,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. The retail sector was one of the leaders of the session after groups reported better than expected January sales.Limited Brands, parent of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported a 24 per cent increase in January same-store sales and revised up its fourth-quarter earnings guidance, sending the shares 7.4 per cent higher to $31.29. Zumiez, a speciality sports retailer, said January same-store sales had risen 15 per cent, sending the shares up 3.2 per cent to $24.39.Costco Wholesale, a warehouse retailer, rose 4.5 per cent to $74.03 after its same-store sales rose 9 per cent.Sally Beauty Holdings saw same-store sales up
6.8 per cent, but reported first-quarter earnings up 57 per cent, outstripping analysts’ estimates and sending the shares 13.8 per cent higher to $14.37.News that BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, was considering selling itself sent its shares up 12.2 per cent to $48.25.After the closing bell on Wednesday, News Corp, owner of Fox Broadcasting and Twentieth Century Fox, reported a doubling of second-quarter net income. Its shares gained 6 per cent at $16.96. The company reported second-quarter profit of $642m, or 24 cents per share, from $254m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, driven by higher TV subscriber fees and advertising sales.That came in spite of deep cuts at MySpace, which triggered a $275m charge to News Corp’s quarterly earnings. The group disclosed that rivals and financial groups from the US and elsewhere had shown interest in the site.Verizon Communications, the telecommunications provider, advanced 0.6 per cent to $36.38 after announcing it would buy back 100m of its shares.Kellogg, the maker of breakfast cereals, reported a 7.4 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, sending its shares up 4.3 per cent to $52.52. Gap rose 4.2 per cent to $19.83 after it forecast that its end of year profits would come in ahead of previous estimates.CVS Caremark, the second-largest US pharmacy chain, dropped 5 per cent to $32.92 after reporting weak fourth-quarter earnings."
94;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-12-31T21:18:34Z;US stocks end 2010 near two-year highs;;US stocks finished the year just short of their two-year highs, as investor profit-taking balanced out some 11th-hour deal activity.“I suppose it is fair to say that equities have had a fantastic run in the past 21 months,” said David Buik, at BGC Capital Partners.“In light of the clouds of uncertainty that gather over sovereign debt issues and growth prospects for China, and in view of its government’s concern and reaction to the threat of inflation plus a rather mixed outlook for recovery in the US next year, investors took some profit this morning.”The S&P 500 closed a fraction lower at 1,257.67 on Friday but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction higher at 11,577.51 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent lower at 2,652.87.Over the year, the S&P 500 rallied 12.8 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10.9 per cent, both hitting two-year highs in late December.The Nasdaq Composite surged 16.9 per cent to reach a three-year high.The consumer discretionary sector leading the risers in the S&P 500, up 25.7 per cent.Investors bought into the stocks in expectation that the US consumer begin spending again and they started to do just that in the end-of-year holiday shopping season.The industrials sector also soared, with the S&P 500 industrials index up 24 per cent over the year, as US manufacturing data improved and US factories benefited from surges in demand from emerging markets. Materials stocks were also buoyed by this demand, rising 19.9 per cent over the year.The markets looked set to close the year without a single sector falling into negative territory but the S&P 500 healthcare index was the worst performer, rising just 0.7 per cent.Worries about the implementation of Obama’s healthcare reforms, on top of concerns about the effects of some key patents expiring for pharmaceutical companies, kept the shares underperforming the indices.Utilities and technology also climbed less than the wider market, with the utilities index up just 0.9 per cent and technology adding 9.1 per cent in spite of a surge towards the end of the year.On Friday, some of the biggest gainers of the year edged lower as investors took their profits.Netflix, the online and home delivery movie rental company, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500 over the last year, gaining 219 per cent. The stock lost 2.3 per cent to $175.70 on Friday.Also in technology, F5 networks soared 145.7 per cent over the last year. But the company, which makes devices and systems to ensure the security and performance of networks, edged lower by 1.7 per cent to $130.16 during the final session.SanDisk, which has risen 71 per cent this year, lost 1 per cent to $49.86, while Red Hat, which has soared 48 per cent this year, gave up 1.3 per cent to $45.64.Monster Worldwide, the online jobs advertisement company which has done well because of investor hopes for a recovery in recruitment, adding 36.9 per cent, was down 2 per cent to $23.63.In contrast, the biggest faller of the year, Dean Foods, added 2.1 per cent to $8.84. The food and beverage company has lost more than half its market capitalisation this year.There was some last minute deal activity with CVS, the pharmacy chain, was lower by 0.7 per cent to $34.77 after it said it would buy Universal American Corp’s Medicare prescription drug business for about $1.25bn. Universal American shares soared 40 per cent to $20.45.The deal will more than double the size of its Medicare programme after sales in pharmacy benefits management fell for the last two quarters.IMAX Corp jumped as much as 13 per cent but retreated to finish the day up 4.5 per cent at $28.07 when the operator of large screen cinemas denied a report that Sony Corp could be preparing an offer for the company.But Borders lost 21.6 per cent to 91 cents after the book retailer delayed payments to some publishers as it tries to refinance its credit agreements.Rival Barnes & Noble also fell, down 1.3 per cent to $14.15. There had been speculation that Borders could make a bid for Barnes & Noble.
95;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;CVS to buy Universal’s Medicare unit;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and pharmacy-benefits company, on Friday agreed to buy the Medicare ‘Part D’ prescription drug business of Universal American for about $1.25bn in a deal that will more than double its share of the programme.Universal American serves about 1.9m Medicare recipients, while CVS already provides prescription drug plans for 1.2m Medicare members.Medicare Part D, introduced in 2006, provides the elderly with subsidised access to prescription drugs. The various programmes are managed by private companies and have proved a lucrative segment of the market.Analysts predict that the ageing US population will become dependent on Medicare coverage while the recent healthcare reform legislation is expected to speed up a shift of retirees from employer to government-based health programmes.The social security and Medicare boards of trustees expect the cost of Medicare part D coverage to grow at an average rate of 9.4 per cent each year over the next decade.In early trading, CVS shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $34.89 while Universal American shares soared 40 per cent to $20.39. Under the terms of the deal, Universal shareholders will get about $12.80 to $13 a share in cash.Pitching the deal to shareholders, Per Lofberg, President of Caremark Pharmacy Services, said the transaction would boost CVS position in “one of the nation’s fastest growing segments of the Pharmacy Benefit Management industry”.The deal will position CVS to compete with health insurance companies such as Humana and UnitedHealth Group who already have a strong presence in the Medicare sector.CVS has had a tough year, coming under pressure from weak consumer spending and the loss of major contracts. At the same time, it faces ongoing scrutiny, including several state investigations, of its hybrid model of managing prescriptions and selling drugs through own pharmacies.“The Medicare Part D program is integral to CVS Caremark’s long-term growth strategy,” Mr Lofberg said, adding that the combination would allow the company to provide members with a wider range of products and services at lower costs.Under the complex terms of the deal, CVS Caremark will buy all of the outstanding stock of Universal and then give Universal shareholders all the shares in a new company, which will own all of Universal’s other operations including its Medicare Advantage business.The new company is expected to have about $640m of cash and statutory capital and no debt. Richard Barasch, chief executive of Universal, said the move would allow the company to “focus its energies” on and building its Medicare Advantage business.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2011 and is dependent on shareholder and regulatory approvals.
96;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Walmart sues CVS over top executive;;Walmart, the largest US retailer, has gone to court in a bid to stop CVS Caremark, the drugstore and pharmacy company, from hiring a former member of its top management echelon in the US.In a legal filing, Walmart says CVS plans next week to appoint Hank Mullany as president of its retail division, which comprises more than 7,000 stores.Mr Mullany was formerly head of Walmart’s northern division, one of three national regions whose leaders report to the head of Walmart USA, Bill Simon.Walmart argues that his move to CVS, just a month after he left Walmart, is in breach of a non-compete agreement signed by Mr Mullany that precludes working for a competitor for at least two years.CVS Caremark announced on Friday evening that Mr Mullany had been appointed as president of its retail business with effect from December 6. Tom Ryan, chief executive, said in a statement that Mr Mullany was “the right candidate to fill this role”, with “a proven track record as a leader”.But a Delaware judge subsequently issued a temporary restraining order that would prevent Mr Mullany starting work at CVS before a preliminary hearing of Walmart’s complaint, scheduled for December 15.CVS did not respond to a request for comment on Walmart’s legal move.Walmart’s suit said Mr Mullany, whose regional responsibilities covered Chicago, New York and the US northeast, was the “executive sponsor” of Walmart’s plans to develop new small format stores of between 10,000 and 20,000 sq ft, as it pursues growth in urban areas.“Mullany was the executive sponsor of Walmart’s ‘smaller-format’ strategy, and was intimately involved in all facets of Walmart’s pilot ‘smaller-format’ programme, including merchandising, store layout, pricing strategies, and real estate issues, as well as plans to roll out Walmart’s ‘smaller-format’ plan on a larger scale,” the complaint says.Walmart has not given any details of its new smaller format stores, although Wall Street analysts believe it is looking at a model that would include a pharmacy, which would intensify its battle with CVS’s neighbourhood drug stores.The suit, filed before the court of chancery in Delaware, seeks an immediate injunction that would prevent Mr Mullany from starting work at CVS next week.Mr Mullany joined Walmart in 2006. From 1988 to 2002 he held senior management positions at Genuardi’s, the Philadelphia based supermarket chain now owned by Safeway.
97;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-11-03T20:59:10Z;US stocks rise in choppy trading;;"The financial sector helped US stocks edge higher in choppy trading after the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would embark on a second round of quantitative easing.Stocks see-sawed after the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said it planned to buy $600bn of bonds, more than the $500bn forecast, by the middle of next year. The purchases will be spread out and the pace will be adjusted if needed.“I think the market is struggling with what to make of it,” said Dan Cook, chief executive of IG Markets. “It had it priced in pretty well at $500bn- $1,000bn and between the FOMC and the Federal Reserve of New York, the total is $850bn-$900bn.“I think we could see a good week or two of softness. A healthy retracement would not be a bad thing.”However, Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management, said in the longer term financials, housing and the automotive sectors stood to do well out of the increased liquidity from quantitative easing, and the consumer discretionary sector could rise on hopes for economic growth.The S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,197.96, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,1215.13 and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3 per cent higher at 2,540.27.The S&P 500 financials index gained 1 per cent, with Bank of America adding 1.1 per cent to $11.52, AIG gaining 3.4 per cent to $43.57 and Morgan Stanley surging 3.2 per cent to $25.40.Before the Federal Reserve’s announcement, investors shrugged off a Republican victory in the midterm elections, widely predicted to buoy markets in the longer term.Analysts at JPMorgan said healthcare, financials and technology stood to benefit most from the Republican victory in the House because reforms of healthcare and finance could be implemented in a more lenient way, and technology could benefit from the extension of the tax cuts of former president George W. Bush. They said alternative energy stocks could suffer.Elsewhere, the earnings season pressed on in a bumper week of results for the healthcare sector.WellPoint, the US health insurer with the most customers, raised its earnings forecast as it became the latest insurer to report reduced costs as people shy away from non-essential procedures.Sales fell but Angela Braly, chief executive, said that enrolment would increase “slightly” next year. The shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $56.05.Profit at Aetna, another health insurer, jumped 52 per cent and the company also raised its full-year guidance. Its shares rose
2.9 per cent to $30.84.CVS Caremark rose 1.1 per cent to $30.87 after reporting its quarterly results. The largest provider of prescription drugs in the US said profit fell 20 per cent, missing analyst estimates, after lower sales in its pharmacy benefits management division.Time Warner beat analyst expectations and raised its forecast for the full year. An advertising recovery helped buoy profits at the owner of cable networks, including CNN and TNT, and magazines such as Time and People.Revenue from Warner Brothers was flat as strong sales for the film Inception were outweighed by a more tepid reception for last year’s The Hangover and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In spite of this, shares in Time Warner slid 1.1 per cent to $32.07.Molson Coors reported a stronger quarterly profit, helped by higher beer prices and cost savings. The brewer, which makes Coors Light and Blue Moon beers, rose 3.9 per cent to $49.08. MillerCoors, the company’s joint venture with SABMiller, said net income rose 37 per cent in the third quarter, also helped by prices offsetting soft volumes in the US market.In financials, insurer Hartford Financial Services Group raised its profit
estimate for this year after it focused on its core markets. The insurer also benefited from impairments and losses in its investment portfolio returning to pre-crisis levels. Its shares soared 9.2 per cent to $25.57.Homebuilder Pulte Group sunk 7.7 per cent to $7.45 after it reported a wider-than-expected loss."
98;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CVS fined $75m over sale of methamphetamine component;;CVS, the largest US pharmaceutical chain, agreed to a $75m fine to settle allegations by the Department of Justice that it unlawfully sold a key component of methamphetamine to drug traffickers.The fine, along with an agreement to forfeit $2.6m in additional profits, represents the largest penalty in history against a company for violations under the Controlled Substances Act.According to the DoJ, CVS sold large quantities of pseudoephedrine to drug traffickers in southern California, leading to a direct increase in methamphetamine production in the state. The company changed its sales practices only after it became aware of the DoJ investigation.Thomas Ryan, the chairman and chief executive of CVS Caremark, which owns the chain, said in a statement that the allegations stemmed from an unfortunate breakdown in the company’s normally high management standards.“While this lapse occurred in 2007 and 2008 and has been addressed, it was an unacceptable breach of the company’s policies and was totally inconsistent with our values. CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its support of the measures taken by the federal government and the states to prevent drug abuse,” he said.Prosecutors said that their probe into CVS uncovered “thousands” of violations of a 2005 law that limited the amount of pseudoephedrine that a customer could purchase in one day. CVS was singled out by so-called “smurfers”, who sought out the ingredient at drug stores, after it became clear that, unlike other large retail chains, it allowed customers to purchase amounts of the ingredient that exceeded federal limits. The drive to CVS allegedly increased dramatically after mid-2007, when Mexico banned the sale of pseudoephedrine, which can be found in cough medicines.The smurfers frequented CVS stores in California and, later, Las Vegas, sometimes clearing out store shelves. For more than a year, the DoJ said, CVS failed to change its sales practices to prevent the drug trade.The company said that the lapses occurred because of the flawed implementation of an electronic monitoring system that was meant to record sales of the ingredient, but failed. It said that this left CVS pharmacies “vulnerable to criminals who intended to purchase large amounts” of pseudoephedrine.Under the terms of the agreement with CVS, the DoJ agreed not to pursue criminal charges. In exchange, the DoJ said CVS had accepted responsibility for illegal conduct and would implement a compliance and ethics programme for three years and a separate compliance programme with the Drug Enforcement Agency for five years.“CVS knew it had a duty to prevent methamphetamine trafficking, but it failed to take steps to control the sale of a regulated drug used by methamphetamine cooks as an essential ingredient for the poisonous stew,” said Andre Birotte, US attorney for the central district of California.
99;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-09-28T20:58:16Z;Consumer goods help US stocks shake off data;;US shares edged higher, led by healthcare and consumer staples stocks, in spite of data showing consumer confidence fell to its lowest for seven months in September.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,147.70, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 10,858.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent lower at 2,379.59.Consumer confidence was worse than forecast, falling to 48.5 in September from 53.2 the month before. Economists had forecast a decline to 52.1.“Consumer confidence is being sapped by high unemployment, rising gasoline prices, low equity prices and now a renewed decline in house prices,” said Paul Dales, US economist for Capital Economics.“This all suggests that the outlook for consumption growth remains ominous.”Shares sunk after the number was released, but later rebounded. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.8 per cent, with the retail sector gaining 0.9 per cent.The index of consumer staples stocks added 0.8 per cent, benefiting from strong earnings from Walgreen, the largest US pharmacy chain, which beat expectations in its fourth quarter.Earnings per share were 49 cents, above the average estimate of 44 cents as revenue soared 7.4 per cent to $16.8bn. The retailer sold more prescription drugs, up by 1.6 per cent at stores open for more than a year.Shares in Walgreen jumped 11.4 per cent to $33.81.Last week, competitor Rite Aid suffered after it posted a loss and lowered its forecast for the full year. Rite Aid nudged higher by a fraction to 94 cents after Walgreen’s earnings, losing 0.3 per cent to 94 cents but CVS Caremark, which owns another pharmacy chain, climbed 2.7 per cent to $31.45.The healthcare sector rose 0.9 per cent with medical devices companies leading the risers. Boston Scientific gained 7.9 per cent to $6.18 and CR Bard added 2 per cent to $81.56.US-listed shares in BlackBerry maker Research in Motion lost 3 per cent to $46.91 after it unveiled its rival to the iPad, the BlackBerry Playbook.The tablet computer, which is aimed at its core business customers, will have a limited launch in October with a general release scheduled for January 2011.In early trading, shares in Apple fell 5.6 per cent after speculation that the number two at the company, Tim Cook, could leave to become chief executive at Hewlett-Packard. Although the companies would not comment, analysts quickly dismissed the idea and shares pared their losses to close down 1.5 per cent to $286.86.Hewlett-Packard climbed 0.9 per cent to $41.61 but elsewhere in the technology sector Google lost 0.6 per cent to $527.17, Cisco fell 1.1 per cent to $21.86 and Microsoft declined 0.2 per cent to $24.68.Before the opening bell, the S&P/Case-Shiller index showed house prices stabilising near their lows after the withdrawal of the homebuyer tax credit in April.On a seasonally adjusted basis, prices fell in line with economist expectations by 0.1 per cent in July.The homebuilders sector rose 1.6 per cent with DR Horton adding 2 per cent to $11.26 and Toll Brothers higher by 1.7 per cent to $19.09.But Pulte Homes climbed 1.5 per cent to $8.85 after Goldman Sachs upgraded it from “sell” to “neutral” partly because of debt purchases and cost-cutting.In contrast, Goldman Sachs cut KB Home from “neutral” to “sell” and reduced its price target. The Californian builder is focused on first-time buyers and suffered a 39 per cent drop in orders after the tax credit expired. Shares in KB Home dropped 1.8 per cent to $11.73.In deals news, Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings surged 8.1 per cent to $33.10 after it said it will buy privately owned generic drug manufacturer Qualitest Pharmaceuticals for about $1.2bn. The acquisition should help it cover the fall in revenue expected when the patent on its pain drug Lidoderm expires.Barnes & Noble shareholders voted for a slate proposed by Leonard Riggio, the chairman, instead of a group backed by investor Ron Burkle, ending a battle between the top two shareholders. Shares rose 0.2 per cent to $16.49.
100;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Floating asset values might sink market;;The fight against moving to a floating net asset value for US money market funds is gathering strength. Four large business groups last month sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, urging them to reject the idea of a floating NAV.The US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Corporate Treasurers, the Association for Financial Professionals, and Financial Executives International said in their July 21 letter that, if regulators were to do away with money funds’ stable $1 NAV, the expected flight of investors from such funds would “severely impair the ability of companies to raise capital in the US and undermine efforts to strengthen the American economy”.The groups were joined in the letter by more than half a dozen large companies, including Comcast, CVS Caremark and Safeway.Paul Schott Stevens, president and chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade body, referred to the letter last week in his opening address to Crane’s Money Fund Symposium in Boston. “At ICI, we have been making this case [against a floating NAV] to anyone who will listen and urging users of money market funds and issuers in the money markets to speak out,” he said. “And I’m pleased to report that they are responding.”Mr Stevens said that more than 40 companies either signed the recent letter or others that ask the president’s working group to drop the idea. Issuance of the president’s working group report has been delayed, and Mr Stevens said it was unclear when it would be released.The SEC, which is also waiting to see the working group’s views on this issue, has said that mandating a floating NAV is a possibility within its second round of rule making to reform the regulatory structure for money funds. (Its first round was finalised earlier this year.) The agency views the floating NAV as a way for money funds to reduce systemic risk.The ICI has repeatedly voiced its opposition, and Mr Stevens sought to make the case in his speech, in front of more than 300 conference delegates, that both retail and institutional investors have voted with their feet for a stable NAV.“For almost a year, taxable money market funds have paid their investors an average yield of less than one tenth of 1 per cent. Yet at the end of May, investors still had $2,500bn [£1,603bn, €1,923bn] invested in taxable money market funds. That compares with just $200bn in higher-yielding short-term bond funds, whose share prices vary day to day,” he said.Mr Stevens also noted that the American Bankers Association supports the ICI’s position with respect to the stable NAV.“Banks don’t want large institutional deposits,” he said. “In fact, banks now ‘sweep’ institutional deposits off their books and into money market funds and other short-term instruments so that the banks can avoid carrying large demand balances.“Wiping out stable value money market funds won’t make banks any more eager to assume those liabilities.”Indeed, the four groups that sent the letter to the SEC and Mr Geithner say there are “no immediate substitutes” for money market funds. They note that unregulated private pools of assets might be a possibility but that encouraging investors to move money into these vehicles does not seem consistent with efforts to reduce risk.Mr Stevens said private investment vehicles are already drawing institutional dollars out of money market funds.He also called attention to the positive impact the SEC’s new rules for money funds are already having. As an example, he said that last December, 15 per cent of taxable money market funds had a weighted average maturity longer than 60 days. By May, he said, that was down to 2 per cent of these funds. He noted that this was before the rule amendments requiring shorter maturities had entirely kicked in.During his speech, Mr Stevens also briefly described the ICI’s work with the industry to create a liquidity backstop for prime money market funds – another means, it says, of reducing risk within the money fund industry – but he did not provide any new details on the facility and whether it will actually be created.He said as well that the ICI will work with the SEC to create an appropriate standard of creditworthiness for money market fund instruments that complies with the new Dodd-Frank legislation.Beagan Wilcox Volz is associate editor at Ignites.com, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
101;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-07-28T21:00:03Z;Wall St falls on durable goods data and poor forecasts;;US equities fell on Wednesday after lower-than-expected orders for durable goods, a mixed picture from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book and cautious outlooks from Boeing and ArcelorMittal weighed on market sentiment.The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent at 1,106.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,497.88 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower to close at 2,264.56.Before the opening bell, data showing unexpectedly low orders for durable goods added to concerns that economic growth may have slowed in the second quarter. New orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods dropped 1 per cent in June after a revised 0.8 per cent fall in May, making the decline the largest since last August. Analysts had expected orders to rise 1 per cent.But the markets did not fall any further when the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book was released later in the day. The Book, which is a wider survey of business, said that the US economy was growing but that there were signs of a slowdown in some regions over the past two months.The S&P has hovered around its 200-day moving average for a third session in a row. Ray Velazquez, managing director of Mizuho Securities, said that in spite of a better than expected earnings season stocks would trade in a tight range for the next quarter or two. He said concerns about the economy meant investors would pay little attention to a stock’s fundamentals until unemployment came down.Both Boeing and ArcelorMittal beat expectations in the second quarter but were cautious about the rest of the year.Boeing reported a second-quarter net profit of $1.06 per share, beating the forecast of $1.01 per share. But the aircraft manufacturer said its profit outlook was lower than analysts’ consensus. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $67.32.US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal fell 2.8 per cent to $31.11 after it was also cautious about its outlook, warning that the combination of slowing growth in China, a seasonal drop in activity and higher raw material costs would push down third-quarter earnings by up to 30 per cent.The world’s biggest steelmaker beat expectations in its second quarter, with net income at $1.7bn, after a loss of $792m for the same quarter of last year.Century Aluminum plummeted 9.3 per cent to $9.57 after it reported lower-than-expected net earnings of $5.1m for the second quarter, which were helped by a gain on forward contracts.Some companies did rise after reporting earnings, with Sprint Nextel nudging up 0.2 per cent to $4.84. The US mobile phone carrier said its net loss had widened to $760m, or 25 cents a share, from $384m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. But fewer monthly bill-paying customers left than analysts had expected.The world’s largest commercial real estate broker, CB Richard Ellis Group, jumped 7.6 per cent to $16.58 after it moved into the black and reported its strongest revenue growth since 2007. It announced earnings of 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of 2 cents per share a year ago.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group , was flat at $54.44. It reported better than expected profit for the quarter and said it would sell its stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest independent oil company.Shares in CVS Caremark, the largest US provider of prescription drugs, rose 3.1 per cent to $31.54 after the company signed a 12-year contract with Aetna, the health insurer, and in spite of it lowering its forecasts. For the full year, earnings excluding some items will be at least $2.68 a share, compared with an earlier minimum of $2.77.Comcast shares rose 1.2 per cent to $19.56 after it reported a better than expected 6 per cent rise in quarterly revenue. But the cable company’s profit was cut by fees paid as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal, falling to $884m compared with $967m for the same period a year before.In deal news, American Oil & Gas gained 6.3 per cent to $7.11. Hess Corporation will acquire the oil and gas exploration and development company.
102;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-06-22T21:11:20Z;US housebuilders hit by weak home sales;;US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as worse-than-expected existing home sales figures set a bearish tone to the session, with the energy sector perfoming worst.Existing home sales, measuring contracts closed during the month, fell 2.2 per cent last month while analysts expected a 7.5 per cent rise.Sales in June were expected to be higher as potential buyers hurried to close on contracts before the expiration of the homebuyer credit.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, expects the market to remain in a tight trading range for the next couple of days in the absence of macroeconomic data to trigger a large move.He added: “There will be more focus on the value of the yuan in the coming days, but the market will be more focused on the path of profit growth into the release of earnings mid July.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.6 per cent to 1,095.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4 per cent to 10,293.52 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,261.80.The weak housing data weighed on homebuilder stocks. Pulte Group was down 3.2 per cent to $8.86, Toll Brothers fell 3.2 per cent to $17.06 and DR Horton lost 3 per cent to $10.22. Home Depot, a home improvement retail chain, dropped 2.6 per cent to $30.61.Walgreen lost 6.5 per cent to $28.17 as the drugstore chain posted a fiscal third-quarter profit of 53 cents per share excluding some items, falling short of the 58 cent per share average analyst estimate.Rival Rite Aid fell 2.9 per cent to $1.01 and CVS Caremark declined 1.2 per cent to $31.40.Intel fell 1 per cent to $20.98 even as the company and the Federal Trade Commission indicated that they may soon reach an out-of-court settlement on an antitrust case, filing a joint motion to suspend administrative trial proceedings until July 22.If the agreement is accepted, it will head off a September trial that would have likely put the spotlight on Intel’s relationships with Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.Apple led the technology stocks higher as the company announced that it had sold 3m iPads in 80 days, sending its stock 1.4 per cent higher to $273.85.The stock’s target price estimate was raised to $375 from $350 at Deutsche Bank. The broker said that demand for iPhones and iPods had exceeded its expectations.Petsmart was 0.4 per cent lower at $31.55 as the pet-store chain announced plans to buy back $400m worth of its shares. It will also increase its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share from 10 cents per share.Patriot Coal Corp lost 16.8 per cent to $13.48 as the coal producer said it is permanently closing its Harris Number 1 mine near Wharton, West Virginia.US-listed shares in Carnival Corp dropped 4.5 per cent to $33.19 as the cruise ship operator said third-quarter earnings would be as low as $1.43 per share. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $1.51 per share.The company’s second-quarter results beat its prior forecasts, with net income of 32 cents per share, against 33 cents per share a year ago. It predicted in March second-quarter earnings would be between 26 and 30 cents.Jefferies Group rose 5.7 per cent to $24.17 after the New York-based securities firm that specialises in mid-sized companies posted second-quarter net income of $85m, or 41 cents per share. The consensus was for a profit of 34 cents a share.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, fell 3 per cent to $64.11 even as James Owens, its chief executive, said its revenue would increase 25 per cent this year. The company also expected its exports to jump 65 per cent.Analysts said that the stock had risen 17.6 per cent over the past two weeks, suggesting that the good news was priced in.Big Lots, a close-out retail chain, was down 8 per cent to $31.56 after the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan.Rival discounter Family Dollar Stores declined 1.5 per cent to $38.45.
103;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-06-17T20:02:54Z;US companies tap cash piles for share buy-backs;;US companies are signalling a desire to buy back their own shares at the highest rate in months as record levels of cash pile up on balance sheets.Companies announced 27 new buy-back programmes last week totalling $18.5bn (€14.9bn), the most since February, according to data from TrimTabs. Walmart alone announced a $15bn plan, which included $4.7bn from a previous programme.“We’ve seen a pretty big decline in share price, so companies are trying to prop them up, and these announcements are one way they can do that,” said David Santschi, an analyst at TrimTabs. “The spike is highly unusual for June, which is not an earnings announcement month. That’s a bullish sign.”So far in 2010 there have been 343 new authorisations for $178bn in buy-backs, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If carried out, and projected over a full year, it would be the highest volume since 2007, or $898bn. Last year, there were only $128bn-worth of buy-backs. Other US companies announcing $1bn-plus buy-backs in June were CVS Caremark, Viacom and Monsanto.Companies so far in 2010 have been cautiously exercising their right to buy shares. They are keen to maintain a large cushion, as rating agencies are closely watching cash balances as credit markets tighten.Jonathan Golub, an equity strategist at UBS, said that while the “absolute level of buy-backs will grow, relative to cash generation, the growth will be disappointing”.Share purchases per day are estimated to still be well below 2007’s peak of $3.2bn. Buy-backs represented only 34 per cent of company cash in the first quarter of 2010, the lowest level in a decade, according to UBS.“If the pressure from shareholders and analysts wasn’t there, companies would continue to squirrel away cash until there’s a clearer picture,” said Michael Thompson, managing director at S&P Valuation and Risk Strategies.Cash available for buy-backs is at all-time highs as companies have cut costs and allowed inventories to shrink. The Federal Reserve last week reported that US companies, excluding financials, hold $1,840bn in cash, the highest level as a percentage of assets since the 1960s.Share buybacks remain the preferred way to return that cash to shareholders, because they are more flexible than dividends, which must be paid regularly, and are typically better received by investors than acqusitions.“Buybacks are a signal that management is being cautious with its capital, not squandering it on empire building,” said Brad Thompson, fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors.Share buybacks also help to boost earnings per share, which are a key determinant of executive pay, by reducing shares outstanding.Companies are not at the point of borrowing to finance share repurchases, as was common in 2007. In that year, payouts represented more than 100 per cent of balance sheet cash, according to UBS.“Companies are not bearish, but not dramatically bullish like they were at the market peak,” said Chip Gibbs, managing director in equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Issuance of new shares has meanwhile remained depressed, which in theory makes share buybacks more effective at increasing demand for shares, and thus price. While buybacks were peaking last week, there was only one IPO from May 19 to June 10.
104;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-06-15T23:01:42Z;Walmart extends its banking interests;;Walmart has taken an equity stake in a rapidly expanding US financial company, in a move that may also give the largest US retailer an indirect link to a small commercial bank.Green Dot, which provides support for Walmart’s pre-paid cards, said this month that it had issued more than 2m shares to Walmart, following an agreement in May that extended the existing alliance between the companies until 2015.Green Dot is also seeking federal and state approval to acquire its own bank, having reached agreement in February to acquire Bonneville Bank, a small Utah-based commercial bank, for $15.7m.The company said in a regulatory filing that it expected to focus the bank on issuing its cards, “and initially, on a pilot basis, savings accounts to our core customer base”.Walmart abandoned a bid to acquire a banking licence in 2007, amid a storm of opposition from the banking industry and political opponents. It has subsequently focused on developing financial services with partners including Green Dot.The holding will give Walmart less than 1 per cent of Green Dot’s voting shares after a planned initial public offering by the pre-paid operator that is expected to raise up to $150m, according to regulatory filings.The stake reflects the growing importance of Walmart’s pre-paid, reloadable MoneyCard business, which it uses largely to build customer loyalty among its primarily low-income core customers, many of whom lack bank accounts.The cards, issued by GE Money’s bank and launched in June 2007, are linked to Green Dot’s internet-based network. Customers can use the network to add cash to their cards, which they can then use for card-based purchases, without the risks of crime or loss associated with cash.The retailer also now uses direct deposits to the pre-paid cards, rather than cheques, to deliver weekly wages to more than 90 per cent of its 1.4m employees.Walmart does not give financial details of its financial services business. But it said this month that “billions of dollars” had been loaded on to its prepaid cards since the launch.Green Dot said in a regulatory filing this month that its card business through Walmart accounted for 63 per cent of its $92.8m in revenues in its most recent quarter. It said it had about 3.4m active cards.Its Walmart business doubled in size in its second full year of operation, to $131m, and was growing in the eight months ending March 30 at a rate of about 50 per cent.
105;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;CVS and Walgreens;US pharmacy chain battle is an expensive and destructive drug war;Drug wars are expensive and destructive, and the escalating battle between America’s largest pharmacy chains, Walgreens and CVS Caremark, is no exception. Indeed the pertinent question now is which company has done itself greater damage?The fight stems from CVS’ dual role as pharmacist and pharmacy benefit manager since a 2007 merger with Caremark. PBMs administer prescription drug plans for employers and insurers, and the rationale for integration is to take a greater share of the healthcare services market. But Walgreens, reacting to changes by CVS at the PBM level designed to steer business away from its stores, indicated on Monday it would not participate in new or renewed CVS-run prescription plans. On Wednesday CVS responded by cutting its rival out entirely.The consequences for Walgreens are immediate and sizeable. CVS prescriptions alone contribute 7 per cent of sales, and the loss will also mean fewer customers throwing shampoos and snacks into their baskets when collecting medication. However, the drug store chain’s shares have already lost a fifth of their value in the past month, and an (admittedly unlikely) happy resolution could ultimately see it win pricing concessions.For CVS the implications are more fundamental, though. The move brings into question the very logic of its combined business model. Walgreens operates one in five US pharmacies, and the loss of that distribution will at the very least cause CVS clients to demand price cuts at contract renewal time. At worst, it may prompt large corporate customers to defect to rivals such as Medco and Express Scripts. Big cancellations could cause investors to treat the PBM business – already valued at about a 40 per cent discount to peer multiples, estimates Morgan Stanley – as a declining asset. Another reminder that when it comes to mergers with potential conflicts, shareholders should just say no.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
106;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-06-09T23:06:41Z;CVS steps up battle with rival drugstore;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and benefits management company, on Wednesday hit back at its rival Walgreens in an escalating war between the two largest US drugstore chains over their multibillion-dollar prescription drug sales.CVS said that members of its Caremark benefit plans would no longer be able to fill discounted prescriptions at Walgreens, taking away a business that directly accounted for 7 per cent of its rival’s annual revenues of $63bn last year.Walgreens said on Monday that it would no longer participate in new or renewed plans developed by CVS Caremark, in a challenge to the three-year-old $26bn merger of CVS’s drugstores and Caremark’s prescription benefit manager (PBM) business.It accused CVS of using Caremark to steer business to its own stores and mail order service.PBMs such as Caremark, Medco and Express Scripts negotiate bulk drug discounts and process payments on behalf of employers and insurance schemes.CVS Caremark yesterday again accused Walgreens of a “transparent attempt to try to raise the pharmacy reimbursement rates it receives” when it fills prescriptions.It also argued that its retaliatory move, which takes effect in 30 days, would not hurt the attractiveness of its PBM.CVS Caremark said its network had 57,000 participating pharmacies without Walgreens and only 0.2 per cent of its members would now have to travel more than three miles to find a participating drugstore.The battle comes at a time when the competition implications of the CVS Caremark merger are under investigation by 24 states, and by the Federal Trade Commission.The deal has also faced bitter complaints from independent pharmacy operators.The conflict highlights the changing dynamics of the retail prescription industry, with pharmacy chains exploring different tactics to steer prescription business to their stores and to compete with low cost mail order services.Both Walgreens and Walmart, the discounter, have been working on preferential drug plan arrangements, developed under a new direct-to-employer plan now used by Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment manufacturer.Walgreens is particularly unhappy with CVS Caremark’s Maintenance Choice prescription plan for chronic ailments, under which patients are required to use either its own stores, or use mail order.In an interview with the Financial Times, Greg Wasson, chief executive of Walgreens, said the plan was “a restrictive network that prevents patients from being able to use their pharmacist”.“And one patient that has known our Walgreens pharmacists for years and can no longer use them is more than enough for me.” He declined to estimate the impact of the lost business on Walgreens’ non-pharmacy sales.Carol Levenson, analyst at Gimme Credit, the bond research firm, said in a note to clients that “common sense says that the two need to reach some kind of agreement” in what she characterised as a contract negotiation over reimbursement rates that has come into the open.
107;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Walgreens hits out at CVS Caremark;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and benefits company created out of a $26bn merger in 2007, has been hit by a new challenge to its already controversial business model after one of its main rivals accused it of “unacceptable business practices”.Walgreens, whose pharmacies meet more than 20 per cent of all prescriptions issued in the US, said on Monday it would no longer take part in new or renewed prescription plans operated by CVS Caremark on behalf of large employers and insurers.CVS Caremark’s prescription benefit management (PBM) business is one of the largest in the US. PBMs negotiate lower prices on bulk purchases of prescription drugs, and arrange for payment of the pharmacies that fulfil the discounted prescriptions for individual employees and retirees.Kermit Crawford, head of Walgreens’ pharmacy operations, said the company had “reached a point where participation in future CVS Caremark plans no longer makes sense for us”. The existing business with CVS Caremark accounts for about 7 per cent of Walgreens’ $63bn sales.Walgreens argued that CVS was promoting long-term drug plans “requiring patients with chronic conditions in many plans to use CVS pharmacies or Caremark mail service facilities for their prescriptions instead of Walgreens”.It also complained that it was being given insufficient information about the terms of new PBM agreements, making it difficult to assess its participation, and cited “the growing unpredictability” of reimbursement rates for prescriptions filled by Walgreens.CVS Caremark said that it was “surprised and disappointed” by Walgreens’ move, which it said was “a transparent effort” to raise the reimbursement payments it received from filling CVS Caremark plan prescriptions.Adam Fein, an expert on pharmacy distribution at Pembroke Consulting, noted that the move came in the midst of the annual season of renegotiations between employers and their PBMs.“Walgreens has strategically timed the move to cause the maximum disruption for CVS Caremark,” he said.Mr Fein also argued that the move highlighted the tensions inherent in the CVS Caremark combination, and increased the likelihood that a new management team at CVS might opt to spin off Caremark.
108;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Wall Street at November low as selling accelerates late on;;"US stocks closed at their lowest level since last November on Monday as Friday’s sell-off continued, and accelerated in the last hour of the session.A range of factors continued to dampen investor risk appetite, including geopolitical pressures in Europe and Asia, uncertainty regarding financial reform legislation and the economic impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of MexicoRyan Detrick, senior technical analyst with Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “Today we saw another late-in-the-day sell-off. It shows there is very little confidence and people don’t want to hold stocks overnight.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.4 per cent to 1,050.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.2 per cent to 9,816.49 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 2 per cent to 2,173.90.US-listed shares in BP were 1.1 per cent lower at $36.76.The stock was cut from “buy” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, which said that the oil group was not only facing heavy legal and clean-up costs but would have its ability to do business and compete as an operator in the region affected.BP said it was capturing about 10,500 barrels per day of crude oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico from a damaged rig and expected to increase that over the next few days.Transocean, a deep-water driller and owner of the oil rig, was down 2.1 per cent to $49.17, and Halliburton, a contractor on the rig, pulled back 1.3 per cent to $22.80.National Oilwell Varco rallied 1 per cent to $35 as the maker of oil and gas drilling equipment was upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” at Credit Suisse with a target price of $49 per share. The broker said the stock was “a more defensive name for the current environment with lower near-term earnings exposure to the Gulf of Mexico and [the] valuation has become more attractive on the group sell-off”.AIG lost 1.9 per cent to $34.08 on reports that AIA, its Asian insurance business, may be worth only $25bn rather than the $36bn it had been seeking.The sale of the business to London listed-Prudential collapsed last week. Prudential denied weekend media reports that it was considering a renewed attempt to buy AIA.Insurance broker Marsh & McLennan dropped 2 per cent to $20.57 after the company said it planned to sell its Kroll unit, a security consulting business, for $1.13bn to Altegrity, a buy-out group. “Our long-term strategy is to focus on the risk and insurance services and consulting businesses,” the company said.Apple fell 2 per cent to $250.94 on the day it launched its fourth-generation iPhone at an investors’ conference in San Francisco.Talecris Biotherapeutics, a maker of protein therapies, jumped 25.7 per cent to $20.01 after Grifols, Europe’s largest maker of blood plasma products, agreed to buy it for $4bn.The deal will help Grifols expand its share to almost a third of the US market.Bristol-Myers Squibb was among the session’s best performers as it rose 6.3 per cent to $23.86 after the New York drugmaker was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” at Goldman Sachs.Drugstore chain CVS Caremark was among the session’s biggest fallers as it dropped 8.1 per cent to $31.04 after Walgreen, the largest US drugstore chain, said it would stop its participation in new prescription drug plans awarded to CVS.New participants in such plans will no longer be able to get prescriptions filled at Walgreen stores. Shares in Walgreen pulled back 2.7 per cent to $30.Goldman Sachs was 2.5 per cent lower to $138.68 after the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a government body, issued the bank with a subpoena for failing to comply with a request for documents and interviews in what it considered a timely manner.The industrials sector was the session’s worst performer as doubts about the strength of the global economic recovery persisted.First Solar, which makes solar modules, lost 4.4 per cent to $104.98; Deere & Co, a maker of agriculture equipment, fell 3.7 per cent to $54.78; and Goodrich, a supplier of aerospace components, declined 4.4 per cent to $63.80."
109;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
110;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-05-19T17:47:08Z;P&G goes online to compete for sales;;Procter & Gamble has started to sell brands direct to US consumers online for the first time, in a sign of how digital commerce is shaking up relations between retailers and their suppliers.The launch of P&G’s “eStore” site is part of the company’s drive to increase its total online sales. Such sales through retailers accounted last year for less than 1 per cent of its revenues of $79bn. The site will sell Pantene shampoo, Pampers baby products, Gillette razors and other brands.The eStore, which will also offer CoverGirl cosmetics, Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, brings P&G into direct competition with e-commerce sites run by its retailer customers, including Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens.It will compete as well with a growing number of online-only retailers that show consumers are happy to buy items such as nappies and washing up liquid online, including Amazon, Drugstore.com and Diapers.com.P&G, the world’s largest consumer goods company, argues that the initiative represents a direct challenge for retailers, describing it as a “living learning lab” that will “help us listen, learn and collaborate with online shoppers”.Kirk Perry, vice-president of its North America operations, said the site “will help deliver new tools, services and features that can ultimately be shared with retailers” to the benefit of shoppers.However, Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief executive, has been more explicit than his predecessor, AG Lafley, in focusing on online sales, telling the Financial Times in an interview late last year: “I don’t feel the need to have every sale go through a retailer.“We want to maximise our sales through retailers but we also want to be where the consumer wants to shop,” he said.P&G said the site would also support online brand building through social networks, such as Facebook. The Facebook page of Pantene is currently using the eStore site to offer its more than 300,000 fans the opportunity to buy promotional bundles of its products.A number of other leading US consumer brands have also begun setting up e-commerce operations with Alice.com, which allows customers to amalgamate shopping for household and personal-care brands.Mark McGuire, president of Alice, said the company had more than 30 brand “store front” sites already running, with another 50 or so under development. “ We are seeing a huge wave of these in the last few months, of consumer companies saying they want to go direct to consumers, and a lot of that is about what P&G is doing.”

But ultimately Germany and the others won’t allow the situation to get out of control. It’s a short-term problem that will be extinguished. [The markets’ fall] is an over-reaction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 2.4 per cent at 1,173.60; the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent to 10,926.77 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3 per cent lower at 2,424.25.“There is also some concern around corporate earnings. The market has run up a lot on expectations,” Mr Neale said.“However, we’ve seen cost-cutting drive profits [in the last quarter] and many companies are still missing top-line growth. It’s not going to be enough to sustain valuations at the current levels,” he added.Pharmaceutical stocks were the day’s best performers, as investors flocked to safehavens and as two of the industry’s biggest names reported strong first-quarter results.Pfizer rallied 2.1 per cent to $17.26 as the company reported better-than- expected results for the first quarter, boosted by its recent acquisition of smaller rival Wyeth.Profit excluding some items was 60 cents per share, beating the 53 cents average analyst estimate.However, the company said the recent US healthcare bill had shaved about $56m from its revenues in the quarter.Rival Merck was also higher, rising 1.5 per cent to $35.81 as it reported first- quarter earnings that also beat estimates.However, the company’s profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago because of acquisition charges from its $41bn purchase of Schering-Plough last year, and its projected full-year earnings were below some analyst estimates. It also said that the healthcare bill will negatively impact its top line.Concerns over monetary tightening in China heavily dragged on the materials sector. Cliffs Natural Resources pulled back 7.5 per cent to $54.55, Vulcan Materials was 5.8 per cent lower at $55.50, while Titanium Metals Corpfell 6.5 per cent to $14.49.Mastercard rose 0.2 per cent to $251.25 as it said profit in the first quarter rose by 24 per cent compared with a year ago, beating analysts’ expectations as consumer spending picks up.It earned $3.46 per share, against $2.80 per share a year earlier and average analyst estimates of $3.14 per share.The Vix index, a measure of the market’s volatility, shot up 22.5 per cent to 24.73, its highest reading since early February.Pharmacy chain CVS Caremark dropped 1.6 per cent to $36.48 in spite of reporting stronger first- quarter results than analysts were expecting, helped by higher revenues and increased stocking of more profitable generic drugs.The company also raised the low end of its full-year earnings forecasts.Apple was 2.9 per cent lower to $258.68 on reports that US antitrust authorities are looking into whether the company’s licensing agreement with iPhone application developers restricts competition in the mobile device market.Blue chip technology stocks were some of the session’s greatest fallers. Microsoft declined 2.4 per cent to $30.13, Dell retreated 4.4 per cent to $15.66 and Google slipped 4.6 per cent to $506.37.Ann Taylor was up 9.3 per cent to $24.76 as the women’s clothing chain said it expects first-quarter earnings to “significantly exceed expectations” and be “substantially better” than a year earlier.However, other leading clothing retailers found themselves under pressure, with J Crew leading the pack lower, falling 4.7 per cent to $46.35. Gap was 3.9 per cent down to $24.71, Limited Brands fell 3.4 per cent to $26.87 and Abercrombie & Fitch lost 2.1 per cent to $43.74."
112;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-04-06T22:00:24Z;Two men and a baby business;Friends’ online brand with focus on delivery;When Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara launched Diapers.com, a US e-commerce website selling nappies and a few other baby products in 2005, one of the biggest challenges was getting hold of the goods. As a small, unknown start-up, says Mr Lore, “we couldn’t buy direct from the manufacturers, so we had to buy from Costco and BJ’s [the discount, bulk-sales warehouse clubs]”.The high school friends started by picking up supplies in a car, before upgrading to an open-backed truck, a van and an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. “We cleared out BJ’s stores up and down the east coast,” Mr Lore says. “The managers would ask us to leave some for the rest of their customers.”Even when sourcing from discount clubs, the high shipping costs on bulky boxes of disposable nappies meant the fledgling company was losing money when it met orders. But demand was so high that the two entrepreneurs took it as a sign that their project was going to work.They came to the venture with previous experience of launching businesses. After college, Mr Lore became a banker, working in London at Credit Suisse First Boston and at Japan’s Sanwa Bank. Mr Bharara became a lawyer with Cahill, Gordon & Reindel in New York and worked on the distribution of the $1.25bn (€935m, £820m) settlement bet­ween Swiss banks and victims of the Holocaust. But in 2000, they left their jobs to launch ThePit.com, an online marketplace for collectables, which they sold a year later to Topps, the entertainment company best known for its baseball cards. Both worked at Topps before deciding to launch another start-up.“We came across the baby market,” says Mr Lore, chief executive of Quidsi, the parent company that owns the Diapers.com site. “It was a $40bn market and incredibly fragmented online, with lots of players but no number-one brand. So we thought: ‘We need to build a brand, and not do it by beating rivals on keyword marketing [to attract internet searches].’ ”Instead, says Mr Bharara, they focused on developing “killer” backroom logistics and high levels of customer service focused on their specialised category. The plan was to attract a loyal customer base with the efficient shipping of low-margin products such as nappies and wipes, promising “fast service and no headaches”, before introducing higher margin baby products, such as cribs, strollers and carseats to an audience that would by now trust the brand.Five years on, Diapers.com is forecasting sales of about $275m in the 12 months to March, making it one of the top US “pure play” e-commerce sites not associated with a traditional retailer, and one of the fastest growing. “We think we can continue to double our sales annually for the next three to five years,” says Mr Bharara, who serves as chief operating officer of Quidsi.The company has yet to record a profit as it continues to invest heavily in marketing and expansion, although it has raised more than $50m in commitments, including $30m in a financing round last year led by New Enterprise Associates, the venture capital group. But with leading baby product brands such as Huggies and Pampers now on board – after many rebuffs including scores of frustrating phone-calls – the pair no longer have to worry about where the next nappy is coming from.Their new challenge is that the site now faces a range of competitors eager to attack its first-mover advantage. Walmart, the largest retailer, started shipping baby products from its website last year. Procter & Gambles now testing selling its Pampers brand from its own direct-shipping e-commerce site. Diapers.com’s free shipping offers are matched by CVS and Walgreens, US national drugstores.Mr Lore and Mr Bharara argue that their business has built-in strengths that will enable it to fight off rivals. Although it trawled the eastern US seaboard in a truck initially, the start-up focused on developing logistics that were low-cost and fast, enabling it to keep customers with the lure of next-day delivery in most of the US while keeping down costs.The first $4m raised from outside investors was spent on new systems – rather than marketing – including developing Boxem, a proprietary software program that calculates the most efficient of 23 available box sizes for any order. In addition, recruitment has benefited from the company being based in Montclair, New Jersey, making it one of the few e-commerce companies hiring on the east coast. It now has, for example, a disproportionate number of Harvard MBAs in top management and working in the “special ops” unit that is entirely focused on ways to improve back-office logistics.In September 2008, Diapers.com also became one of the first US retailers to switch its distribution centres to a robotic order fulfilment system developed by Kiva Systems, that is now also used by Staples, the office supplies retailer, and Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury department store.At the other end of the business, the company set up its own customer-service operation rather than subcontract it to third parties. It also hired staff, says Mr Lore, who were “empathetic” over those with experience. “They are empowered to help the customer at any cost,” he says.The company’s customer-service narrative includes an anecdote in which the associate director of customer marketing personally delivers nappies from the headquarters in New Jersey to a young mother at a hotel in Manhattan.Since 2008 the site has been making the transition from consumables, such as nappies and wipes, to include “everything baby”, with new products such as $389 jogging strollers and $229 cribs. Its product range has passed a target of 15,000 different productsand will reach 60,000 by the end of this year, with a target of 120,000 at the end of 2011 – roughly equivalent to the entire stock assortment of a Walmart superstore. They claim the site has become the biggest online seller of infant carseats and sells four times as many disposable nappies as Amazon.Although reluctant to go into detail, the two entrepreneurs are now preparing an attempt to repeat the success of Diapers.com with plans for additional sites, including a beauty and health website, which will see the number of employees double by the end of 2011 to about 600.Meanwhile, Mr Lore and Mr Bharara remain sanguine about the outlook for Diapers.com: “We don’t think anyone is going to be more effective.”
113;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-02-17T20:53:58Z;Walgreens / Duane Reade;The cost saving opportunity is significant;Selling popcorn and mouthwash at 4am should be the perfect business in the city that never sleeps. With many city blocks holding the population of a small town, it is no surprise that New York-based Duane Reade boasts the highest sales per square foot of any US drug store chain. But the company which began in 1960 between the two streets that gave it its name couldn’t make it there. Walgreens on Wednesday announced plans to snap up the 257 stores of Duane Reade for an enterprise value of $1.1bn.That price could rise if CVS, traditionally dominant in the region, were to try heading off Walgreens’ expansion into the north-east. In 2008 Walgreens lost out to its rival CVS, in a bidding war for California chain Longs. But Walgreens has far less existing overlap than CVS in New York, and the valuation of 0.6 times sales is already slightly higher than that paid for Longs.Indeed, 11 times prospective earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation might be considered a full valuation for a company with a history of operating losses, particularly as Walgreens has little experience of integrations. However, the cost saving opportunity is significant and half of $120-130m targeted annually will come from applying the buying power of Walgreens’ 7,000 stores. As the company has plenty of net cash on hand, interest payments on Duane Reade’s $475m debt could disappear at a stroke. Assume those savings are realised, and the ebitda multiple falls below Walgreen’s own valuation.So the deal looks like a good use of cash, for a company set to benefit from consumers shopping more locally and, potentially, efforts to make healthcare more efficient and accessible. Plus with the Duane Reade brand set to stay, New Yorkers can sleep soundly too.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
114;CVS;CVS Corp;2010-02-17T16:30:24Z;Walgreens to buy Duane Reade for $1.1bn;;Walgreens, the US drugstore chain, is acquiring Duane Reade, the New York retailer whose stores are an omnipresent feature of life in the city.The $1.1bn deal for 257 stores gives the Chicago-based chain the leading position in one of the largest US markets, while strengthening its position in the northeastern region that is the bastion of its national rival CVS Caremark.Previously, Walgreens had only around 70 stores in the New York area, including a flagship store in Times Square.Duane Reade is owned by affiliates of Oak Hill Partners, the private equity group. It is named after the streets in lower Manhattan where it established its first location in 1960.It has the highest sales per square foot of any retail drug store chain in the US, with total net sales of $1.8bn last year, but has been reporting net operating losses.The transaction will be Walgreen’s largest-ever acquisition. Unlike CVS, the Chicago-based chain has grown into a chain of over 7,100 stores largely through organic growth, although it entered a brief unsuccessful bidding war with CVS in 2008 over the sale of Longs, a California-based regional chain with over 500 stores.Walgreens said it would keep the Duane Reade name, but also said it will also work over time to “harmonise” the two brands.Greg Wasson, chief executive of Walgreens, said in a statement: “By combining the strengths of our two companies, we can improve our position as the most convenient provider of consumer goods and services, and pharmacy, health and wellness services in the country.”Walgreens is currently remodeling its store network to reduce its range of duplicate stock items and simplify its stores. It has also hired two former executives of Fresh & Easy, the US subsidiary of Tesco, the UK supermarket group, who are spearheading a drive to introduce ready-to-eat meals to the range of packaged groceries in its stores.The Duane Reade deal also underlines the growing competitive pressures on Rite Aid, the third of the big three national US drug store chains, which has continued to struggle since its $3.4bn acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd stores from Canada’s Jean Coutu in 2006. Rite Aid has been selling off underperforming stores and struggling with declining comparable store sales.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1 per cent to 9,908.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,126.05.Financial and materials stocks led the declines as fears over possible contagion from Greek fiscal woes distracted investors from positive quarterly results in the retail sector.“The market in the US is desperately trying to focus on earnings and fundamentals,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “But it’s being thwarted continuously by what’s going on in Europe and how the EU is trying to handle the debt crisis.”Shares in CVS Caremark climbed 5.3 per cent to $32.72 after the retail pharmacy chain beat quarterly estimates. While total revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, sales from stores open for more than a year were still higher than those at rival Walgreen.Hasbro added to the market’s gains, reporting a higher than expected quarterly profit.The toymaker said it had seen particularly strong demand for products linked to the Transformers movie. Its shares jumped 12.7 per cent to $34.71.Home Depot added 2.2 per cent to $28.59 after Morgan Stanley raised the home improvement chain to “overweight” from “equal-weight”.Analyst Gregory Melich noted improving trends in the housing market and said there was more room for margin growth than the market was currently pricing in.Meanwhile, Lowe’s, the country’s second-largest home improvement retailer, announced the opening of its first store in Mexico as part of its international expansion strategy.Shares in the group, which underperformed Home Depot by more than 10 percentage points last year, rose 0.8 per cent to $21.76.Amazon.com initially rose after analysts at Collins Stewart upgraded the internet retailer to “buy” from “hold”, noting the growth potential of the company’s electronic book business. The shares were later down 0.5 per cent at $116.83.Walt Disney also briefly benefited from an upgrade but later slipped 0.2 per cent to $29.48. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase raised the world’s largest media group to “neutral” from “underweight”.While improving economic conditions would boost revenues, Walt Disney is likely to lag behind the rest of the sector. due to challenging trends at the film studio and parks, they said.Weyerhaeuser, one of the world’s largest pulp and paper companies, was raised to “neutral” from “underperform” at Credit Suisse.The brokerage also raised its price target on the stock to $42 from $40 on the prospect of higher demand for wood in the economic recovery. Shares in the group also gave up early gains, losing 0.5 per cent to $39.25.Elsewhere, CIT Group named John Thain, the ousted head of Merrill Lynch, as its new chief executive after searching for a replacement for almost four months.Shares in the lender, which emerged from bankruptcy in December, fell 0.5 per cent to $30.61.Etrade Financial, the online share trading broker, announced that it would reduce fees for stock and option trades.Low-volume traders will have to pay $9.99 instead of $12.99 while high-volume traders will continue to pay $7.99. Shares in the group rose 1.4 per cent to $1.48.In the technology sector, Motorola climbed 2.7 per cent to $6.57. Barron’s, the US weekly financial newspaper, said shares in the communications company could rise as much as 40 per cent during the coming year if the company spins off its profitable mobile phone division.Nasdaq itself weighed heavily on the S&P 500 index, falling 4 per cent to $18.05. The owner of the second-largest US equity exchange forecast higher operating expenses for this year than analysts had been expecting.

116;CVS;CVS Corp;2009-11-05T22:10:21Z;Wall St storms ahead on productivity boost;;US stocks stormed ahead on Thursday following upbeat jobs data and a surprise jump in productivity as companies fought to boost output in the recession.The Labor Department said non-farm productivity surged to an annual rate of 9.5 per cent during the third quarter, the quickest pace since 2003.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits also dropped last week to 512,000 from a revised 532,000 in the previous week.Analysts polled by Bloomberg had been expecting initial jobless claims to only drop to 522,000.The report left investors more optimistic ahead of Friday’s key monthly employment report, which is expected to show that the unemployment rate has reached 9.9 per cent from 9.8 per cent in September.“There’s enough evidence now to show that the recession is probably over and we’re in the early stages of recovery,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers. “The jobs data was certainly not good but a lot less bad. The unemployment figure will be important too but I wouldn’t be surprised to see that tick up because it’s a lagging indicator.”The S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent higher at 1,066.63 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1 per cent to 10,005.96.Positive results boosted confidence in the technology sector, giving the Nasdaq Composite its biggest daily gain since July. The index climbed 2.4 per cent to 2,105.32.After posting a larger-than-expected quarterly profit after the closing bell on Wednesday, Cisco Systems was up 2.8 per cent at $23.93.Erik Suppiger, senior tech analyst at Signal Hill Capital Group, said: “The tech sector’s stock response, including Cisco this morning, is reflective of a broad improvement in the spending environment for networking products, in particular, and tech more broadly.”Shares in Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry group of smartphones, showed strong early gains and closed up 0.3 per cent to $57.79 after the company’s board approved a $1.2bn stock buy-back programme.Hyatt Hotels added to the market’s gains on its first day of trading.After the company priced its initial public offering at $25, within the expected range, the shares rose 12 per cent to $28.However, disappointing October sales figures from retailers initially restrained the market. The Thomson Reuters same-store sales index for October rose 1.8 per cent, slightly worse than the expected increase of 2 per cent.Of the 30 retailers surveyed, just over half missed estimates.American Eagle Outfitters, the youth fashion store, was one of the market’s biggest disappointments. After analysts had estimated October like-for-like sales would rise 1.7 per cent, they actually fell 5 per cent, sending shares down 11.6 per cent to $15.79.However, Gap shares rose 3.5 per cent to $22.86 after sales at the chain came in higher than analysts had been expecting. Like-for-like sales at the company’s namesake stores fell 6 per cent but revenue from the group’s Old Navy chain and Banana Republic chains continued to grow.Whole Foods Market, the upmarket grocer, disappointed Wall Street after the closing bell on Wednesday, warning that it would miss 2010 profit expectations.Reduced consumer spending and an ongoing price war with rivals were to blame, the group said. Its shares lost 15.5 per cent to $27.10.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy group, had initially pleased the market with a larger-than-expected quarterly profit. But on the subsequent earnings conference call, Tom Ryan, chief executive, revealed that the company had experienced some “big client losses” in its Caremark unit, which manages prescription filings.The comments added to existing concerns about CVS’s acquisition of Caremark in 2007, causing the group’s shares to plunge 20.1 per cent to $28.87.In the pharmaceutical sector, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals gained 12.8 per cent to $11.39 after the company received its first order for its influenza drug Peramivir from the US government.
117;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;CVS shares plunge after losing drug contracts;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and benefit management company, saw its shares fall more than 20 per cent on Thursday after it announced the loss of $3.7bn of prescription management contracts for 2010, and said that it has been under scrutiny by federal regulators.The company said that it had been informed in August by the Federal Trade Commission that it was the subject of a non-public investigation into some of its business practices. It said it is co-operating with the FTC but gave no further details.Several US senators and members of the House of Representatives have called on the FTC to investigate the impact on consumer health costs and service of the $26bn merger of CVS’s drugstore business and Caremark’s prescription benefit management business in 2007.A coalition of five US unions, Change to Win, has also urged federal, state and local governments to avoid doing business with Caremark, accusing it of abusing its dominant position in the market in ways that raise costs for individual consumers and jeopardise privacy. CVS has dismissed the complaints as baseless.Prescription management contracts (PBMs) reduce healthcare costs for big employers and insurance groups by negotiating discounts on bulk purchases of drugs from pharmaceutical companies and handling payment processing.CVS said that Caremark had lost contracts for 2010 worth $3.7bn during its third quarter, in addition to another $1.1bn in contracts it had lost earlier in the year.It warned that this would result in sharply lower growth and operating margins for 2010.The company said that the lost business included a $1bn contract to provide prescription management services to state employees in New Jersey, and a contract with the state of Ohio valued at $500m, which it attributed to a regulatory issue. New Jersey awarded its five-year PBM contract, worth $5.8bn, to Medco, the largest US PBM.It also lost its PBM contract to service pensioners of Chrysler, the carmaker, and with Coventry Health Care, which provides health insurance and other services. Coventry filed a lawsuit in September against CVS Caremark accusing it of overpaying claims.CVS said Howard McLure, head of the Caremark business, and a former chief operating officer at the company before the merger, was stepping down at the end of this month, with Mr Ryan taking over direct responsibility for Caremark.Mr Ryan said in August CVS would be “very disappointed” if its total per-share profit did not grow 13 to 15 per cent next year. He declined to give a revised estimate on Thursday.CVS Caremark handles more than 1bn prescriptions, and operates over 6,700 drug stores.
118;CVS;CVS Corp;2009-09-30T23:37:13Z;Lewis departure catches BofA board off guard;;Ken Lewis said that the acquisition of Merrill Lynch would be the last major purchase he ever made as chief executive of Bank of America. He was right.Last September, as the financial world reeled from the prospect of bankruptcy at Lehman Brothers, he swooped in to buy Merrill in an all-stock deal for $17bn. At a press conference the next day, he rejoiced over the potential of the combined power of his extensive banking operation and Merrill’s unparalleled network of financial advisors.Mr Lewis announced on Wednesday that he would step down from his position as chief executive of Bank of America at the end of the year. His decision follows a contentious nine months in which he battled regulators and lawmakers over the controversial takeover of Merrill, his lack of communication with shareholders and his secret December deal with the government in which he agreed to complete the Merrill purchase in return for $20bn in taxpayer funds.Mr Lewis’s announcement, at a hastily called board meeting in New York, took the directors by surprise, says Tom Ryan, chief executive of CVS, who will serve on the search committee to find Mr Lewis’s successor. For Mr Lewis, the announcement brings him full circle from the time last October when he was celebrated on the TV programme 60 Minutes as a folk hero for agreeing to buy Merrill Lynch to a political punch bag for his role in the complicated deal whereby Mr Lewis agreed to complete the Merrill acquisition only after his job was threatened by federal regulators.For Mr Lewis, it was death by a thousand cuts, as the earnings generated by BofA’s Merrill Lynch subsidiary were overwhelmed by regulatory setbacks and squabbles.The latest setback, and the one which might have been the decisive blow against his continued leadership of the bank, grew out of a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in August alleging that BofA made misleading statements to shareholders last year.In August, BofA and the SEC agreed to settle the matter, with the bank admitting no liability, for $33m. But the federal judge overseeing the matter, Jed Rakoff, blew up the deal, criticising the SEC for failing to identify which individuals were responsible for the allegedly misleading statements, and forcing the commission to prepare for a trial in the matter.In addition to the SEC inquiry, BofA has been at war with New York attorney-general Andrew Cuomo since January, after the Financial Times reported that Merrill had paid out $3.6bn in bonuses on an accelerated schedule, even as BofA was negotiating a $20bn rescue package with its regulators.In April, just before BofA’s annual shareholder meeting, Mr Cuomo issued a report suggesting that Mr Lewis and his board agreed to complete the Merrill acquisition only after former treasury secretary Hank Paulson threatened to remove him and the board if BofA tried to invoke a “material adverse change” clause to renegotiate the deal. The report and shareholder discontent were enough to cause Mr Lewis to lose a vote on whether he should be allowed to remain as chairman of BofA.
119;CVS;CVS Corp;2009-09-30T21:56:35Z;Lewis in surprise departure from BofA;;Ken Lewis, the embattled chief executive of Bank of America, is to step down in December, leaving the country’s biggest lender without a successor and capping a period of turmoil in the executive offices of leading US financial groups.Mr Lewis’ surprise departure, announced on Wednesday night, ends a turbulent eight-year tenure at BofA and comes days after Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo made sweeping changes to their top ranks.The move comes as Wall Street has rebounded from the crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year ago and ultimately led the US government to inject $45bn of taxpayer’s money into BofA.Mr Lewis and BofA have been at the centre of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the New York attorney-general, Andrew Cuomo over the bank’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch at the height of the crisis.A spokesman said Mr Lewis’ departure was not the result of regulatory action. But a BofA insider said he had been increasingly distracted by legal matters in recent months.The decision by Mr Lewis, 62, to retire at year’s end took the recently reconstituted BofA board by surprise and left it scrambling to find a successor.Despite Mr Lewis’ age and repeated hints he would step down at some point, BofA’s board did not have an immediate replacement.“This was a surprise to us”, said BofA director Thomas Ryan, chief executive of CVS/Caremark. “We have succession plans in place. We’re going to proceed with them.” Mr Ryan will be on a committee headed by BofA chairman Walter Massey to find Mr Lewis’ successor.Leading candidates include Brian Moynihan, a veteran BofA executive who heads the retail bank, Barbara Desoer, head of the mortgage operations who BofA took on following the acquisition of Countrywide last year, and Greg Curl, the chief risk officer and an instrumental figure in the Merrill purchase.Thomas Montag, the former Goldman Sachs star trader who leads the corporate and investment bank, and Sallie Krawcheck, the recently recruited head of the “thundering herd” of retail brokers, are also possibilities. Bob Steel, the former Goldman Sachs and Wachovia executive, is one of many former senior bankers who might be considered.Mr Lewis will be remembered as one of the most controversial figures of the crisis. He bought Merrill in an all-stock deal for around $17bn when it closed. The deal got mired in controversy after the government had to extend $20bn in assistance to BofA to ensure the completion of the deal.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 9,742.20 and the Nasdaq Composite, which led the previous session’s gains, edged 0.3 per cent down to 2,124.04.On Monday, Wall Street recorded its biggest daily gain for over a month after a series of merger deals boosted hopes of economic recovery.“After yesterday’s surge, that number [the consumer confidence reading] attracted some selling,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon. “But we’re at the end of the quarter and I suspect we’ll probably see the market continue its advance over the next few days.”Energy stocks dragged the market downward on Tuesday after oil prices sunk lower on a weak demand outlook. Chevron fell 1.1 per cent to $70.91 while ExxonMobil lost 0.8 per cent to $69.07.KBR, the engineering, construction and services company, gained 1.8 per cent to $23.32 after winning a contract to work on a gas project at Saudi’s Shaybah oilfield.Pharmaceuticals stocks also weighed on the Nasdaq. Repros Therapeutics dropped 13.9 per cent to 93 cents after the company said the Food and
Drug Administration requested additional data on the company’s lead drug, Proellexin, in order to resolve the clinical hold placed on it.Sequenom shocked the market by announcing that it had dismissed nearly its entire top management team as a result of a scandal involving the mishandling of data on its pre-natal Down’s syndrome test. Its shares dropped 39.2 per cent to $3.46.However, Astrotech, which owns and operates spacecraft pre-launch facilities, soared 157.5 per cent to $3.10 after saying it was considering options to boost shareholder value, including a possible sale of the company.At the same time, the Texas-based company posted a profit in the fourth quarter compared with a loss in the same period last year.Consumer stocks lifted the market from the opening bell. Walgreen, the US pharmacy chain, rose 9.2 per cent to $37.35 after the company’s quarterly results beat expectations.The company said profit had fallen, mainly due to weak sales of summer merchandise and the costs of refurbishing its stores.As part of a widescale restructuring plan, the retailer has also cut back on store openings and reduced its workforce but said the measures would take time to pay off.Some of Walgreen’s rivals also benefited from the optimism in the sector with CVS Caremark rising 3.4 per cent to $36.07.Citigroup gave a boost to carbonated soft drinks makers after saying the sector offered good opportunities for growth. Coca-Cola was rated “buy” in new coverage at the firm, which cited markedly better earnings growth in 2010. Its shares rose 0.3 per cent to $53.31.Dr Pepper Snapple Group was also rated “buy” and rose 2.9 per cent to $28.55.Polo Ralph Lauren gained 4.2 per cent to $77.38 after Goldman Sachs upgraded to “buy” and said it expected a near-term recovery to drive sales.Gannett, the largest US newspaper chain and publisher of USA Today, rose 17.6 per cent to $11.74 after forecasting third-quarter earnings above expectations.Lamar Advertising rose 6.6 per cent to $27.16 after Barclays Capital raised the billboard owner to “overweight” and raised its price estimate, saying the company had managed to contain costs."
121;CVS;CVS Corp;2009-04-13T19:23:18Z;Express Scripts buys WellPoint unit for $4.7bn;;Express Scripts said on Monday that it would buy the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business of WellPoint for $4.68bn, in a deal that will boost Express Scripts’ purchasing power by making it the second-largest US drug benefits manager in terms of prescriptions processed.Express Scripts will pay $3.28bn in cash, with the rest of the price paid in stock, to WellPoint, a top US health insurer that provides benefits under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand.As a key component of the deal, Express Scripts has secured a contract to manage the drug benefits of WellPoint’s insurance customers for 10 years. WellPoint processes prescriptions for a range of insurers, but its own customers account for most of its volume.The Financial Times reported in early March that WellPoint had set up an auction to sell the business, which is largely comprised of a unit called NextRx that processes drug claims and helps establish drug prices and availability.Express Scripts’ main competitors are a diverse group. Most other PBMs are either owned by retail pharmacies, such as CVS Caremark, Walgreen and Rite Aid, or contained within insurers including Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealth. However, Medco, its larger rival, ­operates as an independent company.Some PBMs, including Medco, were owned by large drug companies in the 1990s until questions over the propriety of such arrangements helped spur the drug giants to sell the operations.Express Scripts faced competition for the asset, said one person close to the matter, who said Medco, CVS Caremark and Walgreen were likely to have been interested. But WellPoint felt Express Scripts provided the best cultural fit for a long-term alliance and was the ideal buyer.“We think M&A opportunities often come about when you go through experiences like we are now, where there’s uncertainty,” Angela Braly, WellPoint’s chief executive, told investors and analysts on Monday, in reference to changes that may lie ahead for the US healthcare system under the new Obama administration.“We considered several PBM strategies and determined that we could provide the best long-term value to our members and our shareholders by selling our pharmacy entities [and entering an alliance with Express Scripts],” Ms Braly said.Industry dealmakers expect other insurers that own PBMs to also consider carving them out or outsourcing more of the work.WellPoint said it will use $2bn of the sale proceeds for additional share repurchases, $1.8bn to account for taxes and transaction costs, and $500m to pay down debt. It expected to book a $2.5bn gain on the sale of the asset.
122;CVS;CVS Corp;2009-03-05T01:20:02Z;WellPoint’s benefits business up for auction;;WellPoint, the second-largest US health insurer by revenue, has put its pharmacy benefits management business up for auction, say ­people familiar with the ­matter.A sale of WellPoint’s PBM business could be worth anywhere from less than $1bn to five times that amount, depending on the extent to which WellPoint and other insurers are willing to sign long-term customer contracts with any potential buyer, said one person close to the process.WellPoint, which has 35m medical members and provides insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand, says its PBM business, which includes ­NextRx, is the fourth-largest in the US.NextRx is a third-party administrator that processes prescription drug claims and helps establish drug prices and availability for more than 32m people who are insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield or other corporate and government employee health plans.The three dominant companies in prescription healthcare services – ExpressScripts, Medco and CVS Caremark – are independent, free-standing companies.Several others are embedded within managed care providers such as WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer.WellPoint paid 67.5m ­prescriptions in the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 5.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Its PBM business is likely to attract interest from CVS Caremark, Medco and ExpressScripts, and the sale process has been under way for months, according to people close to the matter.WellPoint did not have any immediate comment.Expectations have risen that insurers with in-house PBMs might consider selling them or spinning them off as the political and economic environment surrounding the healthcare industry grows more challenging.Shares of companies ranging from ceuticals groups to insurers were hit hard last week after the US government issued proposals to update Medicare payment rates and expand health coverage.The US administration’s plan to insure more Americans could reduce private insurers’ profits and spark new competition.The argument over whether insurers or big ceuticals companies should own PBM businesses, which administer their own products alongside their competitors’, raises questions about potential conflicts of interest.In the 1990s, drug companies such as Eli Lilly, which owned PCS Health, and Merck, which owned Medco, were scrutinised over whether their captive PBM businesses would be pressured to use their parent companies’ drugs.Eli Lilly sold PCS to Rite Aid in 1999 for $1.5bn, and Merck spun off Medco in 2003.WellPoint’s medical insurance enrolment dropped by 288,000 members, or 0.8 per cent, in the fourth quarter because of nationwide job losses.Even with a further increase in unemployment, WellPoint projected last week that adjusted earnings per share should increase 1-3 per cent in 2009 compared with 2008.A Wellpoint spokeswoman said the company does not comment on merger speculation, but noted the company expects further consolidation in the industry.
123;CVS;CVS Corp;2009-02-19T23:59:23Z;US bank stocks fall to 17-year low;;US banking shares hit their lowest level since 1992 on Thursday as fears mounted that the government would be forced to nationalise a key institution.Further heavy selling of key names – Bank of America and Citigroup were once again among the worst performing, down 14 per cent to $3.93 and 13.8 per cent to $2.51, respectively – helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level in six years.Shares in several regional banks also sustained heavy losses as the S&P financial index dropped 5.2 per cent to its lowest level since 1995.“Every time someone mentions the word [nationalisation] then investors shiver – and with good reason,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “There’s a lot of angst over what [US Treasury Secretary] Geithner’s going to propose.”Insurers also suffered badly after Fitch cut its ratings on the senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial to BBB and issued a negative outlook. Shares in Prudential lost 15.9 per cent to $19.02 while Hartford Financial tumbled 24.5 per cent to $7.73.Talk of stake-building helped Principal Financial buck a downward trend for much of the session a day after the insurer said that it was exploring options to raise capital. The shares succumbed late in the day, off 0.4 per cent to $10.51.Relative strength in the energy, consumer and telecoms sectors helped pare the losses in the wider market, which drifted between losses and gains in choppy trading.The S&P 500 closed down 1.2 per cent at 778.94, its fourth consecutive retreat.The S&P slumped this week beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which has prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low. The S&P index stands only 3.5 per cent away from that bottom.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.2 per cent lower at 7,465.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index 1.7 per cent weaker at 1,442.82.The tech sector shed 3.3 per cent overall in the wake of Hewlett-Packard’s results, which prompted concerns over the prospects of other computer manufacturers.Shares in HP, a bellwether for the industry, lost 7.9 per cent to $31.39 after the group missed its first-quarter sales estimates and issued a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.“We think the drivers of the revenue weakness are not isolated to HP but instead a reflection of the macro blues,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan. Dell was one of the worst hit in the fallout, off 6.1 per cent to $8.12.Elsewhere, earnings that were not quite as bad as feared gave bargain hunters at some reasons to return to other sectors.Energy stocks found positive territory after the latest government report showed an unexpected drop in crude inventories.ExxonMobil edged 0.3 per cent higher to $72.16 even though Barclays downgraded its view from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Paul Cheng, analyst, said the stock’s valuation “appears toppy” and said the group may lower its medium term production target at the forthcoming analyst meeting.Telecoms performed relatively well, lifted 1 per cent overall by a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss from Sprint Nextel. The shares leapt 19.9 per cent to $3.25 as the group also said it expected subscriber losses to improve this year.Consumer discretionaries also outperformed. Whole Foods bounced 37.2 per cent to $12.75 as its first-quarter earnings fell less than forecast. “Even with the considerable economic headwind, the company, we believe, is beginning to take the steps to reverse the decline in its operating performance,” wrote analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded their recommendation on the stock to “buy”.Video game shares did well on an upbeat forecast from GameStop, which rallied 7.1 per cent to $26.63.Meanwhile, shares in drugstore Walgreens added 0.7 per cent to $25.83 on the back of well-received results from peer CVS Caremark, which climbed 6.4 per cent to $28.71.Bucking the upward momentum in the consumer sector, however, was Expedia, which lost 7.4 per cent to $7.90 after the online travel agency disclosed worse-than-expected earnings.
124;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;A different way to outperform;;For endowment fund managers such as Michael Glickstein, it has been a nail-biting few months. Earnings at US companies have dropped for five consecutive quarters and the S&P 500 index has had its worst year since 1931.But Mr Glickstein’s fund has held up well, outperforming its industry benchmark by about 6 per cent.Mr Glickstein does not work for a big-name fund company, nor is he a professional portfolio manager. Instead, he is an MBA candidate at New York University’s Stern School of Business, enrolled in a year-long course where students manage a portion of the university’s endowment.The aim of the Michael Price Student Investment Fund (MPSIF) is to expose students to the world of money management and give them solid credentials to help them line up summer internships and jobs after graduation. Students manage a family of funds and are responsible for all activities from screening and evaluating stocks, to presenting pitches for buy and sell recommendations, to strategising cash positions.Competition to secure a spot in the 50-person class is stiff and there are always more applicants than places.“This class has given me real world context,” says Henry Barash, a second-year student who manages the value fund. “It has helped me pull everything I’ve learned at Stern together.”The funds are part of the NYU endowment and were started with a $1.8m gift from Michael Price, the investor. The fund pays an annual 5 per cent dividend to the University of Oklahoma’s Price School of Business, Mr Price’s undergraduate alma mater, which enables students there to attend summer classes at Stern.Since inception in March 2000, the Michael Price family of funds earned a cumulative return of 55.6 per cent, compared with 31.8 per cent for the industry benchmark. The fund was down about 18 per cent from September 1 to the end of November, but has outperformed its combined industry benchmarks by about 6 per cent.Richard Levich, who teaches the class, attributes this outperformance to the collaborative nature of his students’ decision-making. “I think they show a great deal of prudence, in part because all decisions on whether to buy, sell or hold are collective decisions,” he says.“The students have a natural sense of optimism about the markets and the country,” he says. “Many of them subscribe to the notion that America is still going to be an economic powerhouse in the coming decade.”The investment group does bottom-up fundamental analysis to select stocks. Some of the best recent picks include CVS Caremark, the drugstore group, which is up 26 per cent since the fund bought in.“The theme was that pharmaceutical prescriptions are more of a necessity [even in an economic downturn],” says Prof Levich. “And we may be going into a political administration where healthcare benefits are more widely available and CVS could benefit.”The turbulent markets have created many teachable moments. The most memorable, for Mr Glickstein, the fund’s president, came at the beginning of the semester.Over the summer, when the school is not in session, the fund operates using stop orders – orders to buy or sell when a specified price is reached – and limit orders – orders to buy or sell a stock at or close to a particular price – to prevent big losses and lock in profits. When students returned, the market turbulence left the fund with about one-third of its holdings in cash, which was unusually high.The question of what to do prompted vigorous debate. Some students argued that the fund ought to move into exchange-traded funds – baskets of securities that trade on an exchange like stocks – as a holding ground before buying particular equities. They referenced Warren Buffett’s attitude: “Be greedy when others are fearful.”Others felt that staying in cash was wiser. They noted that hedge funds were moving to cash and more bankruptcies were yet to come.Mr Glickstein was on the losing side of the debate – the fund stayed in cash. He is now grateful for the cautiousness of his classmates, but remains bullish about the stock market.
125;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-10-17T22:39:11Z;CVS Caremark looks set to buy Longs;;CVS Caremark looked poised on Friday to clinch its hard-fought takeover of rival Longs Drug Stores, after announcing that its $71.50-per-share tender offer had attracted more than the required two-thirds of Longs’ outstanding shares.CVS regained pole position in its bid to buy Longs last week after Walgreen, the largest US drug store operator, withdrew a higher offer for Longs.Walgreen said the sliding US economic outlook, along with concerns that a protracted battle could hurt shareholders, convinced it to drop its $75-per-share bid.Longs had steadfastly endorsed CVS’s $2.6bn offer even after Walgreen, spurred along by activist investor Bill Ackman, came forward with its $2.72bn proposal last month.California-based Longs had argued that Walgreen’s bid came with a higher antitrust risk.A range of other deals have fallen through in recent weeks.The credit markets’ rapid deterioration, which provoked governments worldwide to take a broad range of emergency actions, emptied some bankers’ M&A pipelines, as their clients turned their focus to managing their balance sheets.The rocky credit and equities markets have also convinced several unsolicited bidders, including Waste Management, United Technologies and Vishay Intertechnology, to scrap their unwanted pursuits of rivals.CVS, which will significantly boost its presence on the west coast of the US with the purchase of Longs, said shareholders had tendered 77.6 per cent of Longs’ outstanding shares.CVS decided to delay the expiration of its tender offer until the end of the day on Friday to allow shares that had been tendered within the past few days to be recognised.Such last-minute trades come with a guarantee of delivery but generally take three days to clear.Walgreen emerged as a potential interloper last month after Mr Ackman, who manages the Pershing Square hedge fund and is a Longs shareholder, said CVS’s bid undervalued Longs’ real estate.After Walgreen dropped its bid, Jeffrey Rein, its chief executive officer, retired from the company.Pershing Square admitted it was unable to find another suitor to bid against CVS for Longs, and Advisory Research, another investment fund that had agitated for a better offer, said it would tender its shares in favour of the CVS bid.Shares of Longs, which had floated above $75 last month, hovered on Friday at $71.44, just cents below CVS’ bid.
126;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-09-25T18:54:14Z;Rite Aid brings back Standley as president;;Rite Aid, the third largest US drugstore chain, on Thursday brought back a former chief financial officer after reporting a larger-than-expected loss.The retailer, whose share price has dropped more than 60 per cent this year, said John Standley, a former chief financial officer who left in 2005, would serve as president and chief operating officer. Rite Aid also replaced its CFO with Frank Vitrano.Both men worked together on the turnround of Pathmark, a regional supermarket, from 2005 until its sale to A&P supermarkets in 2007.Rite Aid, which operates more than 4,900 stores across the US, announced a wider-than-expected $222m net loss in its second quarter, including $36.2m of charges resulting from debt refinancing over the summer. Revenue was nearly flat at $6.5bn.The retailer has been struggling to assimilate a $2.5bn cash and stock acquisition of 1,800 Brooks and Eckerd drugstores in 2006 that has also left it heavily leveraged. Its stores have underperformed its rivals, CVS and Walgreens, while it faces growing competition from Wal-Mart.Mary Sammons, chief executive, said the retailer was facing a “challenging economic environment” but planned to reduce capital expenditures by $50m, increase store leasebacks and cut costs. The company said the refinancing had strengthened its liquidity position by retiring three notes that had restricted its ability to access its $1.45bn bank revolving credit facility. “We are very comfortable with where we are from a liquidity position,” Mr Vitrano said. The company said it planned to start paying down its acquisition debt in 2010.This month, Rite Aid also renewed a $650m receivables financing agreement under which payments due to the retailer from insurance companies and others for prescription drugs are used to back commercial paper sold in the money markets to ensure regular flow of cash.The new agreement included higher costs and was extended for only four months. However, it is supported until September 2010 by a standalone backstop agreement with the participating banks.Leading US retailers have so far been unscathed by the current turmoil, according to credit market analysts, reflecting their high level of cash holdings.In its monthly report on retailers, Fitch Ratings noted for the retailers it covers “liquidity …is generally expected to remain strong as companies are working to maximise free cash flow and maintain cash balances while reducing share repurchases”.
127;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-09-25T18:54:14Z;CVS is added to ban list on short selling;;Shares in CVS Caremark were on Thursday temporarily excluded from short selling as the US drugstore company became one of the latest to join a restricted stock list that has expanded to include non-financial firms.Many companies have been asking to be included on the list of “financial” firms protected from traders seeking to profit from share price declines, saying they meet the broad criteria set out by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which issued an emergency order last week.Companies ranging from big financial firms to industrial groups such as IBM and General Motors and retailers such as CVS – all of which have financial arms – are now among those temporarily protected from short sellers. More than 160 new stocks have been added to the original list of 799.CVS, one of the biggest US drugstore groups, said on Thursday it was added to the list because it ran Caremark, the prescription benefit manager. Some of its rivals in the sector, including Medco Health Solutions, have also been added in recent days. Atlas Energy Resources, a natural gas producer, was added on Thursday.One hedge fund manager said: “This is getting ridiculous. Now, they keep broadening the list and it also implies that it’s not coming off in two weeks.”Indeed, some traders are “looking elsewhere for opportunities and there is a lot of talk about retail being the next big short bet”, said Stuart Calder, head of product strategy and management at Linedata, a technology provider for hedge funds.However, the frequent additions – and in some cases, deletions – of companies on the ban list have taken their toll on hedge funds and brokers struggling to update their systems to deal with the changes. Some market participants have called for a temporary stay on the expansion of the SEC list.The Security Traders Association, which represents professional equity traders, on Thursday said: “What began as an attempt to dampen volatility by restricting short selling in 19 financial services sector stocks has now expanded into a global programme encompassing multiple sectors.”
128;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-09-14T16:27:44Z;Walgreen $3bn ‘spanner’ in offer battle for Longs;;Walgreen has thrown a spanner in CVS Caremark’s attempt to acquire Longs Drug Stores by offering $3bn for Longs just before the first phase of CVS’s contested tender offer for shares of Longs was set to expire.Walgreen’s $75 per share bid, made late on Friday, tops the CVS Caremark offer of $71.50 per share.Longs, a drug store chain concentrated in the western US and Hawaii, had faced a standoff with its shareholders over the proposed $2.9bn CVS Caremark takeover, after two investment firms which own a combined 18 per cent of the company’s common stock said late last week they would not surrender their shares in favour of the deal.Activist hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said he would not tender his 3.1m Longs shares to CVS Caremark because the price was too low, and Advisory Research, which owns 3.3m Longs shares, threw itself into the ring soon afterwards.CVS Caremark, which aimed to get a deal done quickly by executing a tender offer that expires at midnight tonight, had looked set – before the Walgreen bid – to extend the offer. CVS Caremark’s deal with Longs requires it to keep its offer open until as late as next August.Mr Ackman said in a letter to Longs shareholders the $71.50 per share offered by CVS “materially understates” Longs’ fair value.Pershing Square, Mr Ackman’s fund, said it had undertaken extensive efforts to find potential buyers, including two corporate entities, a real estate investment trust and a real estate private equity investor.
129;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Bitter pills in fight for drugstore dominance;;In Elk Grove, a suburb of Sacramento in northern California, a quarter of a mile separates the local branch of Longs Drug stores from a rival branch of Walgreens, the national drugstore chain.But later this year the Longs store is expected to change hands. It is poised be taken over, along with 520 other Longs stores, by Walgreens’ main rival, CVS Caremark.For CVS, which has no stores in northern California the proposed $2.9bn deal for Longs is the latest stage in a national battle being waged neighbourhood by neighbourhood with Walgreens.“Both are working very hard to drive nationwide market share through a series of local market share moves,” says Michael Collins, a retail consultant at Bain & Company.CVS, based in Rhode Island, and Walgreens, from the Midwest, are now running neck and neck in the push to achieve national leadership through local dominance, with about 6,800 drugstores each. Pennsylvania-based Rite Aid, the third largest national chain, has about 5,800 stores.For CVS, the move on Longs is an important part of a drive to build its presence in California, one of the country’s largest retail markets. Walgreens has been in northern California for decades, and Rite Aid has been a market leader in southern California since the mid-1990s.CVS made its first big push into California two years ago, when it bought about 300 Savon and Osco drugstores in southern California as part of the break-up of the Albertsons grocery business in 2006.The planned $2.9bn addition of Longs, which is the market leader in northern California, will give it a total of about 800 stores in the state, as well as additional stores in Hawaii, Nevada and Arizona.Deborah Weinswig, a retail analyst at Citigroup, says the purchase of Longs “is excellent and is one that would take a decade or more for CVS to replicate through organic growth”.CVS is confident about its ability to integrate the Longs stores, pointing to the successful integration of the Savon and Osco stores it acquired two years ago and the 1,800 Eckerd stores in Texas and the south that it bought from JC Penney in 2004.Walgreens, in contrast, continues to focus on expanding organically by opening its own new stores.Rite Aid, running third in a majority of markets, has been less successful in its efforts to keep pace, struggling to integrate 1,800 Brooks and Eckerd brand stores that it acquired in 2006 in an attempt to build scale.As they have grown, all three chains have used their scale to reduce overheads and to market higher-margin private label products such as over-the-counter medications.They have also sought to reinforce their retail business by expanding into new areas, such as “walk-in” in-store clinics, operated by nurses which dispense basic medical treatment, and developing their speciality pharmacy businesses, which offer enhanced management services for patients with chronic conditions.CVS also significantly expanded its presence in the drug benefit business with its $21bn purchase of Caremark, one of the leading prescription benefit management companies that bulk buys discounted drugs on behalf of insurance companies, large employers and other organisations.But as they seize territory, Walgreens and CVS also have their eye on the rear-view mirror.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, already operates more than 4,000 pharmacies at its superstores and warehouse clubs across the US. There is growing evidence that its two-year-old drive to reduce the costs of generic drugs has lured business away from the traditional stores – leading Walgreens to launch a cost-cutting programme of its own this summer.More significantly, Wal-Mart has also indicated that it is interested in exploring the creation of smaller format stores focused on health, potentially joining the drugstores in their neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood battle for the high street.
130;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Longs faces pressure from activist;;Longs Drug Stores could come under pressure from activist hedge fund investor Bill Ackman to seek a higher takeover offer, either from current suitor CVS Caremark or from rival drugstore operator Walgreen.Longs, a well-known drugstore chain in the western US, announced this week that it had agreed to be bought by larger rival CVS Caremark for $71.50 per share, in a deal valued at $2.9bn, including debt.Mr Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square, owns an 8.8 per cent stake in Longs, along with derivative ”swaps” that it says put its actual economic exposure at 23.6 per cent, according to a recent regulatory filing. The fund bought more than 3.1m shares at $40-$46, which would yield a huge windfall - a premium of about two-thirds - if the deal closes.But Mr Ackman feels that Longs should argue for a higher offer, according to a person close to the matter.Pershing Square, which also holds hefty stakes in retailers Sears, Target, Borders and Barnes & Noble, first disclosed that it had accumulated its position in California-based Longs in an August 5 regulatory filing. The fund, which saw Longs as a viable target for CVS Caremark or Walgreen, hired attorneys to evaluate whether a takeover by either of the two pharmacy rivals would trigger antitrust concerns.Pershing was surprised at how quickly Longs announced a deal with CVS Caremark in the wake of its regulatory filing, and feels Longs may have accelerated its sale in order to maintain control of its sale process, according to one person close to the matter.Other people close to the parties, however, said that Longs and CVS Caremark had already drafted their merger agreement by the time Pershing made its regulatory filing, and that Longs’ board meeting had already been scheduled for August 11, less than a week after Pershing’s -disclosure.”The deal had nothing to do with Bill Ackman,” said one person, who said that talks over a deal between CVS Caremark and Longs had been brewing for years, and that those talks had been stronger in nature than discussions over a deal between Longs and Walgreen.Longs and CVS Caremark started to view Mr Ackman as a potential wild card once they learnt of his investment, people close to the parties said, but believe CVS’s willingness to pay a premium on par with earlier deals and move quickly with a cash tender offer will satisfy investors.
131;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-08-14T22:32:18Z;Investors take steps to foil activist ploy;;Investors who have grown frustrated with one of shareholder activism’s classic moneymaking ploys – buying stock in a company and then calling publicly for it to be sold at a premium – are starting to take matters into their own hands.Harbinger Capital and Pershing Square Capital, the activist hedge funds, have hired bankers or lawyers to find buyers for companies they have invested in, often without shareholder or management’s consent.Harbinger used Moelis & Co, the boutique merger advisory firm, to drum up bid interest in Cleveland-Cliffs, the iron ore miner, earlier in the year, and is using the same strategy in regard to AK Steel, the US steel producer, say people familiar with the matter.Pershing Square recently announced in a regulatory filing it hired advisers in connection with its purchase of a stake in Longs Drug Stores. Pershing saw Longs as a takeover target for CVS Caremark or Walgreens, and used lawyers to gauge whether a deal with either company would present antitrust risks.Pershing Square had not yet hired bankers in Longs’ case, but Bill Ackman, the Pershing founder, has done so at times. He currently has bankers evaluating Target, the retailer, and used Blackstone to pin a value on the Wendy’s fast food chain.The most common modus operandi of activist shareholders when trying to spark a takeover tends to be a public letter to a company’s board of directors calling for a sale. But some funds are working more often to mitigate risk by stirring a sale process directly.“It is fascinating when a hedge fund is having someone on its behalf go out to beat the bushes to find perspective buyers,” one merger adviser said. “You’ve got an activist who is taking more extraordinary steps than usual,” the adviser said, “rather than just annoying management and the board.”Hedge funds do not need a company’s blessing to fan out into the market in search of takeover suitors willing to pay a high enough price. Bankers can also help activists establish clout in suggesting other courses of action, such as restructurings or share buy-backs.“Banks take on a degree of reputational risk, particularly when they’re advising a hedge fund,” one investor said. “Very often, it can create a stronger impression if you can get a top five investment bank to agree with you.”It is not clear that an age has dawned in which shareholders can ostensibly “sell” a company without management’s participation, however. The strategy is not always successful.The biggest hurdles for hedge funds may be reputational. If a company is not convinced it should sell, suitors might not want to irk its board by participating in a hedge fund-run process – a concern that deterred some companies that looked at Cleveland-Cliffs.Hedge fund attempts to rouse takeover bids can also be limited by a lack of access to confidential information, which the target would have to agree to provide.Harbinger’s attempt to solicit suitors for Cleveland-Cliffs, in which it is the biggest stakeholder, has so far been unsuccessful. Cleveland-Cliffs instead announced a deal to buy Alpha Natural Resources, the coal miner, which Harbinger opposes.Pershing Square’s investment in Longs proved well-timed. But while one person close to that situation felt Pershing and its advisers’ presence may have sparked the deal, another called it “pure coincidence”.The jury is still out on AK Steel, in which Harbinger owned a 13 per cent stake according to recent filings. Speculation that the company could be a takeover target resumed last month, helping drive up its share price.But there was no formal sale process under way at AK Steel at that time, merger advisers said. Harbinger did not return calls and AK Steel declined to comment.
132;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
133;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-08-12T23:30:06Z;CVS to acquire Longs Drug;;CVS Caremark said on Tuesday that it will buy Longs Drug Stores for $2.9bn, including debt, in a move that continues the consolidation of the US drug store sector.CVS Caremark will pay $71.50 in cash for each share of California-based Longs Drug, a premium of 32 per cent to the price at which Longs’ shares closed on Tuesday, which values the company’s equity at $2.6bn.The deal will boost the number of CVS-operated US drugstores by about 8 per cent, as CVS, which has a presence in southern California, folds in Longs’ retail stores throughout northern and central California, Hawaii, Nevada and Arizona.CVS, which last year took over prescription benefits manager Caremark Rx, will also take over Longs’ RxAmerica benefit management subsidiary.CVS predicted that its integration of the deal will be “seamless”.It follows CVS’s successful assimilation of 700 Savon drugstores, which it acquired in 2006 during the break up of Albertsons, the grocer, and of 1,200 Eckerd drug stores in 2004.It said the acquisition, which will dilute its earnings per share in the first year, would save $100m in 2009 and $140m-$150m in 2010 through better purchasing and overhead cost reductions.The deal will put CVS Caremark, in terms of retail size, on a par with Walgreens, which had 6,849 drugstores as of July 31.Walgreens says it plans to operate more than 7,000 stores in 2010.The two drugstore chains have gained national scale as they face a growing competitive threat from Wal-Mart, the mass discounter.CVS said it “conservatively” valued the prime commercial real estate Longs owns in connection with about 200 of its stores at more than $1bn, and said it would cash out on a “substantial portion” of that real estate over time.Shares of Longs Drug had traded as low as $41 in mid-July, but have risen into the mid-$50s since then.Pershing Square, the hedge fund managed by activist investor Bill Ackman, said in a regulatory filing last week that it had built up an 8.8 per cent stake in Longs, along with total return swaps that boosted its economic exposure in the company to more than 15 per cent.Pershing said it hired advisers in regards to the investment.JPMorgan advised Longs, led by Charles Edelman, a long-time adviser to Longs and a former mergers and acquisitions head at Bear Stearns.Lehman and Deutsche Bank advised CVS Caremark and have committed to provide a $1.5bn bridge loan to finance the deal.
134;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-07-22T18:24:56Z;A bigger dose: Why generic drug producers are bulking up;;From his headquarters just outside Tel Aviv, Shlomo Yanai, a former top general in the Israeli Defence Force, is plotting the next stage in his commercial career: a campaign to reinforce his company Teva’s position as the world’s biggest generic medicines group.Last week he unveiled a $7.5bn (£3.7bn, €4.7bn) takeover of Barr, a US-based competitor, to create a group with more than 500 marketed products and annual sales of $11bn. Now he is mulling fresh transactions to extend his reach still further. “You are going to see more moves of this kind in the future,” he says, as he revises a five-year plan that prior to the Barr deal already envisaged a doubling of Teva’s size by 2012. “We would like to be one of the top three companies in all our key markets.”His strategy reflects an intensifying international battle over medicines that, as well as driving consolidation within the generic drugs industry, is leading to an unprecedented degree of convergence with its traditional rival, the innovative pharmaceutical sector. Traditionally, pharmaceutical groups developing patented medicines spurned and criticised their upstart rivals producing cheaper generic alternatives once these patents expired. But over the past few weeks, a flurry of planned takeovers and legal settlements has brought them closer together than ever.The generics industry was born in its modern form in 1984, when the Hatch-Waxman act in the US created a monopolistic incentive to promote competition and reduce medicine prices. Under the legislation, the first manufacturer successfully to challenge a patented medicine was rewarded with six months’ exclusivity, after which rivals could launch at lower prices still.That fostered the growth of US generics producers such as Barr and turned the US into one of the most competitive medicine markets in the world, helping its healthcare system to contain costs. The pain for the innovative pharmaceutical companies was bearable, so long as they were able to develop and launch higher priced medicines on patent to replace the existing ones that expired. But their diminishing ability in recent years to renew pipelines of innovative medicines has sparked ever more aggressive legal battles over patent rights.Alan Shepherd, a specialist on the generics sector with IMS, the healthcare consultancy, says: “Within the next three years, the big pharmaceutical companies will have a huge hole in their revenues from patent expiries and they can’t compensate with new medicines.”Generics companies are intensifying their efforts to pick apart patents, challenging the originality of ideas, exploiting weaknesses in the legal definitions of precisely what is protected from competition, and launching in countries where the original company had not filed patents or where protections on exclusivity are weaker.The innovators are fighting back, filing ever more patent applications around the world and seeking to extend their monopoly rights on sometimes only slightly reformulated “follow-on” drugs – a process that they call “life cycle management” and their generics critics dub “evergreening”.The struggle has become increasingly global. India, which abolished product patents in the early 1970s in order to foster a domestic medicines industry and thereby help keep drug prices down, reintroduced them three years ago as part of the conditions of its accession to the World Trade Organisation. By that time, however, the local companies that had thrived at home over the 30 intervening years were formidable international businesses. Led by Cipla, Ranbaxy and Dr Reddy’s, they are now keen to expand abroad to maintain their growth in countries including in the US, the world’s largest medicines market.A watershed came last month, when Pfizer, the US-based company that is the world’s largest pharmaceutical group, was forced to reach a settlement over extensive legal challenges to Lipitor, a blood-thinning drug that generates nearly $13bn a year in sales. The challenger was not a western company but Ranbaxy.The agreement, by which Pfizer will co-operate with Ranbaxy in exchange for a few months of extra exclusivity until 2011, was one of several in recent months achieved by the Indian group. It signed a similar peace deal earlier this year with AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish group, for Nexium, the gastric drug that is the world’s second biggest selling treatment after Lipitor.If such partnerships are one pragmatic response, a number of pharmaceutical companies are also extending and diversifying their own businesses to tackle their traditional rivals head-on, establishing a “hybrid” model that embraces patented and generic drugs alike. Some have long had captive generics arms, such as Johnson & Johnson’s Patriot or Sanofi-Aventis’ Winthrop, with experienced teams that attempt to maintain market share and defend their own branded medicines from competing generic versions once patents expire. By cutting friendly “authorised generic” deals with partners, they can manage patent expiries, reducing the risks of legal challenges and competition.More recently, “big pharma” has been expanding much more ambitiously into the niche. The pioneer was Novartis of Switzerland, which in 2005 paid $8bn to acquire Hexal of Germany and merged it with its own Sandoz arm to create the world’s second-largest generics group in its own right. Sanofi-Aventis is currently bidding against a rival consortium to buy control of Zentiva, a Czech generic drugs manufacturer, as it expands its franchise into eastern and central Europe, where generics are an important and profitable business.Most eye-catchingly, Daiichi Sankyo, the Japanese research-based pharmaceutical group, in June announced a friendly takeover of up to $4.6bn of Ranbaxy – a move seen as designed to capture Japan’s tiny but growing domestic market for generic drugs and compensate for pressure on prices in its core business. The bid boosted the share prices of other Indian generics companies on speculation that the acquisition could lead to more deals.Such deals illustrate the growing attractiveness of generics to innovative companies. There is no doubt about high sales growth in the sector. In theory, margins should be much lower given the absence of intellectual property protection and the presence of intense competition. In the US, that is largely the case. But in many smaller markets, including many in Europe,generics competition remains limited. Inertia on the part of prescribers and patients, combined with aggressive marketing for patented drugs, means that the brand can often retain a larger market share even at a higher price than unbranded generic equivalents with identical ingredients.The result is that generic medicines are often priced only modestly below equivalents that have just come off-patent. “The headroom for innovation is still limited,” says Brian Ager, head of Efpia, the European pharmaceutical industry trade association, who argues that there should be deeper discounts to create more savings, which could be reinvested in paying for new medicines.For now, by selling a broader range of patented and off-patent medicines, pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis have the flexibility to offset the unpredictability of innovative medicines. They can also gain economies of scale and have greater scope to offer a broader bundle of drugs, on more attractive terms, to pharmacy chains such as Wal-Mart and CVS in the US.Furthermore, as Tim van Biesen, a partner at Bain, the management consultancy, argues, “the generic drugs cabinet meets the needs of the vast majority of patients in the developing world”. Such products offer the innovators broader portfolios in the emerging economies to which they are increasingly turning as markets.But there are limits to the trend. First, the size of the overall market remains modest. Despite double-digit growth, generics remain a business far more focused on volumes than prices. The global market, at a little over $70bn, is one-eighth the size of that of patented medicines.While the innovators stand to lose tens of billions of dollars in revenues over the next few years as patents expire, the generic “cliff” then becomes less steep, offering fewer future products to refill the generics companies’ pipelines. The new generation of biological medicines coming to market are also more complex to produce and will be harder to convert into generics.It is this, combined with renewed pricing pressure, that is driving the generics industry itself to consolidate through deals such as Teva’s with Barr. In the US, cut-throat competition is already squeezing margins and making generic drugs ever more a low-cost commodity. Meanwhile, cash-strapped healthcare systems across Europe are beginning to take a more aggressive attitude. Germany and the Netherlands have both recently introduced tenders, for example, which are eroding generics prices. “It’s hard to imagine the local Spanish, Italian and Portuguese generics players can survive,” says Mr Shepherd.Generics manufacturers also face renewed regulatory scrutiny. The European Commission this spring launched an inquiry into pharmaceutical companies. While primarily focused on the innovators, it is also studying whether they struck overly cosy authorised generics deals. The US Federal Trade Commission is equally interested in similar practices that could be keeping generics prices too high.Health scares in the US earlier this year over contamination of Chinese ingredients for Heparin, an off-patent blood thinner, have sparked calls for far tougher inspections by the Food & Drug Administration of suppliers based abroad. The US Department of Justice this month also claimed in a court motion seeking more internal company documents that Ranbaxy had adulterated some of the medicines it manufactured in India for sale in the US – suggestions vigorously denied by Ranbaxy.Finally, there is the question of culture. Robert Wessman of Actavis, an Iceland-based generics company, argues that there are limits to the ability of innovative pharmaceutical companies to enter the generics market, because they lack experience of low-cost manufacturing. “It’s a different mindset and set of skills,” he says.As the innovators diversify into generics, their generic counterparts are also shifting into innovative products. A number of India’s generic drug companies have created spin-offs focusing on patented medicines. Teva, meanwhile, makes nearly one-third of its profits from Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis drug on which it has an effective monopoly.Yet these initiatives also have their limits. If generics can only offer limited salvation to the innovators, there is little evidence so far that ground-breaking research will save the generics companies.
135;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-05-22T20:53:46Z;Fall in jobless claims lifts Wall St;;Wall Street stocks rallied modestly in light trading on Thursday after an unexpected fall in the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits cheered investors, but a retreat in some commodities prices hit related stocks and whittled gains.According to the Labor Department, initial jobless claims fell by 9,000 to 365,000 last week, suggesting that while labour markets remain sickly they are not deteriorating. Economists had expected claims to rise moderately. Still, the trend seems clear as the four-week average for claims rose marginally to 372,250.Early momentum helped investors shrug off the latest numbers on house prices from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. House prices fell 3.1 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, faster than analysts predicted. The numbers will reinforce fears that, amid tightening lending standards at US banks and rising foreclosures, the already prolonged housing slump has further to run.After a day of range-bound trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,394.35 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 12,625.62 points. The Nasdaq Composite rebounded 0.7 per cent to 2,464.58.So far this week, equities have been rattled by worrying reports on inflation and squeezed by the relentless rise in oil prices, which threaten to curb consumer spending, hit corporate profits and slow already weak economic growth.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve spooked investors, indicating that it was finished with rate cuts for the moment even as it slashed its economic growth forecasts and raised its projections for inflation and unemployment.Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said: “The market is still looking for some direction. We have had two days of heavy selling, we are heading into a long holiday weekend and I think people are taking a breather and reassessing the situation.”At the open, the broader stock market looked vulnerable to yet another spike in energy prices as oil briefly pushed through $135, driven by a fall in US stocks of crude. But by the close the picture had reversed, as commodities fell back, knocking related stocks but allowing the other industry groups to pull away. The energy sector fell 1.1 per cent while materials lost 0.3.Consumer discretionary stocks wobbled between gains and losses as Ford said it would take longer than forecast to break even due to higher costs and slower sales. Ford fell 8.2 per cent to $7.16 and General Motors slipped 3.6 per cent to $18.43.Limited Brands helped cushion losses, however, after the operator of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain posted estimate-beating earnings. Limited Brands rose 3 per cent to $18.85 while the broader sector added 0.2 per cent.Wendy’s also made ground after William Ackman, the hedge fund manager who is the largest shareholder in the hamburger chain, said the company could increase its value dramatically by selling stores and real estate. Wendy’s shares rose 6 per cent to $29.73.Financials were unlikely winners, but joined a suite of heavily sold sectors that bounced back. They rose 0.9 per cent, led higher by Citigroup and JP Morgan which added 3.1 per cent to $21.72 and 1.5 per cent to $43.05 respectively.The sector advanced despite the fact that a leading banking analyst slashed his 2008 earnings for a number of the big brokerages. Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann suggested selling shares in Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, knocking shares in all three.Consumer staples were the main gainers, adding 1.1 per cent – their biggest rise since the start of April – on analyst upgrades and improved sentiment as investors moved into counter-cyclicals.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy chain, added 1.5 per cent to $42.59 while PepsiCo and Coca-Cola rose 1.7 per cent to $68.38 and 2.9 per cent to $57.27.Deal news was another bright spot. NRG Energy, the second-biggest power producer in Texas, made an unsolicited offer to buy Calpine, the largest producer of electricity from gas-fired plants in the US, for $9.6bn in stock. Calpine rose 8.1 per cent to $23 while NRG slipped 5.1 per cent to $40.35.
136;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-04-08T18:47:14Z;Wal-Mart goes small to take on UK’s Tesco;;"Wal-Mart will open small-format grocery stores in Arizona this year under the trade name, “Marketside”, going head to head with the new Fresh & Easy markets being rolled out in the US by Tesco, the UK grocer.The new pilot stores are about 15,000 sq ft, a 10th of the size of the Supercenters that have been driving Wal-Mart’s growth over the past two decades.The retailer has secured leases on a handful of properties around Phoenix, some of them only a mile from locations where Tesco is setting up its 10,000 sq ft discount grocery stores.The stores, likely to be open by the summer, are the first new concept launched by the retailer in the US for a decade, and are being developed as the company slows its planned growth of Supercenters.Unlike the giant stores, the planning process for the new Marketside stores does not require public consultation, potentially creating a way for Wal-Mart to grow into cities and states where its Supercenter expansion has been slowed by union-backed political opposition.In addition to its 2,435 US Supercenters, Wal-Mart also sells food at 128 Neighborhood Markets, a grocery format the company launched in 1998.Wal-Mart declined to give details of the new stores, but the company characterised them as comparable with its existing Neighborhood Markets, which it uses to “fill in” between Supercenters. At about 35,000 sq ft, the Neighborhood Markets are roughly the size of a traditional US supermarket.“We trial and test lots of different new formats and this would be an example of that,” the company said.But its new logo, filed in planning documents in Arizona and consisting of green lettering with a stylised tomato, egg and grape topped by a Wal-Mart blue star, suggests the format will – like Tesco’s Fresh & Easy – have a far stronger stress on fresh foods.The retailer has also registered a number of new trade names in recent months, such as City Thyme and Field & Vine, which some industry analysts believe could be used for new private-label fresh-food offerings.Wal-Mart recently hired Jack Sinclair, a veteran of the UK grocery industry, to head its supermarket business.Operating the smaller stores is likely to require a significant shift in an operation developed to serve the Supercenter.All the stores are in street-corner properties that were formerly occupied by drug stores. The company has applied for wine and beer licences for stores in the fast-growing cities of Gilbert, Tempe and Mesa.There are already 12 Supercenters and five Neighborhood Markets in the area southeast of Phoenix. All the buildings were previously drug stores that were acquired and then sold off by CVS, the pharmacy group, as part of the break-up of the old Albertson’s supermarket group in 2006.The three initial stores are located at:Mesa: 7561 E Baseline Road
Gilbert: 838 W Elliot Road

137;CVS;CVS Corp;2008-01-29T20:16:22Z;US drugstores;;Investors who bought into drugstore chain Rite Aid last year made the wrong bet. Rival CVS Caremark has risen in value after a deal that transformed it into a drug distribution giant by adding a pharmacy benefits manager. By contrast, Rite Aid, which is trying to integrate ageing rival Eckerd while also reviving its struggling core brand, has swallowed too many pills at once. Rite Aid shares have lost two-thirds of their value in the past year, as investors have backed away from its debt-laden balance sheet disappointing sales and shrinking market share.Shares of CVS, meanwhile,have risen 10 per cent, partly based on the higher valuation multiple assigned to the Caremark prescription processing business it bought for $26.5bn last year. Shares of leading US drugstore chain Walgreen, which has refused to follow CVS into pharmacy benefits, have slipped 22 per cent. Increased generic pharmaceutical usage has hit drugstores’ top lines, and the mild cold and influenza season has softened customer traffic. That, along with a general slowdown in consumer spending, has also reduced purchases of the picture frames, greeting cards and cosmetics that can account for roughly one-quarter of drugstores’ non-pharmacy merchandise. Rite Aid’s sales have suffered disproportionately. It still has to pay for store upgrades to staunch its bleeding market share and make its attempt to build scale through the Eckerd purchase worthwhile. But the top drug chains’ differing answers to the question of whether they should also manage pharmacy benefits may well matter more in the long run.If CVS’s decision to integrate the two businesses continues to prove successful, Caremark’s prescription- processing rivals, MedcoHealth and Express Scripts, are bound to take notice. Retail giant Wal-Mart’s plan to start managing drug benefits should only intensify their interest. In CVS’s case, a drugstore chain bought a pharmacy benefits manager.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,602.68 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 13,056.72.The onset of a bear market in the consumer discretionary sector was a worrying signal for investors sensitive to indications of a US economic slowdown. The sector has lost 21.2 per cent of its value since its peak last June.Although a slump in the homebuilders has contributed to the sector’s decline, the inclusion of an array of other well-known US consumer companies on a list of significant fallers suggests a broader malaise.“It’s the retailers, the hoteliers, the casual dining sector – the whole consumer sector is getting smashed right now,” said Jay Wong, portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel.Office Depot has fallen 65 per cent during the period, discount retailer Big Lots has lost 53 per cent, JC Penney, the department store operator, has shed 51 per cent while Marriot International, the hotel chain, is down 29 per cent.Stocks rose in early trade on Thursday after the Commerce Department said new factory orders increased 1.5 per cent in November, much greater than the expected rise of 0.4 per cent.But traders remained cautious as the data came only a day after a sharp contraction in the December ISM manufacturing index.Investors reacted favourably to news that the private sector added 40,000 jobs in December. Although modest, the figure prompted stock futures to rally as some traders had feared the number would be negative.Weekly jobless claims fell 21,000 to 336,000, below an expected level of 345,000.US markets remain acutely sensitive to employment news, with many analysts pointing to jobs as the key indicator of whether the US economy will fall into recession. The Labor Department is on Friday due to release keenly awaited data on US non-farm payrolls.State Street on Thursday became the latest financial company to reveal exposure to the troubled US mortgage market. The money manager said it would take a $279m charge for the fourth quarter, but the stock closed 8.2 per cent higher at $85.37 after its 2007 operating profit outlook, which excludes the charge and other costs, beat Wall Street estimatesIn the biotechnology sector, Monsanto beat Wall Street estimates after reporting fiscal first quarter net income of $256m, almost treble last year’s figure. The group raised its 2008 earnings guidance and the shares rose 8.5 per cent to $120.92.Celgene gained 7.7 per cent to $49.85 as it passed a regulatory hurdle to the completion of its acquisition of Pharmion.Sciele Pharma rose 11.4 per cent to $22.10 after it received regulatory approval for four dosage strengths of a drug to treat high blood pressure. Onyx Pharmaceuticals, the top performing US stock in 2007, rose 4 per cent to $57.98. The stock made a return of 425 per cent for investors last year.The drug retailing sector lagged, after last month’s pharmacy same-store sales disappointed analysts. CVS Caremark fell 6.6 per cent to $36.77 and Rite Aid fell 15.2 per cent to $2.28.Carmakers were in focus as Toyota overtook Ford to claim the number two position in the US market. Ford’s sales of cars and light trucks declined 9.2 per cent in December, while sales at General Motors sales slid 4.4 per cent. The shares fell 2.3 per cent to $6.45 and 2 per cent to $23.92 respectively.Gold miners were among the best performers as the precious metal held near record highs. Barrick Gold rose 5.9 per cent to $48.71.
139;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-12-05T20:53:04Z;Walk-in clinics help to cure US healthcare ills;;Walk-in retail health clinics have moved from oddity to near ubiquity in just two years in the US. They provide nurse practitioners, who treat minor illness, perform examinations and offer preventive medicine such as vaccines for about $50.Take Care, acquired this year by the drugstore group Walgreens, estimates it will open one clinic a day and have more than 400 by this time next year. The industry is expected to reach 5,000 -10,000 retail clinics in the next few years.“Patient demand could warrant significantly more than 5,000-10,000 clinics. What will limit it is the availability of nurse practitioners,” says Peter Miller, chief executive of Take Care.The explosion of walk-in clinics is one of several significant moves to reform US healthcare by business and other groups outside the traditional medical industry.They range from clinics in retail stores to internet social networking for doctors, retailers’ rethinking pricing policies for prescription drugs, widening support for cost-effectiveness studies of medicines, and financial service industry help for hospitals.These seemingly unrelated examples could change the system at some of its weakest points. They are tackling problems including inexpensive access to basic healthcare for everyone, transparency in medical information, and personal accountability for one’s own health.Walk-in clinics have been set up in some of the largest drugstore and retail groups, including Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and RiteAid.Their business model seeks to offer basic healthcare for patients, whether insured or uninsured.They treat minor illnesses at low cost, and could help to head off higher costs with preventive medicine while leaving physicians time for complex cases.In addition, they generate a computer patient record for each visit, which could help to spur wider adoption of electronic health records.“We are serving as a critical entry point for patients,” says Mr Miller. “In many cases, there are patients that haven’t been in the healthcare system in years.”Since it opened two years ago, the established medical community’s concern in one of Take Care’s first markets of Kansas City has shifted. In some months 10-15 per cent of its patients are referrals from doctors.Clinics see potential to expand services, including helping with obesity and patient health and wellbeing, “transforming how healthcare is practised today”, says Mr Miller.Doctors are not to be left behind. Sermo, the internet networking site for doctors, has emerged to give physicians a network to discuss their medical cases or problems, find new information such as drug data, operate their business better, or post personal information.Sermo has up to 40,000 US physician members, recently adding 2,000 each week. Dr Daniel Palestrant, founder and chief executive, says: “It could be indispensable. But it also does what we want to do – and that’s help fix healthcare.”Healthcare costs have also attracted new reform efforts. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, launched a $4 plan for 30 days’ supply of commonly used generic drugs. It has targeted $10bn (€7bn, £5bn) of savings by squeezing out pricing anomalies and making generic drugs pricing more transparent.Efforts to get evidence to judge whether medical treatments are cost-effective received a surprising boost last month from government researchers.Peter Orszag and Philip Ellis, of the Congressional Budget Office, argued in the New England Journal of Medicine that healthcare costs and quality could be helped by “generating more information about the relative effectiveness of medical treatments and enhancing the incentives for providers to supply and consumers to demand, effective care”.Some estimates, they wrote, say that less than half of all medical care “is supported by firm evidence of effectiveness”.Finally, hospitals have seen their bad debt continue to soar, as uninsured patients or those with less insurance fail to pay large bills.As people are required to take on more costs, this debt has created a vicious cycle that is destabilising US healthcare, experts say.McKinsey & Co says financial institutions have expertise either being used or implemented in the future that could help the healthcare payment system, with “electronic payment processing capabilities that the sector needs”.US healthcare is changing and adapting with these new ideas, either paving the way for potential federal policy reforms, or in lieu of their absence.This is the second in a series on the problems of the US healthcare system. Part three will appear tomorrow
140;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-11-27T23:11:59Z;Kroger in gift card push with Safeway;;Kroger, the largest US supermarket group, is launching a marketing campaign to promote a new gift card sales service managed by a subsidiary of Safeway, one of its main rivals, in a move that underlines the growth of the US gift card industry.Safeway’s Blackhawk subsidiary said on Tuesday it would be operating “gift card malls” in Kroger’s 2,400-plus stores during the holiday shopping season, adding to about 80,000 outlets across the US.Blackhawk’s “malls” consist of racks of branded stored-value cards that are sold on behalf of other retailers, as well as for other services, such as sports tickets, or music downloads, and restaurant meals.After initially avoiding working with its rivals, the Safeway subsidiary now has deals with a range of other supermarkets and drugstores, including CVS and the US subsidiaries of Ahold and Delhaize.Safeway said in October it expected a deal with Kroger to contribute to projected earnings before tax and interest from Blackhawk of about $100m this year, up from $45m last year when it first revealed the existence of the non-core business to Wall Street analysts.Under the arrangement, Kroger will remit gift card revenues to Blackhawk, minus a percentage fee, and Blackhawk takes a further percentage before passing on the revenues to the issuing brand or retailer.Safeway predicted last December that the growth of its Blackhawk business, set up in 2001, could continue at a compound annual growth rate of 80 per cent over the following five years.The National Retail Federation forecasts that Americans will spend more than $26bn on gift cards this holiday season, up 6 per cent on last year. Total US gift card sales – which include both “closed” cards limited to a single brand or retailer, and “open” cards from payment networks such as American Express – are expected to be worth more than $70bn this year, according to industry estimates.Some retailers are taking complex approaches to selling the cards. Giant Eagle, a regional supermarket group based in Pittsburgh, has started linking gift card sales to its own loyalty card fuel sales incentives programme. For every $50 spent on gift cards, the promotion offers customers a 20 cents per gallon discount when they use the supermarket’s associated petrol stations.
141;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-11-01T20:45:40Z;Wall St slides as banks hit by credit fears;;Financial stocks suffered their worst day in five years as investor confidence evaporated on renewed fears about the sector’s exposure to credit market losses.Citigroup plunged, dragging other financial stocks lower, after an analyst said the bank might have to cut its dividend to raise capital. Credit insurers suffered particularly heavy losses.Optimism arising from the Federal Reserve’s quarter-point rate cut dissolved further as oil touched $96 a barrel before falling back, stoking inflation fears. ExxonMobil added to worries about corporate earnings by reporting a bigger-than-expected fall in profit.The S&P 500 had its worst day since August 9, closing 2.6 per cent lower at 1,508.44. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.3 per cent at 2,794.83 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent at 13,567.87.The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks fell 4 per cent at 795.18. Volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index jumped 25 per cent to 23.23.The NYSE instituted selling curbs on program trading within minutes of the open after the composite index swiftly fell 2 per cent.Citigroup fell 6.9 per cent at $38.51 after an analyst at CIBC World Markets downgraded the bank because of fears it will have to raise over $30bn in capital in the near term.“Based upon our thesis that over the near term [Citigroup] will be forced to sell assets, raise capital or cut its dividend to shore up its capital ratios, we believe the stock will be under significant pressure and could trade into the low $30s,” analyst Meredith Whitney said.“Catch 22 will apply here as selling assets will limit Citigroup’s ability to grow earnings,” she said.Credit Suisse also downgraded Citigroup, from “outperform” to “neutral”, while Morgan Stanley Research downgraded a range of large-cap banks, including Citigroup. “We believe there will be contagion from subprime housing to prime housing, to auto, to card loans,” its analysts said.In a further indication of the continuing fall-out from the credit squeeze, the size of the US asset-backed commercial paper market — a crucial source of short-term liquidity — fell for a 12th consecutive week.A broad range of financial stocks were hit. The S&P financial index fell 4.6 per cent at 431.30, its worst performance since September 2002. The investment bank index fell 4.8 per cent at 201.37.Merrill Lynch declined 5.8 per cent at $62.19 while Bank of America shed 5.3 per cent at $45.71 after CIBC also downgraded the stock. Countrywide Financial was off 7 per cent at $14.43 with E*Trade Financial down 7.8 per cent at $10.27.Credit insurers plunged on fears of an acceleration in the deterioration of the US mortgage market. Radian, the mortgage insurer, lost 13.6 per cent at $10.88 after it swung to a big loss. MGIC Investment, another mortgage insurer, shed 11.6 per cent at $17.11. Ambac Financial and MBIA, municipal bond insurers, fell 19.7 per cent at $29.57 and 11.6 per cent at $38.06 respectively.Homebuilders were also hit heavily. The S&P homebuilder index fell 5.5 per cent at 394.29. DR Horton shed 4.1 per cent at $12.03 while Centex Homes lost 5.6 per cent at $23.66.ExxonMobil added to the malaise after it reported a bigger-than-expected 10 per cent decline in its third-quarter earnings as profits from the production of petrol slid. It was the company’s biggest profit decline in more than three years. The shares fell 3.8 per cent at $88.50.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest mobile operator in the US, reported a 77 per cent fall in third quarter profit after it lost 60,000 wireless customers in the quarter. Shares were 3 per cent lower at $16.58.CVS Caremark, the country’s largest pharmacy chain, increased third-quarter earnings to $689.5m, higher than expected by analysts. However, the stock still slipped 1.5 per cent at $41.03.The market was also reacting to the latest economic data. The Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing activity deteriorated to its slowest pace since March.Personal income rose 0.4 per cent while personal consumption was up 0.3 per cent, lower than economists had forecast. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims fell 6,000 to 327,000, more than a forecast decline of 1,000.
142;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Sovereign to make investment on CVS flotation;;Sovereign Capital, the private equity specialist, has cashed in its investment in CVS, the veterinary practice group, getting a return of almost 12 times more than it paid in.CVS employs 1,214 staff, 271 of them vets, and has two divisions: the veterinary side, which comprises 45 small animal practices with 128 surgeries and one specialist equine practice, and the diagnostic side, which has three laboratories.The company is being floated on Aim with a placing of 45.2m shares at 205p each raising £92.7m. This represents 87.7 per cent of the share capital and makes the group worth £105.7m at the placing price.Sovereign backed the company when it was started in August 1999 specifically to acquire and operate well established veterinary practices in local communities. Launching on Aim allows Nash Sells Limited Partnership II, the fund managed by Sovereign Capital Partners, to get a return for its money eight years after it invested.Under the current management team of Simon Innes, chief executive, and Paul Coxon, finance director, sales have increased from £12.8m in 2005 to £39m in the year to June 30. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose from £1.3m to £5.1m.Mr Innes is the former chief executive of Vision Express, which he built into a business with turnover of £220m before its eventual takeover.He said CVS’s acquisition pipeline was “buoyant” and added that the group had experienced an increased level of interest from veterinary practices.Future deals, typically for practices with a minimum of four vets and annual turn-over of at least £500,000, will be funded through a combination of a £12m undrawn debt facility with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays and cash flow.CVS is currently looking at 15 different practices. Three non-executives directors have joined the board. Richard Connell, David Timmins and Christopher Marsh have agreed to invest a total of £100,000 in shares at the placing price. Panmure Gordon acted as nominated adviser and stockbroker on the float and said the placing was ”comfortably” subscribed.Dealing is expected to start on October 10.
143;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-10-05T11:59:49Z;Charles Pretzlik: Barclays to concede on ABN;;Just a short blog, as it looks like we’re going to have to make our own fun today and I can’t tell you about that yet – except to say we’ve got some good Northern Rockery in the works.Otherwise, stand by for a concession of defeat around lunchtime from Barclays on ABN Amro (”Veni, vidi, Varley. He came, he saw, he almost certainly failed to conquer” as Lombard so nicely put it on Thursday). Jeremy Warner was on form in the Indie this morning. “The only real positive that Barclays takes away from months of trying is that in the end it resisted the temptation to overpay,” he wrote. “In all other respects, its chosen strategy lies in tatters.”WH Ireland, the small stockbroker, says it had received a number of takeover approaches. Sarah Spikes has established that one of the approaches is from Formation Group.A company called CVS, which owns vet surgeries, says it plans to raise £92.7m through an Aim float. Could be a dog, as one of my colleagues said.EasyJet, the low-cost airline, says it expects to beat its previous profit guidance, thanks to a one-off £11m gain from its investment in The Airline Group, the consortium which runs the UK’s air traffic control system.Comment on our coverageAbout this blogReceive this blog for free by emailSee previous blogs
144;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-10-04T20:47:03Z;Wall St edges higher ahead of jobs data;;"Wall Street stocks closed marginally higher on Thursday as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of crucial non-farm payroll numbers for September, due on Friday.“Any large equity market move ahead of the payroll number is premature,” said Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent higher at at 1542.84. The index had traded in a narrow range between 1,537.63 and 1,544.02. Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index was moderately lower. The Vix was off 2.3 per cent at 18.37, but is higher by 2 .1 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,733.57.Shares in Research in Motion jumped 4.4 per cent to $100.54 ahead of earnings results. After the closing bell RIM reported fiscal second quarter profit that met expectations but raised guidance for the third quarter. The stock fell 1 per cent in after-hours trade.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction firmer at 13,974.31.A boost for the Dow came from the pharmaceutical giants. Merck was up 1.4 per cent at $52.86, while Pfizer climbed 0.9 per cent to $25.30.The payroll report looms as a crucial piece of data for investors after jobs in August fell 4,000, the first monthly contraction in four years. Economists expect job gains of 115,000 last month.“The market is coming to the view that the US September employment report will provide a riposte to the weakness in the August data, with many indicators, notably the sum of states and initial claims suggesting the August numbers overstated labour market weakness,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.The forecast rebound in payrolls is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines when policy makers meet at the end of the month, say economists.“An indication that the labour market picture is not as dire as suggested by last month’s report should lead the Fed to hold policy steady at the October 30/31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting,” said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley.At this juncture, interest rate futures indicate a split as to whether the FOMC cuts its 4.75 per cent Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent or 4.50 per cent by the end of the year.The tone of the labour report could test the bullish resolve of equity investors as further rate cuts this year are seen helping offset a weak third-quarter earnings season. The major benchmarks have rallied 10 per cent from their lows in August and this week
the Dow set a new record high.“Equities are back on a narrow path and do not want a payroll number that is strong enough to suggest rate cuts are off the table,” said Mr Peta. “But the market does not want a weak payroll number that spurs renewed talk of a recession.”Third-quarter S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to expand 2 per cent over the year, according to Thomson Financial. That is down from a forecast of 6.2 per cent at the start of July.Among the leading sectors on Thursday were utility, telecoms and energy. Conversely, consumer discretionary and technology stocks underperformed the market.Financial stocks extented gains this week as a number of banks issued earnings warnings for pending third quarter results.Mr Peta said: “It was too early to jump back into financials at this juncture, but investors clearly believe the worst is over for the sector.”In earnings news, Marriott International reported a 7 per cent decline in third-quarter profit, but the result was above analyst expectations. Shares fell 4.6 per cent to $42.28.Meanwhile, ArvinMeritor, the car parts supplier, issued a lower fiscal fourth-quarter outlook due to a weak commercial vehicle sector. The stock slid 3.1 per cent to at $16.22.In corporate news, CVS Caremark said September sales at stores open at least one year rose 5 per cent. Pharmacy same-store sales for the five weeks ended September 29 rose 4.3 per cent and were hurt by recent generic drug introductions. Company shares rose 1 per cent to $38.66.Constellation Brands said that its second-quarter profit rose 9.2 per cent as strong spirits sales helped to offset a drop in wine shipments to US wholesalers and heightened competition in Britain. Its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $25.00."
145;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-08-02T20:48:29Z;Wall St boosted by upbeat profits;;"A series of upbeat corporate earnings reports helped lift US shares on Thursday, but investor enthusiasm was tempered by ongoing concerns about credit markets and the subprime mortgage sector.Leading stock market indices staged a strong rally in the last half hour of trading for the second day in succession. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,472.20 while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.9 per cent higher at 2,575.98The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent at 13,463.33. The gains added to Wednesday’s strong last-minute rally which took place amid near-record trading volumes on most equity and derivatives exchanges.Solid earnings from Nokia sent shares in the mobile phone maker 8.8 per cent higher at $30.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.Viacom reported higher revenues and a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, aided by strong DVD sales and the success of the hit film Shrek The Third. Its shares gained 1.9 per cent at $38.50. These results came closely on the heels of strong figures from Walt Disney and Starbucks after Wednesday’s market close.Walt Disney reported a rise in quarterly profit, lifted by strength in its TV and theme park businesses. Shares in the group rose
1.6 per cent to $34.36.Starbucks also posted higher profit and sales. Its shares rose 2.9 percent to as high as $28.00, though by late morning they were down 0.2 percent at $27.15 on the Nasdaq.Eastman Kodak swung to a profit, helped by continued cost-cutting efforts and a hefty gain from the sale of its healthcare group. It rose 5.4 per cent to $26.93.CVS Caremarkrose 3.5 per cent to $36.79 after the company said its second-quarter net income more than doubled in its first full quarter as a combined company.However, the market remained pre-occupied with subprime-related issues as mortgage lender Accredited Home Lenders said it was not certain it would continue to operate due to the adverse conditions in the subprime mortgage market. AHL shares plunged 35.32 per cent to $5.31.Analysts cautioned that stock markets were likely to continue to display significant volatility. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said the CBOE’s Vix index of market volatility had retreated from Wednesday’s peak of 26.22 as investors braced for “peak-
selling”.“Although a sense of calm returned as the Dow rang up a 1.1 per cent gain [on Wednesday], the Vix remains notably elevated and is now set to close above a value of 20 for the sixth straight session,” Mr Wilkinson said.“Judging by the fact that the Vix is lower by 9.6 per cent today [on Thursday], while index values are mixed, makes it hard to tell whether investors are stepping back or adding new positions,” he added.NYSE Euronext shares fell 2.7 per cent to $74.91 after the transatlantic stock exchange reported a rise in second quarter earnings.The earnings report reflected the first time that the pan-European exchange Euronext, which was bought by the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year, contributed to earnings.In deals news, financial data processor Fiserv said it would acquire the electronic payment processing company Checkfree for $4.4bn in cash, soothing recent concerns that dealmaking would wane on Wall Street amid credit market troubles. Shares in Checkfree soared 23.3 per cent to $45.40 on the news.Dellrose 1.5 per cent to $28.18 after it agreed to buy the ASAP Software unit of Corporate Express for $340m.Shares in Clorox fell 7.3 per cent to $57.14 after the bleach manufacturer unveiled a lower-than- expected quarterly profit due to rising promotional and ingredient costs and subdued sales growth.Wall Street also responded to better-than-expected economic data as the US Labour Department said that jobless claims were up 4,000 to 307,000 on a seasonally-
adjusted basis in the week ended July 28. Analysts had expected a rise of 9,000 claims for the week.The Commerce Department said June factory orders rose 0.6 per cent, less than expected, on lower orders for automobiles, computers and electrical goods.Traders were awaiting Friday’s release of July non-farm payrolls, a closely watched indicator of US economic health.The data will be even more keenly watched than usual because of concerns about US housing market weakness."
146;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-05-30T19:47:30Z;M&A fuels surge in bond issues;;Non-government bond issuance surged in May on the back of rising mergers and acquisition activity and moves by an increasing number of banks and companies to refinance debt.Overall bond issuance in dollars, euros, sterling and yen rose to close to $300bn – the highest ever during the month of May and the second highest monthly figure, according to Dealogic, the data provider.Martin Egan, global head of primary markets at BNP Paribas, said debt was cheap with interest rate spreads between the cost of borrowing non-government paper and risk-free government bonds near record lows. Along with M&A activity, this had lured companies to the market.He said markets had stabilised since the volatility of late February and March.Europe saw an example of the M&A influence on Wednesday as Italian power company Enel announced plans to raise up to €3bn of debt as part of a refinancing in connection with its joint takeover bid for Spanish utility Endesa.In the US, the market is equally robust with Edward Marrinan, head of credit strategy at JPMorgan Securities, forecasting investment grade corporate issuance to hit a record $100bn in May.He said: “May is a busy redemption month leading to heavy refinancing requirements. At the same time, there has been a large contribution from hybrid issuance with insurers and industrials looking to augment their capital bases.” .Jim Reid, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank, said the large amount of supply in both Europe and the US was also down to investor demand. He said: “Confidence has returned since late February and there’s a lot of cash about. Investors are demanding paper so a lot of banks and companies are looking to take advantage of this.”Some of this month’s biggest deals included CVS Caremark, which raised $5.5bn in a dollar denominated deal, and Procter & Gamble, which raised €2.5bn in a euro-denominated deal.Another was the €1bn issue from Volvo, which last came to the market in 2001, and was typical of an issuer looking to take advantage of the conditions.
147;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Express Scripts limits its bid for Caremark;;Express Scripts, the US pharmacy benefits manager, on Monday said it would not raise its $26.5bn bid for Caremark, further reducing its chances of emerging as the winner in the takeover battle pitting it against CVS, the drug store chain.“Our current offer is the best and only offer we can make at this time,” said George Paz, Express Scripts chief executive. “We cannot in good conscience offer more consideration without an opportunity to conduct confirmatory due diligence.”Caremark shareholders are expected to vote on Friday to approve a deal with CVS, which is worth roughly the same amount as Express Scripts’ offer but has already received regulatory approval.The competing bid from Express Scripts has already forced CVS to sweeten its offer for Caremark by adding more than $3bn in cash.Wall Street investors interpreted the announcement by Express Scripts as a withdrawal from the bidding.Caremark shares fell almost 3 per cent to $60.07 – below the CVS offer price – in morning trading.However, Express Scripts continued to urge shareholders to reject the CVS deal, allowing it a new window to make a fresh proposal.Even though it appears to be floundering, the Express Scripts bid for Caremark highlighted a new dealmaking trend on Wall Street.The cheap cost of financing acquisitions is allowing smaller companies to target larger rivals, sometimes with hostile approaches. The market value of Express Scripts is only about $11bn.Express Scripts shares rose 4.8 per cent in morning trading, as investors appeared relieved that the Missouri-based group would not lift its offer any further.Another possible explanation for the share price rise is that a failure to buy Caremark might make Express Scripts more vulnerable to a takeover, possibly by a drug store chain.In bidding for Caremark, Rhode-Island based CVS is attempting to create a uniquely integrated healthcare group including pharmacy benefit plans as well as a network of drug store chains.But the improved chances of CVS clinching Caremark did not enthuse the drug store chain’s investors either: the shares were down 3 per cent in morning trading.
148;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;CVS raises its bid for Caremark;;CVS on Thursday raised its bid for Caremark, the pharmacy benefits manager, to about $26.5bn, roughly matching the size of a competing offer from Express Scripts, its rival in the US takeover battle.The move by CVS came one day after Express Scripts sweetened its own proposal by agreeing to pay Caremark shareholders interest on the cash portion of its bid.The battle for control of Caremark is entering its final stages: on March 16, the company’s shareholders are expected to vote on the CVS deal, which was announced in November.By increasing its offer, CVS placed itself in an ideal position to emerge with the winning bid. Its cash-and-stock offer, worth about $61.63 per share, is now worth roughly as much as Express Scripts’ bid but CVS has already received regulatory approval for the deal. The Express Scripts proposal, on the contrary, is still being scrutinised by the Federal Trade Commission.“The Express Scripts’ offer for Caremark remains fraught with risk, challenges and certain loss of shareholder value,” said Tom Ryan, CVS chief executive. “Our best and final merger proposal provides Caremark shareholders with real and deliverable value and is based on a compelling strategic rationale.”In bidding for Caremark, CVS is attempting to make the transition from being primarily a retailer to being a more integrated healthcare company.Caremark shares rose 1.4 per cent in New York trading to close at $62.16.
149;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-03-08T22:41:44Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;The tentative recovery in US stocks gathered pace on Thursday as Wall Street cheered rising overseas markets and signs of improved corporate profits.The rally was given extra vigour by speculation that Citigroup might be attempting a further acquisition in Asia, while the weaker yen eased concerns about the global carry trade.However, the gains were checked in the afternoon as the spectre of subprime mortgage lenders returned to spook investors.Rumours that New Century Financial was close to bankruptcy weighed down the entire market and sent shares in the struggling subprime lender down 25 per cent to $3.87.Led by materials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to close at 1,401.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 12,260.70. The Dow was boosted by AT&T, which rose 3.1 per cent to $36.51 after analysts at AG Edwards lifted their rating on the telecoms company from “hold” to “buy”.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,387.73.Retailers gave a mixed set of trading updates for February but investors largely reacted positively, sending the S&P retailers index up 1.2 per cent. Wal-Mart shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $47.88 after its underlying sales growth last month fell short of analysts’ estimates.Shares in Costco were also on the defensive after the retailer said second quarter profits had declined because of charges related to stock options. The group’s shares fell 3.3 per cent to $54.26.However, while trading in February was also sluggish at JC Penney, its shares surged 4.1 per cent to $81.86 after the retailer said sales in March would rise sharply.Shares in Ford rose 4 per cent to $7.93 after Credit Suisse analysts raised their rating on the group from “underperform” to “neutral”, saying the carmaker’s first quarter loss might be smaller than expected.Steelmakers made big gains after Nucor said it saw “healthy demand” for its products, sending its shares up 5.3 per cent to $63.12.In deal news, an executive of Taiwan’s Bank of Overseas Chinese said Citigroup would buy the bank “very soon”. Shares in Citigroup pared early gains to stand 0.6 per cent up at $50.50.The battle for Caremark heated up after Express Scripts raised its hostile offer for its larger rival in the US drug benefits management sector by offering to pay interest on the cash component of its $26.1bn bid.The sweetened bid comes as Express tries to trump the deal already agreed between Caremark and pharmacy chain CVS. In response CVS on Thursday increased the dividend it intends to pay Caremark shareholders.CVS stock rose 3.3 per cent to $54.26. Shares in Caremark and Express rose by 1.4 and 1.7 per cent respectively to $62.16 and $76.
150;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-02-16T18:26:01Z;On Wall Street: Bitter pill to ease headache for investors;;Normally, you would go to the chemist for a remedy. For Caremark Rx, though, pharmacy chain CVS is causing a headache rather than curing it.Well, partly. The bulk of the pain is “self-inflicted” – the words of the splendid William Chandler, chancellor of the chancery court in the US state of Delaware.You might guess that the involvement of a judge means controversy, and you would be right.Last November, Caremark, which manages patients’ drug benefits for US healthcare plans, agreed to “merge” with CVS. The “merger of equals” idea meant Caremark’s shareholders were to get no premium. Yet all along it looked more like an acquisition by CVS, then capitalised at about $26bn against Caremark’s $21bn.The two management teams claimed the deal would “transform” the health benefits business. It might – but analysts and customers are still struggling to grasp how the industry, so transformed, would look.Then, in mid-December, came the first throb of Caremark’s headache. Express Scripts, a smaller competitor, launched a bid, offering Caremark’s shareholders more than CVS. With a market capitalisation of less than $10bn, Scripts had to line up $13bn or so of debt, but touted the close fit and potential synergies.Caremark dismissed the offer out of hand. Among others, its objections included the lack of a strategic rationale and a “significant, if not insurmountable” risk that competition authorities would block the deal.Then things got catty. Scripts tried to nominate directors to Caremark’s board. Mac Crawford – Caremark’s chairman, president and chief executive – said Scripts’ move was borne of “desperation” to “disrupt” the CVS deal. His board unanimously backed him.To observers, this seemed intemperate, but also sounded like CVS talking. Surely the directors of Caremark were supposed to stay at least somewhat open-minded?Scripts decided to go hostile and approach Caremark shareholders directly. Suddenly CVS and Caremark decided they would offer the latter’s shareholders a bit more – a special dividend of $2 a share (against a share price of $55 or so). Part of that was arguably their money already, but the dividend was still an improvement.Meanwhile, criticism intensified of multi-million dollar “change of control” payments promised to Mr Crawford and some Caremark colleagues, even though they were to be employed at the new CVS/Caremark – Mr Crawford as chairman. Such things hardly helped other Caremark directors appear independent and objective.Along the way, Caremark investors and Scripts had filed lawsuits. Enter Chancellor Chandler. On February 1, he blasted Caremark’s resistance to having director Roger Headrick make himself available to lawyers in Atlanta or New York. Mr Headrick – the lead independent director, a role meant to counterbalance executives’ influence – was apparently tired after a trip to New Zealand and did not want to fly from California.The judge, plainly annoyed, said Mr Headrick would have to “grin and bear” a red-eye flight in economy class, probably suspecting he might escape at least the second part of that hardship.As this week began, it seemed many Caremark shareholders were irritated or confused enough to vote against the deal at a meeting scheduled for next week.But then came a surge of activity. Institutional Shareholder Services on Monday advised against the CVS deal partly because of its “flawed process”. On Tuesday, CVS and Caremark tried to buy off sceptical shareholders with an increase in the special dividend to $6 and Chancellor Chandler fired off another barrel, telling Caremark to postpone next week’s vote until March 9 because shareholders had been given too little time.He singled out 11th hour disclosures that Caremark had considered a deal with Scripts more than once before – relevant, the judge said, given the company’s “protestations” that anti-trust worries make the Scripts offer too risky even to discuss.The bottom line is that Caremark’s shareholders are getting something like the auction they deserve – thanks in part to often maligned proxy advisers like ISS and the judiciary. The delay may be a bitter pill for Mr Crawford and his colleagues. But it is a tonic for good governance.
151;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;CVS/Caremark;;For sheer entertainment value, the fight over Caremark is getting hard to beat. The drugs benefits manager has been fighting a hostile approach from Express Scripts, a smaller rival. Meanwhile, its management team remains committed to merging with CVS, the retail pharmacy chain.Fortunately, independent proxy advisers have succeeded where Caremark’s board failed: forcing CVS to raise its bid by refusing to recommend it. And a Delaware judge has now stepped in to postpone a planned shareholder vote on the CVS deal. The show looks set to continue.In the meantime, though, it is worth recalling that this was originally supposed to be a nil-premium merger of equals. Of course, that was never quite right. After all, CVS shareholders were always going to own almost 55 per cent of the merged group. Now the pretence is wearing particularly thin. CVS has also agreed to pay Caremark’s shareholders a special dividend of $6 a share from the new company’s combined coffers.Given uncertainty over who will win, it would be wrong to assume that all of this is already anticipated in CVS’s price. The same applies to Scripts, which will probably need to raise its now only slightly superior offer to win. It must make up for higher risk, including that of regulatory delays.The bottom line, though, is that Caremark shareholders are starting to get what the company’s management should have aimed for from the start: an almost proper auction. Caremark’s management seems to have been aware that the original deal was, in effect, a CVS takeover – witness the “severance” payments it secured for itself. With Caremark’s shares trading at 22 times 2007 earnings, it is increasingly likely that whoever wins risks overpaying. The larger cash component in Scripts’ offer only strengthens the case that Caremark should finally start talking in earnest with its spurned suitor.
152;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-02-01T23:03:29Z;Caremark bids;;Bid tactics come in many flavours. In the battle for Caremark, both sides are taking an increasingly acidic approach. The drugs benefits manager is trying to dwarf a hostile approach from Express Scripts. It sees the decision of its smaller rival to refile an application for antitrust approval as a “transparent ploy to mislead Caremark shareholders” even though such steps are fairly common and could end by accelerating the approval.Meanwhile, Scripts is alleging “scare tactics” on the part of Caremark and CVS, the retail pharmacy chain, to promote their agreed merger. As with medicine, however, the real test of a bid tactic is its effectiveness. By that measure, neither side can claim much progress.Scripts’ offer still has the appeal of a far larger cash component – and the downside of potential regulatory delays. It also remains a tad higher even after adjusting for Scripts’ later closing.But Caremark shares continue to trade well above both offers. The premium to the revised bid from CVS is about 7 per cent after properly counting a special cash dividend to be paid out of the new company’s combined coffers. Investors are probably right to expect more from either or both bidders even though Caremark is already trading on a punchy 21 times 2007 earnings.Whoever wins, however, is likely to have a more hostile regulatory environment to cope with – and end by passing on a large chunk of the synergies pencilled in to consumers. Caremark’s management has done its credibility no favours by stubbornly refusing to talk to Scripts while negotiating favourable-looking side deals for itself with CVS. It probably has one last chance to redeem itself, by getting a better price – which CVS should be willing to pay if it has faith it its own synergy estimates.
153;CVS;CVS Corp;2007-01-16T20:48:00Z;Express Scripts in $25bn hostile bid for Caremark;;Express Scripts on Tuesday launched a formal $25bn hostile offer for Caremark Rx, its larger rival in the US drug benefits management sector.The move is aimed at breaking up Caremark’s agreed deal with CVS, the retail pharmacy chain, which is billed as a merger of equals. Caremark, however, has refused to entertain the proposal first made by Express Scripts in December, prompting the latter to address Caremark shareholders directly with a formal exchange offer.“While we would prefer to meet with the Caremark board and management to negotiate a transaction …we are taking this action in light of the Caremark board’s rejection of and refusal to even discuss our superior proposal,” Express Scripts said.The offer, roughly half in cash, is now worth about 7 per cent more to Caremark shareholders than the all-stock deal with CVS, which includes no premium. Express Scripts said there was a “compelling” case for merging two benefits managers compared with the combination Caremark favours.CVS responded to the competing offer by saying it would raise its own bid to include a special cash dividend for Caremark shareholders of $2 per share.Caremark’s board has been adamant in its support of the deal with CVS, which it believes has the potential to change the shape of the industry in the US by combining drug distribution channels and consolidating purchasing power. The deal has been cleared by competition authorities, while any sale to Express Scripts would face months of uncertainty.Express Scripts, with a market capitalisation of about $9bn, would also have to borrow heavily to finance the acquisition.Caremark has said the bid from Express Scripts is not “reasonably likely to” deliver a “superior proposal” to the CVS deal, and has not given Express Scripts access to its books.But with a competing offer now formally on the table, Caremark will have to persuade its shareholders that the potential benefits of the CVS deal outweigh the higher value on offer from Express Scripts.
154;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Caremark fight;;It is fun to see real bickering over a takeover. It makes a change from neatly pre-packaged leveraged buy-outs. US drug benefits manager Express Scripts’ proposal to buy larger rival Caremark shows the former’s “desperation” to “interfere” with the latter’s agreed deal with retail pharmacy group CVS, according to Caremark. The spurned suitor, meanwhile, has proposed directors for its target’s board and urged investors to block the CVS deal – which it has also attacked in a lawsuit.Caremark favours a premium-free, all-stock “merger of equals” with CVS. The combination – with a market capitalisation of about $50bn – could, over time, realise the value enhancements touted by proponents of the deal. The Scripts offer, half in cash, is worth about 10 per cent more. But it would involve a delay for antitrust clearance and high leverage.Weighing a seemingly solid, friendly deal against a higher but riskier one is a classic board dilemma. MCI’s former shareholders, for example, are probably regretting the company’s sale to Verizon, agreed in spite of a higher bid from Qwest. Since the deal was done in May 2005, the leveraged upstart’s shares have more than doubled, while Verizon’s have only edged higher. On the other hand, Guidant’s former owners might, with hindsight, wonder if they should have taken blue chip Johnson & Johnson’s stingy offer a year ago against Boston Scientific’s higher bid. Today, with Boston shares down more than 20 per cent, J&J’s cash and stock package would be worth more.At the same time, investors are often disappointed if a company that starts dating ends up single. CVS may yet win over Caremark shareholders with a better offer. But if shareholders vote down the CVS deal, Caremark might need to change its tune and talk to Scripts – or invite other offers. Entertainment value aside, the Caremark board’s dismissive attitude to Scripts looks short-sighted.
155;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Caremark bids;;Is Caremark blinded by its vision? There is a taste of that in the drug benefits manager’s strongly worded rejection of the hostile $26bn approach from smaller rival Express Scripts. Caremark is sticking with its plan to transform the industry by merging with retail pharmacy chain CVS.The average Caremark shareholder might raise an eyebrow. CVS is offering all stock and no premium but the deal actually feels more like a takeover than a merger of equals. By contrast, more than half the Scripts offer is in cash. Adding in the stock component gives Caremark shareholders a premium over the CVS deal of about 13 per cent.Caremark says the combination with CVS would take advantage of the changing US healthcare landscape, generating growth and financial benefits in the future – and that customers have welcomed it. Investors, however, are having more trouble understanding the vision. The simpler deal with Scripts might be less imaginative but it is easier to grasp the potential benefits.Both combinations claim $500m of annual cost savings (now that CVS and Caremark have unearthed an extra $100m of synergies). Both face integration challenges. The Scripts deal could run into antitrust delays but ultimately looks likely to be approved. The bigger risk is that the company, with a market capitalisation of less than $10bn, needs to take on some $13bn of debt. That leaves the Scripts offer somewhere between a strategic acquisition and a leveraged buy-out.But LBOs are setting valuation benchmarks these days. While the Scripts premium is hardly a knock-out, at least it represents close to the capitalised value of the synergies up front (and partly in cash). CVS, in contrast, is only offering to share the benefits over time. If Caremark’s board really prefers the “vision thing”, it should at least make CVS pay up.
156;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Caremark rejects Express Scripts bid;;Caremark, the US pharmacy benefits manager, has rejected a $26bn merger offer from competitor Express Scripts, citing “insurmountable” antitrust risks.Caremark accepted a $22.2bn offer from CVS, the second biggest US pharmacy chain, at the beginning of November, in what was billed as a “merger of equals”.But in mid-December Express Scripts launched a hostile bid for Caremark, its much larger rival, seeking to break up Caremark’s deal to merge with CVS.However, Caremark on Monday laid out a detailed and swingeing rebuttal of the Express Scripts offer.It said the “defensive and reactionary” Express offer was intended to derail the agreed CVS/Caremark merger and might be unviable due to antitrust problems, as it would combine two of the top three pharmacy benefits managers in the US.Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans.Caremark said the Express Scripts offer lacked strategic rationale, risked customer attrition and destruction of shareholder value, relied on dubious calculations of synergies, and would result in a highly leveraged and weakened business.It added said that some of its largest customers had voiced strong opposition towards an Express Scripts/Caremark combination, and that the uncertainties presented by the Express Scripts proposal would “virtually eliminate new business opportunities and make it difficult to renew existing contracts”.Caremark also accused Express Scripts of attempting to disrupt its relationships with clients.“Express Scripts’ proposal is not in the best interests of Caremark, its shareholders, customers and consumers,” said Mac Crawford, Caremark chief executive and chairman.“Caremark believes that its future success does not lie in simply creating a larger pharmacy benefits manager, but in becoming an end-to-end provider of diversified pharmaceutical services and integrated healthcare solutions.”Caremark said that the merger with CVS, which has cleared antitrust hurdles and it hopes will deliver $500m in cost synergies, was expected to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of this year.Express Scripts returned fire on Caremark’s attack by saying that their offer provided a 13 per cent premium to the proposed CVS acquisition price, based on the closing share price on January 5, and the claim of antitrust issues with the Express Scripts offer was “a red herring”.“Our offer represents a superior proposal,” Express Scripts’ board of directors said in a statement. “Caremark stockholders and the marketplace as a whole have demonstrated their strong support for our offer, which clearly provides Caremark stockholders with superior value to the proposed acquisition of Caremark by CVS.”The fight for Caremark marks a shift in the lucrative US prescription drug market as cut-price retailers such as Wal-Mart seek to break into drug sales as drug use rises thanks to a new plan under Medicare, the federal healthcare programme for pensioners.
157;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-12-18T22:01:03Z;US equities give up gains, settle lower;;US stocks settled lower, and retreated from early highs yesterday after a rush of new deals had propelled the S&P 500 to a fresh six-year high and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to another all-time peak.So far this year, companies have announced a record $1,690bn in deals, surpassing the $1,630bn that marked 2000.“These are sure signs of easy money, investor enthusiasm and a bull market,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, a division of Charles Schwab.The financial sector led gains for the S&P 500 index as nearly $90bn in proposed corporate deals was announced.Shares in Realogy jumped 19.2 per cent to $30.40 after the real estate group said it had accepted a $6.65bn private equity bid.Express Scripts tabled a $26bn offer to buy Caremark in a move by the pharmacy benefits manager that could stymie a $21bn all-stock bid made by CVS, which Caremark has already accepted.Shares in Caremark rose 10.5 per cent to $55.58, CVS fell 1.7 per cent at $30.01 and Express Scripts gained 1.9 per cent to $69.97.Biomet fell 1 per cent to $41.59 after the maker of hip and knee replacement parts accepted a $10.9bn private buy-out offer.Shares in Harrah’s climbed 3.4 per cent to $82.18, as the casino operator was expected to confirm a private buy-out offer valued at $90 a share.Eli Lilly increased its offer for fellow drug manufacturer Icos to $2.3bn, or $34 a share, from an original $32 a share. Shares in Eli Lilly retreated 2.4 per cent to $53.23, while Icos rose 1.5 per cent to $33.85.Shares in Shaw Group jumped 8.6 per cent to $33.20, after the engineering company won a contract to build four nuclear power plants in China with joint venture partner Westinghouse.In spite of early strength, stocks slowly turned lower during the day, with investors reluctant to chase the market at elevated levels said traders.Lower oil prices sank the energy sector, and the American stock exchange oil index slid 2.8 per cent.At the close, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent, or 4.61 points lower at 1,422.48, down from its earlier high of 1,431.66.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent, or 21.63 points lower at 2,435.57.Google lost 3.6 per cent to $462.80, and Apple fell 2.6 per cent to $85.47.The Dow closed 0.03 per cent, or 4.25 points lower, at 12,441.27, adrift of its new intra-day record of 12,490.70.Citigroup rose 2.5 per cent to $55.44, after setting a 52-week peak of $55.61, following an upgrade from Merrill Lynch from “neutral” to “buy”.General Electric also set a 52-week high of $38.13, and was 1.7 per cent higher at $38, after gaining 6.1 per cent last week.
158;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Express Scripts launches offer for Caremark;;Express Scripts has launched a hostile $26bn bid for Caremark, its much larger rival prescription drug plan manager, seeking to break up Caremark’s deal, worth more than $21bn, to merge with CVS, the drugstore chain.Express Scripts’ cash and stock bid of about $58.50 for each Caremark share offered a significant premium to the CVS all-stock, merger-of-equals with little or no premium to shareholders. News emergence of a bidding war sent Caremark’s shares soaring 11 per cent to $55.66 in New York lunchtime trading.The fight for Caremark highlights a shift in the lucrative US prescription drug market.Companies such as Caremark manage the prescription medicine plans for big groups, employers and Medicare’s drug subsidy for the elderly. However, the market is changing – drug use has increased with a new plan under Medicare, the federal healthcare programme for pensioners. Prescription drug middlemen are also finding margins squeezed on generic drugs. They also face potential Democrat-backed changes in Medicare law to give the government the power to negotiate prices.Wal-Mart, the US retail giant that has launched a $4 price for generics, also took a look at Caremark but decided against a bid, according to a senior Wal-Mart pharmacy executive.CVS sought to vertically integrate its pharmacy operations by adding the drug plan manager and distributor. However, the deal raised questions about future conflicts of interest.A Caremark deal with Express Scripts would combine two of the top three pharmacy benefit managers and would probably invite scrutiny from federal antitrust authorities and from Capitol Hill.Competition between the top three pharmacy benefit managers, including Medco, is a cornerstone of the Medicare drug benefit, which uses private market plans to negotiate prices, and prohibits federal government price negotiations.Robert Willoughby, analyst at Bank of America, called the potential Express Scripts deal a more “logical horizontal combination” than the CVS merger. In addition, it would process only 26 per cent of US prescriptions, which could help with regulatory clearance. “Caremark’s board will be hard-pressed to credibly thwart such an offer,” he said.Caremark said its board would review the Express Scripts proposal terms “in a manner consistent with its obligations under the CVS merger agreement”.CVS said “prospects for completing that transaction are excellent”, and it remained confident in the long-term strategic value.Meanwhile, Medco shares gained 2 per cent as the industry turmoil could benefit it.Christopher McFadden, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: “A prolonged battle for Caremark should be good news for Medco and its ability to gain market share.”
159;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-12-04T17:28:11Z;Pioneers of retail therapy;;At Wal-Mart these days, customers can fill up a shopping trolley with groceries, clothes and Christmas gifts, then step into a clinic for a vaccine jab.This medical spin on the weekly shop is being driven by companies such as Take Care, who rent retail space for clinics next to aisles of vegetables or camping equipment. Demand is so high that the company is considering installing “cart lockers” to keep shoppers’ items safe while they see a nurse.Walk-in clinics are a rapidly growing feature of the US healthcare landscape. Companies such as Minute Clinic, owned by US drugstore chain CVS, RediClinic, Care Clinic and Take Care are expected to have several thousand retail clinics open by the end of next year.But the booming industry has the potential to offer a lot more than a convenient place to treat the common cold. Advocates say they could fundamentally change how healthcare is managed in the US by providing the infrastructure for a nationally accessible system of electronic medical records.Such records offer a way of tackling skyrocketing costs in healthcare provision. Records accessible nationally, or even internationally, could help doctors and nurses diagnose and treat patients’ illnesses quickly without repeating costly and time-consuming tests.The current system is haphazard. About four out of five medical transactions in the US are handled in small clinics. Patients will often answer the same basic questions about their medical history on each visit. Records are typically stored on files that are scattered between small clinics, doctor’s offices or hospitals across the country.Craig Barrett, chairman of Intel, the US chipmaker, is a leading proponent of electronic records as a way of transforming health provision in America. “In healthcare, information technology is the answer,” he says. “Healthcare is a function of information technology.”Other countries are also chasing the prize. The UK’s National Health Service has the most ambitious and closely watched project to build a comprehensive electronic medical records system. But so far the project has proved difficult and costly, estimated at £20bn.Yet linking together the fragmented US healthcare system, which is privately based, poses an even bigger challenge. The government has made a tentative effort to begin the process. But efforts to move to an electronic system have met resistance because of fears over competition and the privacy implications of storing the data.To push the cause of the electronic age, Mr Barrett has formed a coalition of at least 10 large companies, including Intel and Wal-Mart. It aims to establish a standard for employees’ electronic medical records, with the data stored at an independent repository.Retail clinics could provide the impetus for reform. Since patients can walk in without an appointment and the services offered are relatively inexpensive, the clinics could act as a first stop for medical care for those with or without health insurance. Most important, they will be spread across the country.“We might be an enabler to create the electronic medical record, because we’re seeing a lot of patients,” says Peter Miller, chief executive of Take Care.As the number of clinics increases a vast database of information will accumulate. Take Care alone expects to be seeing 100,000 patients a year once its nationwide expansion plans are complete, says Mr Miller.Those records would be kept on a web-based network system accessible to clinics across the country. Moreover, the industry would have an interest in linking all clinic companies’ electronic record systems: the potential cost savings that would result from having access to patients’ treatment data.How does the system work? The process of creating an electronic record begins at the registration kiosks in walk-in clinics.Patients register on web-based systems, filling in basic personal and health information to create an electronic record in less than five minutes. This is then used as a reference throughout the treatment process.The data includes diagnosis and treatment, including prescription drugs ordered. In more complex cases, involving severe or chronic conditions – heart disease, for example – the patient can be referred to a doctor or specialist.Practitioners can use hand-held tablet computers to input data, or track and reorder the equipment used in the clinics and its stock – down to the level of a cotton wool swab.To improve efficiency, the systems can also review the work of a nurse practitioner, for example, comparing the time he or she spent with a patient to the cost of service.Patients can use their credit cards to check in and check out of a clinic and locate their individual records. After seeing the nurse they receive a print-out giving details of the care they have received.Jack Tawil, chairman and chief executive of CheckUps, says the company is working on biometric systems so that a patient can check in and locate records using their fingerprint. “I’m using the retail base as a platform,” he says. “Even hospitals don’t have what we have.”The stringent US health information privacy laws, however, are far from accommodating. Indeed, they could pose a serious stumbling block to setting up ways of sharing health information. There have been concerns raised, for instance, over the use of sensitive personal information by employers to discriminate against their employees.Walk-in clinics counter that they should at least be allowed to provide a basic electronic record – perhaps omitting more sensitive health information – to help doctors and nurses provide a better service. As suggested in Mr Barrett’s plan, that record – called a continuity of care record – could in future be stored on a secure system to ensure the privacy of patients is protected.The development of secure systems will be an important factor in building the trust of patients. Such trust may be particularly difficult because the industry is still in its infancy. Consolidation and change is likely, as providers fold or buy out rivals.In July, an industry study by the California Healthcare Foundation noted that the emerging clinics were an innovative idea, particularly amid a “scarcity of new ideas about how to improve the cost and delivery of healthcare.”The study added, though, that “questions remain about how the clinics will fare as a business model”, given that they must compete for retail floor space with other products and turn a profit.But several large employers, including Wal-Mart, appear to be lining up behind the clinics as a vehicle of change in US healthcare. Even those businesses that ultimately fail to thrive will be building up records that could form the basis for a future electronic records system.A healthy dose of efficiencyJack Tawil, chairman and chief executive of CheckUps, holds his prefabricated health clinics in high regard. “The feel is really like you walk into a [Manhattan] doctor’s office, not a Wal-Mart,” he says.Whether luxurious or not, the clinics are easy enough to set up within the vast floor space of the discount retailer.When a truck arrives to deliver a new CheckUps clinic, its contents have been packed so that they can be unloaded in a precise order for assembly. The walls come first, with finished interiors in rich cherry and maple woods. All the wiring is pre-installed. Laboratory equipment, including an X-ray machine, is rolled out, followed by the finishing touches of furniture, computers, medical supplies, doors and decorations.It takes the company only about nine days from being granted building permission to transform a 800 sq ft space inside the retailer into a low-cost, walk-in medical clinic.A nurse can then begin to see customers for minor illnesses such as sore throats or preventive measures such as vaccines. Clinics offer routine healthcare with prices of between $30-$50 a visit – significantly less than patients would pay to see a doctor.Such clinics are not only appearing in supermarkets. Companies such as RediClinic are now setting up operations in city-centre drugstores across the US.Operators hope that as well as delivering care, their well-appointed clinics will send customers an important message: access to healthcare can be inexpensive, but it does not have to look cheap.

161;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-11-02T02:27:26Z;Pharmacy deal may ward off pain;;By agreeing a deal to acquire pharmacy benefit manager Caremark Rx for $21bn, CVS on Wednesday moved to eliminate a rising competitor to its retail drug-selling business and expand its prescription benefits and mail order offerings.Investors seemed cool to the combination, sending both company’s shares down on Wednesday.The declines reflected concern over potential integration difficulties as well as confusion about why Caremark shareholders are not receiving a takeover premium.Citigroup analyst Charles Boorady said Caremark investors could still see a benefit. “Being a stock-for-stock transaction, the value Caremark’s shareholders will ultimately receive depends on where the price of CVS’s stock goes and it is premature to say they won’t ultimately receive a premium,” he said. In spite of the tepid investor reaction, analysts said the deal is not surprising given the rapidly changing US prescription drug sales market.The deal come as traditional pharmacies such as CVS face fierce competition from mail-order businesses and big discount retailers such as Wal-Mart.There is also increasing scrutiny of generic drug prices. Pharmacy benefit managers, such as Caremark, make most of their profits from the higher margins on generic drugs they sell through the mail.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) act as agents between institutional health plans and drugmakers.They administer prescription drug benefits for employers and major health plans and also operate mail-order pharmacies.PBMs negotiate volume discounts with pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies. CVS owns PharmaCare Management Services, a PBM, mail order and speciality pharmacy business.Caremark is among the largest PBMs by market capitalisation. It buys drugs from pharmaceutical companies then distributes them through its national network of about 60,000 pharmacies and mail-order offices.Since merging with rival AdvancePCS, Caremark provides drug-benefit services to more than 2,000 plans.If a deal is reached it “would fit well with CVS’s long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business, eliminate a major competitor for its retail drug business and potentially result in scale and distribution efficiencies,” said Joe Agnese, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s, in a research note.The combined CVS-Caremark company would have additional clout to negotiate steeper discounts with manufacturers and wholesalers, helping it fend off the rising threat from Wal-Mart’s healthcare initiative.Last month Wal-Mart shook up the US healthcare industry by saying it would slash the prices of about 300 generic drugs sold at its in-store pharmacies by as much as 60 per cent.In 27 states, Wal-Mart charges $4 for a month’s supply of some of the most widely used generics – copies of branded drugs whose patents have expired. The plan launched in Florida but was recently expanded.“If Wal-Mart extends the current programme across the US, and includes more drugs, the combined company would be better positioned to fend off the increased pricing competition for drugs,” Mr Agnese said.
162;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-11-02T02:20:14Z;CVS to buy Caremark Rx for $21bn;;CVS, the second-biggest US pharmacy chain, on Wednesday agreed to acquire Caremark Rx, a leading pharmacy benefits manager, for $21bn.Under the terms of the deal, which will create the largest pharmacy benefits management group in the US, Caremark shareholders will receive 1.67 CVS shares for each of their Caremark shares.The companies described the deal as a “merger of equals”. However, Tom Ryan, CVS chief executive, will continue to serve as chief executive of the combined group, which will be based out of CVS headquarters in Rhode Island. Mac Crawford, Caremark chief executive, will be chairman.CVS shareholders will own 54.5 per cent of the combined company if the deal goes through, and Caremark shareholders will own 45.5 per cent. The board will be split between directors from Caremark and CVS.The deal price does not reflect a takeover premium for shareholders in Caremark, which has a market capitalisation of $21bn. Caremark shares sank 2.2 per cent to $48.17 after the deal was announced yesterday afternoon. CVS shares dropped 7.4 per cent to $29.06Caremark’s stock option practices have been under investigation, which analysts said could help explain the lack of a premium.Mr Ryan called the deal a “logical evolution for CVS, Caremark and the entire pharmacy industry”.He added: “Over the past year, Mac and I have developed a shared view of where the healthcare market needs to go and how we can work together to get there first.”Both companies also released third-quarter figures on Wednesday. Caremark reported a 27 per cent jump in earnings to $288m, or 65 cents per share. CVS reported a 13 per cent earnings jump to $284m, or 33 cents.The combination of the two companies comes at a time when traditional pharmacies face intensifying competition from mail-order businesses, including Caremark and big discount retailers such as Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart last month said it would cut prices of about 300 generic drugs sold at its in-store pharmacies by as much as 60 per cent.The combined company is expected to fill or manage more than 1bn prescriptions per year. Analysts said that scale should enhance the group’s ability to demand better prices on drugs from pharmaceuticals companies.JP Morgan and UBS advised Caremark. Evercore Partners and Lehman Brothers advised CVS.
163;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-11-02T00:30:41Z;CVS/Caremark;;The proposed tie-up of retail pharmacy chain CVS and Caremark Rx, the drug benefits manager, is billed as a merger of equals. A cynic might wonder whether CVS is saying that to avoid paying a premium for Caremark. CVS shareholders will own about 55 per cent of the combined group if the all-stock deal goes ahead. Tom Ryan, the CVS chief executive, will head the executive team at CVS/Caremark, which will be headquartered in CVS’s Rhode Island home town. A chairman from Caremark and an even split of board seats seem like window-dressing.In its favour, the deal has the potential to lead the way in exploiting rapid changes in the US healthcare industry. CVS and Caremark are both big prescription drugs buyers. The combination would give them extra clout when buying from drug makers. That would help balance pressure to charge patients less. CVS’s retail outlets should complement rather than compete with Caremark’s growing mail order business. The new group might also be better placed to combat Wal-Mart’s recent initiative to sell generic drugs cheaply.The companies expect $400m a year in cost synergies, enough to add more than 5 per cent to the combined valuation of about $45bn, assuming a 10 times multiple after tax. But Caremark shareholders will get none of that up front. Instead they will have to wait and hope integration goes well – as well as sharing gains with CVS’s shareholders. Talk of additional revenue synergies should also be viewed sceptically for now.It might be argued that CVS shares are undervalued, giving Caremark’s owners a hidden premium. But Caremark shares have actually underperformed this year, albeit partly thanks to negative headlines including news of official investigations of its stock options grants. At first blush, at least, CVS looks to have struck the more advantageous deal.
164;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-11-01T21:29:01Z;Wall St lower as economic data weighs;;"Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as the good mood surrounding stellar earnings from MasterCard and healthy deal activity was punctured by economic data.That in turn aggravated concerns among investors that the economy could face a harder landing in 2007.After a bright opening, shares pulled back when the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index suggested activity was nearly at the threshold separating expansion and contraction. Housing and construction activity also slowed.In earnings news, MasterCard reported an 82 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings to $1.42 per share; well above the consensus estimate of $1.07 per share. Shares in the company closed $10.97, or 14.8 per cent, higher at $85.07.Merger and acquisition activity was also in the spotlight. R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it intended to buy Banta in a deal worth about $1.3bn. Shares in Banta increased by $7.87, or 17.8 per cent, to reach $52.15. Donnelley’s shares were 39 cents, or 1.2 per cent, firmer at $34.25.Pharmacy chain CVS and pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx, which has a market value of about $21bn, said they would merge, with CVS exchanging 1.67 shares for each share of Caremark. Shares in CVS were off $2.32, or 7.4 per cent, to $29.06. Caremark shares were down $1.06, or 2.2 per cent, to $48.17, once the terms were announced, down from a high of $53.65.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research Services reiterated its strong buy recommendation for CVS. “We believe such a transaction would fit well with CVS’s long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business,” said analyst Joe Agnese.The news buffeted the healthcare sector. Shares in McKesson swung sharply after its fiscal second-quarter earnings topped estimates and were off $1.10 or 2.2 per cent, at $48.99. Some analysts said a CVS-Caremark merger could reduce earnings at companies like McKesson.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 was 10.1 points, or 0.7 per cent, lower at 1,367.87. The Nasdaq Composite was down 32.4 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 2,334.35. Both indices were off earlier high points of 1,381.78 and 2,375.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 50.3 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower at 12,031.59.Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings were 19 cents a share; 1 cent below forecasts. Shares were 1.2 per cent or 24 cents lower at $19.77.Insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan, owner of Putnam Investments, said its third-quarter net income totalled 31 cents a share; below estimates of 35 cents per share. Its shares were up 96 cents, or 3.3 per cent, at $30.40.Shares in General Motors were off 27 cents, or 0.8 per cent, at $34.65, after October sales rose 22 per cent."
165;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-10-05T21:11:59Z;Low-cost clinics raise their profile;;Companies operating low-cost medical clinics in drugstores or big retail stores such as Wal-Mart are about to signal their arrival as a force in the US healthcare system by forming an industry association and lobby group.Clinic companies such as RediClinic, CheckUps and Take Care are leading the way in building low-cost medical clinics offering basic preventative medicine and health guidance, along with examination and treatment for minor illnesses.The clinics use a nurse practitioner who can write prescriptions, test and treat illnesses such as “strep throat”, and refer patients to doctors for more serious conditions.By the end of next year, hundreds of walk-in clinics will be open in some of the country’s largest drugstore and retail groups, including Wal-Mart, Target, CVS, Walgreens and RiteAid.The industry association, which may be called the Convenient Care Industry Association, marks a coming of age for the burgeoning industry, which could transform the US healthcare landscape. Some of the industry’s entrepreneurial energy is pushing to create a quicker and more widely available use of electronic health records for patients.It also marks a new voice in the scramble for healthcare funding, and in the debate over how to spend more efficiently.In addition it underlines that the retail clinics, which can cost half of a regular doctor’s visit at $50 (€38, £26.50), are keen to promote themselves.Jack Tawil, chief executive of CheckUps, said: “We’ve gone from legislation to wipe us out to ‘let’s get in right now because this is the future’.”Peter Miller, chief executive of Take Care, said: “We think it’s a great idea and really a sign the industry is coming of age. The industry is here to stay. We’re not creating a need, we’re solving a need.”The group will be based in Philadelphia and could include many if not all of the significant companies in the industry.It will seek to highlight the clinics’ attempt to make basic healthcare more convenient and thereby accessible, rather than be seen as merely a retailer of health services.Some of the items on the industry group’s agenda will be an attempt to establish and set out principles for the industry, ways to collaborate, and programmes to ensure consistent quality.Clinic companies also say they have been recently welcomed by large US healthcare insurers, which are increasingly arranging to pay for their patients’ visits to such low-cost, walk-in clinics.
166;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-10-05T20:41:02Z;Dow closes at fresh record high;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a fresh record high on Thursday as rising energy and mining stocks offset declines in parts of the retail sector.Crude oil futures pushed back over $60 a barrel following speculation the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could cut production.ConocoPhillips gained 1.9 per cent to $57.88, and oil services group Noble gained 4.6 per cent to $62.71.Prices for industrial metals also rose, pulling Phelps Dodge up 5.2 per cent to $82.76, while Freeport McMoran gained 5.3 per cent to $51.64.In a note to investors, Morgan Stanley’s Wiktor Bielski said commodities and commodity producers were now in a new long-term “super-cycle” of growth, helped by demand from China.“We believe this will be an extended commodity cycle with rising real prices for the first time since the 1960s,” he said. “The commodity price curve currently priced into the stocks is far too conservative.”Retail stocks suffered. Wal-Mart sank 2.3 per cent to $48.41 and supermarket chain Safeway dipped 4.7 per cent to $28.18. Department store Dillard’s tumbled
7.4 per cent to $31.15 after it disappointed investors with flat same-store sales growth in September.News that Wal-Mart would expand its programme of selling low cost generic drugs sent drugstore Walgreens down 3.3 per cent to $43.39 and CVS down 3.8 per cent to $30.93.At the close, the Dow was up 0.1 per cent, or 16.08 points, at 11,866.69 – its third consecutive record close.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 3.00 points, at a new five-and-a-half-year high of 1,353.22, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent, or 15.39 points, at 2,306.34.Steelmakers were lifted by acquisition news after India’s Tata said it was considering making a bid for Anglo-Dutch steel group Corus. US Steel climbed 8.4 per cent to $60.63, and Nucor ticked up 6.6 per cent to $51.98.Coffee chain Starbucks perked up 7.6 per cent to $38.69, its best one-day rise for more than seven months. After the markets closed on Wednesday, the company said September same-store sales had risen 6 per cent, almost double analysts’
estimates.Telephone and broadband service provider Qwest sank 3.2 per cent to $8.42 as investors shrugged off news of a $1.9bn share buyback and focused instead on the company’s decision not to pay a dividend. The stock is still up 47 per cent this year.However, wireless telecom group Sprint did better, gaining 5.2 per cent to $18.25 after a consortium of which it was a part successfully bid for new wireless licences.Marriott International rose 6.6 per cent to $40.85. The hotel group reported a 5 per cent fall in third quarter profits but still beat Wall Street forecasts."
167;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Wal-Mart fuels generic drugs price war;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday shook up the US healthcare industry by saying it would slash the prices of nearly 300 generic drugs sold at its in-store pharmacies by as much as 60 per cent.Bill Simon, who oversees the retailer’s pharmacy unit, said the company would start charging only $4 for a month’s supply of some of the most widely used generics – copies of branded drugs whose patents have expired.The move reflects growing scrutiny of generic drug prices, the retail prices of which often contain a large mark-up for middlemen including pharmacies and distributors.Mr Simon said the programme, initially launched at 65 stores in Florida, would extend across the state by January next year, and then be extended to the retailer’s nationwide network of more than 3,000 stores. Wal-Mart’s $4 price for a 30-day supply of metformin, the most widely used entry-level diabetes drug, will be 49 per cent lower than the branded drug price. A similar $4 supply of lisinopril, a high-blood pressure medicine, was 67 per cent lower than brand prices.Even with the planned reductions, he said Wal-Mart would not be selling the drugs at a loss, and that the company was not pressing manufacturers for price cuts.Wal-Mart’s move also comes on the heels of a crackdown on some generic drug pricing by UnitedHealth Group, the second-largest US health insurer. UnitedHealth has challenged the belief that generics are always cheaper, moving to discourage the use of 27 generic medicines because they were more expensive to the insurer than deeply discounted branded alternatives.The leading US drug store chains, who make most of their profits from generic sales, saw their shares fall on Thursday on the news. CVS was down 9 per cent to $32.27, while Walgreens fell 6 per cent, to $46.96, and RiteAid 6.5 per cent, to $4.45.The US generic market faces increasing pricing pressure as more and more competition enters the lucrative market. This competition is pressuring manufacturers’ margins, and moves such as Wal-Mart’s adds to this pressure, according to David Maris, Bank of America analyst.Wal-Mart this summer launched a marketing campaign focused on its pharmacy business, which it hopes can attract more customers and increase overall sales across its stores. Mr Simon said the pharmacies “are geared up to deal with significant volume increase” as a result of the new prices.Over the past year, Wal-Mart has responded to political criticism of its healthcare provision for its own workers by saying it is committed to reducing overall healthcare costs. It is expanding a network of walk-in clinics in its stores, which offer lower cost care for basic medical issues.
168;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-08-24T18:27:24Z;Rite Aid to buy US Coutu drug stores;;Rite Aid, the third-largest US drug store chain, is to buy the US store operations of Canada’s Jean Coutu in a $3.4bn cash, equity and debt transaction that underlines the continuing consolidation of the sector.Rite Aid is to pay $1.45bn in cash and $1.18bn in shares for 1,858 Brooks and Eckerd drug stores located mainly on the US east coast, expanding its total store network to more than 5,000. It will also assume $850m of Coutu’s debt.The company said the combined revenue of the two operations last year was $26.8bn, bringing Rite Aid closer in scale to Walgreens and CVS, its two main rivals. Walgreens also has 5,000 stores, with revenues last year of $42bn, while CVS, which has more than 6,100 stores, reported sales last year of $38bn.Mary Sammons, Rite Aid’s chief executive, said adding the stores “gives Rite Aid scale comparable to our major drug store competitors, and we believe this enables us to compete more effectively in a highly competitive business”.For Coutu the deal ends a troubled chapter in the US business. Two years ago the company bought 1,539 Eckerd brand stores from JC Penney, a department store group, for $2.38bn, but it struggled to integrate the stores, saying in April that the process was at least 12 months behind schedule.Coutu will be Rite Aid’s largest shareholder with 32 per cent of its shares after the transaction.Michel Coutu, who headed the company’s US operations, will become co-chairman of Rite Aid alongside Ms Sammons.The deal is the largest acquisition by Rite Aid since it emerged from an accounting scandal that rocked the company in 1999 after a period of rapid expansion. Martin Grass, the company’s chairman and chief executive at the time, was given an eight-year prison sentence in 2003.Coutu’s share’s rose 15 per cent in early Toronto trading to C$12.59, while Rite Aid’s shares slipped almost 4 per cent to $4.50 by midday in New York.Coutu’s problems contrasted with the success of CVS in integrating 1,260 Eckerd stores it acquired from JC Penney at the same time. CVS added 700 stores to its network this year with its acquisition of freestanding Osco/Savon drug stores, previously operated by Albertson’s, a supermarket group.Walgreens, which has focused on organic growth rather than acquisitions, said it planned to operate more than 7,000 drug stores by 2010.Citigroup and Rothschild served as financial advisers for Rite Aid, while JPMorgan advised Coutu.
169;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Boots on brink of deal with CVS;;"Alliance Boots, the international drug distribution and retail group, could soon be selling its No 7 lipsticks in Florida as it hammers out a deal with CVS, one of the US’s largest pharmacies, to roll out its own-brand ranges across the US.The companies are poised to sign a deal to put the Boots products – such as its Botanics skincare range and its No 7 cosmetics brand – into one-third of CVS’s 6,100 stores.Boots, after some disastrous overseas ventures in Japan and Europe, has focused its US expansion on partnerships with existing retailers, choosing CVS and Target, the discount retailer that has built a reputation for “cheap chic” products and design.It has been in partnership with CVS since 2004 and now has its “shop within a shop” concept in more than 50 stores. It also has product in more than 150 Target
discount stores, supported by a network of “beauty advisers” recruited by Boots.It is not thought that the deal will be affected by the £8bn ($15bn) merger this week of Boots and Alliance UniChem, the European drugs wholesaler.“This started as a stand-alone Boots deal, and is unaffected,” said one insider.The US roll-out is part of Alliance Boots’ wider strategy to put Boots products into a number of different countries.The newly merged Alliance Boots is already adding Boots’ ranges into Alliance’s 1,200-strong pharmacy chain in the UK and could, by the end of the decade, start selling Boots brands through Alliance’s 400-strong chain of pharmacies in Norway, the Netherlands and Italy.It could also use its pan-European wholesale network to supply independent chemists with Soltan suncream and No 7 products.However, Alliance Boots has no plans to enter the wholesale drugs distribution market in the US.Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of the merged company, said this week it would be impossible to get a foothold in the US wholesale market given that 94 per cent of the market is already controlled by three companies.“To go there and be a minnow player would be a kind of suicide,” he said.For CVS, the Boots deal is part of a broader drive to boost its margins through improving its cosmetics and skin care offer.It has struck a similar deal with Finland’s Lumene, a privately owned cosmetics company and has recently set up a US subsidiary to develop closer relations with CVS.Boots confirmed it was in discussions with its partners on Wednesday, declining to
comment further."
170;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-07-13T18:10:41Z;CVS buys walk-in medical clinic network;;CVS, one of the largest US pharmacy chains, has acquired MinuteClinic, the operator of a small but rapidly expanding network of walk-in medical clinics at its stores.The deal underlines the significance of the fledgling sector, which has seen the opening of scores of clinics providing basic medical treatment over the past 18 months at supermarkets, pharmacies and Wal-Mart stores.MinuteClinic is a pioneer in the sector, opening the first clinic of its kind at a supermarket in Minneapolis in 2000, supported by a backer who had grown frustrated with waiting several hours at a hospital emergency room for treatment for his son’s mild ear infection.The clinics, staffed by nurses, offer low-cost treatments for a range of basic ailments and are seen by their advocates as a way of reducing healthcare costs.The company operates 66 of its 83 clinics in CVS stores. The retailer has said it wants to roll out 300-500 of the clinics at its network of more than 6,000 stores over the next three to five years.Thomas Ryan, chief executive of CVS, said the decision to acquire MinuteClinic “was driven by our belief that this is clearly the right concept for consumers, payers and providers”. Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is also backing the concept, and is setting up 50 clinics at its stores this year after a successful pilot. Walgreens and RiteAid, the two other large US pharmacy chains, have also signed deals with Take Care Health, another clinic operator.The concept of providing healthcare at retail outlets has also gained attention in the UK, where J Sainsbury, a supermarket operator, has announced plans to open a pilot clinic. Wal-Mart’s Asda unit in the UK and Tesco, the biggest UK supermarket group, have also discussed in-store medical services with the British government.The British Medical Association has criticised the proposals, arguing it was inappropriate for healthcare to be dispensed in stores selling unhealthy products such as tobacco and alcohol.
171;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Amazon adds soup to its online offerings;;Amazon, the online retailer, has begun selling Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup, as it continues its push to establish itself as the dominant online one-stop shopping destination.The retailer’s US customers can now buy almost 2,000 basic packaged foods online, including 12-packs of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup for $12.99, and multi-packs of 70 individual servings of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes for $28.The retailer will also pay for the delivery of most grocery orders of more than $25 – underlining the degree to which it is absorbing costs as it expands its online presence into everything from sex toys to loose diamonds.Amazon said it had gradually expanded the “food and snacks” segment of its online “health and personal care” store in recent months. It said the move mirrored the increasing availability of basic food items at mainstream US drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens.“We look on this as a drug store, and you are going to find food items in a drug store,” said Tracy Ogden, an Amazon spokeswoman.By focusing on bulk purchases of non-perishable items delivered by parcel service, Amazon’s grocery sales contrast with the limited number of online grocers in the US such as Peapod, a unit of Royal Ahold, and Safeway.com.The move also reflects the development of websites such as 1800diapers.com which order bulk sales of low margin packaged items such as baby supplies, creating online competition for discount clubs such as Costco and Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club.Amazon’s food selection – beyond canned soup – is also dominated by more upscale, higher-margin brands in line with the demographics of its typical users, with organic products from Wild Oats, the second largest US organic and natural grocery chain, and from Paul Newman’s Natural Organics.But its bulk purchase pricing is also undercutting its online competition. Campbell’s Beef and Rice chunky soup, for instance, sells for $1.57 a can on Amazon, compared with $2.69 per can on Peapod, the largest US online grocer.However, one online grocer commented that Amazon’s bulk strategy didn’t seem to present a direct threat to a service that stressed fresh products and reliable and convenient delivery.Amazon offers a range of estimates for delivery of its food items, with the Campbell’s soup taking up to five weeks. Without free shipping, it would incur standard delivery costs of $9.65.Online grocery services have been less successful in the US than in Europe, reflecting lower population densities and differing shopping habits.
172;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-03-27T15:04:54Z;Walgreen reports 13.3 per cent earnings rise;;Walgreen, the largest US pharmacy chain, on Monday reported a 13.3 per cent increase in underlying second-quarter earnings and said the figure would have been higher if more Americans had got the flu this winter.Second-quarter earnings rose to $550.9m, including a $27.4m pre-tax stock option expense, up from last year’s $486.2m, which included a $4.7m pre-tax gain from litigation settlements.Walgreen said net earnings rose 6.6 per cent to $523.5m, or 51 cents per share, compared with $490.9m, or 48 cents, in the previous year. Revenues rose 10.7 per cent to $12.2bn.Dave Bernauer, chief executive, said “this quarter saw the impact of a much milder flu season than a year ago, [but] we continue to increase pharmacy market share and our prescription growth continues to outpace the industry”.Prescription sales rose by 11.1 per cent and by 7.4 per cent at stores open at least a year. Walgreens is expected to benefit from an upcoming wave of generic drugs to the market, carrying a higher profit margin for pharmacy chains than brand-name drugs. Mr Bernauer has said that two-thirds of Walgreen’s prescriptions would be for generic drugs by the end of next year.Overall same-store sales grew 6.5 per cent thanks to strong activity during the Christmas and Valentine’s Day shopping seasons, Walgreens said.The company opened or acquired 22 new stores in the first half of its fiscal year and operated 5,156 stores in 45 US states and Puerto Rico. It plans to operate more than 7,000 stores by 2010.Walgreen shares were up 1.2 per cent to $44.91 while shares in rival CVS rose 2.5 per cent to $29.78.
173;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-01-24T15:07:28Z;Lex: Albertson’s;;Hawking your wares to a single bidder is never the most comfortable position. But Albertson’s – after scaring investors in December by intially rejecting the only buyers in town – has checked out of the supermarket business in reasonable style. The three-way break-up values Albertson’s at about $26.50 – a premium of more than 25 per cent to the depressed price before it was put up for sale. More important, it avoids the messy prospect of current management trying to sort out the portfolio itself.Private equity group Cerberus and its partners greased the wheels for a deal by acquiring the rump of Albertson’s troubled grocery stores nobody else wanted. Those stores face stiff competition and are likely to be run for cash or sold off over time. CVS is paying a full price of about 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the attractive pharmacy business.Supervalu, meanwhile, has gone some way to living up to its name. It is buying Albertson’s strong positions in key markets such as Chicago, Philadelphia and New England, which are relatively insulated from the Wal-Mart threat. By offering a chunk in equity, it has not over-stretched its balance sheet. There will be distribution and purchasing savings. And it is paying 7 times ebitda for control – only a small premium to Safeway’s 6.6 times multiple according to HSBC.Food retail deals always carry integration risk. Supervalu is taking a big mouthful, by more than doubling its revenue. But its track record, and sensible plans to retain each brand’s identity, make the risk worth taking.
174;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-01-23T22:51:45Z;Ford helps get Wall Street engine running;;Wall Street bulls staged a modest rally on Monday, with auto stocks and Google racing ahead while the wider market managed a partial recovery following Friday’s steep sell-off.Optimism over Ford Motor’s unexpected profit rise and its sweeping restructuring plan sent shares in the ailing carmaker up 5.3 per cent to $8.32. Ford said the plan would shut down more than a quarter of its North American production facilities and result in up to 30,000 lay-offs.Rival General Motors benefited from Ford’s upswing to become the top performer on the S&P 500. GM shares surged 9 per cent to $21.85 while auto parts supplier Johnson Controls gained 4.5 per cent to $70.90.This, along with sharp gains in oil stocks helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average close 0.2 per cent higher at 10,688.77. The broader S&P 500 also gained 0.2 per cent to 1,263.82 while the Nasdaq Composite gave up early gains to close a fraction of a point higher at 2,248.47.Search engine Google and internet portal Yahoo were among the few technology stocks to make any headway. Google, which on Friday endured its sharpest-ever one-day fall, bounced back 7 per cent, or $28, to $427.50 while Yahoo clawed back 1.3 per cent to $34.17 following an upgrade from Bear Stearns. The broker said the stock’s recent sell-off had been overdone.By contrast, Intel shares continued their slump, losing another 1.9 per cent to $21.35 after last week’s 15.6 per cent slide.Research in Motion, the Canadian manufacturer of the BlackBerry wireless-mail device, dropped 3.6 per cent to $64.25 after the US Supreme Court turned down its request for an appeal.Elsewhere in the market, fresh merger and acquisition activity also helped keep investors in a buying mood.Shares in Albertson’s, the grocery company, advanced 5.4 per cent to $25.42 after a consortium led by SuperValu and CVS agreed to buy it for about $9.6bn in cash and stock.The deal would bring the auction for the second largest US supermarket chain to a close after nearly five tumultuous months. SuperValu jumped 6.7 per cent to $33.98 while CVS edged down 0.6 per cent to $26.96.Meanwhile, oil services firm Cal Dive International has agreed to acquire Remington Oil & Gas in a deal valued at $1.4bn, continuing the recent wave of consolidation in the energy sector. Remington shares surged more than 18 per cent to $44.80 on the news but Cal Dive fell 6.1 per cent to $41.64.Chemical maker Engelhard, gained 2 per cent to $40.50 in after-hour trading after it rejected a $4.9bn, or $37 a share, hostile bid from German chemical company BAS.Bank of America dropped 0.5 per cent to $43.96 after it reported its first quarterly profit decline in more than four years.
175;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Supervalu set to become number-two US grocer;;Supervalu, a discount food retailer and wholesaler, is on track to replace Albertson’s as the second-largest supermarket group in the US, after Albertson’s said on Monday it had accepted a $17.4bn buy-out bid from a consortium of retailers and financial buyers.Under the deal, Supervalu will take over 1,126 of Albertson’s best-performing supermarkets across the US, including the Shaw’s, Acme and Jewel names.The transaction will triple the size of the retailer’s operations, and create a company with annual revenues of about $44bn with a major presence in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and southern California. It will also mark a dramatic move upmarket for a company that built its retail business around cut-price formats such as the Save-A-Lot discount chain.The demise of Albertson’s, previously one of the three giants of the traditional US supermarket sector along with Kroger and Safeway, underlines the shifts in the business resulting from the steady rise of low-cost competition, in particular from Wal-Mart.Supervalu is shouldering the largest share of the buy-out transaction, offering $6.3bn in cash and shares and acquiring $6.1bn of Albertson’s debt. CVS, the leading drugstore chain, will acquire Albertson’s 700 free-standing drug stores for $3.9bn, continuing its strategy of seeking growth through acquisitions.A third element of the consortium, including Cerberus, a private equity group, and Kimco Realty, will take over 655 underperforming Albertson’s stores in Texas, Northern California and other western states, many of which are likely to be closed. It is also buying some of Supervalu’s stores in the Chicago area to reduce antitrust concerns.Jeff Noddle, Supervalu’s chief executive officer, said the stores to be acquired had significantly outperformed industry rivals, holding first or second position in their respective local markets. He also said that their experienced local management teams could fit easily into Supervalu’s own operations.“Wal-Mart has captured a lot of share of the business, but this is an enormous industry….We think the best operators are those regional operators who really care about their local consumers,” he said, adding that Supervalu was not planning major operational changes in the operations of the stores it is buying.The increase in Supervalu’s debt led ratings agency’s to warn that its debt would be given junk status if the deal went through. Mary Lou Burde, Standard & Poors analyst, cited risks including “the substantial execution challenges of acquiring a company larger than itself”.The deal will also give CVS the largest network of US pharmacies, with more than 6,100 stores. Dave Rickard, CVS’ chief financial officer, said the company was particulalry pleased to have secured Albertson’s Savon drug stores in southern California, saying it would otherwise have taken CVS “decades” to build up a similar presence in the region.The bidding consortium is offering $20.35 a share for Albertson’s plus 0.182 shares in Supervalu. Based on Supervalu’s Friday closing stock price of $31.85, the deal values Albertson’s at $26.15 a share, an 8.5 per cent premium over the previous close.Supervalu’s share’s rose 2.8 per cent on news of the deal to $32.79, while Albertson’s share’s rose 4.4 per cent to $25.60.Evercore, Lazard, Lehman Brothers, UBS and JPMorgan advised the consortium, while Goldman Sachs and Blackstone advised Albertson’s.
176;CVS;CVS Corp;2006-01-22T21:17:42Z;Supervalu set to venture into costlier aisles;;"Supervalu has taken a low-cost route to becoming the seventh largest grocery business in the US.Save-A-Lot, its largest brand with more than 1,200 stores, is a no-frills, hard discounter similar to Europe’s Aldi, that prides itself on having “no lobster tanks, cappuccino kiosks or floral departments”.Supervalu’s 230 larger format “price superstores” include Shop ‘n’ Save and Cub Foods – whose name stands for “Consumers United for Buying”. Almost half of Supervalu’s annual sales of about $19bn come from the unglamourous business of wholesale supplies.But the retailer is on the brink of venturing into far more costly shopping aisles, with its participation in a $17.4bn deal for Albertson’s, the second largest US grocer.Albertson’s has more than 1,700 supermarkets, most of them at least twice as large as the average Save-A-Lot store, and most including well stocked seafood counters, floral departments and Starbucks coffee kiosks. Its annual sales, at just under $40bn, are double Supervalu’s.The other members of the bidding consortium – Cerberus Capital and Kimco Realty – are expected to sell-off over 600 under-performing stores, while Albertson’s 700 free-standing drug stores will be sold to CVS.Left with the remaining stores - over 1,100 - Supervalu would join Kroger and Safeway among the largest supermarket operators in the US.“The sheer size of Albertson’s and the prospects of integrating its food retailing operations represents a massive shift in scale and price positioning for Supervalu,” wrote Ajay Jain, analyst at UBS Securities.Supervalu moved into retailing in 1980, when it acquired five Cub Foods stores in Minnesota. Under Mike Wright, its previous chief executive, it expanded, acquiring the innovative Save-A-Lot chain in 1991.The chain, now the largest extreme discounter in the US, has more than 800 stores operated under franchise agreements. It has a reputation for opening stores in tough urban areas and remote communities where other retailers fear to tread.Previously, Supervalu’s largest acquisition was a $1.2bn deal in 1999 for Richfield Holdings, a regional store operator. But Jeff Noddle, a 30-year veteran of the company who took over as chief executive in 2001, has shown interest in expanding its retail business through acquisitions.In 2003, a $400m takeover of Dominick’s, a Chicago-based chain, from Safeway was called off, and in 2002 it bought a St Louis-based chain of “dollar-stores” for an undisclosed sum.Mr Noddle told analysts this month that Supervalu viewed “the sale of Albertson’s and specifically the availability of its premier properties, as an extraordinary opportunity for the company to consider”.Karen Ghaffari, supermarket analyst at Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, also notes that Supervalu wants to expand the retail side of its business, over its lower-margin wholesale business. “This would move them very significantly into the
segment that they have been looking to grow in,” she said.But the acquisition will also represent a significant challenge. Currently, Supervalu’s store network includes only 60 traditional supermarkets, raising questions about the depth of expertise in a company that has been closely focused on discount retailing.The company’s Save-A-Lot unit, for instance, is still run by its founder, Bill Moran, while five of the company’s top seven corporate officers have been with Supervalu for more than 20 years.The sale of Albertson’s freestanding drug stores to CVS is also likely to increase the costs of operating the remaining in-store pharmacy network, although Supervalu does operate its own in-store pharmacy chain.But the biggest challenge will be moving into the heart of traditional supermarket retailing, at a time when the sector has been relentlessly battered by intense competition from Wal-Mart and Target among others, and by other low-cost discounters – including Supervalu itself."
177;CVS;CVS Corp;2005-12-22T22:51:52Z;Confidence filters through to Wall St indices;;Wall Street sprinted ahead yesterday after a string of generally positive economic figures renewed the view among investors that the Federal Reserve would soon end its cycle of monetary tightening.In addition to news of higher consumer spending and stronger US economic activity, investors were cheered by a soft PCE measure – the inflation gauge favoured by the Federal Reserve – which rose 0.1 per cent in the month rather than the 0.2 per cent expected by analysts.“The tame inflation data reinforced expectations that the US economy will accelerate, with inflation under control entering 2006,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach.The upbeat outlook on the US economy propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher to 10,889.44 on an otherwise thin pre-Christmas trading session.The broader S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent to 1,268.12, while the Nasdaq Composite, powered by a 1.3 per cent rally in the semiconductor sector, rose 0.7 per cent to 2,246.49.However, Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co, cautioned that the gains were nothing to write home about.“The gains follows the natural ebb and flow of market movement,” he said.Dow components Caterpillar and American International Group both advanced after being named sector favourites by brokerage firms. Caterpillar rallied 2.4 per cent to $58.45, while AIG firmed up 2.2 per cent to $58.45.Technology stocks were in focus after Research in Motion surged 10.6 per cent to $68.30. The Blackberry maker rose after reporting solid third-quarter profit.Investors were less enthused by Micron Technology however. Shares in the chipmaker slipped 3.5 per cent to $13.64 after it missed earnings estimates for its fiscal first quarter.On the deals front, General Electric rose 1 per cent to $35.42 after the conglomerate’s real estate unit agreed to buy commercial real-estate investment trust Arden Realty for about $3.2bn in cash. Shares in Arden fell 3.9 per cent to $45.18.Meanwhile, Barrick Gold looked set to become the world’s biggest gold digger after it agreed to buy rival Placer Dome for $10.4bn, or $22.50 a share. Shares for both companies fell, with Barrick easing back 0.4 per cent to $27.12 and Placer Dome dropping 1.4 per cent to $22.34.Shares of CVS, SuperValu and Kimco Realty all retreated after grocery chain Albertsons reportedly rejected the consortium’s $9.6bn takeover bid. CVS fell 1.6 per cent to $27.13, SuperValu dipped 0.1 per cent to $32.34 and Kimco edged down 0.3 per cent to $32.77, while Albertson traded 3.4 per cent lower at $23.28.Elsewhere, Google put on another 1.3 per cent to reach $432.04 after JMP Securities raised its 12-month target price for the stock to a staggering $575.Microsoft pulled back 0.5 per cent to $26.59 after the European Union threatened to fine the software giant $2.37m a day for anti-competitive practices.
178;CVS;CVS Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
179;CVS;CVS Corp;2005-11-01T18:32:49Z;Walk-in clinics get foot in door of US health;;"New Yorkers are used to shopping at the ubiquitous Duane Reade drugstore chain for basics such as toothpaste and shampoo, and stopping at it its pharmacy counter to get prescription drugs. But from this month, the local retailer will be offering customers at its Times Square branch something extra: medical diagnosis and treatment for basic ailments such as athletes’ foot and ear infections, delivered at low cost by a fully qualified “nurse practitioner” with the authority to write prescriptions.At the 50th Street store, a new RediClinic walk-in centre, operated by a division of Interfit Health, stands in a corner beneath the slogan “Get Well. Stay Well . . . Fast!”; it includes a small examination room and a waiting area, with no appointment necessary.By the end of the year, CVS, RiteAid, Target, Wal-Mart and Albertson’s – some of the biggest pharmacy operators in the US – will also have similar clinics, run by a handful of operators who say they are now poised for rapid national growth.“All of a sudden it’s an arms race,” says John Pleasants, chief executive of Revolution Health Group, which has provided investment in Interfit to fund the roll-out of RediClinics.Revolution was set up this summer by Steve Case, the founder of AOL – one of a number of investors and entrepreneurs who see not only a business opportunity, but also a way to promote change in the US healthcare system. Americans already receive flu shots and health screening at supermarkets and pharmacies: walk-in clinics could change the way they handle their basic healthcare needs, and reduce the costs.A recent survey by the Minnesota Council of Health Care Plans found that a visit to a conventional doctor for a throat infection costs $109, rising to $329 if the patient goes to a hospital emergency room – the first resort of many low-income patients on state-funded Medicaid programmes. Walk-in clinics charge about $50.“It is about making healthcare more accessible . . . more affordable and more transparent, and that will make healthcare more productive,” says Michael Howe, chief executive of one of Interfit’s rivals, MinuteClinic – which sports the slogan: “You’re Sick. We’re Quick”.MinuteClinic was born out of QuickMedx, a clinic company founded in Minneapolis by a local businessmen who had grown frustrated with spending three hours waiting in a hospital emergency room for a three-minute appointment to treat an ear infection. The first clinic opened in 2000. After changes in management and in its business model,
MinuteClinic opened clinics for Target and CVS. It now plans to have almost 100 clinics operating in about 10 cities by the end of the year, and hopes to open 300-500 clinics over the next three to five years, most at CVS pharmacies.The clinic operators are also using skills learnt in the world of retail and marketing. MinuteClinic’s Mr Howe, appointed in June, is a former chief executive of the Arby’s fast food chain who previously worked for KFC. He highlights the company’s reported level of customer satisfaction among the 300,000 patients treated so far: “We ask them to rate the experience. We’ve had 98.4 per cent saying excellent, and 1.6 per cent rating us very good.”The head of Interfit’s RediClinic division, Sandra Kinsey, is a former director of pharmacy marketing at Wal-Mart. Hal Rosenbluth, the co-founder of Take Care Health Systems, a clinic operator set up last year, was formerly chief executive of his own business travel business, which he sold to American Express in 2003 in a deal reportedly worth more than $300m.Mr Rosenbluth and his co-founder Peter Miller, a former president of Johnson & Johnson, say they ignored the advice of venture capitalists who told them to take a gradualist approach, and have now signed three initial deals with RiteAid, Albertson’s and Brooks Eckerd to open clinics in Portland, Oregon, Kansas City and on the US east coast.“Everyone said do it small, and crawl, and we knew from our research that this was a great idea – we said let’s build the executive team and the technology to get it right and then run real fast,” says Mr Rosenbluth.Expanding the clinics means winning over local doctors – to ensure support for the nurse practitioners and so that the details of visits can be properly communicated to a patient’s doctor. The American Medical Association, which represents US doctors, is sceptical, stressing the importance of the doctor-patient relationship, and warning that without a doctor’s attention, a serious illness may be overlooked until it is too late.Expansion also involves steering a way through complex qualification standards that vary from state to state, and finding suitably qualified staff – Take Care recently hired 30 of the 150 nurse practitioners in the Portland Oregon area in just 12 weeks. And for all the operators the concept is still at an early stage, despite the huge interest.“We don’t know whether it works best in a pharmacy, or a supermarket, or a supercentre,” says Revolution’s John Pleasants. “But you don’t want to be the guy who works for years perfecting a clinic at a store in Cleveland, who turns round and sees that everyone else has rolled out national chains.”The walk-in clinic model, he says, could offer more possibilities in the future. “Can these people become your health coach? Can they staff a 24-hour medical helpline that would operate on weekends? Can they help old people with working out their medical bills?”Meanwhile, Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, said in October that the retailer, which is currently testing clinics at 12 of its stores, wants to move towards setting up basic healthcare clinics in all of its 3,000 or so US stores. The company also sees the clinics as a way of reducing its own employee healthcare costs.“It really does add cost visibility and access to healthcare, so it seems like it’s going to work well inside a retail store,” Mr Scott says.Walk-in clinics are expected to increase business for their host retailers: MinuteClinic’s Mr Howe says that 25 to 30 people a day visit the established clinics, and that they obtain 90 per cent of their prescription drugs at the host pharmacy. But behind Wal-Mart’s interest lies the larger question of how to reduce US healthcare costs – as part of a shift to what Revolution’s Mr Pleasants calls “a defined benefit world”, where consumers need to be made aware of the costs of their healthcare.“In a sense we are part of the movement because we’re giving consumers the ability to access the system more easily, and to decide how they’re going to spend their dollars,” says Web Gonklin, chief executive of Interfit. “As long as customers are isolated from understanding their healthcare and how much it costs . . . then it is going to continue to be
inefficient.”Indeed, Mr Rosenbluth points out that one of the reasons he was attracted to the sector was the challenge of delivering a solution in primary healthcare that people said was unattainable. “It needed a private sector initiative, it couldn’t be done by the government.”CLINICS BORROW FROM THE CORPORATE WORLDWalk-in clinics at pharmacies and other retailers are staffed by a nurse practitioner who can diagnose and prescribe drugs for a limited range of non-emergency ailments. Clinic operators are trying to apply some of the skills they have learnt in the wider world of business:■Price visibility. Costs of a visit to a clinic in a retail store are set according to an easily visible menu, with prices typically at about $55 to treat basic ailments.■Convenience. Most clinic operators issue patients with bleepers after they sign in if an immediate appointment is not available, so that they can get on with their shopping while waiting for their turn.■Technology. TakeCare clinics include self-registration screens, where a patient enters personal details and describes symptoms before seeing the nurse. “Decision support software” is used to assist the nurse by providing the fullest possible range of potential diagnoses for the symptoms. Electronic medical records that can easily be transmitted to a specialist or to a patient’s doctor reduce the need to fill in more forms.■Customer focus. MinuteClinic gets patients to fill out an assessment of their treatment after each visit. Out of 300,000 patient visits in five years, it says 98.4 per cent of patients rated the service as “excellent”, and 1.6 per cent as “very good”.■Staff motivation. TakeCare offers its nurse practitioners compensation on a par with other healthcare providers, but includes a bonus linked to the profits generated by the clinic at which they work.There are currently fewer than 50 walk-in clinics operating in the US. But the number is set to grow rapidly with the support of big retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target and CVS, the drugstore."
