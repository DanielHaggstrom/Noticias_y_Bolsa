The MSCI All Country Energy index has trailed the broader global index by 35 percentage points in the past three years. Even after last year’s oil price rebound, boosted by an Opec production cut, the sector remains in rut. Get ready for more bad news: US oil production could hit an all-time high by the end of this year, analysts at Rystad Energy think. Unless demand can eat into oil inventories more quickly than it has, the equity bear market should continue through the summer.US onshore oil output is surging, according to the Energy Information Agency. By the end of June, production should be up 540,000 barrels a day. More than 90 per cent of this increase has come from one large shale region, the Permian in the US south-west. Note that the other two key areas — the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in South Texas — have contributed little to this recovery. In the second half of this year, the latter two will meaningfully add to US supply. Meanwhile, the Permian should chug along on its steady growth path. All three regions together by year end could put 900,000 barrels on to the market daily.Good news, you might think, for US companies providing everything from rigs to fracking equipment for oil explorers. If so, it is not apparent in their share prices. The Philadelphia Oil Service index has shed 24 per cent this year. Rig company Helmerich & Payne only aims to climb out from a loss, while fracking specialist Halliburton’s forward price to earnings multiple compresses to just 10 times in 2018, half this year’s estimate. Its share price has lost more than a fifth since this year’s peak in late January. The sensitivity of oil service shares to the broader energy sector negates any prospect of better future earnings.Presumably, markets have no faith in analysts’ estimates, regardless that oil has steadied around $50 per barrel. A bullish run for US oil production should give bears confidence.Do you think oil stocks are being overly punished? Is a contrarian, positive view warranted? Or are the bears right to keep selling?

This followed the bankruptcy filing of a Texas-based drilling group last week.JBC, oil consultants in Vienna, said: “We would be of the opinion that several other companies will end up suffering the same fate.”The oil industry is now watching the reduction in output triggered by the fall in prices as the operations become unprofitable.Wood Mackenzie, the energy and mining consultancy, said a Brent price of $40 a barrel or below would see producers shutting-in production at a level where there was a significant reduction of global supply.US onshore ultra-low production volume wells, known as “stripper wells” could be first to be cut, said Robert Plummer, corporate research analyst for Wood Mackenzie.According to the consultancy, with Brent at $50, 0.2 per cent of global supply was cash negative. At $45, the proportion rises to 0.4 per cent, and to 1.6 per cent at $40.The biggest contribution at $40 was from several Canadian oil sands projects. Shale oil production only started to become cash negative as Brent fell into the high $30s, Wood Mackenzie said.As the oil price fell, investors also focused on profit opportunities for oil traders.The sharp fall in oil for near-term delivery has steepened the futures curve, with spot oil trading at a hefty discount to forward-dated contracts.The condition, known in the industry as “contango”, will allow physical oil traders to arbitrage crude — buying oil and putting it into storage while, at the same time, selling a forward derivative contract to lock in a profit.February Brent was trading at a $7 discount to the August contract. The last time the curve was this steep, in 2009, oil traders such as Vitol and Trafigura posted record profits.Crude prices could see support as oil traders are likely to turn to the “storage play”, JBC said. “The physical market could also turn temporarily supportive over the coming months thanks to the balancing effect of floating storage.”
2;HP;Helmerich & Payne;2011-04-08T21:14:39Z;Wall St down on poor economic data;;"Shares in Expedia advanced after the online travel company announced it was splitting in two, but the wider markets lost ground after disappointing economic data and hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve official, leaving the S&P 500 index lower over the week.Investors reacted positively to the news that Expedia was spinning off its lucrative TripAdvisor business, sending shares in the company up 13 per cent
to $25.30. Analysts roundly approved of the move, saying that the plan could help unlock value for the high-growth and high-margin TripAdvisor. “We view such corporate activity as a positive catalyst for Expedia shareholders,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,328.11, leaving the index down 0.3 per cent over the week. Sentiment was subdued by economic data showing that the inventories of US wholesalers rose in February but their sales fell, a sign of uncertainty in the economic recovery.The markets were also unsettled by comments from Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, who said that the central bank was near the “tipping point” where it should start to focus more on combating inflation than stimulating employment.Not helping sentiment was the growing threat of a government shutdown as US lawmakers struggled to agree on a 2012 budget before midnight.Historical evidence suggests that the market impact of a shutdown would not be devastating. In the five-day period in November 1995 that the government was shut down, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent. During the subsequent 21-day shutdown later on that year the index added 0.1 per cent.Still, as the shutdown loomed the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent o 12,379.90 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 2,780.41. The Dow was flat over the week and the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent.The energy sector was one of the few winners in the session, led by oilfield services stocks as oil prices climber higher. Nabors Industries, the world’s largest land rig contractor, added 3.5 per cent to $31.56 while Helmerich & Payne gained 2.2 per cent to $68.98. The S&P energy index was up 0.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector Hercules Offshore lost ground after announcing that it was under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares in the oil exploration group were down 11.3 per cent to $5.66.Seagate Technology added 7.6 per cent to $15.84 after the hard-disk manufacturer reported third-quarter sales that topped analyst estimates and said that it would reinstate its dividend payments.The mood on Wall Street was cautious as investors paused for breath following a 6 per cent rally in the previous weeks when the markets were bouncing back from losses sustained during the turmoil in north Africa, the Middle East and Japan. There was also little economic data to direct the markets and many traders were waiting for the start of the earnings season next week.“The markets are just passing the time at the moment and will need months of good employment news before they get their next leg up. This will likely happen in the summer and take the S&P 500 up to 1,450,” said Linda Duessel, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors. This suggests the markets will put on another 8.7 per cent before the end of the year, adding to the 5.6 per cent already put on.The materials sector saw some of the biggest gains over the week, lifted by deal activity in the sector and rising commodity prices.On Monday, Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m. Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn bid for Equinox Minerals.Molycorp was up 13.4 per cent to $67.19 over the week while Equinox Minerals gained 35.8 per cent to $8.05. The S&P materials sector was up 0.2 per cent over the five days.The S&P retail sector was up 1.2 per cent over the week after a series of strong March same-store sales growth figures from key industry players. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 2.9 per cent to $76.41 over the week.The markets were briefly shaken on Thursday by news that another earthquake had hit Japan, but recovered quickly."
3;HP;Helmerich & Payne;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Venezuela to nationalise US oil rigs;;Venezuela is nationalising 11 oil rigs belonging to US driller Helmerich & Payne, the latest in a series of takeovers in President Hugo Chávez’s drive to create a socialist economy in the middle of a recession.Battling a fall in oil output and rising inflation, Mr Chávez’s government has been tightening its grip over the economy in recent years – nationalising electricity, steel and cement companies as well as a handful of banks. Mr Chávez has also threatened to take over Polar, the nation’s top food producer.Helmerich & Payne, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had halted work on all 11 of its Venezuela rigs for months following an extended dispute with state-run Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, over payment.Rafael Ramirez, oil minister, alleged Wednesday that the move was part of a plot to reduce crude production by sectors opposed to Mr Chávez’s government.“There’s a group of oil rig owners that has refused to discuss rates and services with PDVSA,” Mr Ramirez said in a statement. “This is specifically the case with Helmerich & Payne …We’re not going to allow them to sabotage our operations.”A spokesperson for Helmerich & Payne was not immediately available for comment.PDVSA racked up billions of dollars in debts with contractors last year as it renegotiated contracts in a bid to reduce costs by 40 per cent. Mr Ramirez later said that PDVSA was paying down those debts, but complaints from some companies continued.The largely pro-Chávez National Assembly also approved a law enabling PDVSA to take over contractors without following the usual procedures to expropriate business, and Mr Chávez ordered the nationalisations of dozens of smaller service companies.PDVSA had earlier taken over a rig owned by Dallas-based Ensco International after it suspended operations, saying it was owed $35m. Other foreign rig operators, including Halliburton and Schlumberger, continue to work in Venezuela and maintain cordial relations with the government.In 2007, Mr Chávez nationalized four major oil projects, prompting Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to leave the country and file for international arbitration rather than accept a minority stake.But other foreign companies, including Chevron, stayed on, and earlier this year, Venezuela inked deals with Chevron, Repsol YPF and other investors to develop new fields in the same oil-producing region in eastern Venezuela.Venezuela relies on oil for 95 per cent of exports, but crude production has slumped slightly over the past two years – to 2.25m barrels per day in May, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
4;HP;Helmerich & Payne;2010-04-15T21:34:45Z;Wall St up as earnings overshadow jobs data;;"Strong earnings results from UPS and Yum Brands pushed US stock prices higher on Thursday for the sixth consecutive session, overshadowing disappointing US jobless claims, poor industrial production figures and resurgent worries about the Greek fiscal situation.Benny Lorenzo, chairman and chief executive at Kaufman Brothers, a boutique investment bank based in New York, said: “I don’t think the earnings results are already priced in. Overall, earnings are likely to pleasantly surprise the markets.“The question is what happens after the earnings cycle. We are probably looking at seasonal weakness around the summer, where we could get a 5-10 per cent correction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,211.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,144.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,515.69.UPS added 5.3 per cent to $68.89 after the package delivery company, which is often regarded as a bellwether for the wider economy, reported better-than-expected quarterly results after the session’s close on Wednesday and raised its full-year earnings forecasts.Adjusted earnings were 71 cents a share, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus expectations of 57 cents.Revenue rose 7 per cent, helped by significant volume growth in international markets.Rival FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline, was up 1.7 per cent to $95.62.Yum Brands rallied 2.6 per cent to $42.78 after reporting strong first-quarter results after the close of the session on Wednesday.The company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other restaurant chains, said profit in the quarter rose 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China and a Pizza Hut $10 pizza promotion.Shares in Citigroup pulled back 2.4 per cent to $4.81. For much of the session they bounced around the $5 mark – an important level for the stock because some investment funds are prohibited by their own charters from investing in sub-$5 stocks.Las Vegas Strip casino owner MGM Mirage dipped 5.5 per cent to $14.57 after posting a preliminary first-quarter loss of 22 cents a share and revenues of $1.46bn. Consensus expectations were for a loss of
21 cents a share.However, it was not clear whether the preliminary results and the estimates were comparable. Full results would be announced in the first week of May, MGM Mirage said.The company also said it would issue $750m in convertible debt.Rival Las Vegas Sands, a US casino operator that is focusing on expansion in Singapore and Macao, lost 1.2 per cent to $23.72.Mariner Energy, an oil and natural gas producer, jumped 42 per cent to $25.68 on news it is to be acquired by Apache Corp, the second-largest independent US oil producer by market capitalisation, for $2.7bn in cash and stock.Apache Corp was 1.3 per cent lower at $106.67.PPG Industries, a leading paint maker, rose 0.3 per cent to $69.73 after the company reported strongly better-than-expected quarterly results.Excluding non-recurring items, the earnings were 70 cents per share, compared with consensus expectations of 63 cents per share. Revenue increased 12.3 per cent.Google, the online search engine company, added 1.1 per cent to $595.30 ahead of its first-quarter earnings report to be released after the session’s close.Oklahoma-based oil and gas driller Helmerich & Payne rose 2 per cent to $40.74 on unconfirmed market speculation that Statoil, a Norwegian energy group, was planning to buy it for about $5.6bn.American Superconductor, a maker of electrical systems for wind farms and turbines, was up 9.7 per cent to $31.89 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank. The broker cited expected growth in demand from China this year.Dallas-based cement producer Texas Industries lost 4.4 per cent to $36.76
as Shamrock Capital Advisors, a fund that owns about 10 per cent of
the company’s stock, announced that it was liquidating its funds following the death of its founder."

7;HP;Helmerich & Payne;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
