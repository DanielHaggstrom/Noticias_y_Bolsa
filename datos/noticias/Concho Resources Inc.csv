0;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2018-12-06T18:16:29Z;Shale stocks battered as oil prices fall;;US shale oil producers were among the worst performers in the S&P 500 on Thursday, posting sharp losses as falling crude prices increasingly threaten the industry’s profits.Cimarex Energy, Concho Resources and Diamondback Energy, three companies with operations in the Permian Basin of Texas, saw their shares tumble. Cimarex was down 8.9 per cent, while Concho Resources and Diamondback Energy dropped 7.2 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively. Marathon Oil slipped 6.2 per cent.The broader S&P energy sector was down 3.1 per cent, the main laggard on another rough day for Wall Street.During a meeting in Vienna on Thursday, Opec members agreed to slow their production of oil in an effort to boost prices. But Opec has delayed a final decision on the size of the cut until it concludes talks with Russia and other non-members, possibly on Friday.Lingering doubts about Opec’s expected production cut, combined with concerns of waning demand and a global oversupply, sent oil tumbling in November to its worst month in over a decade. With the slide in prices, the debt of riskier US energy companies has sold off. Junk-rated borrowers are paying nearly 5.5 percentage points over investment grade US Treasuries, the widest spread since June 2017, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.Oil resumed its slide on Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate crude dropping 3.3 per cent to $51.14 a barrel clawing back losses of more than 5 per cent earlier in the session. Brent, the international benchmark, lost 3.4 per cent at $59.44 a barrel. A drawdown in US crude stockpiles last week, fuelled by higher exports, helped prices curb their losses in midday trading.Natural gas prices were also on the decline, slipping 1.8 per cent to $4.391 per million British thermal units.Slumping prices could be particularly damaging to producers in the Bakken, Permian and other US shale regions. The process of extracting oil from shale rock is costlier than conventional drilling, though in recent years, shale producers have lowered their break-even prices — the minimum required to drill at a profit.The American shale boom has led a surge in domestic production over the past decade, and many wells that were idled during a period of weak prices in 2015 and 2016 have since been revived. The US Energy Information Administration last month raised its outlook for US output, predicting it would surpass 12m barrels a day by mid-2019.

The value of $5bn-plus deals is more than triple year-ago levels, according to data provider Thomson Reuters.More than half of the $1.2tn worth of acquisitions in the first quarter — the fastest start to a year ever — have been worth in excess of $5bn.The overall level of activity is up more than 67 per cent from a year earlier and about a third ahead of 2007, the previous high-water mark for takeovers.The surge of big transactions — with more than 20 deals worth at least $10bn — has been bolstered by a desire by boards to head off disruptive technological threats and accelerate growth, according to bankers and lawyers who spoke to the Financial Times.The deals have been spurred by quickening global growth and robust business confidence, as well as tax cuts passed in the US last year that have added to the firepower for marquee acquisitions.“In an environment where growth is back, companies feel the pressure to justify the multiples they are trading on,” said Alison Harding-Jones, Citigroup’s Europe, Middle East and Africa M&A head.Dealmaking in Europe has more than doubled from year-ago levels, led by accelerating activity in the UK, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Some bankers and lawyers expect the pace of divestitures to accelerate, opening the door for private equity groups.That was apparent in a €10.1bn deal, including debt, clinched this week between Carlyle and Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel for the latter’s speciality chemicals business. The acquisition is one of the largest European private equity deals agreed in recent years.Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden, said companies were being vigilant about potential political risks but for the time being there was no evidence that the pace of deal talks would slow down later in the year.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-KhanHere are some of the significant themes that have emerged in the first quarter of dealmaking in 2018.Morgan Stanley dethroned its rival Goldman Sachs from the top of the world’s M&A rankings in the first quarter of 2018, due to a consistent pipeline of megadeals in the first three months of the year, writes James Fontanella-Khan.Morgan Stanley advised buyers and sellers around the globe for a total of $385bn worth of deals, about a third more than the $264bn worth of transactions Goldman advised on during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.The advisory division led by Robert Kindler, Morgan Stanley’s vice-chairman and global head of M&A, worked on fewer deals than Goldman during the same period — 65 compared with 85 — but on significantly more big-ticket transactions.Morgan Stanley advised on six out of the 10 largest deals, including US health insurer Cigna’s $68.5bn acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts and European media group Sky, which was approached by US cable company Comcast in a deal worth $39.8bn.Although the data for Morgan Stanley were slightly skewed by the inclusion of Unilever choosing Rotterdam over London for its single legal base — which Thomson Reuters valued as a $90.5bn transaction — the New York investment bank would have still ended the quarter at the top.JPMorgan Chase and Citibank followed the two investment banks in third and fourth position in the rankings, respectively.Centerview Partners, which jumped from 21st to fifth in the ranking, was the only boutique investment bank to make it into the top 10.The firm co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan advised Express Scripts in its sale to Cigna and Thomson Reuters in the $17bn sale of the majority of its financial and risk assets to Blackstone.Bankers and lawyers are blaming regulatory uncertainty and jittery relations between the US and China for a 15 per cent decline in Chinese cross-border dealmaking so far this year, writes Don Weinland.Chinese companies spent just $25.2bn on overseas assets in the first quarter, while the number of deals fell to the lowest mark since 2005, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The only sizeable negotiation so far in 2018 was Geely’s unsolicited $9bn investment in Germany’s Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz.Behind the low deal count is a deterioration of relations between China and the US and more resistance against China’s acquisitions of US technology.“For me the biggest challenge is the regulatory uncertainty in the US and the future of US-China relations,” said Miranda So, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Davis Polk. “It’s this risk that has subdued some of the appetite for overseas deals.”In a report for new tariffs on Chinese exports last week, the US named several companies that have repeatedly bought US businesses and technologies. The accusation from the US administration is that Chinese policy and cheap loans from state banks were behind the flurry of deals over the past three years.But M&A activity is expected to pick up in coming months as China’s political situation firms up, although the focus could fall outside of the US.“The government’s new economic team is in place in Beijing and everything has settled down,” said Tang Zhenyi, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank CLSA. “Now the corporations can focus on going out, on going global. I think that means it will be a big year for Chinese companies doing overseas deals.”A series of sensitive political meetings kicking off in October of last year had disrupted deal flows in 2017, with companies such as HNA Group waiting for clarity on what types of outbound investment would be allowed.The crackdown was swift, just as much as it was unexpected. In short order earlier this month, the US government acted to, in effect, block the prospects of the largest technology acquisition of all time: the $142bn takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom, writes Arash Massoudi.The use of national security concerns by President Donald Trump to block a takeover that had yet to be agreed was unprecedented and spooked dealmakers around the world at a time when the US government is pursuing more protectionist policies.It is uncertain whether a further freeze in global dealmaking will take a hold, but for now cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for more than $511.7bn in overall activity in the first quarter of this year. That is up 76 per cent from the same period a year ago and advisers see no sign that a slowdown is coming.“M&A dialogue remains robust despite concerns about the potential impact of changes in America’s trade and national security policies on deal activity,” said Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden.One area where the US actions did have an effect however was in deals from China, with companies from the country registering just 4 per cent of the activity so far in 2018.US companies launched more than $101bn worth of overseas deals, with the largest move coming from cable group Comcast as it tries to break up a takeover of UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky.Other significant cross-border transactions in the period include Italy’s Atlantia and Spain’s ACS teaming up to jointly take over Abertis, the Spanish highway concessions group.The largest European deal into the US came in January when privately held consumer group JAB Holding agreed to pay $18.7bn in cash to acquire soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple and combine it with its Keurig Green Mountain coffee business.Global private equity deals have enjoyed their strongest start in five years, buoyed by the record amounts of cash flowing into the sector as institutional investors look for ways to boost their returns, writes Javier Espinoza.Buyout-backed transactions totalled $79.7bn in the first quarter, a 30 per cent rise from a year earlier. The figure represents 7 per cent of overall global dealmaking activity, according to Thomson Reuters data.The US saw the biggest increase in private equity transactions with a 52 per cent rise in deals led by buyout funds, accounting for a total of $46.4bn so far this year. In Europe dealmaking jumped 27 per cent, totalling $19bn and the most active year since 2007. Asian deal flow shrank slightly.The two largest transactions for the first quarter were Blackstone’s $17bn acquisition of the financial terminals and data unit of Thomson Reuters and Carlyle’s €10.1bn acquisition of Akzo Nobel’s speciality chemicals unit.Rob Pulford, head of financial sponsors for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs, said he expects activity levels to surpass those of 2017. He said: “This year is as good as last year and I think 2018 will be even more active. We are seeing the biggest deals in a long time.”Mr Pulford expects a bulk of the deals to come from private equity groups acquiring listed companies following a doubling in the value of such deals last year. “The level of dialogue and conversation around public to private transactions has accelerated from last year. Boards of companies have decided that what’s on offer is compelling,” he said.But as the pace of dealmaking speeds up, advisers to buyout funds have warned that there is a risk of overpaying for assets as multiples have already surpassed the record highs of before the financial crisis.* This article has been amended since original publication to correct the denomination of the Nex Group acquisition from dollars to pounds
2;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2018-03-28T19:42:28Z;Concho investors shun biggest US oil deal in six years;Takeover valuing RSP Permian at $9.5bn including debt is harshly judged;Concho Resources, one of the most successful US shale oil producers in recent years, underlined its confidence in the industry by agreeing a $9.5bn deal to buy rival RSP Permian but was punished by investors who feared it was overpaying.The two companies on Wednesday said they had agreed an all-share deal valuing RSP at $9.5bn including debt, offering a premium of 29 per cent to the shares’ closing price on Tuesday.The takeover is the largest in the US exploration and production industry since 2012. It will make Concho the biggest oi l and gas producer from shale in the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico, which has been the hottest area for investment in the US oil industry in recent years.However, the initial market reaction was negative for Concho, with its shares dropping by nearly 9 per cent to trade at about $143.09. RSP’s shares were up 16 per cent at almost $45.The deal values RSP’s assets at about $76,000 per acre of drilling rights, which was “substantially higher” than for other acquisitions in the Permian in the past couple of years, according to Mark Lear, an analyst at Jefferies.Concho argues that the deal will provide benefits with a present value of about $2bn from fitting together the two companies’ assets. In some places across the Permian basin they have drilling rights in contiguous areas. Putting their acreage together will make it possible to run more horizontal wells from a single location, known as a “pad”, and will help with drilling the longer wells that are becoming increasingly common in shale production.Tim Leach, Concho’s chief executive, told analysts on a call that the cost savings and productivity gains from those larger development projects “will be the most immediate efficiency gains” from the deal.The takeover would also allow the two companies to pool their knowledge of the region and share best practices, improve buying power when securing services including drilling rigs and pumps for hydraulic fracturing, and allow savings of $60m per year in administrative costs.Another benefit, Mr Leach said, would come from the combined company being able to focus its capital spending on the highest-return projects across the two sets of assets.The value of the deal is about $8bn in equity, based on Concho’s share price before the announcement, and about $1.5bn in RSP’s debt. The terms offer 0.32 Concho shares for every share in RSP. Concho shareholders will own about 75 per cent of the combined company, and RSP’s shareholders about 25 per cent.
3;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2018-03-28T17:35:21Z;Permian M&A: head Concho;Even M&A is disciplined now in the shale patch;The uncharacteristic self-discipline recently talked up among US shale oil and gas drillers has turned out to be real. The proof, ironically enough, is found in an M&A deal. On Wednesday, Concho Resources, one of the more successful frackers, announced its acquisition of Permian Basin rival, RSP Permian, at an enterprise value of nearly $10bn.Concho shares have almost doubled since the beginning of 2016. Its production boomed nearly 30 per cent last year but, more importantly, its capital spending can be fully funded from its operating cash flow.This is an all-share deal. Concho is offering RSP’s investors a quarter of the new group. With no new debt to be issued, Concho’s superior valuation multiples — both on profit and cash flow — mean the deal will lift earnings cost efficiently. But Concho stock fell nearly a tenth on Wednesday, demonstrating that investors remain reluctant to give the sector the benefit of the doubt.The most recent explosion in US oil production has been driven by the high output Permian basin where advanced “horizontal” drilling has allowed Concho and others to keep down spending. The companies in the area remain fragmented. They range from wildcatters backed by private equity to oil majors trying to buy their way in and independents like Concho.Credit Suisse estimates Concho is paying a 50 per cent premium to the average trading price per drilling location in the Permian. But by staying within this region, Concho estimates that there are $2bn worth of combination benefits which compares to an initial gross premium value of $1.8bn.The Concho stock reaction likely reflects action among hedge funds that automatically short acquirer stocks. Long term shareholders probably wanted to take money off the table after a sustained run up. But if Concho can keep delivering profit growth and oil prices remain steady, it will keep building firepower to snap up even more Permian assets. Cash profitability is great and looks even better at scale.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

4;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2018-03-04T09:15:04Z;Boom times for US shale oil producers;Industry emerges from downturn more productive and propels spectacular output growth;"“We are in the BOOM of FRAC SAND HAULING” proclaims a job advertisement on the website Indeed.com. Dozens of companies are looking for truck drivers in west Texas to haul the sand used for hydraulic fracturing, one of the processes that has unleashed the US shale oil revolution of the past decade. The sand is mixed with water and chemicals and pumped into wells at high pressure, to open cracks in the rock through which oil can flow.Drivers in the oilfield lead a rugged existence — they might work a rotation of three weeks on, one week off, and rely on truck-stop bathrooms for washing when they are on the road — but it has its rewards. Employers are offering $100,000 per year, sometimes more, and new vacancies are opening up all the time. There have been 12 new job adverts for sand truck drivers in west Texas posted just in the past week. To rev up excitement, one has a simple message: “THE OILFIELD IS BOOMING!!!!”The drivers wanted ads are a sign of how rapidly the US oil industry is changing. Over 2010-14, US crude production put on one of the strongest bursts of growth in the history of the oil industry, but the industry became a victim of its own success as oversupply in world markets sent prices tumbling, pushing it into a downturn. Activity slumped and dozens of companies were forced into bankruptcy.The rebound in crude prices to over $60 a barrel has brought shale oil producers roaring back to life again, but the industry has not simply returned to where it was before the collapse. Geographically and technologically, it has evolved, and the companies that have survived are more capable, more efficient, and better able to survive lower crude prices.As Bill Thomas, chief executive of EOG Resources, one of the most successful shale producers, put it last week: “Our potential for financial returns, operational performance and overall capital efficiency is much better today than before the downturn.”Since 2010, as US shale production has soared, the great uncertainty has always been whether the industry was built on shaky financial foundations. Shale producers have needed constant cash inflows to finance their investment in new wells. Over the past 10 years, the 55 leading US exploration and production companies, the vanguard of the shale revolution, paid out about $230bn more in capital spending than they earned in cash from operations, covering the rest with disposals, share sales, and debt.Investors made it clear last year that they had lost patience with the poor returns from shale companies, and the flow of equity financing into the industry has slowed to a trickle. But as productivity in shale continues to rise rapidly, it is possible for companies to produce more barrels for the same investment.The reason why so many truck drivers are needed in west Texas is that oil companies have been using much more sand in hydraulic fracturing, because it holds the cracks in the rock open more effectively, allowing more oil to flow out. In 2015, shale oil producers on average used 3,300 tons of sand per well, according to Petronerds, a consultancy. By last year, that had almost doubled to 6,100 tons per well. Delivering that much sand to the well site can require 250 truck movements.Other techniques for shale production have also been refined to increase the amount of oil that can be extracted. Modern rigs can drill faster, further, and more accurately than their predecessors. The process of hydraulic fracturing is being split up into more “stages”, allowing effort to be focused more precisely on oil-bearing rocks.Innovations using the latest computing and communications technology, including remote operations, are also starting to be used more widely. Schlumberger, the oilfield services group, says that in 2014, 13 per cent of jobs it worked on at US onshore wells were supported by technical experts watching from its Houston campus. By 2017, that was up to 31 per cent.Activity has also shifted towards the more productive areas. The two regions where the shale oil industry began were the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas and the Bakken formation of North Dakota. Today it is the Permian Basin of west Texas and eastern New Mexico. The numbers of rigs drilling oil wells in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken are still well below their 2014 peaks, but in the Permian it is at a record high.The Permian is a complex formation, with layers of shale and other rocks, and multiple oil-bearing zones “stacked” on top of each other. Five years ago, companies were still drilling quite a few simple vertical wells there, punching holes into the oil-bearing layers. Today the great majority of the new wells are horizontal, running through the layers to expose a greater amount of oil-bearing rock, which makes them much more productive.“Even just since 2013-14, it’s been a huge change,” says Joseph Triepke of Infill Thinking, a research firm. “Today the Permian is busier than ever; it’s like oil was a hundred bucks again.”The result has been spectacular growth in US oil output. The US has overtaken Saudi Arabia as a crude producer, and is on course to pass Russia to become the world leader this year or next. Even the habitually cautious International Energy Agency was moved to describe the recent surge in US oil output as “colossal”, adding 846,000 barrels a day in just three months.Long-suffering investors in shale remain jumpy, alert for any indication that the industry may be faltering. Last week Houston-based Carrizo Oïl & Gas reported problems including more water than it had expected being produced along with its oil in the Permian, and a cut in the expected recovery from its wells in the Eagle Ford. Its shares dropped by 18 per cent.In the latest earnings season for the US E&P companies, there have been several such stories of disappointments and difficulties. But at the same time, many companies are predicting strong production growth and a healthy financial outlook.Concho Resources, a leading producer in the Permian, said it expected to be able to increase its production by 20 per cent per year on average out to 2020, while covering all its capital spending from its cash flows so long as oil prices stay “in the low to mid $50s”.Pioneer Natural Resources plans oil production growth in the Permian of 19-24 per cent this year, and expects to be able to cover its capital spending from cash flow with oil at $58. RSP Permian said that for 2019 and beyond it expected production growth of 30 per cent, “while generating significant free cash flow” above capital spending.Simon Flowers, chief analyst at Wood Mackenzie, argued recently that “all the stars seem aligned for Tight Oil Inc. to generate positive cash flow in 2018, two years earlier than we predicted”.Those projections might seem over-ambitious, were it not for the fact that the industry has already made remarkable progress. Year after year, production from shale wells has been increasing, indicating that productivity is still rising, according to Trisha Curtis of Petronerds.“Geologically and technically, there is plenty more running room,” she says. “I am confident they can increase productivity further.”It looks as though the only thing that could really put a brake on the industry’s growth would be another collapse in prices like the one in 2014-16.“It’s a really competitive market, and what the market encourages companies to do is to keep boosting production until it’s no longer profitable for them to do so,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist.“If prices stay at these levels, it’s up, up and away.”"
5;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2017-08-03T17:40:51Z;Energy shares drag S&P lower amid output concerns;;Energy stocks dragged the S&P 500 lower on Thursday as quarterly earnings from a number of mid-sized oil producers disappointed and moderating output growth raised concerns for the remainder of 2017.The S&P energy sector was the day’s biggest loser, dropping 1.1 per cent and weighed on the broader S&P 500, which was trading 0.2 per cent lower in midday trading. The day’s decline takes the energy sector’s losses so far this year to nearly 13 per cent – the most among the 10 major sectors on the S&P.Pioneer Natural Resources, Apache Corporation, Noble Energy and Conocho Resources were among the biggest laggards on the benchmark index after their latest results missed expectations and forecasts for production growth has been adjusted.Pioneer extended its losses from Wednesday, dropping another 5.6 per cent after closing 10.8 per cent lower last night. The oil and production company, which narrowly missed revenue estimates in the quarter, said it now expects production growth to be between 15-16 per cent – the lower end of its previous forecast of 15-18 per cent growth.Apache, which also missed revenue estimates, lowered its daily production forecasts following the sale of its Canadian assets last month. In 2017 it expects between 457,00 to 471,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, down from 485,000 to 503,000. Shares in the group are 6.7 per cent lower at $44.67.Nobel Energy, in its quarterly earnings, posted a dramatically worse-than-expected loss of $3.20 per share, far more than the 13 cents loss analysts had expected. The decline stemmed from an exit of an upstream asset in Marcellus shale, though the company met expectations on revenue. Adjusted for this, the company said it expects annual production to be on the mid to upper end of its previous guidance. Shares are down 8.1 per cent to $25.78.Shares in Concho also fell 10.9 per cent to $114.65. Revenue of $635m missed expectations of $673m, though the group actually raised its production growth forecast. It expects a growth of between 24 per cent and 26 per cent.Appetite for energy stocks was also dented by the fresh drop in oil prices. After being boosted by the weaker dollar last week, crude has endured choppier trading over the past couple of days. West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was down 0.8 per cent at $49.21 a barrel while Brent was down 0.3 per cent at $52.22.
6;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2017-05-09T13:14:14Z;US shale groups roar back to life after oil slump;Biggest risk for sector is increased output causing new crude price crash;Members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet have a new catchphrase for how they see the future role of the US: not just “energy-independent”, but “energy-dominant”. As Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, put it at an industry conference in Houston last week: “Dominance is what America needs.”It would be tempting to dismiss that talk as hype, except that every week the US energy sector is coming up with evidence to justify that ambition. The latest round of earnings reports from US exploration and production companies, the leaders of the shale revolution, has shown fresh evidence of their resilience and growth potential.The resurgence of the US shale industry after the oil slump of 2014 was a key factor in how crude prices fell sharply last week, to back below $50 per barrel. The market is concerned about whether efforts by Opec, the producers’ cartel, to tackle a supply glut by curbing output will be undermined by reinvigorated US shale companies.These companies are proving that they are able not just to stay in business, but increase production as well, with oil prices close to today’s levels of about $47 per barrel for benchmark US crude.The great weakness of the shale industry has always been that the companies have typically not generated enough cash to pay for their capital spending, and have relied on debt and equity sales to finance their growth. But producers have typically cut their costs by about 40 per cent in the past three years, and many are now at or close to the point where they are covering their spending from operating cash flows.Before the oil crash of 2014, Harold Hamm, the billionaire majority owner and chief executive of Continental Resources, used to say that prices below $70 per barrel could not be sustained for any length of time, because neither Saudi Arabia nor the US shale industry could bear it.Now Continental is planning for 20 per cent annual production growth financed by its own cash flows with oil at $50 to $55, and says it can invest enough to keep output stable even with crude in the low $40s.Mr Hamm told analysts on a call last week: “The United States has retaken its place as a world energy leader, and we will compete effectively in this new regime.”Across the shale industry, drilling activity is increasing even faster than it did in the final stages of its first boom, up until 2014.The number of active rigs in the US drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil production has more than doubled over the past 12 months, from 248 to 598 last week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group. In the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the red-hot heart of the new boom, the number of rigs running has already hit the levels that were expected for next year, says Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, the research firm.“We thought activity was coming back, but it surprised us that it happened so quickly,” he adds. “I don’t think anybody expected that.”Several companies have suggested the pace at which they are adding rigs would slow down.Jack Harper, chief financial officer of Concho Resources, which operates in the Permian, said that while the company’s plans showed a rising number of rigs in use in the next three years, “it doesn’t move up in a hugely dramatic fashion”.However, as companies build up experience working in shale, the wells can be drilled faster and each is on average more productive. This month 662 barrels per day will be produced from new wells in the Permian for every rig that is running there, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration. That is triple the rate of 217b/d per rig at the end of 2014.Jamie Webster of the BCG Center for Energy Impact says that on average across the shale industry, each additional rig coming back into service can be expected to result in 2.5 times as much oil as when activity started to drop off in the autumn of 2014.As a result, many shale producers are predicting production growth this year. Pioneer Natural Resources is the star performer, forecasting growth of 15 to 18 per cent for 2017, and an annual average of at least 15 per cent out to 2026, but many others have projected solid increases.For example, Marathon Oil thinks that between 2017 and 2021 it can achieve 10 to 12 per cent annual growth, excluding its troubled operations in Libya, with US crude at $55.Not every US exploration and production company is expecting short-term growth, but enough are predicting expansion to support the EIA’s forecast that US oil output will hit a record above 10m b/d next year.So far, there are few signs that the recovery in the industry is stoking cost inflation that would stop the increased production being translated into higher earnings. EOG Resources, one of the largest shale producers, said on Monday that even though suppliers’ charges were rising, it had cut the cost of drilling and completing wells by 6 per cent in the first quarter compared to the average for 2016, through improved efficiency and signing new service contracts at lower prices.It seems right now that the greatest threat to the US shale industry is its own success. Adam Sieminski, a former head of the EIA now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, draws an analogy with the Tragedy of the Commons. Rapid growth that is rational for the individual producer could turn out to be collectively disastrous by flooding the market.“One sheep eating the grass on the commons works,” he says. “But an entire flock soon turns the grass into mud. You overwhelm the system. Who is going to buy all that light [US shale] oil globally? Is there a market for it?”A slide from a ConocoPhillips presentation given to a conference in January is headlined rather plaintively: “Permian: We have a shiny object, too.” The message is that assets in the Permian Basin are all investors want to hear about at the moment, and Conoco’s operations there have been unfairly neglected.It is the Permian that has been the strongest the US shale oil regions in terms of crude production.From peak levels in the first half of 2015, output in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas has declined 29 per cent, according to the EIA, while in the Bakken formation of North Dakota it is down 17 per cent. By contrast in the Permian, production is at record highs, up 19 per cent in the past year alone.This boom has been matched by steep rises in the share prices of some of the companies that focus on the Permian.Since the start of 2016, the shares of Concho Resources are up 41 per cent, Diamondback Energy 50 per cent, and Parsley Energy 74 per cent. Over the same period, Conoco’s stock has risen 1 per cent.Shale oil development in the Permian was slower to get going than in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, and companies have been experimenting with production techniques to maximise output.One of those advances is that companies are using higher volumes of sand in hydraulic fracturing or “fracking”: the pumping of fluid into a well to crack the rock so that oil can flow out.Pioneer Natural Resources said last week that in the Permian it was experimenting with using 3,000lbs of sand per foot of well, instead of 2,500. A single well could use more than 12,000 tonnes of sand.Productivity gains resulting from improved techniques mean that although the Permian needs $55 per barrel oil to be fully developed, there are areas that can be profitable with prices down in the mid-$30s, according to Wood Mackenzie, making it the lowest-cost region for crude production anywhere in the “Lower 48” states of the US.
7;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2017-01-19T11:05:24Z;‘Permania’ grips the US shale oil industry;Crude found in the Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico is an M&A hotspot;They call it “Permania”. The Permian Basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico has become the hottest region in the US shale oil industry, for drilling, for production and for dealmaking.The region was already in high demand for acquisitions last year, and a couple of deals this week with a combined value of almost $10bn have confirmed that Permian assets are still the most sought-after for companies seeking to increase their US oil production.Asset prices have been bid up to the point that some observers are starting to ask if they are unsustainable.As one respondent to a recent survey for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas put it: “Permian transactions are approaching price multiples associated with a bubble or a Ponzi scheme”, reminiscent of the property boom of the early 1980s or the technology bubble of the 1990s.As in the dotcom bubble, there is a technological revolution underlying the inflation of asset prices. Spurred by the slump in crude prices that began in 2014, shale oil producers across the US have been cutting costs and boosting productivity.The Permian region has weathered the downturn the best. Since April 2015, oil production has dropped 19 per cent and 37 per cent respectively in the shale areas of Bakken in North Dakota and Eagle Ford in south Texas, according to the US Energy Information Administration. However, in the Permian it has risen 14 per cent.The best parts of the Permian are now among the lowest-cost sources of new oil anywhere in the world, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company. There are some large packages of drilling rights available, and companies with the financial strength to make acquisitions have been taking full advantage.In 2012 there were 21 merger and acquisition deals involving Permian assets. Last year there were 66, representing about a third of the total number of transactions in the US onshore oil and gas sector.Valuations have also been soaring. In 2012, Concho Resources paid $1bn, or about $5,000 per acre of drilling rights, for the assets of the Three Rivers companies in the Delaware and Midland basins, which are sections of the Permian.Last August Concho paid $1.6bn for operations with drilling rights on 40,000 acres in the Midland Basin, giving a valuation of about $28,000 per acre.In the highest-priced deal last year, QEP Resources paid $600m for assets, which worked out at about $58,000 per acre.Those comparisons are never precise, because no two areas are identical, but they give a sense of how dramatically prices have risen.The two deals announced this week confirmed the market was still healthy. ExxonMobil is paying up to $6.6bn in cash and stock to the low-profile billionaire Bass family, for companies with 275,000 acres of drilling rights, with 250,000 of those in the Permian. That works out at $24,000 per acre.Noble Energy has agreed to buy Midland-based Clayton Williams Energy for $3.2bn including debt, valuing its drilling rights at about $35,000 per acre.The value of Permian assets has been transformed by advances in production technology. Following the initial breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and seismic surveying that first made oil production from shale viable in 2009-10, companies have continued to innovate to boost output and cut costs.One of the motives for acquisitions has been for producers to secure larger patches of contiguous acreage, so they can drill more efficiently. From a single “pad”, horizontal wells can be drilled like the spokes of a wheel, cutting down the time spent moving rigs.Companies have also been experimenting with tighter spacing of the clusters of perforations punched through the steel well casing and into the shale rock to crack it. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading producers in the Permian, said last year that it had gone from spacing perforation clusters 60ft apart to having them 30ft apart, and was experimenting with 15ft.More intensive well completions such as these are more expensive, but they can also be much more productive. Peak production for wells in the Midland and Delaware basins was about 35 per cent higher in 2016, according to Drillinginfo, a data and analysis company.At the end of 2011, the Permian was adding 101 barrels per day of new oil production per rig in the region, according to the EIA. Next month, it will be 660 barrels per day per rig: a sixfold increase in just five years.As a result, many companies find it commercially viable to bring Permian wells into production, even with US crude at today’s levels of about $52 per barrel.The number of rigs in the region drilling horizontal oil wells has nearly doubled from its low of 116 last May, reaching 221 last week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group.That increase is likely to continue. The problem for the region is that as increased drilling also raises US crude production, it will put downward pressure on prices.Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, has been a big help to US exploration and production companies by securing an agreement last year to curb output, but that is scheduled to last only six months.Not all analysts agree that the prices being paid for Permian assets are excessive. Drillinginfo has estimated that even QEP’s deal last year could still be profitable with US crude above $31.50 per barrel. But Wood Mackenzie thinks that on average the Permian deals announced in 2016 need oil at $67 per barrel to break even.In the long term, the future of the Permian looks bright. The region has many layers of oil-bearing shale, and companies are only just beginning to explore the potential of those multiple zones.But if oil prices falter, companies that have been overambitious with their acquisitions will face difficulties.“If history holds true,” says Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, “the tail-end of the boom is when the cliff edge back to reality emerges.”A critical factor in sustaining the US shale industry through the oil price downturn has been the support of the capital markets, and particularly equity investors.US exploration and production companies raised a record $34.1bn in equity financing last year, according to Dealogic, and often they issued shares to make acquisitions.RSP Permian, for example, in October announced a $2.4bn cash-and-shares deal to buy two companies called Silver Hill with assets in the Delaware Basin, a section of the Permian Basin. This involved a stock issue to raise about $870m to finance the cash component of the transaction.PDC Energy similarly announced in August a $1.5bn deal to buy two privately held companies operating in the Delaware Basin, and then in September a $500m share issue to help finance it.The trend has continued into 2017, with Parsley Energy, another Permian-focused company, last week agreeing deals for assets in the Midland and Delaware basins for $650m, and launching a share issue that raised $770m. That plan, from a company that was active in buying assets in 2016, too, received an initially sceptical reaction from the stock market, but its shares have since rebounded.Investor appetite for US E & P company equities will probably be put to the test this year with several initial public offerings, according to Bill Nelson of Haynes and Boone, the law firm. They will follow Extraction Oil & Gas, which in October became the first US E & P company to float for more than two years.
8;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2016-09-11T17:08:13Z;The region leading the US oil recovery;Permian basin in Texas is proving resilient following crude price crash;In the property business, it is often said that only three factors really matter: location, location, and location. Much the same is true in the oil business.In the tentative upturn in the US shale oil industry since May, most of the additional drilling and much of the acquisition spending has been focused on one hotspot: the Permian basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico.This formation, about 300 miles long and 250 miles wide, holds some of North America’s most accessible shale oil reserves. Companies that have been lucky enough, or smart enough, to build strong positions there — such as Pioneer Natural Resources and Concho Resources — can expect to have a competitive advantage over other oil producers, in what remains a very difficult market.As share prices of US exploration and production companies have rebounded this year, those focused on the Permian have been the best performers. Shares in Diamondback Energy and RSP Permian, for example, have been hitting record highs, up 48 per cent and 66 per cent respectively over the past 12 months.Even ExxonMobil and Chevron — the two largest US oil groups, which were left behind by smaller, more innovative rivals as the shale boom took off — now have opportunities in the Permian to make up some lost ground.Although the Permian was not immune as activity across the US oil industry slumped after the crude price crash of two years ago, it has proved the most resilient of the “big three” US shale regions. From peak production, crude output has dropped by 40 per cent in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas, and by 25 per cent in the Bakken formation centred on North Dakota. In the Permian, by contrast, the drop is only 2 per cent.In a sign of the region’s attractions, EOG Resources, one of the most successful of the independent US shale producers, last week announced a $2.5bn deal to buy privately-held Yates Petroleum. Yates’ most valuable assets are drilling rights on 324,000 acres of the Permian.EOG pioneered oil development in the Eagle Ford, and it is still the largest producer there. But William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive, told analysts on a call last month that it would spend 45 per cent of next year’s capital budget in the Delaware, a sub-basin on the western side of the Permian.Since May, the number of rigs drilling horizontal shale oil wells in the US has risen by 77 to 325, according to the oilfield services company Baker Hughes. Of those, 49 were added in the Permian, compared with just four in the Eagle Ford and six in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken.At the same time, the Permian has been a focus for deals. Of the $30.4bn spent on mergers and acquisitions in the US exploration and production sector so far this year, 48 per cent has gone to the Permian, according to research company Wood Mackenzie.Companies have been attracted to the Permian because it holds some of the lowest-cost oil in North America.Production costs can vary widely within each area, and the best spots in the Eagle Ford and Bakken are still competitive but overall the Permian has the most attractive economics. At current crude prices, bringing a well in the Delaware basin into production will generate an internal rate of return of about 18 per cent on average, according to Platts Analytics. That is higher than for any other shale region.Coming relatively late to the shale party, behind the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, the Permian has offered greater scope for companies to cut costs and raise production. Since 2012, average peak output per well has risen by 122 per cent in the Permian, compared with 67 per cent in the Eagle Ford and 78 per cent in the Bakken, according to data analysis firm NavPort.Meanwhile, costs are falling sharply. Concho Resources told investors at a Barclays conference last week that it had cut the cost per foot of its wells by about 40 per cent since the first quarter of 2015.Long-term prospects for the region were also underlined last week when Apache, the US exploration and production company, announced the discovery of a “significant new resource play” in the Permian, which could hold more than 3bn barrels of oil and 75tn cubic feet of gas, in a part of a formation that had been neglected by other companies.Geologists sometimes describe the Permian as a “layer cake” of multiple different oil-bearing formations, with names such as Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring. Companies are experimenting with techniques to optimise production from as many of these layers as possible.Exploration in the Permian has a long history, with the first oil struck in 1923, and west Texas has experienced several cycles of boom and bust. Drilling rights are often held by smaller companies that are prepared to sell out, giving larger operators a chance to build positions. That also opens the door for private equity investors such as Blackstone, which last month committed $1.5bn to two oil producers to buy Permian assets.Exxon and Chevron also see great potential in the region. Exxon came into the Permian through its takeover of XTO Energy in 2010, and added on subsequent smaller acquisitions, while Chevron has a large legacy position. But they see similarly bright prospects.Exxon said last month that it had cut unit development costs on the Permian by 70 per cent over the past two years, and “a large part” of the inventory of wells it could drill would be economically viable with crude at about $40 a barrel.Chevron said it had cut unit development costs by 30 per cent since last year, and raised production by 24,000 barrels per day. It was using six rigs there last month, and plans to raise that to 10 by the end of the year.Heightened levels of M&A activity suggest other companies will add more rigs, too, even if the oil price remains at its present level of about $45 for US crude. “You don’t typically do a billion-dollar deal and then wait for market conditions to improve,” points out Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie. “You get rigs in the field.”On that basis, the Permian seems set to remain a hot location for a long time to come.While the Permian Basin of west Texas has become the focus for much of the US shale industry, other areas are also attracting increased activity, writes Ed Crooks.Of these, the most popular has been the “Stack”: a rather laboured acronym for the “Sooner Trend Anadarko basin Canadian and Kingfisher counties”, in Oklahoma.In those two counties, to the west of Oklahoma City, the number of rigs drilling horizontal shale oil wells has risen from 13 in July to 20 today. That is a faster increase than in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas or the Bakken formation of North Dakota, the original heartlands of the US shale oil boom.Activity is now set to pick up further. At the Barclays energy conference in New York last week, seven companies including Marathon Oil, Cimarex and Devon Energy highlighted their position in the Stack as an important prospect for future growth.Lee Tillman, Marathon’s chief executive, described the Stack as the group’s “first priority in the capital allocation process.” In June, Marathon agreed a deal to pay $888m for PayRock Energy, a private equity-backed company with drilling rights over 61,000 acres of the Stack.Similarly, in December, Devon Energy agreed to pay $1.9bn for 80,000 acres in the Stack from Felix Energy. Last week, Devon reported that it had already gone from running two rigs to four in the Stack, and was planning to bring on two more by the end of the year.David Hager, Devon’s chief executive, said results from its pilot wells had been “outstanding”, and the company was “very excited” about its prospects in the region.

Commodities in turmoil; mining companies, such as Glencore, fighting to stay afloat. The bears have begun their victory lap. Well, we interrupt this disaster, for a special announcement. The US market remains happy to put money to work with some hungry oil explorers.Since early June, US oil exploration and production companies have raised about $3bn in equity from secondary offerings according to Dealogic. Another $7bn came from the debt markets, some of which went to private companies.This week, Texas’s Concho Resources, which operates in one of the key US shale oil producing regions, the Permian, topped all recent efforts with an $819m offering. This follows an earlier financing in February, completed at a higher share price. No pessimism there. And all this money will be used to fund growth, not to rescue otherwise doomed companies.European oil companies have been less fortunate. Equity investors have not opened their wallets. Luckily, the companies’ bankers have taken a kinder view. Tullow Oil, the UK-listed Africa explorer, announced this week that it had passed its latest physical. Its banks confirmed that its oil reserves were still valuable enough to count as collateral for its loans. Good thing, too. Tullow already carries net debt of three times next year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.While Tullow’s lenders want comfort that their reserve-based collateral will not shrink, US E&P investors want something more exciting for their equity: exposure to rebounding oil prices.The share prices of some explorers are pricing in this optimism. In the US, E&P valuations already reflect $55 oil, according to Goldman Sachs. That is about a quarter higher than the West Texas Intermediate price. Still, the US E&Ps are priced near book value, near decade lows. That is cheap enough to encourage some people on to the pitch.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
10;CXO;Concho Resources Inc;2015-05-05T18:39:28Z;Shale groups rise to oil price challenge;EOG raises prospect of production growth before the end of the year;EOG Resources, the largest shale oil producer in the US, on Tuesday raised the prospect of its crude production returning to growth before the end of the year.US shale oil companies have been detailing in their first-quarter results how they are cutting costs and increasing productivity as they grapple with sharply lower crude prices since last summer.Companies including EOG, Anadarko Petroleum, Concho Resources and Noble Energy reported steep cuts in both capital and operating costs, while their production is either growing or roughly flat.EOG said that if benchmark US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $65 per barrel or higher — compared with its price of about $60 on Tuesday — then the company could resume “double-digit” production growth, while covering its capital spending from its operating cash flows.EOG reported a loss of $170m for the first quarter, and an $843m cash outflow, and reiterated its guidance that it expected its average production for 2015 to be roughly unchanged compared with last year.However, William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday morning that the company had been building up a backlog of wells that had been drilled but not yet completed, and planned to start bringing some of these on stream in the third quarter.“We expect our oil production to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016,” he added.EOG’s statement came after David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who made his name betting against Lehman Brothers before the bank collapsed, on Monday argued that shale oil producers were overvalued, labelling them “frack addicts” that failed to create value from their investments even when crude was over $100 per barrel.New extraction techniques and oil prices boost US oil production“A business that burns cash and doesn’t grow isn’t worth anything,” he said.However, US shale oil companies, while reporting losses or very small profits for the first three months of this year, are arguing that cost cuts put them on a course for renewed financial health once crude prices recover.Noble reported a $22m loss for the first quarter, but said it had greatly improved the efficiency of its drilling.Concho, which operates in the Permian Basin of west Texas, reported a profit of just $7.5m for the first quarter and said it had cut the number of rigs it was using from 36 at the start of the year to 18 today.However, it raised the midpoint of the range of its guidance for 2015 production growth from 18 per cent to 20 per cent.Timothy Leach, Concho’s chief executive, said: “We expect to deliver higher production growth on a lower capital spend and with fewer rigs.”Anadarko, which has offshore operations in Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as its US shale business, said it expected average production for 2015 to be slightly lower than in 2014, as it reported a $3.3bn loss for the first quarter, including a writedown of $2.9bn.The company said it had cut the average cost of drilling a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas by 14 per cent since the last three months of 2014.Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, struck a cautionary note on the company’s call with analysts, saying it would be careful about stepping up spending and production growth in response to a recovery in oil prices.“As we achieve higher prices, we could see activity increase and prices, unfortunately, could suffer as a result of higher production than people are anticipating,” he said.“So we’re going to be a little careful in terms of adding to that production number.”

For many, that was true even when oil was at $100 per barrel.“Depletion gets ignored because it is not a cash item, and capex gets ignored because it is funding future growth,” he argued. “When someone doesn’t want you to look at traditional metrics, it is a good time to look at traditional metrics.”As well as Pioneer, the companies singled out in the presentation on Monday were EOG Resources, Whiting Petroleum, Continental Resources and Concho Resources.Mr Einhorn — who made his reputation shorting Allied Capital, a mid-cap lender in the US, from 2002 — likened the companies to St Joe, a Florida landowner that could not develop its land profitably even at the peak of the housing bubble.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices
