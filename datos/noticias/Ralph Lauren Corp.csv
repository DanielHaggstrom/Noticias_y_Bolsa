0;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2019-11-07T15:12:06Z;Ralph Lauren races higher after quarterly results beat forecasts;Clothing retailer posts sales rise in trio of major markets;Ralph Lauren shares were set for the biggest one-day jump in more than a year after the American retailer revealed a rise in sales across its major markets even as it faced a “more challenging” environment.Net revenues at the retailer known for its preppy Americana vibes climbed 1 per cent from a year ago to $1.7bn in the fiscal second quarter. In North America, its biggest market, same-store sales at its retail stores and online climbed 2 per cent. It also recorded increases in the closely watched same-store sales metric of 3 per cent in Europe.In Asia, a market of growing importance to the brand, sales climbed 1 per cent. The rise came despite turmoil in Hong Kong that resulted in 48 days of store closures during the quarter and sparked a 22 per cent drop in revenues on a constant currency basis.“These closures, along with significantly lower tourism drove declines in our Hong Kong business and negatively impacted our total Asian comp by about three points,” the company said on its earnings call. However strength in mainland China helped offset this weakness.The better than expected revenues come despite volatile tourism trends and uncertainty around the trade war.Ralph Lauren shares jumped more than 12 per cent and were eyeing their biggest one day gain since May 2018.“Our progress was driven by a continued focus on brand elevation and creating immersive lifestyle experiences that are amplified across our stores and digital marketing and commerce channels around the world, while also maintaining expense discipline,” said chief executive Patrice Louvet.Like other clothing retailers Ralph Lauren has been challenged by falling mall traffic and the rise of online shopping. The company has also faced competition from fast-fashion brands like H&M and Zara that mimic runway styles for a fraction of the cost.In its fiscal second quarter the retailer engaged both existing and new customers through its partnerships with Wimbledon and the US Open and through cultural moments like launching a capsule collection tied to the 25th anniversary of the 90s sitcom Friends.Net income climbed to $182m, or $2.34 a diluted share, in the three months ended September 28, up from $170m or $2.07 a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusted earnings of $2.55 a share easily surpassed expectations for $2.39 a share.The company noted its adjusted operating expense rate fell 30 basis points from a year ago to 46.6 per cent — driven by cost reduction initiatives and lower marketing expenses. Gross margins climbed 60 bps from a year ago to 61.5 per cent.The company expects net revenue growth to be in the low end of its previously guided range of between 2 to 3 per cent primarily because of political tensions in Hong Kong.
1;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2019-02-05T15:14:22Z;Ralph Lauren crushes holiday forecasts on China, ecommerce strength;;A bigger marketing push and strength in China and ecommerce helped Ralph Lauren post a better holiday quarter than expected, prompting it to upgrade its full-year sales guidance.Ralph Lauren, the New York-based purveyor of Polo shirts and blazers, noted momentum in Asia carried through the fiscal third quarter as revenue in Greater China jumped 19 per cent year-over-year on a constant current basis.Chief executive Patrice Louvet, speaking during an earnings call, said the company is closely monitoring economic trends and will take a disciplined approach to store openings in China.“There’s a lot of question around China and a potential slowdown in China. We have not seen that on our business in Q3,” Mr Louvet told analysts, adding that the company was “highly underdeveloped in China” compared to the market penetration level of its peers.Revenue across Asia rose 10 per cent, and sales in North America — its largest market — increased 3 per cent.Global digital revenue surged 20 per cent in constant currency, with comparable ecommerce sales in North America up 21 per cent. Ralph Lauren said growth in its directly-operated digital flagships exceeded its expectations, partly driven by an upgrade to its ecommerce platform and brand-building initiatives.The company said it spent 18 per cent more on marketing to bolster the brand during the holiday season. Its marketing drive included working with celebrities and social media influencers.“These results give us confidence that our strategic investments in brand-building, product, digital, and global expansion are on the right track, while the strength of our balance sheet will continue to be a competitive advantage as we manage through an increasingly volatile global environment,” Mr Louvet said in a statement.Ralph Lauren earned net income of $120m, or $1.48 a share. In the year-ago quarter, it reported a loss of $81.8m, or $1 a share, including the impact of tax-related charges.Earnings hit $2.32 a share on an adjusted basis, easily beating analysts’ forecast of $2.15. Adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 61.6 per cent on improved pricing and reduced promotions, the company said.Revenue grew 5.1 per cent to $1.73bn, ahead of analyst forecasts for $1.66bn.Ralph Lauren now expects net revenue to be up slightly in constant currency in fiscal 2019. It previously said net revenue was on pace to be roughly flat to up slightly.Shares rallied 11.4 per cent to $127.49 in early trade on Tuesday morning.
2;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2018-05-23T13:06:13Z;Ralph Lauren profits, sales top view;;Ralph Lauren on Wednesday reported a better than expected profit and said sales fell less than feared as the retailer’s efforts to improve the quality of its sales by limiting department store sales and reducing discounts appeared to pay off.The New York-based company known for its preppy Americana swung back to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, posting net income of $41m or earnings of 50 cents a share, compared with a loss of $204m or $2.48 a share in the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter included $322m in restructuring charges.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 90 cents a share, topped analyst estimates of 83 cents. And Adjusted gross margin climbed 4.40 percentage points from a year ago to 59.8 per cent.Revenue fell 2 per cent from a year ago to $1.53bn and was down 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. The retailer attributed the decline to its efforts to reduce discounting, increased quality of sales and lower consumer demand. However the decline was narrower than expected as analysts had predicted revenues of $1.48bn.Same-store sales fell 1 per cent when stripping out currency fluctuations compared to analysts’ expectations for a steeper 2.3 per cent slide. Sales have now declined for four consecutive years.A breakdown showed that revenue fell 14 per cent in North America, the retailer’s largest division, on the back of a 6 per cent increase in brick-and-mortar same-store sales that were offset by an 18 per cent drop online “primarily due to a planned reduction in promotion frequency and depth”. Revenues grew 12 per cent in Europe and 17 per cent in Asia.Ralph Lauren like other clothing retailers has suffered amid falling mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce. The company has also faced competition from fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara that mimic runway styles for a fraction of the cost.To help revive its fortunes the company had tapped Stefan Larsson, whose 18 years of experience in the industry included time and H&M and the successful turnround of Gap’s Old Navy brand. However, Mr Larsson departed after less than two years at Ralph Lauren following creative differences with the founder. The company then turned to former P&G executive Patrice Louvet to help it revive its cachet.“Patrice and I have developed a strong partnership over the past year and I am confident that we are on the right path,” said founder and chief creative officer Ralph Lauren in a statement on Wednesday.Looking ahead the company expects full-year net revenue to decline in the low single-digits, with foreign exchange expected to have “minimal impact”. In the current quarter, net revenue is expected to be flat or slightly lower than the year ago quarter. Foreign currency is expected to boost revenue growth by about 150 to 200 basis points.Ralph Lauren has also planned capital expenditures of about $275m for the year.Ralph Lauren shares, which are up 12.5 per cent year-to-date, climbed 3 per cent in pre-market trade to $120.05.
3;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2018-01-14T09:33:15Z;Versace brings energy to the Milan menswear shows;AW18 Milan menswear report of Versace, Gucci, Ralph Lauren and Emporio Armani;At the Versace menswear show in Milan, energy was everything. It was the brand’s first since September’s Tribute collection, a womenswear show to commemorate the 20th anniversary of founder Gianni Versace’s death. Archive pieces were faithfully recreated, ending with supermodels Carla Bruni, Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Helena Christensen in metal mesh dresses.It happened four months ago, but the show created a forward propulsion within the house that is still palpable. Here, artistic director Donatella Versace played with prints and pattern, cutting them up and reappropriating them on a range of strong product. Velvet shirts came in an archive heraldic print, as did a padded velvet jacket of wide and deep quilting. Want it more normal? Later it came in orange nylon.Sharp plaid tailoring echoed the look at Charles Jeffrey Loverboy in London a week ago, and had similar vim. The plaids often came cut up, with clashing colours on a quilted lumberjack shirt or a women’s blazer. Then quick, it was on to the next idea. Schoolboy V-neck sweaters were worn under slick tailoring, trousers cut short. Versace football shirts hugged the body. The final look had a black Versace dressing gown. Many of the models wore a new pumped up sneaker, the stacked sole of which was in the pattern of a chain.Before the show, Donatella Versace seemed happy and relaxed. For a year now, various rumours have swirled about possible succession at the house. If there were a succession, it would be with Ms Versace’s approval, since the family still own 80% of the company. Let’s see what happens. Suffice to say, this was a collection of which she should be proud.For the past year, Gucci have shown men’s with its womenswear. Buyers from the major men’s say their Gucci business is booming. The Gucci model is the clearest argument against the existence of separate men’s shows, since the men buying its garments don’t need to see them on a menswear catwalk. The economics are clear: save money on a show, profit more from sales.But these brands still can’t quite kick the men’s show habit. Gucci held appointments to show its pre-fall 18 collection, which will enter stores before its catwalk collection and hang around longer. Pre-fall collections tend to be commercial, and such was the case here. Rare was the piece that didn’t have the brand’s name somewhere on it. The lettering was usually in fonts that look like the opening titles of 70s TV shows. Often they were also sewn with a patch of a rabbit or a pig, the kind you used to buy for kids clothes from a local haberdashery. The sort of haberdashery that’s long since shut down, most likely replaced by a Starbucks.A cotton crewneck sweater was knitted with an Italian phrase that translated as “copy of a copy of an idea”. Nearby were a pair of stretch leggings. I have never before considered the construction of a pair of leggings. There are four panels, two at the front and two at the back. These Gucci men’s leggings were printed with a psychedelic natural scene. Thanks to the placement of the fabric, a large grasshopper emerged from the seam of the crotch. Out of the butt seam, a lily in full bloom.Corduroy pants came in vivid shades of yellow and pink. A velvet blazer had been woven with the pattern of double Gs. Many garments — the back of tracksuits, a T-shirt — were decorated with a Latin phrase that translates as “perpetual privilege”. Such are the new signifiers of luxury. This was Gucci’s first collection since it announced it would no longer use fur. The breadth of product here shows no fur is no loss. Three years after creative director Alessandro Michele began his reign, it is clear there is much more of this rich seam to mine.“It’s herringbone on herringbone on herringbone on herringbone on plaid,” said a member of the Ralph Lauren design team. He was talking about a look of layered cloth. These are the garments, in order of his description: coat, suit, waistcoat, tie, shirt. It was in the most pleasing moment of the Ralph Lauren presentation, along with a coat of herringbone that was wide enough for the pattern to almost disappear. It was a lovely thing.Nearby, a cluster of models were dressed in the relaunched RLX, it’s sports range which was now being aligned with the high-end Purple Label. It’s the latest example of sportswear infiltrating the higher levels of luxury. The garments were suitably ramped up: technical fabrics mixed with more traditional and tailored ideas of sportswear.Velvet: a fabric that’s back in play. Emporio Armani offered a velvet crash course, which is really pretty obvious. Velvet on the top half: go for it. Bottom half: be careful. Men and velvet usually equals eveningwear tuxedos, but we are now in a decorative menswear era. Velvet bombers: they could very well work.
4;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2017-11-02T21:02:32Z;Tesla reverses into bear market after target delays;US stocks make little progress as investors digest details of Republican tax plan;Tesla shares fell into a bear market on Thursday after the electric carmaker further delayed its Model 3 production target and posted a wider than expected loss and amid reports that Republicans may seek to repeal electric car credits.The stock fell 6.8 per cent to $299.26. The day’s drop took its slide since its September peak of $389.61 to 23 per cent and trimmed its year-to-date gains to 40 per cent.The decline came after Elon Musk’s company late on Wednesday pushed back production targets for its new mass market Model 3 by three months.While the Palo Alto-based company had first signalled that it was behind on production last month when it first reported producing far fewer models of the car, the latest quarterly update suggested the problems were more deep-seated than the company had previously let on.Moreover, analysts noted that the delay in the production ramp could weigh on the company’s cash flow as there is likely to be less cash generated and the company’s suggestion that capital expenditures next year may be flat, while some analysts had expected it to be lower.Another point of concern stemmed from Mr Musk’s remarks that he roughly expects the company to begin production in China in three years.The laundry list of concerns accompanied quarterly revenue growth of 30 per cent year-on-year to just less than $3bn, in line with estimates.On a pro-forma basis, the loss per share rose to $2.92 compared with the loss of $2.30 a share analysts had anticipated. The quarterly update saw a handful of analysts lower the company’s price target.Adding to Tesla’s woes were reports that the tax bill introduced on Thursday could propose repealing credits given to electric car buyers.The sell-off come on a mixed day for Wall Street as investors digested details of a Republican tax plan.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,579.9, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 23,516.3, with the Nasdaq Composite also flat at 6,714.9.Elsewhere, shares in Ralph Lauren rose 2.6 per cent to $91.73 after the retailer reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly revenues and posted upbeat earnings on Thursday as the retailer sold more full-price clothing and as sales increased in Europe.The retailer, known for its preppy Americana and maker of the official uniforms of team USA at the 2018 Winter Olympics, said revenues declined 8.6 per cent to $1.66bn, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.65bn, according to Thomson Reuters data, but its earnings topped expectations.Net income rose to $143.8m, or $1.75 a share, compared with $45.7m, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That topped Wall Street expectations for $1.70 a share.Blue Apron shares tumbled 18.6 per cent to $3.80 after the ingredient-and-recipe meal kit service said its customer count declined in the third quarter but that its sales beat forecasts.Wayfair shares slumped 15.6 per cent to $62.84 after the ecommerce retailer posted a wider than expected third-quarter loss and reported revenue growth that missed Wall Street estimates.
5;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Ralph Lauren revenues fall less than expected, shares pop;;Ralph Lauren reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly revenues and posted upbeat earnings on Thursday as the retailer sold more full-price clothing and as sales increased in Europe.The retailer, known for its preppy Americana and maker of the official uniforms of team USA at the 2018 Winter Olympics, said total same-store sales, a measure of sales in stores open at least 12 months, were down 9 per cent from a year ago in North America in its fiscal second quarter. That included a 6 per cent drop in brick and mortar stores and 18 per cent online due to the company’s planned reduction in discounting and lower traffic and consumer demand.Revenues declined 8.6 per cent to $1.66bn, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.65bn according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall revenues in North America, its largest market, fell 16 per cent to $877m while those in Europe climbed 3 per cent and were flat in Asia.Net income rose to $143.8m or $1.75 a share, compared with $45.7 or 55 cents a share in the year ago period. That topped Wall Street expectations for $1.70 a share. The retailer also noted that its adjusted gross margin was up 300 basis points compared to last year as discount rates were down across all regions.US retailers have suffered amid competition from both fast fashion names like Zara and H&M that mimic runway styles for a fraction of the cost and the rise of online shopping.Under former CEO Stefan Larrson — who parted ways with the company after less than 2 years at the top job following creative differences with the company’s founder — Ralph Lauren has sought to lure shoppers back to its store and site with ready-to-buy fashion shows that reduce wait times between when clothing hits the runway and when it lands in stores. To shore up its bottom line, the company has also moved away from the heavy discounts that American shoppers have got used to, reduced its reliance on department stores and is better managing its inventory.Ralph Lauren tapped former P&G executive Patrice Louvet to lead the turnround efforts earlier this year.Looking ahead, the company said it expects net revenue to slide between 6 to 8 per cent, excluding the impact of currency changes, in the crucial holiday quarter. For the year, Ralph Lauren continues to expect a revenue decline of between 8 to 9 per cent. However, it lowered its outlook for capital expenditures to $225m, down from $300m.The retailer’s shares, which are down 1.5 per cent so far this year, were up more than 3 per cent in pre-market trade.
6;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2017-08-08T12:48:54Z;Ralph Lauren shares lifted by earnings beat even as sales fall;;Ralph Lauren shares were back in fashion on Tuesday after the retailer posted upbeat adjusted earnings in its fiscal quarter and improvement in gross margin, although comparable sales fell for the eleventh consecutive quarter as the retailer works to curb discounting.The New York-based company, known for its preppy designs, said comparable sales, a key industry metric, fell 7 per cent. Stripping out currency effects, the key sales metric was down 6 per cent, slightly worse than Wall Street forecasts for a 5.8 per cent drop.While still a touch above estimates, Revenues fell 13 per cent to $1.35bn due to “lower consumer demand” brand exits, a reduction in shipments and promotional activity to improve the quality of sales. In North America, the company’s largest market, revenues fell 17 per cent, while comparable sales fell 8 per cent.Meanwhile, the company swung to a profit of $60m, or 72 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $22m, or 27 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.11 a share topped Wall Street estimates of 95 cents. Meanwhile, gross margin was 63.2 per cent, up 210 basis points from the prior year on an adjusted basis.That sent shares in the company up more than 5 per cent in early trading.“While we are addressing challenges in our business, we have significant opportunity ahead and we’re moving forward with urgency,” said chief executive Patrice Louvet.Ralph Lauren in May named Mr Louvet, a former Procter & Gamble executive, its new chief executive, after abruptly announcing his predecessor Stefan Larsson’s exit from the top job in February after less than two years in the role. Mr Larsson, who had driven a turnaround at Old Navy and helped champion fast-fashion at H&M, departed following creative differences with founder Ralph Lauren.Like its rivals, the retailer has faced increased competition from online rivals and fast-fashion names like Zara and H&M, which mimic runway styles at a fraction of the cost. To bridge that gap, Mr Larsson had helped roll out a “ready-to-buy” fashion show that reduced the wait time between when clothing hit the catwalk and when it was available in stores. The turnaround plan has also included efforts to lower discounting and reliance on department stores.Ralph Lauren still expects net revenue for the current fiscal year to decline between 8 to 9 per cent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, compared with a 10 per cent decline the previous year. However, it expects exchange rates to have a “minimal impact on revenue growth” compared with its previous guidance of 150 basis point impact.For the current quarter, the retailer expects net revenue to be down 9 to 10 per cent, with the pace of decline cooling in comparison with the fiscal first quarter.Ralph Lauren shares are down more than 13 per cent so far this year.
7;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2017-05-17T17:52:04Z;Ralph Lauren hires new chief executive from P&G;Patrice Louvet steps in after predecessor clashed with company founder;Ralph Lauren, the retailer known for its preppy Americana, has searched outside of the fashion industry to recruit Procter & Gamble executive Patrice Louvet as chief executive after his predecessor clashed with the company’s founder.Mr Louvet, 52, joins the company as it struggles with a sales slump that is now in its third year.He most recently served as global beauty president at P&G and had also previously run its prestige business, where he oversaw a portfolio of high-end beauty products under the Gucci and Hugo Boss brands before they were sold to Coty for $12.5bn in 2015.The appointment follows the sudden announcement by Ralph Lauren in February that Stefan Larsson would depart as chief executive after less than two years at the company. Mr Larsson had engineered a turnround at Old Navy, Gap’s largest division and helped H&M become a leader in “fast fashion” but parted ways with Ralph Lauren after creative differences with the founder.Mr Lauren praised the incoming CEO’s “collaborative working style” and said that “finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several months”.Mr Louvet will receive a sign-on fee worth $12.6m and will be eligible for an annual salary and bonuses of up to $6.9m, plus equity awards of $7.5m a year, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Ralph Lauren began as a purveyor of ties more than 50 years ago and grew into a $17.4bn company at its peak in 2013 by market value.Finding the right partner to work with me to take us forward in our evolution has been my primary focus over the last several monthsBut the value has fallen by nearly two-thirds since then as rising competition from online retailers and ‘fast fashion’ retailers such as Zara and H&M, as well as the strength in the US dollar, have led to comparable sales declines for nine consecutive quarters.“I think anyone coming to the seat needs to figure out how to work within the new rules of retail,” said Simeon Siegel, analyst at Nomura’s Instinet. “If sales are proving hard to come by, companies need to generate the most profits out of [the sales] they do have.”Ralph Lauren shares were down as much as 3.3 per cent before recovering slightly to trade at about 0.7 per cent down by lunchtime in New York. That stands in contrast to the reaction when Mr Larsson was appointed in September 2015, when the shares jumped 14 per cent. The company is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday.
8;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2017-02-16T18:06:16Z;Ralph Lauren and Yeezy play it safe for AW17: New York Fashion Week;The two brands have radically different aesthetics, but neither of them took risks;"On Wednesday, as New York Fashion Week neared a close, two brands turned to curiously similar strategies. Ralph Lauren and Kanye West’s Yeezy are at the absolute opposite ends of the fashion spectrum but both retreated into the safety of well worn ideas.Ralph Lauren, the brand, is on the hunt for a new chief executive after Stefan Larsson, the Old Navy impresario, announced his intention to depart. There were strategic differences on how to turn the preppy label known for its Big Pony polos around, and these culminated with his exit. Shares tumbled by more than a tenth. Investors were looking for an evolution: cost restraint and some articulation of how the company can return to growth. Instead, Larsson’s departure left them with the familiar: a powerful brand in need of direction. You could say the same thing about the clothes Lauren showed on Wednesday evening in his flagship store on Madison Avenue, adorned with 100,000 white orchids.This wasn’t anything particularly new, but the clothes did have a quiet power and assurance. There were sharply cut linen suit jackets shown with lamb leather pants; silk double-breasted blazers and python belted linen jumpsuits, alongside rope crochet cardigans and chiffon evening dresses, all in desert tones. Mr Lauren and his clientele love a good safari, and the brand has been on this particular trip numerous timesAt times he dipped too far into the fantasy: an orange lame evening gown with a sunburst floral print and tasteful slit high up the leg could have lost the cape sleeves. A long silk dress coat looked better when paired with distressed indigo boyfriend jeans. That’s when it lost the fuss.At West’s Yeezy — now in its fifth season — the rapper cum designer lost the pretense too. After forcing buyers and editors to Roosevelt Island last season, and to Madison Square Garden the season before (it’s hard to see the clothes from the New York Knicks’ bleachers), he turned to a tame space in Chelsea that’s used by dozens of other designers each year. The show started and ended relatively on time and the designer, who was hospitalised for exhaustion last year, never stepped out from behind the black curtain to take a bow.The collection hit some new notes for West and lost the nude-toned leotards that he has obsessed over in the past. For the most part, however, the workwear and sportswear themes echoed those seen over the past few seasons at Vetements and Off White; no surprise, given that Off White designer Virgil Abloh is a friend and collaborator of West’s. There were shearling-lined denim work jackets and white washed denim pants and oversized varsity sweaters with the word Calabasas on the back; a reference to the town his wife Kim Kardashian grew up in. Simple mossy green sweatshirts featured the Adidas logo and dusty merlot-red racing inspired track suits sported Adidas’ three stripes up the side.It wasn’t about Kanye, the designer seemed to be saying. Although it is, isn’t it? Brands like Ralph Lauren would love to capture the kind of excitement that West can drum up. West’s work with Adidas — including some simple graffiti-ed white crewneck sweaters — will sell.And that’s the point. This is commerce and brands need results. Perhaps it would help, though, if that included something new."
9;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2017-02-02T17:43:24Z;Stefan Larsson to leave Ralph Lauren after less than two years;Chief executive parts ways with retailer over ‘creative differences’ with founder;Stefan Larsson, chief executive of Ralph Lauren, is leaving after less than two years in the job after clashing with the company’s 77-year-old founder over the future of the clothing empire.Mr Lauren said in a statement that Mr Larsson and the company had “agreed to part ways” after “differences”, and that a search would be conducted for a replacement. Mr Larsson, who is leaving in May, will receive $10m in severance paid in the form of a salary over the next two years, according to an SEC filing.“Stefan and I share a love and respect for the DNA of this great brand, and we both recognise the need to evolve,” Mr Lauren, chief creative officer, said in a statement. “However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business. After many conversations with one another, and our board of directors, we have agreed to part ways.”During the company’s earnings call, Mr Larsson said they disagreed on how to evolve “product, marketing and shopping experience”. He added: “I’ve spent my whole career, 20 years, in family-controlled businesses. So we worked hard to find common ground, but we didn’t and that’s what led to this mutual decision.”After many conversations with one another . . . we have agreed to part waysShares in Ralph Lauren were poised for their biggest one-day drop in nearly a year, falling 11 per cent to $78.03 following the news of Mr Larsson’s departure. The announcement of his pending arrival at the retailer in September 2015 was greeted with much fanfare and a 14 per cent rise in share price after he drove a turnround at Old Navy, Gap’s largest division and helped H&M become a leader in fast fashion.Under his leadership Ralph Lauren unveiled its “Way Forward Plan” cutting jobs, shutting underperforming stores and its Denim & Supply line to focus on core products, as well as removing three layers of management in an attempt to revive its fortunes.It has also tried to widen its appeal to shoppers who flock to fast fashion retailers such as Zara and H&M, which offer catwalk looks at a fraction of the cost. He instituted a “ready-to-buy” fashion show that reduced the wait time between when clothing hit the runway and when it landed in stores.“Mr Larsson’s departure significantly heightens uncertainty around the future strategic direction of the company in our view and causes P/E [price to earnings] contraction,” Jay sole, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said. “The main reason to own this stock was the cost-cutting story, but Mr. Larsson was the cost-cutter and now he is gone.”Chief financial officer Jane Nielsen will lead the turnround plan in the interim and said the company expected to return to revenue growth by fiscal 2019.Charges tied to the ‘Way Forward Plan’ are expected to result in revenues in the current quarter falling by double-digit percentages in the mid-teens compared with a year ago.Net revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to record a low double-digit percentage decline as well.This followed a 5 per cent drop in same-store sales in the third quarter, leading to a fall in net revenue of 12 per cent from a year ago to $1.78bn, in line with estimates. Profits in the quarter slid to $82m, or 98 cents a share, down from $131m, or $1.54 a share, in the same period the previous year. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.86 a share topped analysts’ estimates of $1.64.Also on Thursday, Givenchy, the fashion house owned by LVMH, said that its artistic director Riccardo Tisci was leaving the company. The Italian designer who dressed pop stars such as Beyoncé is leaving after 12 years and his exit follows the departure of creative heads at Dior, Lanvin and Valentino in the past two years.

Separately, Ralph Lauren said it would not renew Mr Lochte’s contract.Speedo said in a statement that “we cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for”.The swimwear company’s decision arrived after Brazilian police claimed that Mr Lochte lied in official testimony about being robbed at gunpoint by men dressed as police officers. They claim that video evidence showed Mr Lochte and three other US swimmers, Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and James Feigen, stopped at a petrol station to use a toilet and damaged a bathroom in the process.A security guard is then said to have asked for a payment and when the swimmers became aggressive the guard is said to have pulled a gun but eventually allowed the swimmers to leave. Mr Bentz and Mr Conger confirmed that narrative last week.Mr Lochte has since apologised for “not being more careful and candid” about the incident.Speedo USA also said that it would donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte’s fee to a charity aimed at helping children in Brazil.Ralph Lauren, meanwhile said it continues to “sponsor the US Olympic and Paralympic Team and the values that its athletes embody” but that it would not renew Mr Lochte’s contract, which was specific to the 2016 Olympics games.Here is Speedo USA’s statement in full:Speedo USA today announces the decision to end its sponsorship of Ryan Lochte. As part of this decision, Speedo USA will donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte’s fee to Save The Children, a global charity partner of Speedo USA’s parent company, for children in Brazil.While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.

Excluding one-off items related to the company’s restructuring, adjusted net income was $90m, or $1.06 per diluted share, ahead of the 89 cents a share analysts had predicted.“The main drivers to the decline in North America are . . . a combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience, and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory,” said chief executive Stefan Larsson. “Having these self-induced challenges, are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment.”Indeed, it has been a challenging few years for department stores and retailers as US consumers are increasingly opting to spend their money on experiences such as travel and dining over clothes.The rise of ecommerce and fast-fashion retailers — such as H&M and the Inditex-owned Zara chain, that mimic runway styles for a fraction of the cost — and outlets such as TJ Maxx that offer branded clothing at a steep discount, have all raised competition and seen traditional fashion names struggle to lure customers back to their shops.At the same time, the strength of the dollar, which has lowered tourist spending at big department store chains such as Macy’s, has also plagued Ralph Lauren’s sales in the US and chipped away at its overseas earnings — the company derives more than 30 per cent of its overall revenues from Europe and Asia.Last year, Ralph Lauren appointed Mr Larsson to lead the nearly 50-year old company as it tries to lure customers back to its shop floors. Mr Larsson — who engineered a turnround at Old Navy, Gap’s largest division — has worked to streamline Ralph Lauren’s operations and shaken up management in an effort to revive growth.Striding to show the overcoming of obstacles / From Charles D Collins
12;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2016-08-10T20:41:00Z;Yelp shares surge after surprise profit and upbeat outlook;All three main US indexes close lower on the day;Yelp shares surged on Wednesday after the customer review site reported a surprise profit in the second quarter and issued an upbeat sales outlook for the current quarter.Shares in Yelp jumped 12.8 per cent to $36.83, taking its year-to-date gain to nearly 28 per cent, after the San Francisco-based company reported a profit of $449m, or 1 cent a share, in the three months to the end of June, compared with a loss of $1.3m, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts had forecast a loss of 7 cents.Sales jumped nearly 30 per cent to $173.4m — ahead of the $169.8m that analysts were looking for — as local advertising revenue climbed 41 per cent from a year ago to $151.9m.Yelp said last year that it would refocus its sales force on attracting ads from local businesses, seen as a stronger revenue driver than looking for large brand advertising accounts.The company said it expected sales of between $180m and $184m in the current quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates for $179.7m. Its full-year sales guidance of between $700m and $708m also exceeded expectations.The results were cheered by investors as the company, which began 12 years ago and was once the prime site for customer reviews, has faced rising competition from TripAdvisor, Google and Facebook.Two analyst upgrades for the stock on Wednesday lifted the overall buy rating on Yelp to 16, while 18 have a “hold” rating and three have a “sell” rating, according to Bloomberg data.“We see continued pressures over the long term as Yelp competes for local ad dollar growth . . . against large-scaled ad platforms,” Eric Sheridan, an analyst at UBS, said. He added that continued moderation in traffic growth and rising investment costs to compete in terms of hiring, marketing and salesforce staff remained key concerns.The advance in Yelp shares arrived as US stocks edged lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 2,175.5 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.2 per cent to 18,495.7. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent to 5,204.6.Elsewhere, Wendy’s shares fell 2.8 per cent to $9.91 after the burger chain said like-for-like sales climbed less than expected in the second quarter as consumers continued to eat at home. Same-store sales, a key industry metric, rose just 0.4 per cent, missing analysts’ estimates for 1.9 per cent growth.“We believe there are multiple drivers behind the recent slowdown, but the most notable reason appears to be the continued gap between the cost of eating at home and the cost of dining out, which is now at its widest point since the recession,” said Todd Penegor, chief executive.Wendy’s also said profits and revenues slid in the quarter — as the company owned 361 fewer restaurants at the end of the quarter compared with the beginning of the second quarter of 2015 — but exceeded analysts’ estimates.Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren shares bucked the pain felt by other retailers, rising 8.5 per cent to $103.14, as the retailer reported better than expected profits in its fiscal first quarter. However, the company noted that same-store sales — a key industry metric — fell 6 per cent.

14;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2016-06-19T06:41:58Z;Versace, Ralph Lauren, Brunello Cucinelli show report SS17 Milan menswear;The big trend in Milan isn’t a colour, or silhouette, it’s clothes that men can actually wear;"Sometimes trends in fashion are about a sensibility rather than a particular look. At three shows or presentations in Milan, where the menswear caravan has parked on the next step of the spring/summer 17 season, there was a move towards the wearable. I know. Clothing that’s wearable. What will they think of next?Donatella Versace has been moving her menswear towards a reality for a few seasons, usually through sportswear. Here the wearability saturated into pretty much every look. Zip-up blousons came in old Versace prints that had been overdyed to create a deeper colour palette. Single-breasted jackets were in a jersey that kept its shape, so they could be treated badly to no ill effect. The weather has been terrible in Milan the past few days, so the long billowing nylon parkas felt apt. It was a strong look.New chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd, ex of Alexander McQueen, has been in the job less than a month, so his effect is yet to be felt. But the mood here was widening the offer. Silk knits worn as well as tied around the waist were a message to its customers: don’t just come here for the extravagance; there are everyday pieces too. Oh yeah but then there was the slashed leather jackets. And the skin-tight running shorts worn with a bare chest. This is still Versace, after all.The music to the show were tracks that Prince had recorded for Donatella. They were good friends. When she talks about him now, she wells up. The tracks sounded like late night jams, versions of his hits re-recorded and reworded. Instead of citing Dynasty on a version of Kiss, he said Desperate Housewives instead. They were extraordinary recordings to hear. Funny, the privileges of this job.Earlier in the day, there was a brunch on the roof terrace of Ralph Lauren’s palazzo. Sure, it’s nice to stand and chit chat, but us hacks get twitchy: where are the clothes? It was half an hour before the presentation was supposed to begin, but some American colleagues had other places to be, so they led a march to the lift. Downstairs, the models dashed to take their positions on the traditional Ralph Lauren tableaux, clustered in groups to denote the specific theme: navy! Art Deco black and white evening! Etc etc.Representatives looked panicked as the models dashed across the room to take their place, but actually they shouldn’t, since it was good to see this modern collection move. The impact of new CEO Stefan Larsson was clear. Suiting had construction removed and had been garment-dyed, technical speak for being made more approachable. Much of the tailoring as shown with a sweater beneath; if there were shirt and tie, it was often all the same shade. A biker jacket was made from easily sellable cotton; a grey tropical wool zip-up was waterproofed. Most here was restraint, but under one blazer was an excellent Fair Isle sweater that popped with acid pink and cornflower blue. Crucially, the majority of the models could step down from their place, head out on to the street, and easily merge into real life: a good thing.“It’s a new moment for menswear,” said Brunello Cucinelli. Oh wow, OK, better listen close. He was talking through his translator, his English as non-existent as my Italian. All around were men in blazers worn over trackpants. There were gilets, sneakers, blousons. He was talking about the victory of casual over formal, right? No. He meant a new moment in the way men were shopping. He said they were no longer replacing their clothes, more building a wardrobe, adding pieces, wearing old with new.OK, OK, but what about the trackpants? Cucinelli is a demonstrative man. He stood up, and summoned over a model who was patrolling the showroom. He put his hands in his pockets and waggled his trousers — they were tailored, with a cuff. The model wore trackpants, with a cuff. He said he was selling suits with two options for trousers, tailored and track. What was important was the blazer, to keep it all sharp. That blazer was linen, snug, and both looks of desirable reality.I had to get to another show. We stood, and Cucinelli came close. “You are young,” he said through his translator. I can’t remember exactly what came next, but he was talking about me as part of a younger generation, and the responsibilities on our shoulders: the future is in your hands, you can make a change, “you are the sentinel”.He stopped, then continued, “and maybe in ten years time you’ll remember what a crazy man in Milan said.”Photographs: Catwalking"
15;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2016-06-10T14:00:42Z;Stefan Larsson — a dose of high street reality for a fashion icon;He respects the Ralph Lauren legacy but has space to move, too, writes Jo Ellison;As Ralph Lauren is fond of saying, Stefan Larsson is the “first CEO I ever had”. Until last October, Mr Lauren acted as chief executive of his fashion house. The appointment of Mr Larsson, a Swede with 18 years’ experience in retailing, first at H&M and then reviving Gap’s Old Navy brand, drew speculation that the 76-year old American designer might be retiring.In fact Mr Lauren stayed on, as chairman and chief creative officer. But it now falls to Mr Larsson, 41, to deliver the bad news. During a three-hour presentation to investors this week, Mr Larsson, who wears heavy-rimmed spectacles of the architect school and has collar-length curls, outlined the “Way Forward” plan, the first of the radical changes he plans for the ailing $8bn business, where sales and profits have fallen by 50 per cent in two years.The “Way Forward” plan will involve 50 store closures, 1,000 job losses and a restructure to remove three of the nine layers of management that stand between Mr Larsson and “the actual doer doing the work”, as he puts it. It will also mean a refocus on the best-selling “core” products of the Ralph Lauren brand — classics such as the “blazer, the double-breasted jacket, the chinos and biker jacket”.Clothing production lead times will be cut from 15 to nine months, to maximise the time that full-price stock stays in store, and a “continuous test pipeline” will be introduced, where certain lines will be ushered through development on to the shop floor within eight weeks.Mr Larsson couched his language in corporate jargon which belied the severity of the cuts: $180m to $220m in annual costs on top of existing plans to reduce costs by $125m. The coming months will be fairly brutal at Ralph Lauren.Mr Larsson is one of a new breed of chief executives to have crossed over from everyday retailers into the exclusive world of luxury. He brings with him an invigorating sense of urgency, a democratic attitude and openness to disruption — but he is making changes that reflect broader trends in luxury retailing. By concentrating on the main Ralph Lauren lines, for example, Mr Larsson is following other brands in cutting down the number of collections on offer: this traditional luxury brand business model has confused millennial consumers shopping online.During Larsson’s time at H&M, the retailer became known for its very successful collaborations with leading designersDespite the brand’s recent woes, Mr Larsson’s task is an enviable one. Ralph Lauren has a celebrated ethos and look and is instantly recognisable as the home of preppy style and chic Americana. And Mr Larsson was a huge admirer of Mr Lauren long before he worked for him. Just as the US designer worked his way up out of the Bronx, Mr Larsson once dreamt of escaping the small Swedish town of his childhood.Like Mr Lauren, he considers himself an entrepreneur. Mr Larsson paid his way through business school (and acquired a Polo jacket) by forming a company that produced contacts’ books of his fellow student’s details: like an analogue Facebook “but not as pretentious”. He only joined Stockholm-based H&M because the management persuaded the 25-year-old to join a team that would transform the then “scrappy” company into one of the biggest fashion retailers in the world.An elegant man, Larsson is dismissive of retailers who sell “clothes by the pound”. During his time at H&M, the retailer became known for its very successful collaborations with leading designers, and Mr Larsson was impressed by how those sought-after collections transformed the public’s perception of the brand and made it “cool and relevant”.His interest in product design then transformed Old Navy, previously considered a “problem” business. “He is one of the rare people who is good with numbers, but he is also good with fashion,” says a former colleague. “He always had a soft spot for high fashion: even at H&M he wouldn’t walk around wearing a T-shirt for £4.95.”Mr Larsson is a quieter, far less flamboyant character than Mr Lauren, who revels in the mythology of his rags-to-riches success. Mr Larsson, meanwhile, avoids the limelight. His family — he has three young children — will soon relocate to New York from San Francisco, and he is fascinated by how the next generation, tomorrow’s consumers, will be “the authors of their own lives” through their use of social media.He works with a small, loyal team, and he works fast. “He has a nose for finding the right people,” says the colleague. “He’s not someone who wants to get along with everybody, he’s super political, he has an agenda and he knows the only way to do it is to go fast. He has no scruples about getting rid of people, and putting his own team in. It’s important to him to make change.” That change is under way and one of his first big hires was a former H&M colleague.Despite having to answer to Mr Lauren, it is said that Mr Larsson has negotiated a contract allowing him to act without express permission from the boss.The new chief executive is, however, well aware of Mr Lauren’s influence, and very respectful of his legacy. “Ralph Lauren is not the standard model,” he told the Financial Times. “I was sitting in the Polo restaurant [owned by the company] recently and looking at the clientele. It’s so mixed, it appeals to all ages. I saw how much they love Ralph Lauren. Now we just have to create the same desire about the product.” He concluded: “Ralph is the originator of iconic style, so we have it all. We just need to continue to evolve from that core.”The writer is the FT’s fashion editor

The S&P 500 crept up 0.1 per cent to 2,112.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.1 per cent to 17,938.3, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 4,961.8.The S&P touched its highest level since last July during the day and sits within striking distance of the all-time high the broad-market index set last May.“Low volatility, easing financial conditions and early signs of improving sentiment are all contributing to the rotation into risk [assets],” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.Elsewhere, shares of Ralph Lauren fell after the clothing company announced restructuring plans and forecast a sharp sales decline in its current fiscal year.The company said it expected its revenues to fall at a “low-double digit rate” in the fiscal year that ends in March 2017, compared with Wall Street estimates for a 4 per cent decline.Ralph Lauren also said it would take a restructuring charge of up to $400m as part of a transition led by Stefan Larsson, chief executive, who took the helm last year.The group’s shares fell by 2.4 per cent to $94.06. They have fallen by 30 per cent over the past 12 months.On the other side of the spectrum, the S&P 500 energy sector rallied for the second straight day. US crude oil prices advanced by 1.4 per cent to $50.36 a barrel, the first time it has settled above $50 a barrel since July. Brent crude, the international marker, rose 1.8 per cent to $51.44 a barrel.The oil price has almost doubled since mid-February, which has dramatically lifted sentiment over energy groups.Indeed, the risk premium investors demand to hold the lowliest-rated debt of companies in the sector over Treasury bonds has dropped by more than 50 per cent since oil bottomed in February, according to data from BofA Merrill Lynch.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, was among the gainers on Tuesday, jumping 4.7 per cent to $14.62. Chevron, an oil major, rose 2.1 per cent to $103.32.
17;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2016-06-07T17:15:17Z;Ralph Lauren warns of 2016 sales decline;New chief Stefan Larsson vows to close stores and cut costs;Ralph Lauren warned that sales would decline in the “low double digits” this fiscal year, initially wiping nearly a tenth off the value of the luxury brand, as the recently-installed chief executive from Gap’s Old Navy brand outlined a plan to cut costs.The turnround plan involves eliminating between $180m and $220m in annual costs including through shutting about 50 of its full-price stores, 10 per cent of the total, and reducing inventory. It comes on top of an existing plan to reduce costs by $125m.The cuts will lead to a $400m charge in the year ending March plus a further $150m from reducing inventory. Ralph Lauren also said it would streamline its supply chain operations. High hopes have been pinned on Stefan Larsson, who had breathed new life into Gap’s Old Navy brand, to get Ralph Lauren’s back office into shape in an increasingly difficult environment for fashion retailers.However, investors were not initially impressed by the plan with shares falling 10 per cent. By lunch time in New York the shares had clawed back much of the lost ground to be 2 per cent lower at $94.38.Recent retailer earnings in the US have highlighted the winners from the losers in an industry where consumers are willing to spend selectively.Younger generations are increasingly shifting to online purchases and shunning department stores that do not offer enjoyable shopping experiences. Retailers such as Macy’s, where Ralph Lauren sells a significant amount of its clothes, are struggling to stem a decline in sales.It has given off-rack (brands sold at a discount) stores an edge, while fast fashion brands such as H&M, where Mr Larsson cut his teeth in retail, continue to win over the millennial consumer.“We will build on our strengths, refocusing on our core brands and instilling a financial discipline that is highly focused on return on investment, Mr Larsson said.The aim at the company, where founder Ralph Lauren last year relinquished his role as chief executive, is to revive operating margins to the mid teens in 2020 after expecting them to decline to 10 per cent this year from 10.7 per cent in the year just ended.

For the current quarter, Ralph Lauren expected flat net revenues, down 2 per cent from the period a year ago.Third-quarter profits were $131m, or $1.54 a share, compared with $215m, or $2.41 a share, in the period the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $2.12 a share. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of $2.27 a share topped expectations.Ralph Lauren faces increased competition from fast-fashion retailers such as Zara and H&M and the proliferation of ecommerce. The strong dollar has hurt the chain by eroding tourism spending in the US and denting overseas earnings.Sales slid 4 per cent to $1.9bn, shy of estimates for $2bn. Warm weather, declining tourist traffic and product assortment challenges contributed to a 4 per cent decline in North America sales.Stefan Larsson, chief executive, said: “We are disappointed with the current business results.”He succeeded Ralph Lauren last year in an effort to revive sales, having helped turn round sales at Gap’s Old Navy brand.The shares declined 40 per cent last year.Kohl’s was also under pressure, falling 18.8 per cent to $41.52 after it cut its full-year earnings forecast. The department store expects fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4 a share, down from its previous outlook for the low end of $4.40 to $4.60.Shares in GoPro fell as much as 16 per cent to $9.01, a fresh record low, after it revealed a disappointing outlook and said that it was abandoning the low end of the action-camera market.The maker of wearable cameras expects revenues in the range of $160m to $180m in the current quarter, below the $300m expected by analysts. Its full-year sales forecast of $1.35bn-$1.5bn also came in shy of Wall Street estimates.Disappointing fourth-quarter results showed the company swinging to a loss of $34.5m in the final three months of the year.Analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded GoPro from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered their price target from $21 to $10.Shares in ConocoPhillips declined 8.7 per cent to $35.29 after the oil company cut its dividend by nearly 70 per cent to 25 cents a share amid a protracted slump in crude prices.The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 1,915.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 16,416.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,509.56.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The shares, which were already down 38 per cent this year, fell 14 per cent to $40.41.“The department store sector has come under significant pressure in recent weeks as a number of brands commented on weakness in the US wholesale channel and elevated inventory levels driving a promotional acceleration,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.The extent of the hit to sentiment was underlined by the performance of JCPenney, another veteran department store, whose shares began the day brightly after it said same-store sales in the third quarter had climbed a larger than expected 6.4 per cent.Its stock rose as much as 2.3 per cent to $8.88. But the move quickly unravelled after Macy’s results, which pushed the shares down 2 per cent to $8.51.JCPenney said it would pay as much as $50m to settle a lawsuit by customers in California over pricing. Although it denies the allegation that it broke Californian state law, the retailer said it was settling to avoid a protracted legal battle.The S&P 500 Consumer Durables and Apparel index, a broad measure of US retailers that includes Under Armour and Ralph Lauren, dropped 1.6 per cent, making it the second-worst performer on the S&P 500.Pharmaceuticals were also in focus. Shares in Horizon Pharma plunged 19.6 per cent to $17.99 after Express Scripts, which manages drug programmes for insurers and is a force in US healthcare, said it was suing the company and severing ties with pharmacy chain Linden Care, which dispenses Horizon’s products.Speciality pharmacies, which exclusively or predominantly sell medicines made by a single company, have been hit by concerns about some drug companies’ business models. Horizon said Express’s suit was without merit.In oil and gas, Apache shares fell 7.4 per cent to $49.38 after Anadarko Petroleum confirmed that it had made an approach. Anadarko added that it had withdrawn the bid. Energy companies are struggling to agree deals despite the pressure for consolidation.Some sectors fared better. The S&P 500 homebuilding index rose 1.9 per cent after surging 5.4 per cent on Tuesday. Results from DR Horton, one of the largest US homebuilders, buoyed sentiment after its profits rose more than expected. Its shares were up 2.8 per cent at $32.02 after jumping 8.3 per cent on Tuesday.US stocks overall struggled for direction on Veterans Day, a public holiday for many government employees, some businesses and the bond market.

20;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-11-05T18:03:49Z;Whole Foods slides as competition bites;US stocks edge lower ahead of Friday’s jobs report;Rising competition and slowing same-store sales in the fourth quarter weighed on shares of upscale US grocer chain Whole Foods.The Texas-based company said comparable sales, a key industry metric, declined 0.2 per cent in the quarter, missing expectations for a 0.6 per cent gain.Moreover, in the first few weeks of the first fiscal quarter, sales declined 2.1 per cent.Comparable sales slowed sharply in the previous quarter as well, at the time the company attributed the weak numbers to price audits in New York that found the store overstated the weights of its pre-packaged goods that resulted in consumers being overcharged.The company said it expects 3 to 5 per cent sales growth in fiscal 2016 and said the higher end of this outlook reflects 2.8 per cent two-year comparable sales growth but that the low end “reflects the possibility that comps could get marginally worse before they get better, with an inflection point later in the year”.Whole Foods has faced increasing competition from grocers that offer healthy foods at cheaper prices.Last month, the company said it would eliminate 1,500 jobs, or 1.6 per cent of its workforce, in an effort to cut costs.Some analysts have viewed its attempt to lure “millennial” consumers with a new store, dubbed 365 by Whole Foods Market, as an admission that the company could not attract customers seeking lower prices to its existing stores.The news came alongside fourth-quarter profits that declined 56 per cent to $56m or 16 cents a share, while revenues gained 5.6 per cent to $3.4bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 35 cents a share on sales of $3.5bn.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 30 cents a share also missed forecasts.“Fourth-quarter results only highlight the growing structural issues facing the company and we believe earnings will deteriorate even faster than management expects as it attempts to reposition the company,” Edward Kelly, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.The company also announced a $1bn share buyback programme and declared a 4 per cent increase to its quarterly dividend.Whole Foods shares declined as much as 6.6 per cent to $28.73 but pared back losses to trade 2.1 per cent lower by markets close.Ralph Lauren jumped after the fashion brand known for its preppy clothing revealed stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profits and sales.Stefan Larsson, a former executive at Gap, also began his tenure as the company this month, taking over for founder Ralph Lauren, who became executive chairman.Mr Larsson is credited with turning around Gap’s lower-end Old Navy brand.The shares climbed 14.8 per cent to $130.50.Facebook climbed to a new high of $108.79, rising 4.6 per cent, after the world’s biggest social media network unveiled better than expected profits, sales and user growth late on Wednesday.The company’s market value vaulted to just under $300bn.HomeAway rallied after Expedia said it would buy the company in a $3.9bn cash-and-stock deal. HomeAway competes with Airbnb, the burgeoning alternative lodging website.HomeAway’s stock soared 25.3 per cent to $40.15. Expedia’s shares rose 2.3 per cent to $137.31.US stocks were weaker ahead of Friday’s jobs report.The S&P 500 slid 0.1 per cent to 2,099.93, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 17,863.43 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 5,127.74.
21;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-10-05T11:26:12Z;From Apple to Python: how everyone can tap teams’ creative juices;A leader’s talent lies in integrating other people’s work rather than trying to direct every aspect;"When creative people hand day-to-day operational duties to someone else, they are often described as stepping back, stepping down or stepping aside. It is as though they are part of a sort of management hokey-cokey.“Stepping back” was one phrase used when Sir Jonathan Ive became Apple’s chief design officer in May, and when Ralph Lauren and Diane von Furstenberg recently appointed chief executives to their respective fashion empires. Occasionally, creative people “step up”, too, as Christopher Bailey, the Burberry designer, did in 2013, becoming chief executive of the group.But creative projects are not whole-self-in or whole-self-out operations. Individual artists or designers may or may not be competent or content to run a growing business built on their creative skill. But their work is inextricably part of it. How they manage their involvement and — once they are no longer in charge — how others manage them, will decide whether the business stays successful.What is more, the same techniques used to ensure creative people and teams remain productive can be useful in managing people in other types of business, far from the soundstage, catwalk or drawing board.Reviewing the vast research in the area, Babis Mainemelis of Greece’s Alba Graduate Business School and his co-authors identified three types of creative leadership. “Directive” leaders, such as chefs, conductors and some particularly innovative entrepreneurs, are the primary source of creativity in the organisation. Then there are the leaders who encourage creativity in others, facilitating large-scale, repeatable creative work; and those who bring ideas together for specific projects in the theatre, say, or on television. Academics tend to study these groups separately. But the divisions between them are blurred.Designers, for instance, often start as inspirational leaders directing a small group to implement their vision. But above a certain size, most creative enterprises burst out of the studio or workshop and face the sort of commercial challenges familiar to more humdrum businesses.Even then, if the identity of the designer is a vital part of the product’s attraction, the creator must sometimes jump back in to reinvigorate the brand. There is a reason why Mr Lauren and Ms von Furstenberg deny so strenuously that they are edging towards retirement. Like chefs — whose job is to create recipes that can be reproduced time after time even though they are not themselves in the kitchen — designers, or their heirs, must keep watch over their brands.But, as Prof Mainemelis explains, “if the basic objective is to have more creativity, more often, by as many people as possible in the company”, then eventually the creator should find someone else to run it.Sometimes the most creative act leaders can perform is to step out of the wayIn Creativity, Inc, Ed Catmull describes how he realised he had to manage Lucasfilm’s new computer division (the fledgling Pixar) differently, by switching from director to facilitator: “Clearly it wasn’t enough for managers to have good ideas — they had to be able to engender support for those ideas among the people who’d be charged with employing them.”In such situations, the impulse to control everything may be counter-productive. The creative director at an advertising agency, for example, should not try to micromanage every campaign.Similarly, in many project-based creative ventures, such as movie production, leaders need to give up their ideas to a team of people who are better at their individual jobs than the leader would be. The imperative then is to integrate their work as much as to direct each aspect of it.Terry Gilliam, the Monty Python cartoonist and film-maker, told the BBC recently: “There’s a point that the film is really running itself and I — the director [and] writer — do not exist.” He might make for a madcap management thinker. His attempt to adapt Don Quixote for the big screen was such a notorious disaster that it was made into a documentary.Yet leaders of consultancies, construction consortiums, or any company where a network of professionals shares a goal, could still learn something from Mr Gilliam’s Pythonesque insights. Project leaders may conceive and launch the idea, assemble the team and co-ordinate their work. But once the task is under way, sometimes the most creative act they can perform is not to step up, or step back, but to step out of the way.andrew.hill@ft.com

22;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-09-30T17:53:19Z;Ralph Lauren recruit on a brand new stage;Gap’s Larsson joins fashion company with brief to bring his mass market expertise to luxury group;At first glance Ralph Lauren and Stefan Larsson appear an odd couple.Mr Lauren’s estimated $6bn net worth is built on designs that created consumer aspirations of American country club luxury. Mr Larsson, though similarly dapper, made his name in the mass market through successful tenures at H&M and most recently Gap’s Old Navy.But the pairing at Ralph Lauren, which will begin in November when Mr Larsson takes over as chief executive, should bring important lessons from the mass market, leaving 75-year-old Mr Lauren to step back to a creative role.Mr Larsson’s achievements at Gap and the expectations riding on him at Ralph Lauren were crisply expressed by the two companies’ share price reaction on Wednesday. Shares in Ralph Lauren jumped 12.9 per cent to $117.46 by lunchtime, clawing back some of the 44 per cent slump so far this year, while Gap’s shares tumbled 5.9 per cent.“I’m quite excited about it,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, of Mr Larsson’s move. “He brings exactly what the company needs at this time.”There has been a revolution in fashion retailing in past years across the globe as younger shoppers increasingly choose “fast fashion” clothes from retailers such as like H&M, Inditex’s Zara and Forever 21, over more sedate brands like Gap and J Crew of the US. Fast fashion companies copy catwalk looks and tend to use extremely efficient supply chains to release more collections each year than other retailers.It is the know-how of improving such unsexy back-office areas as supply chain management and his global retailing experience that Mr Larsson can bring to Ralph Lauren, analysts said, rather than prompting the luxury brand to take style cues from fast fashion upstarts.“Ralph Lauren can’t be copying other people, it’s the brand that gets copied,” said Michelle Grant, Euromonitor’s global head of retailing industry research. “[It’s about] how much of those skill sets can be applied without degrading the brand.”Mr Larsson’s three years at Old Navy transformed that brand from being a weight around Gap’s neck to being its star, as the namesake brand struggles. In fiscal 2014 Old Navy pulled in $6.6bn in sales, more than the Gap brand for the first time in four years.Analysts put this down partly to Mr Larsson’s focus on speed to market. The longer it takes to get from the sketching phase to the shop floor or website, the more vulnerability there is to changes in consumer tastes and the economy.This tardiness can have a damaging effect on inventory and margins. Ralph Lauren’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have fallen from 20 per cent of revenues in its 2013 fiscal year to an estimated 15.5 per cent for 2016.The company has already been investing to improve its supply chain and technology to reduce the time it takes to get its designs to market, which one analyst said is longer than the industry average.“Speed to market is critical and that’s what the fast fashion guys are really good at. If Ralph Lauren can be a bit quicker and flexible, it’d be great for margins and the top line,” Ms Nedialkova said.Mr Larsson arrives at Ralph Lauren as sales and profit are falling and as it moves to simplify its structure into six global brands — Polo, Luxury, Home, Club Monaco, Lauren and Denim & Supply — while expanding overseas and cutting $100m in annual costs.Sales at Ralph Lauren dropped 5.4 per cent in the three months to June as profits plunged 60 per cent to $64m. This was partly because of restructuring but also reflected its decision to hold out against discounting, unlike some of its luxury rivals, Euromonitor’s Ms Grant said. Analysts support this strategy, arguing that it helps maintain Ralph Lauren’s brand equity over the long run at a time when the high-end image of rivals such as Michael Kors has taken a hit as they are seen as increasingly ubiquitous.Ralph Lauren is looking to expand sales further in overseas markets, and Mr Larsson’s new colleagues will hope he can replicate his success at H&M, where he spent 15 years. As head of global sales he was instrumental in expanding the Swedish company into a $17bn powerhouse in 44 countries.Analysts said Ralph Lauren should ideally have the key regions of the US, Europe and Asia each contributing 30 per cent of sales. At the moment, Europe stands at 20 per cent and Asia just 12 per cent. The group has been overhauling its Chinese operations since it took direct control of the business in 2010, after it was unhappy with the way that its licensee was handling the brand.When the chief executive steps down the company will do well to remember his brand maximRead moreWhile Ralph Lauren is predominantly seen as a luxury brand, its Polo shirts offer a more affordable entry point, and it operates more of its cheaper outlet stores than retail stores. It does not disclose the breakdown of profits by division, though some analysts think its more affordable ranges could be more profitable.Barclays analysts were encouraged by Mr Larsson’s experience in “women’s fashion in the affordable segment, in which Ralph Lauren is attempting to build a larger business to complement its high concentration in menswear”.However, not all are happy with the new Lauren-Larsson partnership. Robin Lewis, author of the Robin Report on retail strategy, cautioned that Mr Larsson could drag the company away from luxury and even affordable fashion and towards the mass market.“Larsson will simply take the brand closer to the greasy slope down to competing in the world of commodities, which apparel is becoming. Bye bye Ralph,” he said.Most analysts find it hard to see that happening while Mr Lauren, who built his company up on dreams of American luxury leisure, is still ultimately in control of the creative side.And Mr Larsson is not the first executive to shift from mass market to luxury over the past decade or so, but there have not been many. Grita Loebsack left Unilever this year to become CEO of Kering’s luxury couture and leather goods emerging brands division, while Chanel hired Maureen Chiquet from Gap’s Banana Republic in 2003 and she became the company’s CEO in 2007. Ralph Lauren’s chief financial officer is from Procter & Gamble.Mr Larsson’s moves will be watched closely by industry experts to see just how much mass market expertise stays in the nuts and bolts of the industry and away from the catwalk.With additional reporting by Eric Platt
23;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-09-30T17:06:54Z;Gap CEO move sparks fashion share wars;Ralph Lauren price jumps after group poaches Stefan Larsson;Fashion wars erupted on Wall Street as a top executive’s move from Gap to Ralph Lauren sent the rival retailers’ shares careering in opposite directions.Ralph Lauren shares jumped 13.6 per cent to $118.16 after the company poached Stefan Larsson, who has led the revival of Gap’s Old Navy brand, to be its new chief executive.Although Mr Larsson has large shoes to fill at Ralph Lauren, investors welcomed the appointment of a retail executive who also enjoyed success at Swedish retailer Hennes & Mauritz.While the instant verdict from Ralph Lauren shareholders’ on Mr Larsson’s switch was near euphoric, those of Gap were downbeat. Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $28.50, leaving the stock down 32 per cent this year.Analysts at Mizuho did not try to sugarcoat their assessment of the fallout for Gap, which under Mr Larsson’s leadership has proved a bright spot in what remains a testing backdrop for US retailers.The exit of the executive was “a bad omen for Old Navy’s performance going forward (especially facing tougher compares)”, he said. “This is also, in our view, a major loss of brain trust for the company with both Gap and Banana Republic struggling to refine design and supply chain processes to regain footing in the softlines space.”Analysts at the Japanese bank cut their rating on Gap to underperform and lowered the price target to $26.Shares of the retailers swung in sharply different directions in what proved a strong finish to a testing quarter for US stock markets.The S&P 500 closed up 1.9 per cent at 1,920.03, but it is down 7 per cent for the quarter in its worst three-month showing since 2011. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, home to just 30 US companies, was 1.5 per cent firmer at 16,284.70 as the quarter drew to a close, but it has weakened 7.6 per cent during the quarter, marked by anxieties over a global slowdown.The Nasdaq Composite, the benchmark index for the world’s largest technology companies, closed up 2.3 per cent at 4,620.17, bringing its quarterly losses to 7.4 per cent.However, it was a technology company that was one of the biggest risers on Wednesday.Shares of Western Digital, a computer hard disk manufacturer, jumped 15.4 per cent to $79.44 after Unisplendour, a Chinese information technology company, took a stake in the company. The $3.8bn investment by Unisplendour, a subsidiary of state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup, is the latest in a string of deals by the acquisitive Chinese company.Steve Milligan, the chief executive of Western Digital, said the investment will “help facilitate our growth as we look to capitalise on the many opportunities and changes within the global storage industry”.Activist investing has been a key trend in US equity markets this year, and the final day of the quarter saw another company targeted.Shares in Advance Auto Parts surged 11.1 per cent to $189.53 after Starboard Value, an activist firm that has previously pushed Yahoo to make changes, disclosed a 3.7 per cent stake. The investment firm, which is led by Jeff Smith, urged Advance Auto to return more cash to shareholders and eye acquisitions as a means to fuel growth.richard.blackden@ft.comTwitter: @richardblackden
24;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-09-30T14:54:57Z;Ralph Lauren on the importance of a name;When the chief executive steps down the company will do well to remember his brand maxim;"When the FT first interviewed Ralph Lauren in 1989, he laid down a maxim that every designer who puts his or her name on a garment should commit to memory. “You have to be very, very careful with licensing. You must concern yourself with every detail: the quality of the product; how it is delivered to the stores; and how they present your lines.“Most of all you have to be sure that you control everything. Otherwise the licensee might think that they have a hot name and sell in all the wrong places. Before you know it, your name has gone.”Mr Lauren’s name has not gone. But come December, he will have stepped down as chief executive of the empire he built on an idealised vision of how Americans see English tailoring. He will still be executive chairman and chief creative officer, which gives him ample opportunity to monitor the day-to-day decisions of his successor. The designer told Women’s Wear Daily: “This is important to say: there is no toe in the water [of retirement].”Ralph Lauren, the company, faces short-term challenges from “fast fashion”. Its founder’s step back from operational management must increase the risk of brand abuse, despite rigorous policing of trademarks such as the famous polo player (Mr Lauren even has the right to the brand on “meat and living animals”, herds of which roam his Double RL Ranch in Colorado).But the best insurance against abuse of his name is not Mr Lauren’s continued involvement, but the fact he founded the label at the zenith of “hot” — the late 1960s — with a deliberately timeless look. It should easily outlast him. That is more than can be said for other designer brands. If Mr Lauren wants reassurance, he need only Google “Pierre Cardin”, currently adorning an extensive range offered by the UK’s biggest discount clothing chain, Sports Direct."
25;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Ralph Lauren steps down as chief of fashion empire;Old Navy executive Stefan Larsson to take helm in November;Ralph Lauren, the US designer who built a $9bn fashion empire, will step down as chief executive from the company that bears his name as the peddler of pony-emblazoned polos charts a future beyond its founder.The company, which brought preppy sportswear to the masses, revealed Stefan Larsson, global president of Gap division Old Navy, will take the helm in November.Mr Larsson is credited with restoring Old Navy’s fortunes and turning it into Gap’s largest brand, accounting for $6.6bn of the group’s $16.4bn in revenues in its latest fiscal year.Mr Lauren, who showed his latest collection in New York this September, will remain executive chairman and creative chief.“My job is to think always about the future of our company and how to move it forward,” he said. “We have had tremendous success expanding the Ralph Lauren brands around the world and creating a great management team. Now, all the pieces are in place to position our business for continued growth.”The appointment of Mr Larsson, who spent 15 years at Swedish retailer Hennes & Mauritz, follows a tumultuous journey for most US retailers, including Ralph Lauren Corporation.The retailer has reported three consecutive quarters of same-store sales declines, as currency swings and lacklustre economic activity damped its results. Investors have sliced $7.5bn off the market valuation of Ralph Lauren since the end of 2014, when the company was worth $16.3bn.The appointment buoyed investor enthusiasm that Mr Larsson might be able to invigorate sales: shares rose 5 per cent in after-hours trading to $108.80.So-called fast fashion retailers have thrived in the current climate, with Zara and H&M continuously updating merchandise to keep up with consumer trends. US retailer J. Crew, which has a similar design line to Ralph Lauren, has also struggled, while teen retailers such as American Apparel, Abercrombie & Fitch and Aéropostale have failed to drum up stronger sales.While Mr Lauren will remain active at the eponymous label, the shuffle is the latest of several departures in the retail sector. Donna Karan stepped down at the label that bore her name this summer, while Diane von Furstenberg appointed a new chief executive at the company famous for her distinctive wrap dresses.
26;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-09-18T19:02:40Z;New York Fashion Week round-up;Social responsibility was the big message — but it was the shows with just one focus that were the most giving;"It was the season that designers gave back to the city. It started with Riccardo Tisci, who opened the week with a Manhattan debut for Givenchy and a sartorial paean to love, loss and family. The show was co-devised with Marina Abramovic and staged before the twin beams of light that annually light the sky on September 11. His was a broad, all-encompassing message of goodwill to all men, dressed up in couture corsetry and lingerie lace.Others were more specific. To celebrate his 10th year in business, Alexander Wang offered 10 reissued pieces from previous collections to raise funds for Do Something, a non-profit organisation dedicated to empowering youth. It was a potent homecoming for the designer, who will make his grand finale for the Paris-based Balenciaga early next month. Prabal Gurung introduced his SS16 collection with 30 Buddhist monks, who chanted a prayer of gratitude for the world’s help during the earthquake in Gurung’s native Nepal in April. Phillip Lim’s 10th-anniversary show invites came with an appeal to “stop and smell the flowers”.Meanwhile the American brand Coach staged its first ready-to-wear show, having previously done presentations, in a prairie-grassed glass box on the High Line. The location underlined the brand’s ongoing relationship with the pedestrian garden on which it hosts an annual summer party, whose ticket price is put towards the walkway’s upkeep. And at DKNY, the city’s native sons and the house’s incoming designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne (better known as Public School) dedicated their inaugural show to their own “backyard”. Social responsibility and philanthropic “journeys” were central to the week’s event.New York was all about giving. I only wish some designers had given more attention to the clothes. Consistently the most commercial and safest of the schedules, this season was especially lacking in verve. Collections were easy on the eye, but seldom arresting.At the week’s start, rumours were circulating that designer Phoebe Philo may be leaving Céline. The shockwaves will be seismic if she does; that so many of her ideas and silhouettes were revisited in New York was testimony both to her commercial influence but also to the label’s diaspora. Many former Céline studio designers are now elsewhere, and this was an interesting place in which to unpick the threads that bind.While Givenchy was exquisite, and the clothes as epic as the message expansive, most of the stronger shows selfishly ignored any notion of spiritual nourishment and just focused on great design. OK, fine, Proenza Schouler did describe its sensual ruffled-knit dresses as “soulful”, but the love and attention here had been lavished on technique and fabric; and the results were deeply alluring. At Rodarte, the Mulleavy sisters found real spirit in a love-song to a 1970s-era, sequin-spun Stevie Nicks.Elsewhere, Ralph Lauren’s French Tricolore-coloured collection was a masterful exercise in fluid, flattering tailoring, simple shirting and immaculate navy knits while, at Calvin Klein, Francisco Costa explored new territory with a blousy floral print and a homage to 1930s original bombshell Jean Harlow. His long-line, silky, chain-embellished slips were teamed with mannish jackets that drew on the “lusty warmth of the morning after”. One of a number of gentle seductions, Costa also nailed the trend for straps, seen trailing down catwalks everywhere from Michael Kors to Public School, and offered an interesting proposition to the much explored language of masculine/feminine style.It was a good season also for the Park Avenue set. Carolina Herrera scored a coup in persuading the Frick museum to allow her to stage her show in its marble-floored Garden Room, and it was delicious to see the 76-year-old designer’s rose-themed collection away from the gloomy Lincoln Centre, where she has traditionally shown. What better accessory for a petal-soft, sheer, organza shirtdress than Whistler’s “Symphony in Flesh Color and Pink”?And Peter Copping had a powerful second season at Oscar de la Renta, where he drew on Spanish themes (inspired by his predecessor’s “passions” and a visit to the Hispanic Society of Harlem) to deliver carnation-strewn prints, bullfighter scarlets and a score of beautiful gowns. Model Julia Nobis (an absolute catwalk favourite and about to complete a medical degree) scored one of the most gorgeous looks of the week when she stepped out in Copping’s black chiffon-and-lace mermaid gown with glove-like black chiffon sleeves and I had a proper moment before a billowing aqua ball gown with black grosgrain bows.Copping wasn’t supporting any major cause with his collection but his show notes included credits for each member of the de la Renta atelier — an unusual gesture in an industry obsessed with status and the supremacy of a single creative voice. In a very noisy week of giving, it’s a sweet irony perhaps that Copping’s quiet tribute to his team was one of the most generous acts of all.For all of Jo Ellison’s reports from the New York shows, go to our fashion weeks page on the FT web app, or visit our New York Collections Women SS16 fashion weeks hub on FT.comPhotographs: Catwalking.com"

29;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-02-20T16:13:42Z;The dawn of man: New York men’s fashion week;Designers showed a new confidence on the catwalk with their sophisticated and commercial collections;"“We have arrived” — that was the feeling one got from the dozens of New York menswear shows that took place over 10 brittle days this month.It was the last time the menswear collections were to be tied to the womenswear schedule. Two and a half years after London created a viable men’s fashion week — cracking the duopoly held by Paris and Milan — New York’s small but growing cohort of menswear designers is to get its own this July. The move appears to have prompted a maturation and a new ease in the collections: ranges were sophisticated and commercial, even those from designers known for their whimsy, charm or, shall we say, provocation.At Hood by Air, Shayne Oliver’s cult label, gone were the Plexiglas chokers and Great Danes of seasons past. He did not give up entirely on the theatrics — models’ faces were covered with stockings threaded with padlocks — but sharply-collared pleated shirts and wide-legged trousers, as well as a rich camel wool trenchcoat, showed what the team at HBA is capable of: something far beyond streetwear.It’s the brand to watch, even if more attention is paid to Public School. The New York label, fresh from a string of awards, reworked the cool outerwear for which it is known. A grey melange wool coat, mohair bomber and shearling dolman jacket will be on buyers’ lists for autumn. A double-breasted coat stood out amid what was ostensibly a womenswear runway. This was not necessarily a bad thing: womenswear continues to dwarf its male counterpart but the rapid growth of menswear has made it something of a Valhalla for retailers.Duckie Brown, which has dabbled in women’s, stuck to men this time in what was a toned-down, minimalist showing from the outré brand. It was one of the label’s best collections, including transparent silk tops and a pink blush collarless wool overcoat.Tim Coppens, who has also slowly dipped into womenswear, put together one of his strongest runways — a point true for peers Patrik Ervell and the brothers behind Ovadia & Sons. Coppens took inspiration from photographer Derek Ridgers’ shots of punks and skinheads. It was a bit more “raw” than what he typically does, he said backstage. The opening look, a sharp tailored duffel jacket with a leather harness, was simply too cool.Ervell also went for raw, checking brutalist architecture in his show notes. The aviator jackets, as well as an oil-spill overcoat that shimmered a rust colour, had utility. Trousers here were cut wide, a trend spotted at Perry Ellis and Porsche Design, too. Ovadia slowed the pace at its show (models took their time on the catwalk) to fine effect. The clothes were wearable and refined; a bit more urban than the smart sportswear and eveningwear at Ralph Lauren. A silk navy suit worn over a pink cotton T-shirt, a patchwork sweater and a blue calfskin-and-down coat felt luxurious.Billy Reid upped the luxe as well, although with a more relaxed approach, removing darts to give his garments an unstructured feel. With the temperatures outside below freezing, the knit-heavy collection felt timely. Textures were given particular attention, including one grey wool angora overcoat with saddle-brown lapels that looked like an aged rug you’d be remiss to part with.J Crew also slouched it up with alpaca crewnecks and shawl cardigans. Frank Muytjens, director of menswear design, said he was aiming for something more tactile, taking inspiration from army supplies. Todd Snyder, a J Crew alum, took the opposite approach with rigid tailoring, but the collection fell flat, lacking the preppy punch on which Snyder has built his brand.Ahead of menswear’s breakaway, there is industry concern that, with few mega-brands in the schedule, younger designers will struggle to attract big foreign buyers to New York in July when they are normally bound for Europe. But in this last dress rehearsal, there is reason for hope. Gents, David Hart and N Hoolywood all showed fine collections, while Laurence Chandler, one of the designers behind Rochambeau, constructed chunky cable-knit sweaters, a translucent puffer jacket and a solid navy top with rubberised buckles.“This is making sense,” Chandler said of the decision to elevate New York’s menswear designers, adding that he hoped to secure the company’s 30th stockist this year. So long as those buyers make their way across the Atlantic, he won’t have a problem at all.Photographs: Catwalking.com"
30;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-02-20T01:26:06Z;Ralph Lauren — New York Fashion Week AW15 show report;The US luxury retailer plays it safe in neutral colours and clean cuts;"Ralph Lauren has had a horrible year. Profits plummeted 9.3 per cent in the last quarter, and the share price dropped to a low not seen since 2012.The problem is one of scale: Ralph Lauren is a big beast, with myriad diffusion lines, accessories, children’s clothes and homeware all part of the brand’s all-American umbrella. One hit hurts the whole, and the results have propelled the company to announce a re-examination of its management structures. They want to wrest back control of the ancillary lines that have operated on a more regional basis, and consolidate once more.In terms of business the womenswear division has the same centrifugal purpose: it consolidates the brand’s focus and announces its intentions for the next quarter. Ready-to-wear is, after all, the jewel from which all the other Lauren lines are chipped.The forecast for next season was to play it safe: a palette of cream, fawn and heather woollens; and simple clothes cut in classic Lauren lines: three-quarter-length skirts and cable knits, layered cashmere poncho tops and polo necks, and slim-hipped, wide-legged Annie Hall trousers. The silhouette was svelte and smart.There were demonstrations of daring: trapper-hats, fur overthrows of indiscernible origin that trailed towards the floor in shaggy rags and lots of sequin embellishments and low-slung, big-buckled belts. But these were a rather nasty distraction. Just as the group has announced the streamlining of its operations, this AW15 collection would have benefited also from a more rigorous management.Photographs: Catwalking.comFor more reports from the New York shows, go to our fashion weeks page on the FT web app, or visit our AW2015 fashion weeks hub on FT.com"
31;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-02-04T18:27:44Z;Gilead sinks on discounting worries;Consumer discretionary and telecoms offer support to S&P 500;Gilead Sciences shares tumbled on Wednesday despite exceeding fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates after it said it would have to offer discounts on its hepatitis C drug.The California-based company said it would make a “gross to net adjustment” of 46 per cent on US sales of its Harvoni and Sovaldi pills this year.Sales of the company’s older hepatitis C medication, Sovaldi, slowed to $1.73bn from a quarter earlier as patients transitioned to its successor, Harvoni.The new medication, which has a cure rate of 94-99 per cent and a $94,500 price tag for a 12-week treatment, beat Wall Street estimates at $2.11bn. Sales a quarter earlier were limited as the medication was only available in Europe.“Gilead expects lower margins to be offset by higher patient volumes and fewer eligibility restrictions, including treating F0 patients (no fibrosis) in select agreements,” said Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura.Gilead expects to have capacity to treat more than 250,000 patients for hepatitis C in 2015.Matthew Roden, an analyst at UBS, said market penetration would rise as the drug became more affordable, but in the short term “more patients are captured by Gilead ahead of further competition”.But he added that year estimates beyond 2015 would decrease because more patients would have been cured.Gilead profits more than tripled from a year earlier to $3.49bn, or $2.18 a share in the three months to the end of December, while sales more than doubled to $7.3bn.Gilead announced that it would pay a 43 per cent quarterly dividend and announced a $15bn share buyback programme.Shares of Gilead, which have climbed more than 18 per cent in the past year, fell more than 8 per cent to $98.43, wiping $16.5bn in market capitalisation.Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 7 per cent to $676.00 after the restaurant chain reported a 16.1 rise in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, shy of Wall Street estimates for 16.5 per cent growth.Earnings of $3.84 a share topped forecasts, while sales of $1.1bn were in line with estimates.Ralph Lauren was the worst performing stock on the US benchmark after the company reported a 9 per cent drop in fiscal third-quarter profits to $215m or $2.41 a share and sales of $2.03bn that missed Wall Street estimates.The retailer expects fiscal 2015 revenue to rise 4 per cent in constant currency terms, lower than its previous estimates for 5-7 per cent growth. Its shares fell 18 per cent to $139.71.Walt Disney shares advanced nearly 8 per cent to $101.28 after it topped fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales estimates driven by sales of consumer products and home entertainment related to its 2013 animated hit Frozen.Kohl’s reported a 3.7 per cent rise in same-store sales, ahead of its forecast for 2-3 per cent growth, lifting shares up more than 6 per cent to $66.87.Consumer discretionary and telecoms stocks offered support to the US benchmark as lower oil prices and healthcare stocks weighed on the index.The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 2,041.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 17,673.02 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 4,716.70.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
32;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2015-02-04T16:59:12Z;Ralph Lauren shares slide on profit fall;US luxury retailer hit by strong dollar;Ralph Lauren reported a 9.3 per cent drop in quarterly profit, stung by a stronger dollar and weaker than expected sales, sending shares in the US luxury retailer down more than 18 per cent on Wednesday.The company said net income fell to $215m, or $2.41 a share, in the third quarter to December 27, down from $237m, or $2.57 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Net revenue rose 0.9 per cent to $2.03bn, missing Wall Street expectations for the holiday season.Ralph Lauren said it now expected revenue growth of about 4 per cent in 2015, compared with a previous projection of as much as 7 per cent.Like other global luxury groups, including Richemont and Prada, Ralph Lauren has been grappling with foreign currency swings in recent months.Robert Drbul, a Nomura analyst, said this week that because Europe and Asia made up about a third of Ralph Lauren’s revenue, it could face a potential $100m negative impact this fiscal year as the dollar appreciated against the euro and other currencies.But the company remained cautiously upbeat on Wednesday, and looked to reassure investors with an 11 per cent increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.50 a share.“Although our sales were below the expectations we had set, we navigated through the volatile global marketplace by controlling the controllable and delivered an operating margin at the high end of our outlook. Foreign exchange and global consumer spending remain unpredictable, and we are planning our business accordingly,” said Jacki Nemerov, chief operating officer.Ms Nemerov said the group would be implementing a global brand management structure in the coming months that aimed to “operate in a more customer-centric way and provide substantial operating efficiencies”. Ralph Lauren reported $124m in capital expenditures, compared with $81m a year earlier. Arch-rival Michael Kors reports its latest earnings on Thursday.Ralph Lauren’s shares closed 18 per cent lower at $139.71.Hugo Boss was also hit by rising costs, taking a €19m one-off charge due in part to an overhaul of its Middle Eastern distribution network. The German fashion and lifestyle house on Wednesday reported weaker than expected fourth-quarter sales and profit as it contended with stagnant demand in its European home market.Total revenue for the period rose 5 per cent to €684m, missing analysts’ average estimate of €699.4m.“2015 will not become any easier in light of the many economic and political uncertainties,” said Claus Dietrich Lahrs, chief executive.He added that the company would focus expansion efforts in the emerging economies in Asia and eastern Europe to stem the decline in demand in western Europe.Shares in Hugo Boss fell nearly 3 per cent by close of trading in Frankfurt.
33;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2014-09-12T01:02:58Z;New York Fashion Week: Day 7;Show reviews from Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein;"The final day of fashion week in New York always holds a sense of closure, comfort and routine before the circus packs up for London. Partly, this stems from the fact that the same two titan US brands close each season in the same ritualised way. But also, in part, the sense of ritual arises because the catwalks hold few surprises.As usual, Ralph Lauren selected an exotic foreign clime – in this case India – and applied his distinctive Midas touch to a series of feminine, well-executed designs.The fulcrum of the collection was traditional utilitarian safari attire, then adorned with lashings of silk in a rich kaleidoscope of colour dripping with diamanté embellishments. Take the opening look, pocketed khaki cargo pants with a deep purple sari-inspired top and billowing train, or a gauzy double breasted reworking of a utility jacket in citron paired with sleek suede pants and a beaded sports top of cascading semi-precious stones.A series of top-to-toe khaki looks – 1940s style suit skirt combos, or peplum top with pencil skirt – provided an aura of timeless elegance, before an eveningwear finale that married the rigour of sage gazar safari shirts with the fluidity of cascading tulle skirts in dazzling burnt oranges, lemon yellows and magenta.Over at Calvin Klein, Francisco Costa also stuck to what he knew – minimal, streamlined stricture – while simultaneously weaving in a chic and maximal experimentalism via highly technical materials and texture blocking. Navy sleeveless tank dresses were blended with sheer viscose underskirts, spinning into an overall effect of soft form-fitting layers; graphic, creamy, Mondrian-style contrasting blocks made their way on to pleated pants and fluted skirts; and papyrus white and silver engineered knitted dresses and driving coats that shimmered with understated and elegant sophistication.The colour palette, a sea of red, white and blue, felt on point – both on the anniversary of September 11, but also as a reminder of the strong American identity woven into the Calvin Klein aesthetic that Mr Costa appears keen to maintain."
34;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2014-09-04T17:03:57Z;PVH leads retail sector higher on ECB stimulus news;;Consumer discretionary stocks climbed on Thursday, buoyed by new stimulus measures from the European Central Bank and data that showed firmer US economic activity than some economists had expected.The sector, which remains among the worst performing this year after a frigid winter, has been lifted over the past two weeks as investors rotate back into stocks set to benefit from economic expansion.Figures out from ADP showed US payrolls rose by more than 200,000 in August, while initial jobless claims hovered near post-crisis lows and a reading on the country’s service sector showed the fastest pace of growth in nine years.Analysts with Goldman Sachs said they expected retail spending to “gain some ground and advance at a pace more aligned with income growth”, noting anecdotal evidence showed signs of improvement in the key back-to-school selling season.“Consistent income and employment trends remain supportive of a solid backdrop for spending,” Matthew Fassler of Goldman said. “Retail sales and consumer spending growth are in fact consistent, though below levels implied by macro drivers.”Mr Fassler added commodity price pressures, including gas and food costs, had moderated from a year earlier, allowing consumers to shift spending to other areas.“Growth in disposable income is accelerating nicely, on both better growth in wages and salaries, and on the absence of a tax hike,” he said.The decision by the ECB to cut interest rates to a record low and to begin a programme of private-sector asset purchases to spur economic activity also buoyed the sector and broader market on Thursday.Jonathan Glionna, a strategist with Barclays, noted the European market was the second most important sales market for S&P 500 companies.“US equity investors should continue to monitor Europe closely because a revenue growth revival will be difficult to achieve if this important market does not begin growing faster soon,” Mr Glionna said.PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, was among the top performing stocks on the day, after it reported better than expected quarterly results and its chief executive said gains over the remainder of the year would be in part fuelled by improvements in Europe.The company, which affirmed its full-year earnings guidance after market close on Wednesday, soared 10 per cent to $128.38.“We believe that same store sales trends at company-owned Calvin Klein stores in the long-struggling Europe region finally have turned positive in August,” Michael Binetti, an analyst with UBS, said.Venerable names across the sector, including department stores, luxury goods makers and electronics retailers, climbed as well.Best Buy rose 3 per cent to $32.17, Under Armour advanced 2 per cent to $71.96, Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands increased 1 per cent to $64.62 and Ralph Lauren gained 2 per cent to $172.46.Mattress Firm shares jumped 10 per cent to $62.69 after the company agreed to buy The Sleep Train for $425m in a bid to capture more business on the US west coast.Sleep Train’s owners will receive a mix of cash and shares as part of the acquisition.Mattress Firm said the combination would “deliver significant synergies and provide our customers with a greater level of selection”.According to the retailers, the acquisition will generate about $20m of cost savings within three years. The combined company will also maintain both brands.BP slumped after a US District Court in New Orleans found the company acted with gross negligence and wilful misconduct in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.New York-listed shares of the energy company, which is exposed to penalties of up to $18bn, declined 6 per cent to $44.89.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,997.65 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent to 17,069.58.

35;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Michael Kors sinks on wave of target cuts;;Luxury handbag maker Michael Kors was felled on Tuesday as at least three brokerages cut price targets on the company, citing a litany of issues including rising promotions and elevated inventory levels.Analysts with Barclays, Sterne Agee and Citi cut price targets, sending the shares 7 per cent lower to $79.44.Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow noted that Michael Kors had increased discounts over the summer months, a tactic many mall-based retailers have adopted in an effort to boost sales as consumer spending falls short of Wall Street expectations.“Elevated inventory levels, broader discounting and investment needs may all combine to pressure margins in the near future, and as a result, we believe it will be difficult for the stock to outperform materially despite solid top-line trends,” Mr Boruchow said.Barclays analyst Joan Payson added that there was a noticeable “uptick in summer promotional activity compared to that in prior years”, as the company discounted between 30 and 50 per cent of merchandise in stores.The company has seen a sharp reversal in sentiment over the past few months as investor and analyst concerns mount that rapid growth recorded since shares were listed in 2011 cannot be sustained.Michael Kors saw a fourfold jump in its market capitalisation between its debut on the New York Stock Exchange and the start of 2014, touching $20.4bn this past February.The declines on Tuesday took Michael Kors’s descent from that peak to more than 20 per cent and reduced its market cap to $16.5bn.Rivals including Burberry and Ralph Lauren have had a difficult start to the year as well, falling 7 and 10 per cent, respectively.Mr Boruchow noted the handbag maker’s same-store sales “remain among the best in retail” and said Michael Kors would benefit from an expansion in Europe despite a maturing US business.JPMorgan led the benchmark S&P 500 higher after the US bank said quarterly profits topped Wall Street expectations.Profits at the bank fell to $6bn, or $1.46 a share, from $6.5bn, or $1.60 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. The bank also became the latest to suffer a slide in revenues, which fell 2 per cent to $25.3bn.While JPMorgan’s fixed-income division was, once again, the chief drag in the quarter, the decline in trading revenues was not as steep as expected.Fixed-income revenues fell 15 per cent to $3.5bn from the same quarter in 2013. Analysts had forecast a decline of 20 per cent.Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs also surpassed low expectations, reporting a surprise rise in second-quarter profits.Goldman earned $2bn, or $4.10 a share, in the quarter to June 30 compared with $1.9bn, or $3.70 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues climbed to $9.1bn from $8.6bn.The biggest positive surprise came from Goldman’s bond and currency business, historically a key profit engine for the bank.Although revenues fell 10 per cent to $2.2bn, that was less than half the 23 per cent decline that Wall Street analysts had forecast.Shares of JPMorgan climbed 4 per cent to $58.27 while Goldman advanced 1 per cent to $169.17. Morgan Stanley rose 1 per cent to $32.00 while Bank of America increased 2 per cent to $15.81.Campbell Soup and Kellogg were under pressure on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on each to “sell” from “neutral”.Analysts with Goldman warned that eroding demand and higher tomato prices would cut into Campbell’s profits, and said they expected Kellogg to cut guidance as sales remained weak.Shares of Campbell Soup declined 3 per cent to $44.14 while Kellogg fell 1 per cent to $65.56.Overall, markets trended lower following a US Federal Reserve report that said valuations for smaller social media and biotechnology companies appeared “substantially stretched”, despite better than expected revisions to monthly retail sales data.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,973.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 5.3 points lower to 17,060.68. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5 per cent to 4,416.39.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
36;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2014-06-20T15:57:45Z;Coach slides on store closure plans;US handbag maker’s move triggers price target cuts and downgrades;Coach, the venerable US handbag maker that has struggled amid intensifying competition, continued a three-day decline on Friday after the company said on Thursday it would close more than a fifth of its North American full-price stores.The move, which Coach says will cost as much as $300m and bring its mainline store base to roughly 268 locations, triggered at least 20 price target cuts on Wall Street and three downgrades.Chief executive Victor Luis said that the entry-level luxury handbag market had “shifted dramatically” and at times at an investor day alluded to the successes of Kate Spade and Michael Kors.“We have not put sufficient investments and resources behind our brand and fleet, and we have not demonstrated enough fashion innovation in an increasingly competitive category,” Mr Luis said.Analysts with Wells Fargo said the time it will take to complete the company’s transformation, which will also see Coach shift away from heavy promotions, disappointed the market.“Coach is attempting something very difficult in trying to transform its brand, reduce promotions, and attract new customers,” analyst Paul Lejuez said. “The most similar situation, in our view, is that of JC Penney.”Coach shares declined 3 per cent to $34.73 on Friday, taking its losses since the year’s start to 39 per cent.Rival Ralph Lauren rose 1 per cent to $155.57 while Kate Spade climbed 3 per cent to $39.20. Michael Kors was little changed at $88.60.Shares of Oracle, which makes servers, software and developed the Java programming platform, fell 4 per cent to $40.82 after the company missed expectations on two fronts in its latest earnings report.Sales climbed 3 per cent to $11.3bn, while profits fell 4 per cent from a year earlier to $3.6bn, or 80 cents per share. When adjusted for certain items, Oracle said it earned 92 cents per share.Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 95 cents a share on sales of $11.5bn. The company said it failed to ignite new software licence sales, which account for a third of net revenues.“While Oracle accounting is more conservative than many [‘Software as a Service’] peers . . . the low growth rate suggests that the ‘base’ of SaaS business such as 2012 and 2013 acquisitions Taleo, RightNow and Eloqua is underperforming its market,” Citi analyst Walter Pritchard said.Mr Pritchard also downgraded the company to neutral from buy.Darden Restaurants said on Friday that “legal, financial advisory and other costs related to implementation of [its] strategic action plan,” as well as the writedown of the value of some assets, dented profits in the quarter to May 25.The company, which is based in Florida, has been engaged in a high-profile battle with activist investors over how to generate more value from its businesses.Last month, Darden agreed to sell its Red Lobster chain to a private equity firm for $2.1bn, an agreement that riled several activist funds.Profits in the quarter tumbled 35 per cent to $86.5m, or 65 cents a share. Legal and advisory costs, as well as impairment charges, accounted for 19 cents of the drop. When excluding those costs, the company said it earned 84 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts.Shares of the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants owner fell 4 per cent to $47.58.RadioShack, which lost almost $100m in the three months to May 3, fell 10 per cent on Friday to 92 cents, taking it below $1 for the first time in at least 30 years.At its height, RadioShack commanded a market value of more than $15bn – larger than retailers such as Nordstrom and Tiffany – and made more than $2.4bn in profits between 2000 and 2010.But a rapidly changing retail landscape, which has felled so-called big box electronics chains CompUSA and Circuit City, has pushed RadioShack’s market value below $100m.Gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson fell 9 per cent to $15.52 after the company forecast full-year earnings below Wall Street expectations.Overall, US equity markets coasted to new record heights. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,962.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.15 per cent to 16,947.08.

37;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Ralph Lauren shares slip as investors react to muted guidance;;Shares in Ralph Lauren slipped nearly 6 per cent on Friday as investors reacted to lower than expected revenue estimates for the current quarter and management changes at the US retailer.The company beat Wall Street forecasts for fourth-quarter earnings, with net revenue jumping 14 per cent to $1.9bn. Net profit was $153m, or $1.68 a share, up from $127m, or $1.37 a share, during the same period a year earlier. Analysts had predicted $1.63 a share.The company warned that operating margins for the three-month period to June 30 were expected to decline, however. Executives attributed this to heavy future investments in the expansion of its global store network, ecommerce operations and developing fledgling brands.It said global revenues were projected to rise between 6 and 8 per cent in the quarter to roughly $1.74bn. Analysts had estimated an average of $1.8bn.The shares recovered some ground to trade just over 2 per cent down at $148.81. Before Friday, they had lost 14 per cent this year.Rahul Sharma, analyst at Neev Capital, said the market reaction suggested investors were increasingly frustrated with the company’s continually low guidance.Ralph Lauren has enjoyed several strong recent quarters, thanks to burgeoning global appetite for its premium offerings, especially accessories and outerwear.“While this low-balling outlook is hardly out of character for the company, this is yet another ‘investment year’,” Mr Sharma said. “For a business in otherwise good shape, shareholders can’t be blamed for being upset on not seeing any of the upside from the strong sales.”In recent years Ralph Lauren has sought to open more stores and diversify its brand portfolio across the pricing spectrum. This has also triggered a series of leadership changes, designed to streamline management operations.The retirement of Roger Farah, the company’s executive vice-chairman, was announced on Friday, effective at the end of the month. A Ralph Lauren veteran, Mr Farah was president and chief operating officer for 13 years until November and was widely credited with turning the brand into a powerhouse.“During his tenure, Roger helped us assume direct control of our most strategically important regions and merchandise categories, evolving our company into a highly profitable, global business. He’s cultivated an impressive team of leaders who are ready to build on the strong foundation he has established,” said Ralph Lauren, chairman. Mr Lauren and Jacki Nemerov, the new chief operating officer, will assume Mr Farah’s responsibilities.The speculation on Wall Street is that Mr Farah will not be out of the industry for long.“Roger Farah is to retail what Bono is to music. His retirement is bad for Ralph Lauren. He’s only 60. Still another job in him, and I could think of a few,” tweeted Brian McGough, a retail strategist at Hedgeye Retail.
38;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Top-end brands cautious about outlook;;Ralph Lauren and Estée Lauder took the shine off strong US sales in the last quarter by painting a less enthusiastic outlook for future profit growth.Lower company forecasts on profit margins from Ralph Lauren and caution from Estée Lauder damped investor confidence, after an early surge.Ralph Lauren shares were down 2 per cent at $151.09 by midday in New York, while Estée Lauder was down by almost 5 per cent to $65.95, after rising as much as 8 per cent in premarket trading.Ralph Lauren’s caution that increased promotions may eat into gross margins scared away investors who had earlier pushed the stock higher.The company had reported a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like third-quarter sales to $2.2bn, fuelled by strong growth in its core North American merchandise.Profits rose 10 per cent to $237m, or $2.57 in earning per share on a diluted basis, up from $216m, or $2.31 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street had predicted earnings of $2.51.Ralph Lauren, founder and chief executive, said the accelerated profit and high single-digit revenue growth across all international markets in the last quarter had been driven by a surge in consumer appetite for the luxury brands at the highest end of its portfolio.Similarly, Estée Lauder said demand across beauty product categories for top-price labels such as Jo Malone and Tom Ford had fuelled sales growth over the holiday season. However, margins were squeezed and the company faced a slowdown in the Asian market.A 3 per cent rise in global sales to $3.02bn had been boosted by the company’s core US market, where revenue rose 5 per cent to $1.19bn.Overall sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East climbed 7 per cent in the company’s second-quarter to $1.18bn. But softer than expected results weighed heavily on the Asia-Pacific region, where sales slipped by 6 per cent to $643m amid currency headwinds and competitive pressures in markets such as China, Taiwan and Korea.Diluted earnings per share of $1.09 slipped from $1.16 in the previous period.Estee Lauder lowered the high end of its revenue outlook by one percentage point to the range of 6 per cent to 7 per cent, but affirmed its earnings outlook for the year.Results from both companies confirmed that western markets had compensated for slowing growth in emerging economies.Many mass market retailers had struggled to attract shoppers over Christmas in North America, causing discounting which spread across the industry.The Ralph Lauren and Estée Lauder results came a day after US ‘accessible luxury’ group Michael Kors beat expectations as third-quarter revenue jumped 51 per cent in North America and more than doubled in Europe, with total sales of almost $1bn.
39;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2013-08-07T21:21:52Z;Financials drop as S&P 500 falls again;;Financial and consumer discretionary stocks fell on the second straight day of a broad sell-off in US stocks, with fashion retailer Polo Ralph Lauren down after a disappointing earnings report.The company known for popular brands such as Polo said earnings fell due to thinner margins. That sent shares lower by 8.6 per cent to $173.13.Ralph Lauren has benefited from a 2013 rally in consumer discretionary stocks, which tend to perform well in strong economic environments, despite weak earnings in previous quarters. Shares in the company are still up 15.5 per cent in 2013.Ralph Lauren was far from alone on Wednesday, as seven of the 10 major sectors of the S&P 500 were in negative territory, with the index off 0.4 per cent to 1,690.91.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq followed suit, both down 0.3 per cent to 15,470.67 and 3,654.01 respectively.The financial sector was off 0.8 per cent. Major US banks extended Tuesday’s falls, with Bank of America losing 0.8 per cent to $14.53 and US Bancorp down 1.1 per cent to $37.21.Strong earnings helped some companies avoid the day’s selling. Time Warner rose in early trading but finished the day down 0.4 per cent to $63.84 after the company reported earnings that bested estimates.The media conglomerate that owns Time Inc, HBO, and Warner Brothers also raised its profit outlook.Time Warner’s former stablemate AOL rose after announcing a deal to buy video company Adap.tv. Shares in AOL added 1.4 per cent to $36.69.Twenty-First Century Fox A shares rose 1.9 per cent to $31.81 after reporting quarterly earnings that beat expectations. The report marked the first results from the company since its split from News Corp.But quarterly results were not positive for all. The Walt Disney Company fell 1.7 per cent to $65.91 despite reporting earnings per share that beat estimates. Analysts noted that profits missed expectations when deferred cable revenue was subtracted.Disney expects to lose up to $190m on its disappointing summer movie The Lone Ranger.But S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi maintained a “strong buy” rating on Disney.“We see no signs of a consumer spending slowdown at Disney’s core businesses, with key catalysts still in place for ESPN and other cable networks, and record attendance at domestic parks,” Mr Amobi said in a note.Real estate website Zillow fell sharply after a note from RBC Dominion Securities said that despite strong earnings, the company’s upside is limited after a 200 per cent rise in 2013.Zillow shares fell 7.7 per cent on the day to $83.73.Trulia, a rival of Zillow, was also lower, down 4.9 per cent. Its shares have had a similar meteoric rise in 2013, up 157 per cent on the year to date.The broader fall in US stocks cause the S&P 500 to log its first three-day losing streak since early June. The benchmark index is off 0.9 per cent in that time.Recent headlines of record highs and the breach of the 1,700 level for the first time mask the fact that the S&P 500 is now almost exactly flat in the last two weeks, off just 0.1 per cent.That may be an indication of both the relative quiet in the news, as well as what could be in store for the rest of 2013, said John Sawyer, chief investment officer of BBVA Compass in Houston“There’s not a lot of news in the market. The attention has turned back to the quantitative easing reduction, with some speculation of a more substantial statement in September,” Mr Sawyer said. “I think to some degree the buyers have moved into a wait and see mode.”Flat trading to the end of the year would leave the S&P 500 up 18.6 per cent in 2013.“We’ve obviously come a long way fast. What we’re expecting is somewhat of a plateau through year-end. I think everyone would be pleased if we ended with the numbers we have today.”
40;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2013-06-02T13:57:09Z;US brands bet big on Europe;Labels target bigger slice of €74.2bn luxury market;US brands such as Ralph Lauren, Coach and Michael Kors are betting on Europe’s retail sector by increasing their presence on the continent with the aim of securing a larger slice of its €74.2bn luxury market.Last Wednesday, Michael Kors reported a 97 per cent increase in fourth-quarter sales revenue for Europe, as well as revealing plans to double both its retail and wholesale presence in the region over the next 12 months.“We’re seeing big business in all local European markets,” said chief executive John Idol last week, as the group reported record full-year earnings of $2.1bn for 2013.“We are probably one of the few companies that can say we are excited about our business in Spain, in Italy and in Greece, as well as healthier markets like the UK, France and Germany.”Ralph Lauren, which derives a fifth of annual sales from the continent, forecast accelerated growth thanks to expansion of their long established store network into under-penetrated central and eastern Europe. Other premium fashion labels including Tory Burch and J Crew have also recently confirmed that they see major growth opportunities within the region.Given that a gloomy economic climate continues to weigh heavily on consumer spending in both the UK and the eurozone, a high-profile move across the Atlantic seems counter-intuitive to many.Yet the European luxury market remains the largest and most lucrative in the world. Data compiled by Bain & Co show that the European region accounted for 35 per cent of all luxury sales by area in 2012, followed by the Americas and Asia-Pacific generating 31 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.Europe’s growth potential, added to the continent’s high household consumer spending per capita, has attracted US brands to the continent’s luxury market. In recent months, many have begun to reap the rewards of pricing decisions made by their European industry rivals.Some continental labels have been plagued recently by flat or negative regional sales: last month, Italian accessories group Tod’s said that total revenue for its latest quarter had slipped by almost 5 per cent thanks to a decline in spending within its core home markets.Claudia D’Arpizio, a Milan-based partner at Bain & Co, said that local consumers were now turning away from certain European luxury brands, after product prices were raised to bring them closer in line with those of mainland China.Chinese tourists were behind one-third of overall luxury sales made in Europe last year. Many choose to shop abroad as a result of heavy-duty taxation placed on imported products at home.“After spending heavily on Chinese expansion, European brands decided to rebalance global prices to try and make good on their investments, thinking it would encourage Chinese to spend more in their domestic market. Instead, they have alienated cash-strapped local consumers at home,” Ms D’Arpizio said.As a result, a growing vacuum at one end of the luxury market is now being filled by US brands offering products at more accessible prices.“These US businesses have pioneered the concept of an affordable luxury lifestyle brand. When you take their diffusion lines into account, their average accessories price point hovers around the $300-400 mark, significantly less than that of European labels,” said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Citigroup.“For recession-hit consumers who have maintained an appetite for stylish product, American labels are becoming an increasingly seductive alternative.”
41;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2013-05-23T17:07:05Z;Ralph Lauren earnings soar despite weaker sales;;Ralph Lauren has unveiled a 35 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits, despite experiencing weaker-than-expected sales and failing to meet its fiscal year forecast for 2013.The US fashion retailer reported net income of $127m, or $1.37 per share in the last quarter, up from $99m, or 99 cents per share in the same period last year. Fourth quarter net revenues edged up by 1 per cent to $1.64bn, falling short of the consensus estimate of analysts at $1.7bn, and missing the company’s forecast of mid-single digit revenue growth.Net revenue for the full year fiscal 2013 rose 1 per cent to $6.9bn.Ongoing macroeconomic pressures, a 4 per cent decline in wholesale orders and unseasonably cold weather in Europe and the US had weighed heavily on sales growth in recent months, the company reported on Thursday.Roger Farah, Ralph Lauren’s chief operating officer, called fiscal 2013 “a year of two halves,” with a surge in profit in the latter part of the year as a result of the group’s increased gross margin, thanks to lower cotton prices and in-house cost-cutting.The company has shuttered its Rugby and American Living brands in the last year, focusing instead on the expansion of its Ralph Lauren labels, as well as its Polo and Club Monaco businesses.At the company’s own stores open at least a year, revenue was up 7 per cent.Looking ahead to 2014, the group remained guarded, projecting below consensus revenue growth of between 4 and 7 per cent. Some analysts said this “sandbagging” strategy was to be expected from the company, which has in the past provided cautious forecasts only to surprise on the upside.“It’s a typical move in the Ralph Lauren playbook – guide as horribly as you can in order to beat big later,” said Rahul Sharma, managing director at Neev Capital.However, Mr Sharma also said the results were encouraging, particularly coming from an apparel-focused company with heavy exposure to local demand in Europe.“Ralph Lauren may lowball Wall Street in the short term but they also manage very efficiently for every eventuality – in the long term this has really paid off for them, as with other prudent luxury players such as Richemont and Estee Lauder.”Shares, which hit a 52-week high on Wednesday, were trading down 2.44 per cent at $183.47 by midday on Thursday in New York.
42;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2013-04-22T17:18:15Z;Ralph Lauren settles bribery charges;;American fashion group Ralph Lauren has agreed to pay $1.6m to US authorities to settle allegations that it bribed government officials in Argentina.Ralph Lauren said in settlements with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice that from 2005 until 2009 a general manager in its Argentina subsidiary arranged the payment of $568,000 in cash to customs officials to permit clearance of items without the required paperwork, to clear prohibited goods, and to avoid inspection of products.The company also said in court filings that the general manager provided several gifts to three different Argentine government officials that included perfume, dresses and handbags valued between $400 and $14,000 each. The bribes were disguised in invoices as “Loading and Delivery Expenses” and “Stamp Tax/Label Tax”, the SEC said.Ralph Lauren agreed to settle civil and criminal investigations by agreeing to a statement of facts as part of a “non-prosecution agreement” with the SEC and DoJ.In return, the fashion designer agreed to pay the SEC $593,000 in connection with the bribe payments plus $141,846 in interest. The company paid the DoJ $880,000 in fines.The maker of the Polo brand and Ricky bag also said it closed its operations in Argentina.The SEC said it credited Ralph Lauren for reporting the violations two weeks after a new internal compliance programme in 2010 identified the improper payments.“When they found a problem, Ralph Lauren Corp did the right thing by immediately reporting it to the SEC and providing exceptional assistance in our investigation,” said George Canellos, acting director of the SEC’s enforcement division. “The NPA in this matter makes clear that we will confer substantial and tangible benefits on companies that respond appropriately to violations and co-operate fully with the SEC.”The SEC said it was the first time it has agreed to grant a company a non-prosecution agreement for foreign bribery violations. In 2010, the SEC said for the first time it would credit companies that come forward through these non-prosecution pacts. It agreed to the first NPA later that year with Carter’s, the children’s clothing company, over accounting violations.The company, “investigated, self-reported, co-operated fully with the authorities, conducted a worldwide risk assessment and implemented a series of remedial measures, including enhanced compliance programs and training”, said Tom Hanusik, a lawyer for Ralph Lauren.
43;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-08-08T18:30:06Z;Ralph Lauren forecasts stormy seas ahead;Note of caution despite better than expected results;Ralph Lauren, the US luxury retailer, warned revenues were expected to decline in the current quarter due to weakness in the global economy and as it overhauls its distribution network in mainland China.The weaker outlook came as the group reported better-than-expected earnings, which saw net revenue rise 4 per cent to $1.59bn in the quarter ended June, up from $1.53bn in the comparable period last year.Growth was attributed to a robust performance in North American clothing and improved sales at factory outlets and online stores. But heavy exposure to troubled European markets, particularly Italy and Spain, the effects of a strong dollar and higher inventory costs thanks to a spike in cotton prices were highlighted as ongoing concerns.Net income in the quarter rose 5.1 per cent to $193m, or $2.03 per share, up from $184m, or $1.90 per share, from the same quarter last year. Analysts had forecast net income of $1.78 per share, according to FactSet.Roger Farah, chief executive, said the group closed 60 per cent of its partnered distribution network in Greater China, while sales within lucrative department store concessions in South Korea and Japan declined.Ralph Lauren this month said it was temporarily shutting all its stores in Argentina due to high import taxes and currency restrictions.Mr Farah said he remained cautious about growth for the rest of the fiscal year with net revenues expected to fall by a “mid-single-digit” percentage in the three months ended September.However, rising sales at group-owned stores, primarily fuelled by tourist spending, should help offset a planned reduction in wholesale business to department stores and other retailers.“The outlook for consumer spending and global economic growth remains challenging and we are planning our business accordingly,” Mr Farah said.Unlike many luxury brands, Ralph Lauren is yet to fully benefit from the booming appetite of Chinese consumers for Western prestige products. Chinese customers generated just 2 per cent of annual group sales.“For several European rivals, Chinese purchasing power creates 25-40 per cent of sales – this is a market we have yet to fully tap,” Mr Farah said.Ralph Lauren said it planned to focus on building its share of sales from Chinese tourists over the course of 2013.
44;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-07-14T00:16:09Z;Ralph Lauren seeks to calm Olympic furore;;Ralph Lauren said it would manufacture US Olympic team uniforms in America for the 2014 winter games in Russia after facing congressional fury this week over revelations that the outfits for this year’s squad were made in China.“Ralph Lauren promises to lead the conversation within our industry and our government to address the issue to increase manufacturing in the US,” the company said. “We have committed to producing the opening and closing ceremony Team USA uniforms in the US that will be worn for the 2014 Olympic Games.”The decision came after two days of intense pressure from Congress, where some lawmakers called for the Chinese-made kit to be burnt and replaced with ones produced domestically.“Our Olympians don’t train their entire lives to don Chinese uniforms,“ said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York who was the latest to step into the fray on Friday.Mr Schumer fired off a letter to the US Olympic Committee saying Hickey Freeman, a suit maker based in Rochester, New York, was willing to produce “sports coats and dress trousers” in time for the opening ceremonies in London at the end of the month.Mr Schumer’s move came after Harry Reid, the Democratic senator from Nevada and the majority leader in the upper chamber of Congress, said scathingly on Thursday that the US Olympic Committee should be “ashamed” of itself.“I think they should be embarrassed. I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again,” Mr Reid said. “If they have to wear nothing but a singlet that says USA on it, painted by hand, then that’s what they should wear.”John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, was less aggressive, but did say of the USOC: “You’d think they’d know better.”The reaction reflects the anger at China and the anxiety about the economic impact of globalisation that is pervasive in Congress – and is exacerbated by election-year politics.Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for the White House, are trying to present themselves as tougher than their opponent in dealing with China. Mr Obama’s campaign has launched fierce attacks on Mr Romney for promoting the outsourcing of US jobs during his tenure at the helm of Bain Capital, the private equity firm.The USOC said it took “seriously the concerns we’ve heard from members of Congress and the American public” but could not make the change in time for the London games since the “apparel distribution process” was already starting this weekend. But it asked for Americans to support the US athletes and rally around the team.
45;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-06-08T23:14:21Z;Pick and mix;More men are experimenting with bold combinations of colours and patterns;"In the natural world, it is usually the male bird that has the boldest plumage – and it is usually in spring and summer that his display is at its finest. This year designers have taken note, encouraging men to unleash their inner peacock with bold displays of colour and print.Is this a frightening idea? Maybe, until you consider that it’s the male bird’s sartorial display that ultimately gets the mate. Perhaps it’s worth giving pattern a chance.Admittedly, the conventions of many professions and workplaces decree that colour and pattern are limited to accessories: ties, handkerchiefs, shirts and, for some individualists, socks. Contemporary pattern mixing can be brought into the office, however. James Brady, a 32-year-old underwriter with insurer Hiscox in the City, has in the past year adopted a preppy look from the London branch of Brooks Brothers. “I like to wear a spread-collar blue gingham shirt with a bright diagonally striped tie or even a madras checked tie,” he says. “Even my blue suit is in a birdseye pattern, so there is a little bit of pattern mixing there also. A lot of my clients are in the media and technology sectors and they seem to approve.”While Brady is a Scot who likes American influences, Dr Matthew Witten is an American who is devoted to the quirky Britishness of Duchamp. The brand made its name with richly decorative silk ties, pochettes and cufflinks and now has a full menswear range in the same ethos. Witten, 38 and chief physicist in the cancer department of a hospital in New York state, chose a Duchamp tie for a wedding five years ago and now has an extensive wardrobe of the brand’s styles. “In my job I have to look professional, but as a physicist I like playfulness and whimsy. In the winter I work around a palette of darker hues but at this time of year I’ll wear an orchid-coloured linen windowpane blazer with a light purple jacquard shirt, floral tie, patterned socks and khaki trousers. If I remove the tie, it’s perfect for going straight out in the evening.“I recently started wearing bow ties and found that one with multicoloured dots of different sizes on a black base went really well with a maroon-and-white checked shirt. It’s surprising what works.”Brands such as Paul Smith, Etro, Polo Ralph Lauren, Gant and Liberty regularly show patterns and colours together that could work in the office, while Tom Ford has some striking formal shirt combinations this season: a royal blue and white gingham shirt with a royal blue and white large polka dot tie and a royal blue and white small dot pocket square.“Many designers have played with print and colour this spring and we’ve seen strong sales in both areas,” says Jeremy Langmead, editor-in-chief of online boutique mrporter.com. “Men are obviously a lot more confident about mixing things up a little than they were a few years ago. The key is to take one print at a time and team it with something more neutral: like a pair of Ikat print trousers from Burberry teamed with a cream sweater; or a graphic print T-shirt by Lanvin worn with a navy jacket. If you’re feeling bold you can clash the patterns a bit – with shirts and ties, where stripes and polka dots always work well together.”“On mixing patterns, checks and stripes easily work together. Some combinations, like classic club stripes on ties against check shirts, are timeless,” says Edward Sexton, the London-based tailor who made his name as the cutter for Tommy Nutter. “The key to successful colour mixing is to have combinations that romance each other. They have to be tonal and from the same part of the colour wheel or spectrum, or they have to be from opposite sides.”This season menswear brands from Acne to Z Zegna are offering bright cotton trousers, principally in jean- or chino-cut styles, and equally bright cotton blazers, often in double-breasted options. For those men not yet ready to wear an array of patterns, however, a bold colour worn with a bold pattern is a way to test the waters. Further colour and pattern injections can come from socks, casual shoes, pocket squares, belts and summer scarves.It’s something to tweet about, anyway.……………………………………………………………..Detailswww.brooksbrothers.comwww.duchamplondon.comwww.edwardsexton.co.ukwww.mrporter.com"
46;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-05-07T21:48:49Z;Luxottica stays in vogue in EM;;"Despite jitters about slowing growth in China and Brazil, emerging markets remain a good place to be for luxury goods makers.The proof? Luxottica, the Italian eyewear maker and owner of the upmarket Ray-Ban and Oakley brands, on Monday said it recorded its best first quarter ever, with sales and net income up 15 and 27 per cent respectively, thanks to surging demand for designer shades in Brazil, India and east Asia.Net income for the three months to March 31 was €131m, compared to €115m the same period last year. The figure includes a €15m one-off charge related to the reorganisation of the company’s business in Australia. Stripping that out, adjusted net income rose 27 per cent to €146m.While sales in North America (+8 per cent) and Europe (+6 per cent) remain robust, sales in emerging markets grew by a whopping 36 per cent. Within this, Brazil, India and east Asia each saw sales climb some 40 per cent, the company said.In a way, Luxottica is probably one of the biggest consumer companies that consumers have never heard of.In addition to owning Sunglass Huts, LensCrafters and Pearle Vision, the Italian company also makes sunglasses under licence for Burberry, Chanel, Polo Ralph Lauren, Paul Smith, Stella McCartney, Tiffany, Versace, Miu Miu and Donna Karan.In recent years, the company has been pushing aggressively in emerging markets as it looks to cash in on the rise of a large, fashion-oriented middle-class population in Asia, India and Latin America.Luxottica, which was considered relatively slow in moving into China compared with rivals, has 250 company-owned LensCrafters optical stores in the Middle Kingdom while in India it has 20 Sunglass Huts, although these are operated with a local partner as required by Indian law.In Latin America, Luxottica has expanded – first with the acquisition of MultiOpticas and two retailers in Mexico and most recently, with the purchase of Grupo Tecnol in Brazil.The group said the two purchases lifted revenue by about €40m in Q1.“The Brazilian market is already extraordinarily important for us and we aim at making it one of the top five countries by turnover, along with the US, Italy, France and Australia,” Andrea Guerra, Luxottica group chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times last year.Luxottica is not alone in benefiting from the EM middle class’s love affair with designer bling. Both Coach, the US bag maker and Apple reported strong quarterly results, thanks to EM sales growth, especially in China.As fears of sluggish global growth continue to infect both developed and emerging economies, it remains to be seen whether demand for $400 sunglasses will continue to hold. Especially as EM consumers get savvier about luxury goods.But until then, Luxottica will enjoy its moment in the sun.Related reading:

47;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-04-06T23:17:20Z;Colouring in;Pastels pack a punch this spring, from Beams Plus’s peachy pink double-breasted blazer to Gap’s chinos;"It started with a pair of pale pink socks,” says City management accountant James Hartnett. “Then some baby blue cords and a lilac sweater, and I was hooked. It’s become something of an obsession. My girlfriend jokes that it’s like living with a children’s TV presenter.”Pastel colours are popping up like daffodils in the spring. Step in to any high street chain and it would be easy to think you’d encountered an aggressive Easter promotion. Click online and, under the slogan “Make life more colourful”, Uniqlo divides its men’s range by colour: light blue, pink, orange, green – take your pick. But this isn’t about bunnies and parades.“I‘m sure it’s not just me who’s bored with so-called ‘recession-wear’,” says British designer Jonathan Saunders, whose sophomore men’s collection this summer majors on pastel knits (£688) and colourful chinos (£390). “A sharp black suit can look great but adding a little colour makes a real difference. Designing menswear can be quite restrictive, as there’s a standard basic silhouette you generally have to follow; adding colour and print is the sure-fire way to make a statement and look like you take pride in your appearance. I basically design clothes that I’d want to wear myself.”“Personally, I just feel that after all the recent doom and gloom a bit of colour adds a little fun to our lives,” says Patrick Grant, creative director of E Tautz. “There has always been quite a bit of colour in men’s fashion if you knew where to look, but it seems to have really spilled over into the mainstream in the past few years.”“Our pale blue jeans (£34.90) have been very successful,” says Hide Nishino, manager of Uniqlo’s store on Oxford Street. “Men are becoming braver and more experimental with colour; from those who go for a total head-to-toe look to the guy who just wants a pair of coloured chinos for his summer holiday. I don’t think you can go wrong with colour as long as you wear it with conviction. Just choose your ‘hero’ colour and stick to it; too many colours together can look a little jumble sale.“Colour was previously seen as a womenswear thing,” adds Nishino, “but retailers are now really having to adapt to this demand for more colour from their male customers.”According to Jeremy Langmead, editor in chief of etailer Mr Porter: “Men have become more confident with colour, partly because when something becomes more readily available and is seen in stores more frequently it seems more commonplace and less scary.“Partly, it’s a nod back to the 1970s, when men wore extraordinary colour concoctions without the slightest hesitation,” Langmead adds. “Look at all those wonderful Slim Aarons’ photographs of the well-heeled posing on their manicured lawns by their California pools. Think of pictures of Patrick Litchfield in yellow floral shirts, Terence Stamp in a bright pink suit, David Hockney plastered in stripy pastels.”Today that translates as Japanese label Beams Plus’s peachy pink double-breasted blazer (£475), Brooks Brothers’ Black Fleece mint green shirt (£135), Turnbull & Asser’s baby blue cashmere sweater (£325) and Gap’s pastel chinos (£25).“Our customers are buying colour mainly in shirting, knitwear and chinos and wearing it in a preppy, Ralph Lauren way,” says Lee Douros, menswear buying manager at My-Wardrobe.com. “Polo Ralph Lauren is always a great brand for summer and does colour in a way easy to translate into everyday life.” See, for example, pink stripe cotton poplin shirts (£95); pastel pima cotton knits (£115); and a pair of coral slim fit chinos (£179).“Colour is a fundamental way of bringing personality and attitude to menswear,” says tailor Richard James, who is celebrating 20 years on Savile Row through a collaboration with high street giant Marks and Spencer featuring an orange striped shirt (£49.50) and matching neckwear (£29.50). “I think these things are to an extent cyclical and right now colour is very relevant again,” says James.……………………………………………………………..Detailswww.beams.co.jpwww.brooksbrothers.comwww.gap.euwww.jonathan-saunders.comwww.marksandspencer.comwww.mrporter.comwww.my-wardrobe.comwww.turnballandasser.comwww.uniqlo.com"
48;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-03-19T16:21:46Z;The new iPad’s unexpected effect on luxury;;"When the new  iPad went on-sale at midnight last Friday night it provoked the usual frenzy — miles of lines, ecstatic buyers — as well as one very interesting blog that somehow seems to have fallen through the cracks over the weekend. I think it’s worth revisiting.It was written by Evan Clark, deputy business editor of WWD (the site of insider fashion publication Women’s Wear Daily), and it takes a good, analytic look at the general perception that Apple is a luxury brand (a perception that Apple itself has created), pointing out that it does tick all the boxes save one; exclusivity. But here’s what I wonder: is exclusivity really a luxury value these days?We (the public) think it is, but that may be an issue of perception, rather than reality.As Mr Clark notes, Apple is available everywhere, including Walmart, which is generally regarded as having nothing to do with luxury. This he believes makes Apple a special case, since luxury “has long used scarcity to its advantage”. But has it really?Historically — yes. But that was as much as issue of logistics as philosophy. As the industry has become increasingly global, “scarcity” has become a relative term: a luxury brand with over 300 stores around the world certainly has fewer points of sale than, say, the Gap or P&G, but I think it would be pushing the logic of the word to label it “scarce.”Besides, there is a very similar luxury model to that of Apple’s already in existence and used as fruitfully by brands like Polo Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani — create a luxury tip of an iceberg, house it in a super-fabulous loss-leading flagship store, and support it by much more mass, widely available lines (often made in China, just like Apple’s products).Apple has done exactly the same. The only difference I see is that it sells all its products in the mass areas, which luxury brands do not, tending instead to reserve the super-special for their own stores.Either way, this gets at the core of a current hot-button debate within the luxury industry about the importance of exclusivity. Mr Clark says, “[Apple] is a luxury retailer that’s transcended scarcity and its approach has been too successful to argue against”. Yet currently a number of luxury brands, led by Hermes and Louis Vuitton, neither of which permit any wholesale activity, are doing exactly that.Indeed, a retailer told me the other day that Prada had told her they were hoping to phase out all their wholesale accounts too; that they had decided wholly-owned models, with full pricing control, was the most effective way forward. Meanwhile, Harry Winston actually has a number of stores – around 50 – that they say they do not want to grow beyond.All of which makes me wonder if the success of Apple at co-opting part, but not all, of the luxury model, and the attention it had brought to what the parameters of that model are, may have an unexpected effect on luxury itself: forcing it to differentiate itself and in the process actually define a word that in the last decade has become wholly elastic. Exclusivity has become an existentialist concept. Wouldn’t you like to know exactly what it means?While we wait to see what, if anything, luxury comes up with, I’m very curious if anyone has a definition of their own to offer. Exclusively on this blog, of course."
49;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-03-09T18:31:40Z;Brand new thinking on luxury shares;I thought Emporio was Giorgio Armani’s brother, writes Dina Iordanova;A few years ago, I was rather ignorant of luxury brands. I couldn’t tell my Bulgari from my Berlutti, and I thought Emporio was the name of Giorgio Armani’s brother.But, as I have spent more time in Asia, I have come to realise the key role luxury brands play in the minds of Asian consumers.First, there was my Thai doctoral student, who has been scrutinising teenage culture in Bangkok. According to her research, urban Thai youth would forego food just for the sake of acquiring at least one luxury item from Louis Vuitton or Dior – which they would want to buy at full price from the brand’s official store. No fakes, no bootlegs, no cut price or second-hand deals.Then, walking the streets around Aoyama in Tokyo, and the upscale malls of Hong Kong, I grasped that the trade in top luxury brands is there to stay. It is being fuelled by the newly discovered purchasing power of people free of the economic gloom that has settled in the west.These lessons learnt, it crossed my mind that building a portfolio comprising top-tier luxury brands could be a good inflation-proof strategy. These shares seem to have a lot going for them: momentum, good liquidity, speculative upside. Should I try to overcome my deep-seated prejudice that bags and rags cannot possibly be a serious underlying asset? Should I buy these shares, as they keep climbing even further– even if they appear overvalued?While exploring this idea, I came to realise that it might be easier said than done.Putting together my fantasy luxury portfolio would be hampered, first and foremost, by the fact that many luxury brands remain privately held and out of reach. Those that are publicly traded are listed on different exchanges in different currencies.Ralph Lauren, Estee Lauder, and Tiffany & Co are listed on the New York Stock Exchange in US dollars. LVMH and PPR are listed in Paris in euros. Antichi Pellettieri, Luxottica Group, Tod’s and Ferragamo trade in euros, but on Borsa Italiana in Milan. Prada trades on the volatile Hong Kong stock exchange in dollars – a market that, while accessible, has its own complex trading rules and follows its own logic.When one adds the need to go through currency conversion, and keep the related volatility in check, there are enough risk factors here to deter investors like me. For much the same reasons, I wouldn’t want to invest via a supranational luxury brands fund, either.So, how about the modest number of UK luxury brands?Well, while their shares keep climbing, I keep thinking I have missed the boat and they cannot possibly go up any further. I admit I have been thinking this for a year or so now – while watching in disbelief the unstoppable rise of Burberry, which is up more than 20 per cent in the year to date, and Mulberry, which has proved a staggering ten-bagger since its flotation in 2008 IPO, and is up 30 per cent in the past 12 months.For the time being, my only flirt with “luxury” is Las Vegas Sands, owner of casinos and, most importantly, of the indulgent Marina Bay Sands hotel and resort in Singapore.I bought into its shares not for the gambling revenues, but mainly because of my fond memories of the 150m-long infinity pool on the roof of Moshe Safdie’s fantasy complex, where scores of young girls flock to the shops in the adjacent luxury oasis.However, I am contemplating dipping my toe into other investments in the luxury sector.Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments.

50;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-02-08T21:39:59Z;US stocks react to 2012 forecasts;;Shares in IT outsourcing company Computer Sciences Corp soared as much as 25 per cent in the morning session as the company wrote down losses from a UK government contract.The shares pared gains but still closed up 18.5 per cent to $31.39.CSC booked a loss of $1.5bn, or almost $10 a share, on a contract to computerise the records of the UK’s National Health Service. Shares had fallen 50 per cent in the 12 months to the end of last week on concerns about the UK contract and an accounting probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, although CSC had pre-warned about the writedown in late December, some analysts said the move provided a degree of closure for investors.“The risk of further large writedowns is significantly smaller than it was yesterday,” said Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan. “People feel like we may have seen a bottom for CSC.”But other analysts were unimpressed, and suggested investors might be well advised to take profit, with CSC now trading at an earnings multiple equal to industry peers.“To say CSC should trade in line with its peers when it can’t give guidance for 2012, is subject to an SEC accounting investigation and has the overhang of further potential losses on the UK NHS contract is presumptuous,” said Darrin Peller at Barclays Capital.He said the share price move was largely a result of short sellers covering positions. More than 10 per cent of available CSC stock had been on loan to short sellers at the start of the day, with many investors anticipating a sell-off if the company declared a larger writedown on the NHS contract.Elsewhere, US stocks climbed, but gains were moderate as eurozone worries once again weighed on Wall Street.The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent to 1,349.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 5 points to 12,883.95, while the Nasdaq Composite index rallied 0.4 per cent to 2,915.86.Energy stocks were the laggards with coal miners falling for a second successive day, as SocGen analysts said iron-ore shipments to China through Australia’s Port Hedland fell in January compared with December.Peabody fell 1.6 per cent to $41.27 and Alpha Natural Resources fell 2.1 per cent to $21.85.Option traders appeared sceptical about the latest rally in the face of renewed Greek default concerns, with data showing large bearish bets that would profit from a fall in the Dow Transport index.The index is closely watched as a leading indicator for movements in broader indices.But some analysts remained bullish. “Given other efforts to stabilise the eurozone, we tend to think a Greek default would only lead to a momentary pullback in US stocks, lasting one or two days, and indeed would present a good buying opportunity,” said Randy Frederick, managing director for active trading at Charles Schwab.Luxury clothing chain Ralph Lauren rose 9.2 per cent to $17.73 after forecasting stronger than expected 2012 revenue.Unlike jeweller Tiffany, Ralph Lauren did not see a slowdown in US or European sales in the fourth quarter, leaving investors free to focus on strong sales growth in emerging markets that Ralph Lauren reported in common with other luxury brands. The company also raised its forecast for 2012 margins.“If we were to look for trouble, a cause for concern could be the recent gross margin deterioration, which reflects an increasing amount of technology resale that both boosts revenue growth and hurts gross margin,” said George Hill at Citigroup, although, along with most other analysts, he was upbeat on the results.Bank stocks traded higher despite the Greek concerns. Citigroup was up 3.5 per cent to $34.23 and Bank of America topped $8 for the first time since September, closing up 3.6 per cent to $8.13 for the best performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Walt Disney shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $41.27 as earnings rose despite flat revenues.The initial public offering of Caesars Entertainment made a surprise leap on its debut, jumping 71 per cent to $15.39 over its $9 debut price, the most of any US IPO since Zillow last July.The offering of just 1.8m shares had been intended only to provide liquidity to a small clutch of investors in its 2008 leveraged buyout, ahead of potential larger exits by investors such Paulson & Co, Apollo Group and TPG Capital. But traders said that retail investors swooped on the offering at the discounted valuation, despite the risk of future dilution.Additional reporting by Telis Demos
51;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-02-03T21:49:59Z;Boys aloud;In the City of London, brightly coloured trousers sell best;"In London, this is the greyest time of the year – grey streets, grey skies, grey suits – but, recently, bright spots have appeared in even the most monochrome of urban landscapes. Or to be more accurate, bright trousers. Though the pheasant shooting season drew to a close earlier this week, a quick scan of London’s Square Mile reveals a surfeit of quilted jackets, felt hats, Harris tweeds and …coloured trousers.“When we first started Hackett in 1983 we stocked corduroys in safe country colours such as olive, brown and tan,” says Jeremy Hackett, the founder and chairman of the British label. “But then we noticed our customers were special-ordering brighter colours, so we added red, yellow, bright green, cobalt blue and even pink. Now it seems that the more lurid the colour the better it sells. Our bestselling colour for trousers is red (£100). We have around 18 colours of chinos arriving this spring, and a colour I think will be popular is burnt orange.”Gordon Richardson, design director at Topman, agrees. “We have had phenomenal success with our coloured chinos and cords,” he says. The store’s slim chinos (£28) are selling out in a rainbow of shades from pale mint to rust via parma violet and old rose.Why do city folk adopt the uniform of the country? Richardson says: “There is more than a discreet nod towards the heritage trend that’s been a pervasive influence in men’s fashion for the past few seasons. It comes down to men feeling comfortable with clothing that is a tried and tested classic.”Hackett elaborates: “Historically, coloured trousers were worn by landowners and gentlemen farmers to distinguish them from the estate workers who always wore camouflage tones. Also, army officers adopted bright trousers as part of their ‘mufti’ so as not to be confused with the ranks.”Richard Evans, a 33-year-old City of London trader, likes the paradox of wearing country attire in town. “I bought a pair of pale pink Jack Wills cords and felt a little self-conscious the first time I wore them, but now they’re like any other pair of jeans, just a little cheerier,” he says. “I keep them for weekends but only in the City. I’d feel like my dad in a country pub.”Aside from Topman and Hackett, Gap sells washed-out red skinny jeans (£49.95); My-Wardrobe.com has Polo Ralph Lauren moleskin trousers in deep olive (£195) and APC X Carhartt has petrol blue twill chinos (£115). Mr Porter stocks Canali’s straight-leg blue trousers (£170), Acne’s bold mustard chinos (£150), Jil Sander’s forest green skinnies (£430) and Burberry Brit’s deep plum narrow-cut numbers (£150).“We have sold brightly coloured cords for nearly 80 years and they still remain one of our core products,” says Rosie Dixon of Cordings, which has been supplying the landed gentry with cords and chinos in outrageous shades from royal purple to acid yellow and sage green (£99). One customer loved his vibrant cords so much he bought a 50 per cent stake in the company back in 2004. And, says Dixon, “ Eric Clapton has bought several pairs over the years.”She adds: “People have become slightly more daring in their colour choices recently, particularly the younger generation and overseas visitors. The Italians and Spaniards love bright reds, pinks and purples. The quirkier members of the British aristocracy are drawn to the outrageous salmon pinks, oranges and purples.”A further update to the original line comes courtesy of young Brit label Jack Wills, which approached Cordings last year about collaborating. “They took our men’s cord trousers and came up with a slightly different version (£69) in shades from plum and olive through to gold and pink,” says Dixon. “They proved to be a bestseller.”But is it possible to introduce such vibrant shades into an otherwise restrained wardrobe? Jeremy Langmead, editor-in-chief at Mr Porter, advises: “You can get away with teaming brightly coloured chinos with a navy blazer, although this can look a bit too Wasp-y. It’s better to roll up the trousers at the ankle a little, and put them with some battered old desert boots or a pair of deck shoes. Personally, I think they look best dressed down, worn more casually with neutral colours, like grey or camel. I own a pair of fairly vibrant orange corduroys by Hentsch Man. To avoid looking like ‘Fanta’ pants, I wear them with a pair of battered white Jack Purcells and a grey wool sweatshirt. It stops it from being too overpowering.” And still lets him go out with a bang.……………………………………………………………..Detailswww.cordings.co.ukwww.gap.comwww.hackett.comwww.hentschman.comwww.jackwills.comwww.mrporter.comwww.my-wardrobe.comwww.topman.com"
52;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-01-10T22:12:55Z;Tiffany loses lustre amid sluggish sales;Luxury brands struggle in mature markets;Shares in Tiffany & Co fell 10.5 per cent to $59.94 as the luxury retailer it cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its New York store.November and December sales in Tiffany’s Americas region, which includes Canada and Latin America, were up just 2 per cent compared with 2010, while sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store falling 1 per cent, despite strong spending by tourists.Asia-Pacific same-store sales climbed 12 per cent but investors had been focused on developed markets since Tiffany forecast “weakness” in European and north-eastern US sales in December, an announcement which had also triggered a big share price fall.The sell-off suggests the rise of an emerging market middle class may not inoculate the likes of Tiffany, Coach and Ralph Lauren against developed market worries. “No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach fell 0.8 per cent to $62.33 while Ralph Lauren fell more than 3 per cent at the opening before recovering to close up 0.7 per cent to $147.32.Elsewhere, US markets were in bullish mood, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,292.08, its highest level since the end of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,462.47 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 2,702.5.“Everything is in place for a big rally,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “If the market doesn’t break out now, I don’t think it’s going to at all this year.”Life Technologies rose 8.3 per cent to $46.17 after unveiling a DNA reader.But BorgWarner, which makes powertrains for engines, had the best performance in the S&P, climbing 12.3 per cent to $72.25 after forecasting record sales and earnings growth.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, said Glen Senk, chief executive, had resigned on Monday. That sent its shares down as much as 11 per cent to $25.91 after hours.Elsewhere, the rally was broadly cyclical. Materials and industrial stocks were to the fore after Alcoa kicked off the quarterly earnings season on Monday. Alcoa reported a first loss from continuing operations in two years but was positive about demand in 2012. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $9.44.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China, rose 2.8 per cent to $21.33. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 4 per cent to $68.82.Bank investors continued to show signs of optimism, with Bank of America climbing 5.7 per cent to $6.63, while Citigroup climbed 3.2 per cent to $30 for its highest close in a month.“Absent new negatives equals a positive?” asked Goldman Sachs analysts, summing up the attitude of investors to large universal banks, which have emerged bruised but intact from big share price falls in 2011.Shares in Goldman climbed 3.8 per cent to $98.33 and Morgan Stanley was up 4.3 per cent to $16.89, although data showed trading levels in capital markets were down as much as 36 per cent compared with 2011 so far this year, which may bode ill for investment banks.Separately, Goldman Sachs warned against buying regional bank stocks, which have appreciated 20 per cent as a group since October lows, arguing price-earnings ratios were still high on a forty-year basis. Investors paid little heed, with Regions Financial up 3.8 per cent to $4.70 and Zions Bancorp up 1.6 per cent to $18.17.Shares in the New York Stock Exchangeclimbed 4.6 per cent to $27.79 on an Financial Times report that European regulators would block its merger with Deutsche Börse. The proposed tie up has weighed on NYSE shares, as Deutsche Börse’s price fell with European financials last year.A new year rally, which had seen shares in Juniper Networks appreciate as much as 10 per cent, came to an end as the wireless network provider said it would miss fourth-quarter earnings guidance. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $21.50.Credit Suisse analysts said internet service providers would “continue to look to suppliers [such as Juniper] to deliver greater performance at lower cost,” as households consumed ever more bandwidth on unlimited packages, without corresponding revenue growth for ISPs. Shares in internet service provider WebMD fell 28.5 per cent to $26.25 as it pre-announced a fourth-quarter revenue miss and said its chief executive had resigned. Yahoo shares were little affected, up 0.3 per cent to $15.51.Most of the share price action appeared driven by WebMD’s decision to terminate “discussions with several potential acquirers of the company.” Speculation of a takeover by Yahoo had seen the company’s market capitalisation climb more than a third since October 6.
53;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2012-01-09T21:55:26Z;Google slips on fear of move into mobile;;Google shares slid as investors considered the internet group’s possible move into the manufacture of mobile phone handsets.Its shares fell 4.2 per cent to $622.94 after Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone company that Google has agreed to purchase for $12.5bn, said on Friday that fourth-quarter results would come in significantly below expectations because of increased competition.“We believe the Motorola Mobility pre-announcement could serve as a reminder of the operational challenges for Google to enter the hardware space,” said Doug Anmuth at Morgan Stanley, predicting a “slower growth, lower margin Google once the deal closes”.US stocks climbed ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which kicked off as aluminium producer Alcoa reported an estimated loss of 3 cents a share from continuing operations after the close.Alcoa shares had climbed 3 per cent to $9.42, recovering from weakness last week, while there had been strong call buying, in anticipation of a share price bounce off results. Many analysts had predicted a loss and shares held steady at $9.43 in after-hours trading.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,277.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,392.69.Although Google’s woes weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, the tech-heavy index eked out a 0.1 per cent gain to close at 2,676.56. Its other heavily weighted stock, Apple, hit a high of $427.75 in the morning session, before closing at $421.73, off 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 has recorded gains on all but one trading day in 2012 but much of the legwork has been done by a concentration of industrial, material and financial stocks, making some analysts wary.“While the S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent last week, the percentage of industry groups in up trends actually contracted [from 56 per cent to 52 per cent],” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird. “Absent of a significant broadening in rally participation, the ability of the major indexes to move significantly higher is likely to be limited.”Netflix climbed 13.8 per cent to $98.18 as it launched its UK and Ireland video web streaming service.The stock, which bombed last year as its US service lost subscribers, is enjoying a mini-renaissance, now up almost $30 since the start of 2012, when the company said customers had streamed more than 2bn hours of content in the quarter to the end of December.Shares in Inhibitex climbed 141.1 per cent to $23.70 after Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to buy the pharmaceutical group for its hepatitis C medicines. That drove up shares in other treatment developers as Idenix Pharmaceuticals surged 37 per cent to $9.66.Bristol-Myers Squibb was off 0.9 per cent to $33.91.CareFusion fell 8.6 per cent to $23.28 after the medical device manufacturer lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings forecast to $1.75 from $1.80.Rival St Jude Medical rose 3.2 per cent to $35.70 after it said it still expected to meet fourth-quarter and full-year guidance.Regions Financial rose 2.7 per cent to $4.53 on reports that the regional bank, which is yet to repay all Tarp funds borrowed from the Treasury, may offload its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, which could fetch up to $1bn.Financials were generally stronger with Bank of America climbing 1.5 per cent to $6.27, despite reports it would sack a fifth of its Asia managing directors.Health insurer AFLAC fell 2.3 per cent to $43.23 as UBS analysts warned “its outsized exposure to debt issued by European financials” makes it particularly vulnerable to a European slowdown.Exchanges continued to show weakness after JPMorgan analysts warned on Friday that earnings estimates may be over optimistic. The CME Group fell 2.5 per cent to $228.24 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 2.1 per cent to $112.58.Ralph Lauren climbed 4 per cent to $146.36 as Goldman Sachs analysts tipped the luxury brand to be one of the “secular winners with strong tailwinds of sales and margin expansion” in 2012.Video game retailer Gamestop fell 3.5 per cent to $23.99 as same store sales in the holiday period came in 0.3 per cent lower than in 2010.Tech stock Zynga fell 9.2 per cent to $8.00, $2 below its December IPO price. That might be bad news for investors in Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds as filings revealed that the investment bank owns 16 per cent of the group’s publicly available stock.

The S&P 500 closed at 1,277.3, less than a quarter of a point up for the day, with financials bearing the brunt of selling, off 0.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $15.94, while the afterglow from Citigroup’s $2.5bn bond offering on Tuesday, its largest such debt issue since 2009, did not last long. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2 per cent to 12,418,42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,648.36, although the Nasdaq had opened sharply lower as technology stocks suffered.Ebay, the auction website, fell 3.8 per cent to $30.16 after Yahoopoached Scott Thompson from Ebay-owned PayPal as its new chief executive. Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent. Mr Lampert also reduced ESL’s stake in car parts retailer AutoZone to 12.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent, but after falling sharply at the open, shares recovered to close 2.2 per cent higher at $326.96.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 2.2 per cent to $348.75 after Goldman Sachs analysts added the fast food restaurant to its “conviction buy” list, tipping the company for earnings growth of 35-0 per cent this year as food costs fall, boosting margins.Shares in Chipotle rose almost 60 per cent in 2011 after more than doubling in value in 2010.Ford Motors rose 1.5 per cent to $11.30 as December sales rose 10 per cent, beating most analyst estimates. General Motors saw December sales growth of 5 per cent, which gave shares a 0.5 per cent fillip to $21.15.

MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."
55;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-12-15T22:35:08Z;Michael Kors shares jump 21% on debut;;Shares of Michael Kors, the upmarket fashion and accessories brand, jumped 25 per cent on their debut on the New York Stock Exchange.On Wednesday night, Michael Kors launched the biggest-ever initial public offering in US fashion. , selling more shares than expected in a deal valuing the company at $3.8bn, some 45 times its earnings.The IPO market in the US will end a busy week, as companies rush to go public before year-end, with a debut for Zynga, the online games developer, expected on Friday.Despite extremely choppy capital markets that have led to a record number of deals being delayed in 2011, investors have shown a willingness to buy high-profile offerings of growth companies, such as social networking groups and retailers seeking to access emerging markets.Michael Kors’s $944m offering surpassed the IPO of Ralph Lauren in 1997, according to Dealogic. Kors is seeking to expand its brand, which has been aided by the celebrity profile in the US of its eponymous founder, to Europe and Asia.In trading, the shares opened at $25 and close the day at $24.20, a rise of 21 per cent from the IPO price at $20. That is better than the average first-day gain of 10 per cent for US IPOs this year, according to Dealogic.Retail has been a standout sector in US IPOs this year. The second-best performing debut was GNC Holdings, the vitamins seller, whose shares are up 73 per cent since a March offering.Dunkin’ Brands, parent of Dunkin’ Donuts, has also outperformed, rising 33 per cent since its IPO. Both groups have cited overseas expansion as part of their need for capital.Those performances contrast with high-profile debuts in Hong Kong, where Kors is headquartered. Prada, the Italian fashion house, chose to list in Hong Kong this year in order to better market its brand to China’s fast-growing luxury market, but its shares have fallen 16.8 per cent since its listing.“Despite the volatility, 2010 and 2011 have seen good windows for both tech and high-growth consumer and retail stories,” said JD Moriarty, co-head of Americas technology equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.An IPO earlier this week of Jive Software, maker of social networking software to businesses, also jumped 25 per cent at its debut after pricing at the top of its projected range.Though the US IPO market this year is on track be about 50 per cent smaller than it was in 2007, tech IPOs are running on a pace roughly equal to pre-crisis levels, with $10.5bn expected to be raised in 42 deals.
56;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-12-14T22:59:25Z;Kors shares open 25% higher;;Shares of Michael Kors, an upmarket fashion and accessories brand, jumped 25 per cent on their debut on the New York Stock Exchange.On Wednesday night, Kors launched the biggest-ever public offering in US fashion, selling more shares than expected in a deal that will value the company at nearly $4bn.The New York flotation surpassed the $882m offering of Ralph Lauren in 1997, according to Dealogic, despite growing concern over the resilience of luxury spending.The deal was heavily oversubscribed and priced at $20 a share, above the projected range of $17 to $19. Investors in the company sold 47.2m shares, more than the 41m initially offered and raising $944m. The sale valued the company at $3.8bn.In trading, the shares opened at $25, and as of midday are at $24.25, a rise of 21.3 per cent. That is better than the average US IPO this year, which saw a first-day gain of 10 per cent, but well below the biggest “pops” of the year, such as the 109 per cent jump for LinkedIn.Michael Kors is a high-profile brand in the US, where it earned 89 per cent of its $758m revenue in its past fiscal year, but it wants to expand its presence in Europe and Asia, where it lags behind rivals such as Coach, Burberry, Hermès, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs.At the IPO price, Michael Kors’ valuation is equal to 44 times its net earnings in the past four quarters, compared with Burberry’s valuation of 24 times trailing earnings and a multiple of 19 at Coach.Vanessa Friedman blogs on the fashion/luxury industry from both a corporate and consumer point of viewStacey Widlitz, an independent retail analyst, said: “It’s coming to the market at a time where we’re questioning the rate of growth in luxury, so the valuation …is quite expensive compared to peers.”Luxury has been one of the most resilient parts of retail since the global financial crisis, thanks to the continued spending of well-off consumers but in recent months stock market volatility and the eurozone crisis have raised concerns over whether they will retrench. “The idea is to get this IPO in before we see any downturn in luxury,” said Ms Widlitz.The company was founded 30 years ago by Michael Kors and continues to make clothes that are classic rather than trendy. However, the majority of its wholesale and retail sales now come from accessories such as handbags, leather goods, jewellery and watches.The company is registered in the British Virgin Islands and has its headquarters in Hong Kong.Since 2004, awareness of the company in the US has been boosted by the role of founder Mr Kors as a judge on Project Runway, a reality television show about fashion designers.Mr Kors is the company’s chief creative officer and the IPO will reduce his stake in the business from 11.7 per cent to less than 9 per cent.Unlike many companies that take months to build investor demand, Michael Kors filed to go public just two weeks ago.Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique, an investor advisory, said the deal came together quickly thanks to the company’s established brand and its strong following among international financiers.“Investors consider them a comparable name to Burberry and Prada in the high-end market,” he said. “They also have free advertising on the television show.”Despite its Hong Kong base, Michael Kors decided to go public in the US after companies such as Prada debuted poorly in Hong Kong. Prada’s $2.1bn IPO in June priced at the bottom of its projected range and the shares fell in first-day trading.Michael Kors’ biggest shareholder is Sportswear Holdings, a private equity group led by Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll that also owns stakes in Tommy Hilfiger Asia and Hackett.It acquired a majority stake in Michael Kors in 2003, which will be diluted to 37.7 per cent from 51.9 per cent by the share offering.

Metal, mining and energy stocks soared on rising commodity prices, and hopes that monetary easing in China would offer support to the country’s resource-intensive construction industry.Steel stocks performed particularly strongly with Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, rising 28.2 per cent to $24.11, AK Steel Holding rose 16.8 per cent to $8.22 and US Steel climbed 24.9 per cent to $27.81.“The Policy accommodation may support Chinese steel consumption, reducing the chances of oversupply, which would depress prices and hurt US companies,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie.But other analysts said the rally had more to do with trading patterns than fundamentals.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and shorts are buying shares to cover their positions,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.Some energy stocks sat out the rally, as investors remained wary of companies carrying debt.Transocean fell 3.9 per cent to $42.76, after announcing plans to issue 29.9m new shares and raise up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 9.5 per cent, led by Citigroup, which climbed 19.2 per cent to $28.17 and Morgan Stanley, up 17 per cent to $15.52.Hospital owners and medical device manufacturers had a tough day on Friday after Wells Fargo said Medicare carriers in 11 key states will perform pre-payment audits for inpatient hospital linked to certain cardiovascular and orthopaedic conditions from the start of the new year.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 10.7 per cent on Friday to end the week up just 0.2 per cent to $4.18. Device manufacturer St Jude Medical tumbled 7 per cent, to end the week up 3 per cent to $35.83.Western Digital Corporation rose 25.8 per cent to $31.44, hitting levels not seen since flooding forced the hard disk drive manufacturer to close production facilities in Thailand more than a month ago.The company raised its current quarter revenue forecast to at least $1.8bn from a previous maximum of $1.25bn, as supply chain pressure eased.Fertiliser companies underperformed broad markets, as concerns mounted that Indian farmers will import less nutrient.Mosaic and Potash Corporation suffered losses early in the week as Indian farming co-operatives pushed for discounts on potash imports of up to 35 per cent in dollar terms, to reflect rupee weakness.Mosaic ended the week up 3.8 per cent to $51.78 and Potash Corporation up 4 per cent to $42.29.CF Industries, which supplies India with nitrogen-based fertilisers, had fared better earlier in the week, but fell Friday to close the week up just 0.7 per cent to $140.73, as reports suggested Indian orders for urea declined significantly in November compared with October."

American has called time on attempts to renegotiate pension and benefit costs with pilots.Semiconductor manufacturer Corning suffered heavy selling after unexpectedly lowering fourth quarter sales guidance.The stock fell 10.8 per cent to $13.19, as the company said sales of a major LCD screen product will rise only 5 to 10 per cent quarter on quarter, compared to prior guidance of a 20 per cent sequential rise.Hospira fell 9.1 per cent to $28.17 after RBC Capital Markets said a long running Food and Drug Administration investigation into the medical device marker’s main manufacturing plant may cause “widespread” production breakdowns, and take two to three years to correct.Netflix fell 3.4 per cent to $67.57 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s debt another notch, citing the risks involved in the video streaming website’s capital intensive overseas expansion.Home Depot was the standout performer in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. Shares rose 5.3 per cent to $38.96 after the company’s chief financial officer told an analyst breakfast meeting that November sales had been better than expected.Hard-drive manufacturers Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $27.80.The company was following on the coat tails of rival Seagate Technology, which was up 3.7 per cent to $16.58, after releasing a positive update to fourth-quarter guidance, even as widespread flooding in Thailand wreaks havoc with supply chains.“[Seagate’s] guidance update was driven by increasing industry-wide prices [for hard drives] rather than anything company specific,” said Joe Yoo at Citigroup.Mr Yoo said rising prices should reduce Western Digital’s fourth quarter net loss to roughly $150m, compared to the company’s most recent guidance of $300m.Banks gave back some of their gains from Monday’s rally.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.31, leaving the investment bank up just 0.4 per cent for the week, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up almost 3 per cent.Bank of America was down 3.2 per cent to $5.08, after touching a new year low of $5.03 during the day.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran gave bank executives some cheer, arguing retrenchment by European lenders from the US markets could benefit midsize US banks.“This creates an opportunity for US banks such as US Bancorp, PNC and Wells Fargo who are big enough to serve large corporate borrowers and are now able to replace Europeans as they pull out,” Mr Foran wrote to clients.PNC was up 1.2 per cent to $50.83.
59;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-11-25T19:19:49Z;Wall St battle turns into Black Friday store wars;Consumers pack stores amid ‘Occupy’ protest and pepper spray;Protests against excessive consumption and a pepper spray attack by an aggressive bargain-hunter marked the two extremes of a busy post-Thanksgiving shopping day.US retailers opened earlier than ever on the eve of the day known as Black Friday, seeking to secure a share of holiday spending that may rise only modestly from last year due to consumer worries over jobs and housing.Full-bore consumerism has long been a pillar of the American economy. But this year Black Friday, which often accounts for 10 per cent of all holiday spending, became the latest target of Occupy Wall Street’s grassroots activism.“Stop supporting big companies. Support the working class. Support small business. Stop feeding the rich,” yelled half a dozen Occupy protesters at some of the 10,000 people that Macy’s estimated were waiting for its flagship store in Manhattan to open at midnight.One protester asked people standing inches away from him: “Are you guys listening?” The answer seemed to be no.At the front of the queue was Robert Glover, a Brooklyn transport worker and newspaper delivery man who was more interested in buying a Polo Ralph Lauren shirt than debating whether he was enriching America’s “1 per cent”.“They’re just saying that because they can’t afford to shop here,” Mr Glover told the Financial Times. “I don’t really care. I’m buying stuff for myself. No one else.”Early openings by Macy’s, Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us and Walmart before the end of Thanksgiving sparked criticism from some employees and commentators who said they were ruining the stay-at-home tranquillity of the holiday.At a Walmart in Porter Ranch, California, a 10pm stampede through the doors turned ugly when police said a woman used pepper spray to “gain an upper hand” over her fellow shoppers. Up to 20 people suffered minor injuries as the woman attempted to clear a path to the electronics section.The National Retail Federation has estimated that holiday spending will rise by 2.8 per cent from a year ago. In 2010, holiday sales increased by 5.2 per cent to $452bn after two years of declines.“The pepper spray scenario is the new way of the world. People will do anything they can to get that deal,” said David Bassuk at AlixPartners, a consultancy. But Mr Bassuk added he was not convinced retailers were offering better bargains. “It is all marketing. It really is. But what you see with the long lines is that marketing works.”
60;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-11-11T16:14:01Z;Holiday hot spots: New generation of global vacationers drives sales;So where do you go if you want to buy a watch? Insiders suggest you should think more of Bodrum, Beirut or Grand Cayman, writes Elizabeth Paton;"So where do you go if you want to buy a watch? You might think of Madison Avenue or Bond Street, but insiders suggest you should think more of Bodrum, Beirut or Grand Cayman.In LVMH’s annual report last month, the group attributed a 19 per cent increase in overall revenue to its travel retail arm DFS Gallerias. “Sustained by the continued growth of Asian tourism, DFS reaped remarkable rewards by upscaling its strategy and development in new markets,” it said.Traditional European hubs continue to pull in the majority of luxury watch sales, but a coterie of brands has been developing alternative strategies: boutiques in smaller, yet highly lucrative, holiday hot spots.“Since launching in 2009, some of our top points of sale outside Paris and New York have been high-end ski resorts such as Gstaad, St Moritz and Courchevel,” says Guy Chatillon, CEO at Ralph Lauren Watches & Jewellery.Sales assistants in the après ski boutiques say their biggest customer base is Russian holidaymakers, whose spending on luxury goods hit €9bn ($12bn) last year. The Turkish coastline has seen a similar boom after brands noticed its popularity with the eastern European bourgeoisie.Financial data service Global Blue says luxury watch sales in Turkey are up 366 per cent since 2006, making it the industry’s second largest growth area worldwide.The Middle East is another important emerging market. Yet despite the opportunities offered by the malls of Dubai, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, Lebanon is proving to be the region’s star performer. It is now the fourth largest market in the world for watch and jewellery sales. Last year, Cartier, Rolex and Boucheron all unveiled boutiques in the glamorous gold souk of downtown Beirut; other luxury brands are opening stores in streets nearby.Expansion here is designed to entice wealthy tourists as well as the local population. Visitors from the Gulf are up by 30 per cent this year, perhaps thanks to Lebanon’s relative stability.Gambling resorts also continue to bring in watch sales, despite the downturn. “Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau have all given exceptional performances this year,” says Luc Perammond, CEO of Hermes Watches & Jewellery. “This new focus is an important development as the watches sold in resorts are often of a higher value than in normal retail environments.”However, it is not just high spirits or hedonism that fuels vacation spending on luxury goods. There is a new generation of global vacationer emerging – particularly from Asia – who travels primarily to make purchases. According to Mintel, 82 per cent of Chinese tourists say that shopping is their first choice of holiday activity.“The Asian consumer knows exactly what he or she wants from a luxury purchase,” says Bernd Schmitt, executive director of the Asian Institute on Consumer Insight. “Buying a high-end watch on vacation is a calculated investment – it’s a stylish souvenir for showing off a rising income and elevated lifestyle when that person returns home.”Financial savvy is a huge driving force in luxury travel retail – particularly when it comes to the aspirational middle classes emerging out of new markets.Hefty sales tariffs can add between 20 and 50 per cent to luxury watch prices in China. Keen to make a saving, millions of weekend shoppers fly to duty free cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong where, according to HSBC analysts, 75 per cent of all 2010 luxury watch sales were made to vacationing Chinese mainland residents.“Flight costs will be negated by the overall savings made on their new Cartier or Rolex timepiece,” says Prof Schmitt. “Almost all have come to shop; conventional tourism is now a secondary pursuit.”Protectionist import taxes have had a similar impact in Brazil: more than half all luxury purchases made by Brazilians happen outside the country. Thirty-nine per cent are carried out in and around North America – buoyed by a favourable exchange rate between the US dollar and real.“Of course it will be attractive to buy an expensive watch in destinations where the currency is weak – business is booming for us in the Caribbean, as it should be for anyone in the industry,” says Nelson Lucero, vice-president of sales and marketing at Ulysse Nardin. The brand has reported “exceptional” sales in duty-free ports such as Grand Cayman, St. Martin, St Thomas and Aruba.“In some cases, results are due to local wealthy expat populations,” says Mr Lucero. “Mainly, however, sales are thanks to tourists passing through on high-end cruise ships.”Finally, one of the biggest retailing arenas for brands is the transit market; targeting high-rolling travellers on the move. They may not be glamorous, but airports account for billions of dollars of watch sales each year.“The destinations may keep changing, but global travellers will always be travelling – and most go via airports,” says Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Tag Heuer. About 15 per cent of the brand’s sales are to tourists, he adds. Most are business travellers in departure lounges, taking advantage of some free time – and duty free prices. Bidding wars for both concession and advertising wall spaces are fierce.“The airport is one of the best places for us to create brand exposure; we have ad campaigns in 32 airports worldwide so we can connect with customers. You will see Tag when you check in, when you pass security and when you pick up your luggage. We even feature in Air France in-flight entertainment programmes – the brand is with you from door to door on your journey.”Despite all this, for most luxury watch brands, home is still best.“Our core focus continues to be domestic markets: Paris will always be our number one store,” says Mr Babin. “Still, no one can ignore the growth potential in travel retail.”"
61;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-11-09T19:21:46Z;US shoppers bring optimism;;Ralph Lauren and Macy’s struck an optimistic tone on the end-of-year shopping season as they reported quarterly gains in sales and profits in spite of global economic uncertainty.Ralph Lauren, the high-end clothing retailer that is expanding aggressively beyond the US, forecast that revenues would grow at a “low-teens rate” in the Christmas quarter as it reported sales up 24 per cent from a year ago to $1.9bn in the three months to October 1.Macy’s, the department store chain, said it expected sales to grow by 4 to 4.5 per cent in the three months to the end of January. It had previously announced that for the first time it would open at midnight on the cusp of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year in the US.For the previous quarter Macy’s – which is focused on the US and also owns the Bloomingdale’s chain – reported a 4.1 per cent rise in sales to $5.8bn, which signalled it was gaining market share from peers, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.Macy’s net income surged from $10m to $139m partly because of better cost control.Deborah Weinswig, analyst at Citigroup, said Macy’s performance was driven by initiatives to integrate its online and bricks-and-mortar business, to tailor merchandise to local neighbourhoods, and to give sales associates better training.Ralph Lauren reported a 14 per cent rise in net income to $233m from a year ago, but indicated higher material costs were still taking a toll on profitability. Roger Farah, Ralph Lauren’s president and chief operating officer, said: “Over the last two months, we have seen extreme stock market movement and negative economic news which resulted in more volatile sales and traffic at Ralph Lauren stores in the US and Europe, particularly with local customers.”He said sales in the UK, France, Germany and Scandinavia had been “quite strong” while Italy and Spain had been “more difficult”. The company has limited distribution in Greece. Across the globe Ralph Lauren said its sales were better in markets where tourists made up a significant proportion of shoppers – including South Korea, a popular holiday destination for Chinese consumers.Ralph Lauren is expanding its online presence in Europe and shifting more of its business from wholesale to its own retail spaces. The latter will increase operating expenses but improve gross profit margins and give it more control over its brands.
62;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-10-17T14:08:01Z;Reasons to be bullish, albeit with a lower case ‘b’;The bears may prevail, but don’t buy high and sell low;The S&P 500 has been perilously close to a 20 per cent decline in recent weeks which would, by definition, terminate the bull market which began in March 2009. Given the economic circumstances and the continuing political turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic, most commentators believe it is only a matter of time before such a landmark is reached.Having been bullish, I am – as expected – disappointed but not undaunted. I remain bullish if only now with a lower case “b”. Some months ago I conceded that making market forecasts was increasingly difficult as they entailed an understanding of American politics, Chinese monetary and financial policy, Greek and Italian attitudes, German elections in addition to the usual economics, corporate developments and actions and comments by the Federal Reserve Board.I contend that as much as five percentage points of the recent sharp correction has been a result of fund liquidations. It was curious that there were a number of stories regarding the sharp losses and redemptions at some significant hedge funds and at quarter’s end there was accelerated selling. I think it unlikely that declines in stocks such as Ralph Lauren, Wynn Casinos, Chipotle Mexican and other strong performers is related to corporate developments or fundamentals.That does not, of course, mitigate the pain of seeing those and other stocks fall but going forward it suggests the pressure was more likely temporary than enduring.I am willing to concede that the sun is shining on the other side of the fence but I continue to find the negatives only somewhat persuasive. Yes, global economies are shaky and political paralysis exists, but stock market concerns are too often based on opinion. The bears contend that corporate earnings are too high. Perhaps, but we recently calculated that analysts’ expectations for the third quarter on a company by company basis – which are down 2 per cent from three months ago – have actually been increased by 1.5 per cent for the fourth quarter. And even a casual perusal of the past finds that bears always think earnings expectations err on the side of optimism.Thus, the bears rationalise the reality that the S&P is trading at 11 times forward earnings. I submit that many individual names are, by definition and history, attractive. IBM, for one, is trading at a discount to the market which is not the norm for declining markets.The bearish retort has been that stocks are expensive and should be sold, using the ten year, inflation-adjusted price-to- earnings measure by academic Robert Shiller. My response is “sell what?” His measure suggests stocks are attractive in the six to eight times P/E level. But the market last ventured into that neighbourhood in the late summer of 1982. As a money manager, using this rule would have meant I missed out on the two subsequent 100 per cent plus rallies.I am also encouraged by the chartists. Based on painful experience, I have never found them to be of value. Several months ago 1,400 was a virtual given but on September 12th and 13th no less than six technicians were suggesting much lower levels. Perhaps, but our files included a prominent article from April 26, 2010: “Technical analysts see room to roll”. The market was then in the third day of what was to be a 17 per cent decline. On July 5, 2010, that year’s S&P low, we had: “Technicians await the bear”. Buy high sell low?There is, of course, the possibility that the bears will prevail, a double dip will occur and the market will retreat. Even then I would not follow the convention to take a defensive posture. Those who suggest that course always begin with utilities but some historical analysis undermines that idea.Our study of market cycles found that in bad times utilities are not a panacea. During the bear market that began in late 2007 and ended in the first quarter of 2009, the S&P lost 56 per cent and utilities 46 per cent. Dividends helped some but they are usually taxed. In the 2000 decline the broad market lost 46 per cent and utilities were down 45 per cent.I think the bearish case is short of substance, the defensive thesis suspect and that selling has been overdone. There are some attractive – if not cheap stocks available. We are reviewing and pruning weaker positions and stocks as well as being more judicious in our purchases. Being bullish on stocks is probably a step down from being bullish on the market but, as economist John Maynard Keynes once said, when things change, I change my mind. What do you do?I don’t know how and when this will all end. One clue might be to look for significant and prominent negative reports. On March 9, 2009, at the absolute bottom, the Wall Street Journal’s Money section headlined: “Dow 5,000? A bearish possibility”.And one of the longest market stories in last year’s New York Times – again at the absolute bottom for markets that year – was subtitled: “Wall Street tallies new losses with a bear market in mind”.Laszlo Birinyi is the founder and president of Birinyi Associates
63;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-09-28T21:51:02Z;Flagship armada;;This month Louis Vuitton unveiled its latest flagship store, in Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands. Floating 50 metres off shore, the “Island”, designed by Peter Marino, can be entered via a 33-metre underwater tunnel lined with fine art and has its own jetty. There is a terrace in the style of a yacht’s deck, sweeping floor-to-ceiling windows with ocean views, and a dramatic hub with an 11-metre-high pointed ceiling. Sailing ships’ masts hang in the air.Marina Bay Sands is the latest example of what Louis Vuitton calls its Maison concept, a select breed (there are now 12) of giant “immersive brand temples”. It is also an example of the recent explosion in the retail spend of luxury brands.According to research by The Future Laboratory, a trends consultancy, the average spend per square metre in luxury fashion flagships has increased fivefold in the past five years. Vuitton’s flagship on London’s Bond Street, also designed by Peter Marino, has its own library, private lounges and a butler, and is estimated to have cost £50m just to fit out.“We’re seeing a huge investment in retail environments,” says Chris Sanderson, co-founder of The Future Laboratory. “Brands are reappraising what the flagship means and its value. They’re using words like ‘home’ and ‘world’. The whole perspective has changed. They’re understanding that customers rely on the retail experience to develop and continue their relationship with the brand both on- and offline.”Yves Carcelle, chief executive of Louis Vuitton, agrees. “We offer our customers a unique experience, whether they are in Tokyo, New York, Paris, Singapore or Milan. Customers coming though the doors of our stores are looking for much more than the product they need or they would like,” he says.George Wallace, founder of the MHE Retail consultancy, says groups are “driving the customer online” by building fewer stores and “creating [stores that are] destinations”. These include Costume National’s first flagship in Tokyo, which opened this month at a reported cost of $39m with a vertical garden by artist Patrick Blanc, art gallery and café. Then there’s Ralph Lauren’s New York women’s store, a 22,000 sq ft “revival château” on Madison Avenue. Opened late last year, it is fashioned like an aristocrat’s retreat with ironwork doors, salon spaces, marble fireplaces and oil portraits on the walls. It was estimated at the time to have cost $40m-$50m.Also in this category is Hermès’ 15,800 sq ft Paris flagship, also opened late last year, on the left bank. Housed in a former 1930s swimming pool, it has a tea room, florist and bookstore, all designed by architect Denis Montel, with rooms for different product ranges in sculptural wooden structures. Burberry is also gearing up for a new Regent Street flagship set to open early next year. Its recent Beijing opening featured hologram models and 3D animations of rain and snow.“People are no longer interested in fashion on its own,” Mr Sanderson says. “They want to engage in culture and arts, which seems more meaningful. Brands want to show themselves to be part of that ‘wisdom’ culture. Before, it used to be about creating a global footprint, being everywhere, and the same everywhere. Now brands are trying to manage their global image by seeming more niche.”Do flagships drive sales? “A large number of people will stay in a store if there’s more of an experiential element. If they stay longer, there’s a greater propensity to spend. It’s absolutely proven,” he says. “People are looking for a five-dimensional retail experience.”In France sales at Hermès for the first half rose 21 per cent, helped, the brand says, by the success of the flagship on rue de Sèvres.Antoine Belge, luxury analyst at HSBC, says mega flagships “when taken as standalones” are probably less profitable than smaller and midsize stores. But there is a hidden factor. “What you can’t measure is the umbrella effect of tourists from China and the Middle East, who are driving a lot of luxury sales, and travel to Europe regularly. That small difference in profitability becomes treated as an advertising expense. As long as the overall balance is not changed, it works. Plus, these stores generate a lot of publicity.”Mr Wallace agrees. “Historically the biggest luxury flagships have not been profitable. It takes a huge income to offset the costs,” he says. A store such as Louis Vuitton’s Bond Street outlet would need to be make £30m-£40m a year to break even, he estimates.“But it has become a reputation thing. They’ve set the pace for how much you need to spend to join it and if you don’t spend that, you can’t compete. Brands are like lions marking their territory in the bush.”
64;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-08-11T12:48:22Z;UGG and the flight to the high-end;;Recently I was at the unveiling of the new line of UGG Australia boots – you know, those squishy sheepskin booties that looks like slippers and became hugely trendy after movie stars like Kate Hudson and Sadie Frost started wearing them with shorts to get their Starbucks (that’s Sadie’s sister in her classic UGGs at a launch party below left). Anyway, these UGGs were not those UGGs. These UGGs were all Made in Italy, mostly sporting very high heels or wedges, and priced not an average of $150, but an average of $1095. They also had matching bags (price: $695-$1295).Yes, UGG, one of the defining styles of mass market cool, wants in on luxury. But does luxury want in on UGG?I see two issues, neither of which have necessarily to do with the product itself, which is pretty good: the boots, which come in squishy sheepskin and stacked wood heels, can be rolled up to the thigh, down to the knee, or folded at the calf, so you get three styles in one, and look convincing. But I wonder about timing, and image.After all, while it’s not a surprise the brand (which is owned by US company Deckers) would want a piece of the high-end. If you look at recent quarterly reports, like today’s Polo Ralph Lauren news, luxury has been bucking trends pretty aggressively, and looks like about as much of a safe haven as anything. But launching at the front end of a possible double dip seems questionable: if the last recession taught us anything, it was that consumers tend to take refuge in proven experts when it comes to spending lots of money (for example Hermes and Louis Vuitton for leathergoods, the above-mentioned RL for clothing). They want to know an investment is going to sustain its value over time, and clearly an arriviste brand, such as UGG, is unproven in the high-end context.Then there’s the issue of perception: the consumers’, and the brand’s. The UGG folk have spent years looking at pictures of Ms Hudson, among other celebs, wearing their product and carrying, say, a Balenciaga bag, and they probably think: hey! No fair! She should be carrying our bag! Hence the decision to fight Balenciaga on its own ground – or close to it, and launch a competing product.But what they have missed is the cool appeal of wearing a street-like product with a super-expensive piece of fashion kit: it’s precisely UGG’s practical, comfy, un-luxury identity that makes it the perfect companion on high/low, I-am-not-a-stuff-snob days for a luxury accessory. That’s a very important market niche, and I wouldn’t undervalue it.Given market conditions, I expect we will see more of this flight to the high-end on the part of many brands, and I’d suggest they look at what happens with UGG as a test case. Personally, my breath is baited.
65;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-08-10T17:21:57Z;High-end retailers thrive despite US weakness;;Macy’s and Polo Ralph Lauren reported strong profit growth in quarterly results on Wednesday, proving that high-end apparel retailers are thriving in spite of a weak US economy and subdued consumer sentiment.Net profit at Macy’s, the US department store group that also owns Bloomingdale’s, surged 64 per cent to $241m from the previous year and beat market expectations, while sales grew 7.3 per cent to $5.9bn.Ralph Lauren, which earns two-thirds of its revenue in the US, reported a 52 per cent increase in net profit to $184m and a 32 per cent rise in its combined retail and wholesale sales to $1.5bn.Executives said it was too early to judge the impact of this week’s extreme volatility in financial markets, which can affect the mood of well-off shoppers via their investment portfolios.But the companies’ results indicated that in the past quarter luxury shoppers – and especially international tourists – were still willing to splash out on well-known fashion brands, while underlining the importance of distinctive products and e-commerce initiatives.Walter Loeb, a retail consultant and president of Loeb Associates, said the lesson of Macy’s and Ralph Lauren was: “People are interested in quality, value and fashion, and ultimately they are individualists and would like something tailored to their likes rather than a mass-manufactured product.”Macy’s attributed its growth partly to its success in securing exclusive rights to sell products from certain brands in the US – including Tommy Hilfiger, Donald Trump and Martha Stewart – and to an initiative to customise merchandise in each store to the local area.Ralph Lauren’s revenues outside the US rose by 60 per cent and it said its business was growing across its own branded stores, department stores, speciality stores and online.Macy’s said its online sales jumped 40.2 per cent, contributing 1.2 percentage points to like-for-like sales growth of 6.4 per cent at stores open at least a year.“The interaction between our stores, the internet, and mobile devices is making it harder and harder to really distinguish between store sales transactions and internet sales transactions,” said Karen Hoguet, Macy’s chief financial officer.“We know that customers are sometimes shopping in the stores and then going home and ordering online, while other times the reverse is done.”Both companies must still contend with the impact of price rises on sales as they continue to pass on higher input costs driven by commodity inflation.Roger Farah, president of Ralph Lauren, said: “We will not know the impact of our pricing actions until mid to late September. By then, the customer has probably had enough time to adjust to the pricing paradigm and we should see how the macroeconomic [situation] affects global consumption trends.”
66;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-07-24T09:47:24Z;Polo endures in US despite low profile;In the US, more people associate polo with the Ralph Lauren clothing line than with the exclusive sport itself, writes David Gelles;In the US, polo is not just an exclusive sport played by the wealthy in Santa Barbara and the Hamptons. For many Americans the better association is with the Ralph Lauren clothing line of brightly coloured shirts and other garments emblazoned with the famous horse and rider.This has created some uncomfortable tensions between Polo Ralph Lauren and the sport itself. Earlier this year, Ralph Lauren sued the US Polo Association to stop it from using an image of a horse and rider and the word “polo” to market its own fragrance as part of its existing product line.In a related lawsuit, the USPA alleged that Ralph Lauren was “attempting to monopolise the depiction of the sport of polo”. But a federal judge decided against the sport’s governing body in the US, ruling that Ralph Lauren’s long history of marketing gave it near-exclusive rights to the motif.That the judge felt compelled to deny polo the right to use its own identity to market itself in the US points to a stark reality: the sport is not a mainstream pursuit in the US, nor is it even very much on people’s minds.Although popular in the vineyards of California’s wine country and the seaside resort towns of New York, the game no longer enjoys a mainstream following, as it did early in the 20th century.Its scarceness, however, has not prevented it from taking root where it does find an audience. There are 270 clubs around the US, from the White Swan Polo Club in LaConner, Washington, to the Red Hills Polo Club of Tallahassee, Florida. They are divided into 13 regional circuits, each of which has its own manager to oversee interclub competition. The USPA reports 4,100 members and says the numbers of players and clubs are at 10-year highs.It was in 1876 that the first US club, the Westchester Polo Club at the Jerome Park racetrack in New York, was established. In the 1930s, crowds of more than 30,000 would attend international polo matches at the Meadowbrook Polo Club on New York’s Long Island. Across the country in San Francisco, the city constructed a massive polo field in the centre of Golden Gate Park.These areas have remained the sport’s focal points even today. “Where there’s been a long history of polo, the facilities and the fields tend to stay,” says Peter Rizzo, executive director of the USPA. “We have a high concentration of polo clubs in the north-east area.”California has the highest concentration of polo players, he says, while Florida has the most fields thanks to its reputation as the “sunshine state”. The Santa Barbara club celebrates its 100th anniversary this year.The rise of football, baseball and basketball, however, has taken its toll on polo’s popularity. Although regular matches no longer draw the crowds that once flocked to the Meadowbrook club, the US Open Polo Championship each April in Florida attracts an audience of 5,000-10,000.The financial crisis also had an impact. “The world recession has hit everything, any sport that requires any kind of outlay of money,” Rizzo says. “And we had a bit of hit. We saw about a 10 per cent decline in [the number of] players.”But the polo community is working to make the exclusive sport more accessible and affordable. “There are a lot less expensive ways to play polo,” he says. “You can rent or lease horses. It’s the great old American way. That entrepreneurial spirit takes over.”For polo-playing communities, there can be real upsides. According to an analysis commissioned in 2007 by the Wellington Equestrian Alliance, a lobbying group, the polo and equestrian industry is worth more than $500m a year. “Just like any other sport, there are a lot of things around the sport, from veterinarians and blacksmiths to feed stores,” says Rizzo.At the same time, the Polo Ralph Lauren brand has grown. With international operations now spanning the globe, it is a publicly traded multinational with a $13bn market capitalisation, making it the polo with which most Americans are familiar.This will likely be the case for years to come. “As we look to the future, the scope of our opportunities across products, channels and geographies is incredibly invigorating,” Mr Lauren said in the most recent annual report, as the company reported a 14 per cent rise in sales.

The programme is already taught on Skema’s Sophia Antipolis campus. Dean Alice Guilhon says the demand from students in China has been tremendous.But companies are also looking for such programmes, she says. “There’s a lot of demand from French (luxury) companies who want to be present in Shanghai. It’s a good opportunity for us to feed the market.”Meanwhile London is to get its first MBA in luxury goods management, but it will be a Scottish University, not an English one, that will teach the programme.Glasgow Caledonian University opened its campus in Spitalfields, one of the trendiest areas of London’s East End, in September 2010 and will launch its MBA in luxury goods management there in September. The one-year programme will enrol students in both September and January.The programme is targeted towards those who want to work in the global luxury industry as well as those who already work in the industry and are looking to accelerate their promotion prospects. Brian Duffy, president for Europe for the Polo Ralph Lauren Group is a visiting professor at GCU and GCU promises more links with top industry.“This is a programme that is focused to reflect the very latest brand management thinking and developments within the global luxury sector,” says Christopher Moore, Vice Dean of GCU Business School. “The MBA will provide students with an excellent insight and understanding of the competitive strategies of the very best luxury companies.”GCU already teaches MSc degrees in International Fashion Marketing and Luxury Brand Marketing from its London campus.www.skema.eduwww.gculondon.ac.uk

They looked like they’d just heard a really silly joke:“PPR is delighted by the excitement the company is generating but the claim made by La Tribune this morning regarding our interest in Prada is not true!” said Ms Beveridge.Implication: “Have you not been paying attention to what François-Henri Pinault keeps saying about acquiring mid-size companies where he can add value?

69;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-05-25T20:52:38Z;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Polo Ralph Lauren led consumer discretionary stocks lower after the retailer reported a sharp drop in quarterly earnings but US indices enjoyed modest gains as firmer commodity prices bolstered the energy and materials sectors.The high-end fashion retailer reported a 36 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit amid higher costs and lower sales in Japan, sending the stock down 11.4 per cent to $114.70.Ralph Lauren is one in a long line of retailers that have been under pressure in recent months thanks to higher commodity costs squeezing margins and elevated gasoline prices discouraging consumers from splashing out.The S&P retail sector is down 2.6 per cent this month after a number of weak earnings reports from companies such as Gap and Aéropostale.The disappointing news from Ralph Lauren weighed on related stocks, with VF Corp, one of the world’s largest clothing companies, falling 2.1 per cent to $95.54 and JC Penney down 0.7 per cent to $35.86.The S&P consumer goods sector lost 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.The main S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,319.89, led higher by energy and materials stocks as commodity prices rose.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climbed 1 per cent to $84.10 while Halliburton advanced 5 per cent to $49.87.The S&P energy index was up 1.4 per cent, the best performing sector on Wall Street.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 2.4 per cent to $49.98 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 2.8 per cent to $49.52. The S&P materials index gained 1.4 per cent.This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.3 per cent to 12,394.66 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,761.38.Technical factors also helped the wider markets to post gains, after the previous session saw the S&P 500 hit a one-month low and come near a resistance level of 1,315.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “The S&P 500 continues to trend toward a potential test of the 1,295-1,300 zone with resistance emerging in the 1,315-1,320 area.”Gains on the indices were limited by downbeat economic data, however, with news that US demand for durable goods had sunk more than expected in April.The number of new orders for durable goods fell 3.6 per cent last month, led by a sharp drop in car and aircraft orders.Car orders dropped 4.5 per cent, the sharpest fall since August, as parts shortages following the Japanese earthquake slowed production at US factories.Ford shares fell 0.6 per cent to $14.58 in the session, leading the S&P auto index down 0.5 per cent.Shares in AIG were down 4 per cent to $28.28 after 300m shares in the bailed-out insurer began trading after a secondary offering.The US Treasury sold 200m shares worth $5.8bn while AIG itself sold 100m shares worth $2.9bn.Applied Materials reported forecast-beating second-quarter earnings but rose only 1.1 per cent to $13.86 as the manufacturer of chipmaking equipment forecast an unexpected drop in current-quarter revenue.Applied Materials has fallen 11.7 per cent this month, one of the many technology stocks that have been on a downward trend recently as investors have moved away from riskier assets into more defensive sectors.The S&P technology index has fallen 4.3 per cent this month while Apple has lost 3.8 per cent to $336.78.Citigroup analysts said that, after the recent losses, it was hard to see a lot of downside on Applied Materials shares, although they argued that now was still not quite the right time to buy.Away from the technology sector, shares in Toll Brothers rose 1.8 per cent to $20.63 after the luxury homebuilder reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss as sales and margins improved.Hormel Foods, which makes Spam and MegaMex Foods products, fell 4.8 per cent to $28.59 after the company forecast a fall in margins because of rising input prices.Express dropped 12 per cent to $20.12 after the apparel retailer said that its second-quarter earnings would not exceed 15 cents a share, which was below the 16 cents a share that analysts had been expecting.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell 5.4 per cent to 16.86 in the session.
70;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-04-12T18:15:54Z;J Crew to launch UK online business;;J Crew, the “preppy” US retailer bought out in a $3bn private equity deal last year, is planning to launch an online business in the UK’s high-end fashion market this summer, its chief executive has said.Mickey Drexler, J Crew’s head and one of the most renowned personalities in US fashion retail, said the group would use its online business to spearhead its overseas expansion ahead of opening more bricks-and-mortar stores.Mr Drexler successfully repositioned J Crew as an upmarket brand, but until now he has maintained a narrow focus on the US market. He will join a growing band of fashion retailers using the internet to lead expansion outside their home markets.“We just have huge demand overseas,” Mr Drexler told Bloomberg TV. “We’re walking, we’re studying right now. But we launch in the UK …in August or September. That’s kind of our official online international.”J Crew agreed to be acquired by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a $3bn deal last November.The group will enter an increasingly competitive market for high-end online fashion in the UK, where Ralph Lauren and Boden are among the retailers that already have a presence selling their own label clothes.Some J Crew clothes are available in the UK via the national site of Net-a-Porter, which sells a variety of women’s brands.Mr Drexler said the group’s online business in the US was its most profitable and added that once the group had expanded it into the UK, “then we’ll figure out where we put stores”. The group is already planning to open an outlet in Canada in August.Stressing that J Crew was not losing interest in the US, he said: “It’s not because America’s over-stored for us. We still think we have [a] good opportunity here. But …we’ve got to make sure you’re on the game, and continuing to move forward or else someone’s going to take your business.”Mr Drexler led Gap’s rise to dominate the retail landscape in the 1990s. After leaving Gap suddenly in 2002, he was recruited to lead a restructuring at J Crew, which began as a catalogue business in the 1970s.The deal to take J Crew private returned it to the control of TPG, which controlled the retailer as a private company between 1997 and its initial public offering in 2006.Mr Drexler said he had no regrets about accepting the buyout offer.“I would do it the same way …I sleep well at night,” he said. “It is what it is. I can’t blame anyone. If you look at most buyouts etc, things happen. But I’m very comfortable with it.”He was talking in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s “In Business with Margaret Brennan”.

GSI stock jumped more than 50 per cent to $29.18. Under the terms of the deal, GSI will have 40 days to solicit higher offers from other potential buyers.The deal – Ebay’s largest in North America since the $2.6bn acquisition of Skype in 2005 – comes as Mr Donahue tries to resuscitate the company’s traditional Marketplaces auction and e-commerce businesses.Ebay has in recent years been increasingly reliant for growth on its PayPal online payments service.GSI is intended to create a third leg to the company’s business, alongside the Marketplaces and payments businesses. The company has more than 180 customers and is expected to benefit from increased investment by Ebay in its technology.“We see considerable potential related to moving larger Marketplaces customers to the [GSI] platform, and having [GSI] customers use Ebay.com as an additional channel and PayPal/Bill Me Later for payments,” said Scott Kessler, IT analyst at Standard & Poor’s.As well as serving bigger companies’ needs outside of Ebay.com, analysts say GSI will bring expertise in “fulfilment” – the processing and delivery of orders – for third-party sellers that will make Ebay more competitive with Amazon.Certain assets deemed non-core by Ebay will be sold as part of the deal. GSI’s sports merchandise business will be sold to a new company, led by Michael Rubin, GSI founder. Mr Rubin’s vehicle will also buy 70 per cent of RueLaLa.com, a private sales shopping website, and ShopRunner.com, a members-only shopping service.Ebay will lend $467m to the new company, while Mr Rubin will invest $31m.Ebay is paying about 21 times GSI’s trailing 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Bloomberg. Ebay said the deal would have little impact on its guidance on core 2011 earnings.Goldman Sachs and Peter J. Solomon acted as financial advisers to Ebay. Morgan Stanley advised GSI.
72;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-02-15T21:56:59Z;Amazon’s Europe push targets Spain;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is laying the groundwork for a new e-commerce site serving customers in Spain, as it continues to expand its business in western Europe.The retailer has begun recruiting Spanish-speaking managers to handle the look and content of home pages and site merchandising initiatives, as well as vendor and in-stock managers.It is also looking for a marketing manager to develop its customer base in Spain with efforts including e-mail campaigns, search engine optimisation, and a local associates programme to encourage individuals to link their websits and blogs to Amazon’s site.Amazon’s job advertisements indicate that the planned business will follow the lines of the company’s Italian site, which launched in November last year, and which is run by a management team split between Paris and the retailer’s European headquarters in Luxembourg.Amazon initially moved into Europe with separate businesses, launching first in the UK and Germany in 1998, but it is increasingly moving towards a more unified European business.The Italian site was the first new country business Amazon has launched since expanding into China in 2004 with its acquisition of Joyo.com.Of the 13 new distribution centres the retailer added in 2010 to its previous global network of about 40 sites, three were in Europe, including a second location in Montelimar in southern France.In January, Amazon took full control of Lovefilm, the UK-based DVD rental service that has customers across western Europe, in a £200m ($317m) deal. In October last year, it paid almost $100m to acquire BuyVIP, a fashion sales site based in Spain with a presence in seven EU countries.The international expansion of e-commerce has gathered pace over the past year, with Amazon’s rival Walmart expanding its business online in Mexico, China, Chile and Argentina, and US brands ranging from Gap to Polo Ralph Lauren opening international e-commerce sites. In the UK, both Tesco and Marks & Spencer are planning to expand their e-commerce presence.
73;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-02-13T19:31:36Z;Polo Ralph Lauren eyes locations in China;;Polo Ralph Lauren, one of the top US luxury brands, says it plans to open its first company-owned stores in mainland China, joining a lengthening line of upmarket western brands eager to serve increasing demand from affluent Chinese consumers.Roger Farah, president, told analysts the brand was looking for store locations not only in Beijing and Shanghai, but in other Chinese cities.“A lot of second- and third-tier cities are now beginning to gel and exhibiting customer demand, and so we are going to have to look at those at the same time we’re looking at the primary cities for key locations,” Mr Farah said.He said Polo Ralph Lauren, known for the preppy look pioneered by its founder Ralph Lauren, planned to establish an e-commerce presence in China and elsewhere in Asia to reinforce its brand, describing China as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”“We are going to have to move quickly to accelerate our strategy of e-commerce in that region because I think that will help overlay the brand positioning we’re trying to achieve,” he said.The company’s plans for China are part of a broader effort to step up its performance in Asia, where its business has previously been handled by licensees.Asia accounted for just over 9 per cent of the group’s revenues of $4.9bn in its most recent fiscal year, with about 70 per cent of its business coming from North America.The group has recently taken over control of its licensees in South Korea and Japan.Mr Farah said Polo Ralph Lauren was also looking to open high-profile, company-owned stores throughout Asia, in contrast with its previous dependence on licensees focused on selling its men’s wear line through concessions or leased space in department stores.“We are going to be aggressive in our desire to get the kind of locations …we think we need to properly position the brand,” Mr Farah said, describing these moves as part of an effort that would unfold during the next two years and beyond.In its home US market, Polo Ralph Lauren has used its stores, such as the 16,000 sq ft faux Gilded Age mansion opened last year in Manhattan, to reinforce its image as a lifestyle brand that embraces not only fashion but accessories, home furnishings and other items.Polo Ralph Lauren’s decision to take control of its local Asian licensees mirrors a similar move in Asia by Coach, the luxury handbag and accessory brand, in 2008, before significantly expanding its presence in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
74;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2011-02-13T19:31:36Z;Clothing groups warn on cotton surge impact;;US clothing companies are warning of a jolt in consumer prices in the latter half of this year, affecting everything from socks to evening dresses, as the soaring cost of cotton ends a prolonged spell of price deflation in the sector.Some US clothing brands have started passing on an initial wave of price increases in their spring collections, after last year’s initial escalation in cotton prices.But the groups say they expect far sharper rises later this year as the surge in commodity prices moves through the production process and into stores.Cotton hit a record high on Friday, topping $1.90 a pound amid a shortage of the fibre.The cost of the commodity has risen 150 per cent since the start of 2010.Efforts by manufacturers to reduce costs by switching to cheaper alternative materials have also led to sharp price increases in polyester and other synthetic fibres.Wesley Card, chief executive of Jones Group, whose brands include Nine West and Anne Klein, told the Financial Times that after single-digit percentage price rises in some areas in the spring, consumers would be looking at “price increases pretty much across the board” by the end of the year, with percentage rises as high as double digits.“It’s going to be relatively broad-based because it affects all denim, no matter what price point, all items including cotton and footwear as well,” he said.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, the mid-range department store, has said the company avoided price increases this spring but faces challenges in the autumn.“If the cotton price is going to be double what it was a year ago, it will obviously affect retail prices,” he told the FT.Executives say the clothing industry is as yet unsure about how consumers will react to price rises, after becoming accustomed to prices that have fallen steadily during the past decade due to the emergence of low-cost overseas production and the rise of China.John Anderson, chief executive of Levi Strauss, said last week that it was too early to calculate the impact because “the consumer hasn’t had a chance to respond to those [prices] yet.”Mr Card at Jones Group said price increases could vary from as little as $2 on a pair of low-cost jeans at a discounter to $15 on an $80 jacket at a department store.“It is hard to see where the price elasticity is going to meet resistance at this point,” he said.At JC Penney, Mr Ullman said that the higher margin on the group’s large private-label clothing business would give it more flexibility in introducing price increases and that the retailer expected to seek to reduce the impact on basic clothing.“We obviously have key price points that we want to maintain to give customers the very sharp value that they’re used to,” he said.“We think we have more flexibility in fashion than we do in basics.”Roger Farah, president of Polo Ralph Lauren, warned this month that the price rise would be a challenge for its high-end brands, which he expected to lead to “a responsible adjustment that reflects the reality of cost of goods increases”.He said: “Until we get to the [autumn] …we won’t know whether the end consumer understands and accepts what will be an overall increase for most product categories.”
75;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-12-22T22:53:41Z;Survival guide for retail brands;;"The New Rules of Retail
Competing in the World’s Toughest Marketplace
By Robin Lewis and Michael Dart
Palgrave Macmillan, $26/£16.99The retail sector appears to be undergoing one of its periodic bouts of upheaval.JC Penney, the mainstream US department store, will launch two online-only retail stores next year. Walmart, the biggest US discount retailer, is planning a new range of small, local stores aimed at serving urban neighbourhoods. Polo Ralph Lauren, the preppy “lifestyle” brand, has just opened a New York store on Madison Avenue that looks more like a mansion than a shop. And Procter & Gamble is franchising a line of automatic car washes around its Mr Clean brand.For Robin Lewis and Michael Dart, this flurry of apparently unrelated innovation might fit well with the central thesis of their book, The New Rules of Retail – Competing in the World’s Toughest Marketplace, that the US retail industry is undergoing a wave of fundamental change, and that brands and ret­ailers who do not res­pond are doomed to fail.Lewis, a former executive editor of Women’s Wear Daily, and Dart, head of private equity at retail consultancy Kurt Salmon, boldly predict that 50 per cent of the plethora of current brands will disappear in a wave of structural change that has less to do with the impact of the worst recession since the 1930s and more to do with, as they see it, historic structural change driven by “total consumer power”, already under way before the recession hit.There have been two such upheavals before, they write. The first, starting in the late 19th century, saw the emergence of the first national US retailers such as Montgomery Ward, JC Penney and Sears. These pioneers sought to satisfy exploding demand for newly available manufactured goods by using the new infrastructure of industrial America.The next came after the second world war, with the proliferation of supply and choice delivered by new national consumer goods brands, and the ascendancy of mass marketing. It lasted until the beginning of the current century.But the retail world is now in upheaval again, not because of the retail slump of the past few years, but because of the emergence of total consumer power, as buyers use the power of digital technology in a saturated market to determine what, how and when they buy.This supremacy of the individual buyer, plugged into Facebook and checking prices on a smartphone, is not a new idea. But this readable analysis provides an accessible set of principles for assessing what retailers need to do to survive, and tests them against a range of retail successes and failures.It outlines three principles that the authors argue will decide which businesses survive, making it a thought-provoking read for retailers and their marketers, investment bankers and investors.The first is to establish a “neurological relationship” with the customer – the kind of rewarding customer experience that builds an emotional relationship with a brand or store. It is this, they say, that makes shoppers so eager to flood into retailers such as Apple, or to return repeatedly to such flash fashion e-commerce sites as Gilt and Rue La La. They expect to be promised things that are sexy and new, or thrilled by the hunt for bargains.Second, brands need “pre-emptive distribution” – so they are available almost immediately to the customer, as with Amazon’s instant availability of almost everything, or JC Penney’s new webstores, or Walmart’s new small urban stores.Third, retailers need total control of their “value chain” – ensuring that even if their clothes or goods are sold in a department store, they can be sure the items are presented in a way that reinforces the relationship with the customer. Thus, Polo Ralph Lauren shapes its image with its new Madison Avenue “mansion store”, but also through the specially trained staff selling its clothes in Macy’s.Meanwhile, the department stores themselves – and even supermarkets and grocers too – will accelerate development of their own exclusive brands, in order to maintain control.Established brands with no direct path to the consumer are seeking to create their own direct links. Thus P&G seeks now not to sell Tide via just a retailer, but to deliver a direct experience at pilot Tide-branded dry-cleaners, while it builds and rewards online communities of Facebook fans.The authors say their research into retail companies broadly supports their three principles. They look­ed at companies that ap­peared to be putting the principles into practice and found retailers that rated top in each category were creating more economic value than the rest between 2002 and 2010, while a quarter of those in the bottom quartile went into bankruptcy in 2007 – supporting their prediction that half the brands we know will disappear.However, they concede that some retailers that seem to meet the necessary criteria can also come un­stuck – notably Gap and Starbucks, which both suffered setbacks as growth led them to lose touch with their customers.It is a thoughtful analysis, and one that helps ex­plain, for instance, why recent private equity investments in the J Crew and Gymboree brands have focused not on potential turnround candidates – but on two of the stronger performers in a rapidly changing retail landscape."
76;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-11-10T22:33:50Z;Polo Ralph Lauren;Sales outlook lifted to double-digit growth as consumers pop collars;Collars are popping at a rapid rate around the world. Polo Ralph Lauren raised guidance for the rest of its financial year when reporting second-quarter results on Tuesday. In spite of already elevated expectations – shares in the clothing group have tripled in the past 18 months – strong sales growth and record profitability pushed Ralph Lauren stock to an all-time high.Still run by Mr Lauren, who began the Polo label in 1967 with a range of flamboyant ties, the group has extended the brand to everything from luggage and polo shirts to women’s handbags and “Big Pony” perfume. In recent years the group has invested in its own retail stores to complement the larger wholesale operation, and in 2008 set itself the target to double sales from Europe and Asia – two-thirds of revenues now come from North America, down from about three-quarters two years ago.The overseas expansion has helped. Reflecting the recent pick-up in consumer demand for upmarket and luxury brands generally, Ralph Lauren sales were up 12 per cent on the year before. Impressive too was good cost control in the group’s manufacturing operations after it raised concerns about rising raw materials six months ago. An operating margin of 20 per cent for the quarter was far above the 13 per cent average over the past decade.Investors willing to pay 22 times prospective earnings though should note that such profitability is not sustainable – a tougher second half ahead means that guidance is for margins below that made last year. So maintaining that premium to peers and Ralph Lauren’s own historic valuation requires constant sales growth. But with past investments in Europe now cantering along, and consolidation of the Asian operations proceeding apace, there seems little to stop the Polo’s preppy march ahead.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
77;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-11-10T21:36:50Z;Good retail results lift Wall Street;Market muted in spite of better earnings;Better-than-expected earnings from Macy’s and Polo Ralph Lauren lifted consumer discretionary stocks while the wider market edged up.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index pushed up 0.8 per cent and the retail sector also rose 0.8 per cent.Polo Ralph Lauren jumped 7.3 per cent to $108.28 after its second-quarter profits beat expectations. The fashion and luxury brands company said it expects sales in its fiscal year 2011 to rise by a low double-digit percentage, higher than it previously forecast.But the company also said margins would decline in the second half of the year because of rising labour, raw material and transportation costs.Macy’s, the department store chain, adapted to local tastes and benefited from a rise in spending at its high- end Bloomingdale’s stores.The retailer beat expectations, reporting a quarterly profit compared with a loss for the same period last year.Sales were higher than expected and the company reaffirmed its forecast for same-store sales in the fourth quarter to rise 3-4 per cent. The chain also edged its full-year profit outlook higher to a range above some analyst estimates. However, its shares slipped 1.4 per cent to close at $24.86, after rising 28 per cent in the last three months. Rivals rallied with Nordstrom higher by 1.2 per cent to $42.39 and Saks gaining 1.1 per cent to $11.56.But Michael Exstein, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that a sharp recovery in department store stocks meant that they were already 80 per cent of the way to their prior peak and may be nearing the top of the cycle.“This has, and always will be, a cyclical group due to the high fixed-cost nature of the business,” he said. “Once again, investors may be focusing too much on the upside and should consider where the group is today relative to prior cycles.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,218.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,357.04 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,578.78.“Essentially what we’re seeing right now is profit-taking, we’ve had a nice-sized run and people are a little bit nervous,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research.Investors, still recovering from last week’s quantitative-easing fuelled rally, were not inspired by the better-than-expected initial jobless claims, which fell to a four-month low. The US trade deficit narrowed more than was expected in September as the weak US dollar helped American exporters offset near-record imports from China.Some pharmaceutical stocks fell, with Eli Lilly declining 0.8 per cent to $34.99 and Pfizer dropping by 1 per cent to $16.83.In industrials, Boeing shares were sent 3.2 per cent lower at $67.07 after the emergency landing of a test flight of a 787 Dreamliner. It was reported that the aircraft was forced to land due to a fire on board. The new model has been delayed six times because of a combination of problems with new materials, parts shortages and redesigning work.Research in Motion, the maker of BlackBerry handsets, jumped 6.3 per cent to $58.44 after it said that the PlayBook, its tablet computer, will sell for less than $500, making it cheaper than Apple’s iPad.But Apple shares still edged up 0.6 per cent to $318.03.Shares in Campbell Soupsuffered, falling 3.3 per cent to $34.85 after the company lowered its full-year forecast as shoppers shied away. Earnings per share will climb 2-4 per cent for the year that ends in July compared with its previous guidance of 5-7 per cent.Kelly Services, the employment agency, beat expectations in its third quarter as demand for temporary employees rose. The shares rose 3.3 per cent to $17.00.The deal speculation dominating the market this week continued as BJ’s Wholesale Club, the warehouse store operator, gained 12.6 per cent to $47.34 after it was reported that it could be considering options, which included a sale of the business.
78;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-09-20T09:23:18Z;Parsing Interbrand’s best global luxury brands;;"The Interbrand 100 best global brands list 2010 just came out, and there was some interesting (or depressing, depending on your perspective), movement in the luxury rankings. Of the seven brands on the list, one rose vis-à-vis its ranking last year (Hermès, from 69 to 70), three held steady (Louis Vuitton, 16; Tiffany, 76; Cartier, 77), three dropped a few spaces (Gucci, down from 41 to 44; Armani, down from 89 to 95; and Burberry, down from 98 to 100), and three more fell off entirely: Prada, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Chanel. Ouch.Still, there are a couple things worth noting.One: almost all the brands still on the list are accessory-driven. Vuitton and Hermes do have runway shows, as does Gucci, but the bulk of their profits come from handbags and other small leathergoods/silks.Two: the apparel names that made it on are associated with what are called “classics”, and have company structures where a luxury tip rests on an iceberg of more accessible lines. See Armani, with his signature power deconstructed suits and jeans. Ditto Burberry where the majority of sales are not the fashion-forward Prorsum line, but the trenches, which are kind of accessories, bags, and the lower-priced Burberry London. Tiffany and Cartier meanwhile function much the same way in the jewellery and watches sphere.Three: brand value seems to have very little to do with fashion. In fact, maybe if your goal is to be a great global brand, you should avoid fashion altogether. Prada was the most trend-setting and season-specific brand on the list in 2009, after all, and, well….And four: this is exactly the kind of showing you would expect in a post-recession environment, where investment and quality/heritage are continually being touted as the single most effective consumer buttons. Who wants to spend money on a new dress when it might be on eBay in a few months? Especially when every magazine you open is telling you a scarf is the answer to your wardrobe update needs (hello, Hermès!).The only thing that puzzles me is the 2010 absence of Chanel, which fell from a high of 60, and which I would have thought fulfills all of the above criteria. Bags? Quilted, check. Classics? Little boucle jacket, check. Heritage and track record? Check, check. Big global presence? Check.Interbrand doesn’t really explain what happened to the brands that slide off their particular slope, though; they just tell you the percentage growth in the ones that make it on their list. That’s all very positive of them, but personally, it leaves me feeling a bit negative. Failures, mistakes, the effects of market flukes – don’t all enquiring minds want to know?Related reading:how to spend it FT"
79;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-08-31T22:28:56Z;Relocated labels;;"It is a steamy day in Manhattan but buyers from Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and other big-name department stores have been lured out of their air-conditioned lairs to the midtown offices of an Indian company called S. Kumars Nationwide Limited. The attraction? The latest collections of men’s suits from such venerable American names as Hickey Freeman, President Barack Obama’s favourite tailor.As they enter past giant promotional posters shot by Annie Leibovitz, they are considering what high-end men’s wear will look like in spring 2011. One conclusion: a lot more global than it has until recently.Just weeks after Mr Obama was inaugurated wearing a Hickey Freeman suit, HMX, the Chicago-based owner of that brand as well as Hart Schaffner Marx among others, filed for bankruptcy protection. After an auction in August last year, Mumbai-based SKNL became the latest Asian group to buy a collection of premier western fashion brands.In doing so, it joined Megha Mittal, of the Indian Mittal steel dynasty, who last year bought the German luxury brand Escada; Li & Fung of Hong Kong, which two years ago snapped up Hardy Amies, couturier to Britain’s royal family; and Hong Kong-based S.C. Fang & Sons, which bought Pringle of Scotland in 2000.From individual consumers of luxury goods, the Chinese and Indians have become consumers of luxury companies, in a shift that has far-reaching implications for the $80bn (€63bn, £52bn) a year industry. Many of the recent acquisitions have been driven by a wish to raise production standards in Asia and, in the long term, change a tenet of the luxury industry: the importance of production in “country of origin”. The notion that to merit its price tag, a luxury item must be made in the country where it is designed and where its label was born is on the wane.Although the ready-to-wear shows, which start next week in New York and continue in London, Milan and Paris, are filled with labels that say not only Calvin Klein or Gianfranco Ferrè but also that they are “Made in Italy” or “Made in France”, the goal of many new owners is to change the second part of the equation to “Made in India” or “Made in China”.The first stage in the transformation – transfer of ownership– has not only begun but, says Luca Solca, chief luxury analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Switzerland, “is a trend that is only going to gain momentum”.Inevitably, all this is being driven by the rising prosperity and expectations of an exploding middle class in both of the world’s biggest emerging markets. In China, sales of luxury goods are expected to reach $14.6bn by 2014, according to Bain, the consultancy. Every second- or third-tier Chinese city now boasts upscale malls. In India, the luxury market, though still small, is estimated to be growing at 25 per cent a year – and its business sector is engaged in “an incredible wealth accumulation that sees these companies as assets that are very reasonably priced”, says Mr Solca.Many Asian companies believe they have a comparative advantage in taking over apparel-centric luxury brands because they can shift production to lower-cost facilities closer to home and increase profit margins, while also using the magic of brand names and their existing distribution channels in the US or Europe to increase sales.Sung-Joo Kim, the South Korean mogul who in 2005 bought MCM, the German luxury handbag brand, has managed to double its revenues partly thanks to a focus on Asia. The SKNL investment thesis, meanwhile, includes using the fine woollen mills it bought in Scotland as part of the HMX acquisition and the silk mills it controls in Italy to upgrade the quality of the textiles it uses in its apparel production in India.“We want to introduce American creativity and expertise to India,” says Tushar Maloo, who oversees the New York operations of SKNL, which makes fabrics, clothing and home textiles.Others, too, are on the prowl. Welspun, another Indian company, tried unsuccessfully to buy a US home textile maker such as Stevens Point a few years ago. Now, with the help of a big minority investment from Temasek, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, it is again searching actively.There can be pitfalls, to be sure. “Brands mean nothing unless you know what to do with them,” says the chief executive of one of the most successful US apparel chains. “Olds­mobile used to be a prestigious brand,” he points out, referring to one of the General Motors marques that had value in the past but is no more.For the shorter term, anyway, some acknowledge the corporate rationale. “The competitive advantage of these Chinese and Indian companies is their ability to source cheaply,” says the senior managing director at one big New York buy-out firm with responsibility for vetting Asian deals. “Asia is good at mass manufacturing. The way to make money is to go downmarket. It isn’t pretty, but it is profitable.”W hile on paper many acquisitions look logical as well as emotionally compelling, execution can be hard work. Indian companies are, for example, used to surviving in an environment where capital has been expensive and interest rates high. That gives them a laser-like focus on return on their investment. But often they may not have the deep pockets to invest in the brands they acquire.“Just as in the 1970s, [when] ‘Made in Japan’ had a negative taint,” says Mark Bandak at Blackstone Advisory Partners, part of the US private equity group, “today so does ‘Made in China’ or ‘Made in India’ – but they take great pride in their manufacturing capabilities and the question for them is how do you change that image? This is key at the moment.”For luxury companies, relocating all manufacturing back to Asia, no matter the country, can risk devaluing the brands they have paid to acquire. In addition, says Alessandra Coppola, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s in London, the European countries where the brands are currently based will fight to protect their heritage. “Italy has already created legislation regarding what is necessary for a product to carry the ‘Made in Italy’ label,” she adds. To qualify, two stages of the manufacturing process must take place in the country.“We have brands that straddle the whole pyramid,” counters SKNL’s Mr Maloo, whose employer paid a bargain $25m for HXM but took on $125m in debt of the company, which apart from in-house labels has licensing arrangements with others including Austin Reed of the UK. “We won’t take upscale brands such as Hickey Freeman downmarket. We are about getting customers to spend hundreds of dollars – not like Walmart, which is about spending nickels.”Other ways to improve performance also exist. SKNL has taken advantage of flexibility in the US bankruptcy code to rationalise the structure of its purchase. HMX had eight plants in the US and Canada, with none working at full capacity, each run as a separate fiefdom, and with no effort to combine shared functions, from information technology to distribution. Today, only three plants are functioning and the workforce has been slashed from 3,800 when the company filed for Chapter 11 protection to about 1,700 now.The company is being run by Doug Williams, who worked for Ralph Lauren for 17 years before forming his own consultancy, and has brought Joseph Abboud on board to oversee design. It moved the US headquarters from Chicago to trendy offices (which it obtained rent-free for the first year from a bankrupt insurer) across the street from New York’s Grand Central Station. “The old company was a manufacturing company; it wasn’t a branding company,” says Mr Williams.Asian companies, especially in China (in part thanks to Hong Kong groups such as Li & Fung, which as well as Hardy Amies bought Gieves & Hawkes, the Savile Row tailoring house, in 2006) have moved up the value chain with speed. Twenty years ago, zippers and even buttons had to be imported for anything other than the lowest-quality clothing. No longer.Although for years Giorgio Armani used China to make only Armani A/X, its cheapest line, today its Armani Collezione bridge line is also produced in Asia, says Sanford Bernstein’s Mr Solca. Or as Ms Coppola at S&P puts it: “In reality it is increasingly apparent that luxury goods could be produced outside of their ‘country of origin’ with the same quality.”Indeed, if anything the flow is becoming more two-way. Dalian Dayang Trands, the Shanghai-listed preferred suitmaker of investor Warren Buffet, has aspirations to compete with Armani and Ermenegildo Zegna, according to Blackstone’s Mr Bandak.F or the moment, China remains in the lead. There are still many difficulties facing ambitious Indian fashion companies, not least the fact that it is currently far easier to do business in China for a variety of reasons. “Only China has the capacity and the infrastructure,” Mr Maloo notes, pointing out that SKNL’s Hart Schaffner Marx made-to-measure business is based in China.Crucially, China boasts both a skilled labour force and infrastructure (not just decent roads, ports, and transport but financial arrangements), attributes lacking in countries with even cheaper working environments such as Vietnam or Bangladesh, according to executives at HSBC. Yet even in China, total costs are 30 per cent lower than in India.But as wealth swells in Asia, and American and European consumers tighten their belts, there is no doubt that fashion’s centre of gravity will increasingly shift east, in manufacturing as well as consumer terms. In the end, more and more companies will tackle the question posed by John Studzinski, head of Blackstone Advisory Partners: “Do you just buy the milk, or is it smarter to own the cow?”"
80;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-08-30T21:39:43Z;Retailers and financials lead Wall St lower;;US stocks dropped on Monday after data showed personal incomes rose less than expected, raising questions about the sustainability of consumer spending.The S&P 500 closed down 1.5 per cent at 1,048.93, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.4 per cent to close at 10,009.95 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.6 per cent lower at 2,119.97.Figures on consumer spending and personal incomes kicked off a bumper week for economic data that culminates in the release of the non-farm payrolls report on Friday.Personal incomes rose less than forecast in July, climbing just 0.2 per cent compared with the projected 0.3 per cent. Even though consumer spending rose slightly more than expected at 0.4 per cent (compared with economists’ estimates of 0.3 per cent) the gap between the figures raised concerns that the rise in spending may not be sustainable.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said that the data, although slightly below expectations, did not point to anything the market did not know already but simply highlighted the high rate of unemployment.“If you had to summarise the situation in three words it would be jobs, jobs and jobs. The market is predominantly focusing on jobs and the Federal Reserve is exclusively focused on jobs,” he said.He added that soon he expected many corporate earnings forecasts to be revised lower. “They’ll have to come down and be more in line with the economic growth outlook. The central scenario is sluggish, sloppy, ugly growth, [but] not a double-dip recession.”Shares fell further after President Obama failed to address economic concerns. In an afternoon speech, he said that he and his economic team had looked at ways to bolster the economic recovery, including tax cuts for businesses, but did not provide an action plan.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell by 1.8 per cent and the index of retailers was down 2.2 per cent. Ralph Lauren declined 3.5 per cent to $75.46, department store owner Nordstrom fell 5.2 per cent to $28.72 and Home Depot lost 2.6 per cent to $24.32.The financial sector suffered the most in the S&P 500, down 2.2 per cent, with AIG falling 3.4 per cent to $34.00, Wells Fargo sliding 3.1 per cent to $23.25 and US Bancorp 4.4 per cent lower at $20.71.In technology, Cisco fell 2.4 per cent to $20.32, Microsoft was down 1.3 per cent to $23.64 and Google lost 1.3 per cent to $452.69.Deal activity continued to dominate the market as both Intel and 3M completed acquisitions. Intel fell 2.2 per cent to $17.96 after Infineon Technologies agreed to sell its wireless chip unit to the company for $1.4bn. US-listed shares in Infineon, which is based in Germany, fell 5.6 per cent to $5.61.Cogent, which makes technology for biometric identification, rose 24.4 per cent to $11.09 after industrial conglomerate 3M said it had agreed to buy the company for $10.50 a share, or $943m. 3M was down 1 per cent to $80.20.United Airlines rose 1.3 per cent to $20.71 after the US government cleared its merger with Continental Airlines, which nudged up 0.4 per cent to $21.89. The deal is still waiting for shareholder approval.3Par, the “cloud computing” company at the centre of a battle between Hewlett-Packard and Dell, fell 2 per cent to $31.82 as the bidding war continued. 3Par’s board said on Friday that HP’s most recent bid of $2bn was a “superior proposal”. Dell, previously the favoured bidder, responded by saying it was assessing making another offer.Dell rose 1.1 per cent to $12.02. HP was buoyed after it authorised an additional $10bn for share buy-backs, on top of $8bn announced last November. HP gained 1.5 per cent to $38.56.In other deal news, Genzyme was up 3.4 per cent to $69.91 after it rejected an $18.5bn offer from Sanofi-Aventis as “unrealistic”.Sanofi-Aventis had reiterated the proposal it made a month ago. The Paris-based pharmaceutical company said Genzyme was refusing to discuss the offer and that it was prepared to take the bid hostile.US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis fell 1 per cent to $28.63.

82;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-06-14T00:06:09Z;US M&A: Luxury groups adapt to the post-recession world;;Coco Chanel once commented of her business: “some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.”But the buying public had other ideas during the downturn: in 2009, a healthy fear of destitution trumped consumers’ aversion to the unrefined. The result was an 8 per cent fall in luxury sales.For an industry buoyed during previous economic slumps by increasing demand from emerging markets, the lessons of a severe and wide-ranging recession are still being absorbed, says Claudia D’Arpizio, a Milan-based partner at Bain & Co.“The winners were the most professionally managed companies, which had the ability to anticipate and react to the crisis,” she says.“In particular, the biggest groups and the best brands within those groups outperformed.”Ms D’Arpizio is among those predicting a new wave of deals among luxury goods companies.“In 2008 and 2009, most people were cutting costs, increasing productivity and managing their balance sheet,” says Ken Berliner, president of Peter J Solomon Company.“Now they’re looking at where they are going to get growth.”In the 1990s, double-digit growth in luxury sales and inter-company rivalries helped motivate a slew of richly priced deals that brought brands together within groups such as France’s PPR and LVMH.Now, the impetus for mergers and acquisitions in the sector is different.“We’ll see a new rationalisation of portfolios of the big groups, as they get rid of brands that can’t compete, as well as the creation of new groups by emerging market companies or family offices,” says Ms D’Arpizio.Labelux, the luxury company founded by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, has indicated an interest in making a further acquisition this year, while India’s Mittal family last year ventured into the luxury sector scooping German fashion brand Escada from bankruptcy.But while the largest luxury players previously snapped up young brands when seeking growth, the downturn proved that not every developing designer has global potential.“The biggest groups have a whole raft of brands, some of which won’t make it,” notes Alexandra Soto, a managing director in investment banking at Lazard.“In some cases, the group is not the right home for the brand. A brand may not thrive in a big group environment and could be better off within a smaller, family-owned entity.”LVMH last month denied it was considering a sale of Kenzo, the French fashion label, but declined to comment on reports it was considering pruning its portfolio elsewhere.Meanwhile, PPR has made no secret of it wish to shed retail assets, which include Conforama, the discount furnishings retailer and Fnac, the consumer electronics chain.However, the group wants to add to its portfolio of brands, both in its luxury division, anchored by Gucci, and its lifestyle operations, built around the 2007 acquisition of Puma, the German sportwear company.In the US, luxury groups are less well defined. VF Corp, Liz Claiborne – which restructured its portfolio just before the downturn hit – and Jones Apparel – which recently bought a majority stake in footwear and accessories brand Stuart Weitzman – combine a broad variety of brands ranging from leisure names to premium apparel.And while Jones, along with smaller groups such as Perry Ellis and Oxford Industries, has expressed an interest in acquisitions, opportunities to snap up top-end names are limited, say industry bankers.“The reality is there are not a lot of luxury brands in the US for groups to buy,” says Carrie Barber, director in the retail and consumer group at Credit Suisse. “There are not a huge number of true luxury opportunities.”Instead, groups can seek to create broader portfolios, or increase existing brands’ appeal, beyond the high-priced, luxury niche.International markets helped prompt Phillips-Van Heusen to pay $3bn earlier this year to add Tommy Hilfiger to its stable, which already includes Calvin Klein. Part of the deal’s rationale was Hilfiger’s strength in Europe and Asia, where it commands higher prices than in the US.However, Hilfiger also offered breadth of distribution, argues Ian Sugarman, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, enabling management to explore growth through broadening the brand’s appeal.More generally, says Mr Sugarman, “the US apparel and footwear players take advantage of channels of distribution that some of the European luxury players typically avoid.”While catwalk couture might dominate the headlines, say industry bankers, taking most labels beyond about $100m in sales requires either extending distribution or launching lower-priced or lifestyle ranges, in a model best executed by Polo Ralph Lauren.In the US, Coach and Tiffany also have both concentrated on tending their core brand and seeking out growth overseas.Taking a brand to a wider audience while maintaining its upmarket appeal can prove a difficult balance.“People are always attracted to luxury. It has a certain allure to it that is hard to describe,” comments Mr Berliner. “Yet the most successful retailer in the world is Walmart.”
83;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink.

84;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-05-10T18:10:19Z;Silk price soars as China’s farmland shrinks;;Silk ties and handkerchiefs are forecast to rise in price after the cost of silk jumped to its highest level in at least 15 years as rapid industrialisation in China, the world’s largest supplier, robs the sector of valuable farmland.The price of silk cocoons, the raw material for the fabric used in expensive items of clothing, has doubled since the start of 2009 to Rmb92,700 ($13,570) a tonne in mid-April, according to the China Cocoon and Silk Exchange.European merchants and weavers said the price of raw silk, the variety traded internationally, had followed a similar trend.“It is rising every day, every week,” said Christian Morel Journel, a silk merchant in Lyon, France.The urbanisation of the key silk-producing region around Shanghai has reduced the land available for mulberry trees, whose leaves are the only thing silk worms eat.“It’s as if you had a very large city in Champagne on the soil of the famous wine,” Mr Morel Journel bemoaned.Chinese output fell 15 per cent to 84,000 tonnes last year, according to the International Sericultural Commission, and a drought that began in late 2009 has further reduced production. China accounts for 70 per cent of global silk production.The rally coincides with a surge in the cost of other natural fibres: coarse wool, used for carpets, has soared to the highest level since 1980, while cotton is near a 14-year high. Silk accounts for a small part of the final price of fine clothing.But David Tooth, chairman of Vanners, a 270-year-old silk weaver in Suffolk, England, which supplies brands such as Burberry and Ralph Lauren, expects retail prices to rise 10-20 per cent in the near term.The rise in prices marks a small reversal of fortunes for silk, which was once one of the pre-eminent global commodities, giving its name to the “silk route” from East Asia to the Mediterranean.Demand of silk has sagged in modern times with the arrival of artificial fibres, which are cheaper and easier to clean.Industry executives forecast prices will rise further until fresh supplies arrive later this year. Stocks are low, and some believe Chinese investors are exacerbating market tightness by hoarding silk in the hope of further rises.The drop in supply has coincided with an increase in demand that has squeezed the market.
85;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-04-26T02:58:57Z;Jack Wills eyes international expansion;;Jack Wills, the preppy youth fashion brand, opened its first store in the US at the weekend as it embarks on a programme of international expansion.The retailer, which targets school and university students, has been using viral marketing to build its brand presence in the US for the past three years.Sales have risen 81 per cent since 2007, and forecast full-year turnover for 2010 is £65m ($100m), with profits of £10.1m.Rose Marie Bravo, former Burberry chief executive, joined the Jack Wills board as a non-executive director last November. She will be helping the retailer tackle the US market, where it will face competition from brands such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Ralph Lauren.Last year, Jack Wills hired 20 young people to party on the US East Coast while wearing its clothes. Videos of their antics were posted on its website and spread using social media.The first store, in Nantucket, will be followed by two more in Martha’s Vineyard and Boston this summer.
86;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-04-08T19:38:48Z;LVMH in luxury hotel deal with Egypt’s Orascom;;LVMH, the luxury goods company, is to enter the five-star hotel management business, initially through a partnership with Egypt’s Orascom Development Holdings, to build two resorts in the Middle East.The hotels will be branded Cheval Blanc, after the Michelin-starred French ski resort opened in 2006 by Group Arnault, the family holding of Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s executive chairman.Paris-based LVMH, which already has a score of luxury brands ranging from leather goods, watches, fashion, wines and spirits, and duty-free stores, said the creation of LVMH Hotel Management was a “natural extension of activities in luxury hospitality”.The hotel management company will have a team of five to 10 people and will “minimise capital commitment” while retaining control over the development and design of the hotels.The hotels will also showcase some of LVMH’s other brands – the Cheval Blanc resort in Courchevel has Louis Vuitton and Dior shopping outlets as well as a Givenchy spa.A number of fashion and luxury brands have diversified into hotels, for the most part on a limited basis, including Armani, Bulgari, Versace and Ralph Lauren.“This looks at first sight an extravagant diversification but on closer inspection the move seems sensible,” said Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein Research. “LVMH will control key choices in the development of these hotels but will commit no capex and retain no management risk.“It will take a royalty from its partners and have a chance to display its brands. If this is how it works, I see no downside and possibly some upside.”The first two hotels, scheduled to open in 2012 in Egypt and Oman, will be mostly financed by Orascom.LVMH is to manage the hotels, and will take a percentage of sales and profits.The projects will cost $100m, with Orascom providing $40m and the rest coming from other investors, including the Sultanate of Oman and banks.LVMH said that a large number of other developments were being studied but it gave no timetable or pipeline for these.The group would not comment on whether the hotel that it has planned to open in its mothballed Samaritaine building in Paris alongside the river Seine, when the former department store reopens as a shopping centre with offices, would be a Cheval Blanc.The Oman hotel will be arranged as 32 private villas, of which the smallest will be 500 sq m, each with its own beach and swimming pool.In Egypt, the 40-suite hotel is be situated on an island in Aswan overlooking the Nile.
87;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-02-15T23:19:52Z;US stores cautious in spite of robust results;;"US retailers, including Walmart, will give a further reading of the state of US consumer confidence this week as they start the sector’s reporting of earnings for the important holiday quarter.Overall monthly sales have remained significantly below pre-crisis levels, but analysts on Wall Street are expecting the sector as a whole to benefit from holiday demand that was at the high end of most retailers’ expectations.Profit margins are also expected to have benefited from broad cost reduction efforts introduced by many retailers last year, and from reduced clearance of unsold merchandise, as they entered the season with inventory levels that had been significantly reduced.Other retailers reporting this week are Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer; Whole Foods Market, the natural and organic supermarket; Office Max, the office supplies retailer; and JC Penney, the department store operator.The comparatively positive mood has been reinforced by positive early guidance from Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, which said its fourth-quarter earnings would be “substantially higher” than a year ago, on better-than-expected sales of about $470m and an improved gross margin, reflecting reduced price markdowns.Macy’s, the department store, Gap, the clothing store and Kohl’s, the discount department store all raised earnings guidance earlier this month after announcing their January sales results.Branded clothing companies including Polo Ralph Lauren and VF Corp, which operate their own stores as well as supplying department stores and other retailers, have also been reporting comparatively robust results, again reflecting tightly managed inventory and cost-cutting.Polo Ralph Lauren as well as Estée Lauder have reported improved luxury and aspirational spending that is likely to boost performance at traditional department stores.But most retailers are expected to maintain their conservative view of the year ahead, with the National Retail Federation predicting a sales rise for the industry of about 2.5 per cent.Eric Wiseman, chief executive of VF, whose brands include Lee jeans and Nautica sportswear, said last week he expected retailers to continue to focus on managing existing inventory levels more efficiently, rather than restocking.“Everybody is working on speed and being more responsive in our inventory management,” he said.Michael Dart, a retail consultant at Kurt Salmon Associates, argues that the overall low growth prospect means retailers will now focus resources on initiatives to improve the top and bottom lines."
88;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US shoppers splash out on luxury items;;More prosperous American shoppers seem to be defying continuing high unemployment levels and economic uncertainty to renew their spending on luxuries such as jewellery, fashion and cosmetics.That is the picture emerging from the current round of US earnings and sales reports.Tracey Travis, chief financial officer of Polo Ralph Lauren, said last week that the fashion brand and retail company had “slowly begun to see the gradual return of our core luxury customer”, including buyers of couture dresses that sell for more than $4,000.Fabrizio Freda, chief executive of Estée Lauder, has said that sales of its beauty products at “prestige” stores – such as traditional department stores – had grown faster than at “mass” drugstores and discounters during November and December, reversing the trend seen earlier in the year.“We view this as a return of the aspirational consumer,” he said.Sales of cognac in the US had jumped 19 per cent by volume during the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year, according to BNIC, France’s trade association of cognac makers.Last week’s January sales figures from leading US chain stores reinforced the picture of growing readiness to spend, with Neiman Marcus, Saks, ­Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s – the top upmarket US department stores – reporting strong sales growth, albeit from the depressed levels of a year ago.Neiman Marcus, which operates about 43 luxury fashion stores serving the most affluent US consumers, said that its strongest categories included women’s couture clothing and precious jewellery.Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth retailer known for its $60 polo shirts, reported that comparable sales had risen 8 per cent, its first monthly increase for 20 months, in spite of teenage unemployment running at about 26 per cent.The evidence of greater readiness to spend comes in spite of continuing high unemployment, with about 20 per cent of the US population unemployed or working casually or part time.Richard Hastings, retail strategist at Global Hunter Securities, said that roughly half of the 80 per cent of Americans fully employed were not affected by the depressed housing market and were now more ready to spend as they had become less concerned about their own jobs.The strength in the January sales numbers “suggests that sufficient spending is coming from the least affected parts of the consumer universe”, he said.
89;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-02-04T18:59:39Z;US retailers boosted by strong January;;Spending by US shoppers continued to bounce back from last year’s post-crash lows, with retailers ranging from luxury department stores to teen fashion boutiques on Thursday reporting stronger sales in January.Retail Metrics said its index of chain retailers’ same-store sales figures rose 3.3 per cent, higher than the 2.4 per cent forecast, the fifth successive month of positive year-on-year sales growth shown by the index.Retailers including Gap, Kohl’s and Macy’s, saw their shares rise as they raised expectations for their fourth-quarter earnings.The monthly sales numbers offered further indications of returning demand for prestige and luxury goods, with Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion department stores, reporting increases of 6.8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, saw its comparable sales jump 14 per cent.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, highlighted a strong performance from its luxury Bloomingdales stores, as it reported a 3.4 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month and raised its earnings guidance.The performance of the prestige stores fits with recent comments from Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing brand company, and from Estée Lauder, the cosmetics maker, which have both reported stronger demand for their higher-priced products.The more mainstream retailers also enjoyed sales that were stronger than had been expected.Comparable sales at Kohl’s, the discount department store, rose 6.5 per cent, although Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said customers “remain conservative in their discretionary spending”.Kohl’s rival JC Penney reported a 4.6 per cent decline in comparable sales, but said this was better than the forecast decline of 5 to 8 per cent.Speciality clothing retailers also fared significantly better than last year, with Aéropostale’s same-store sales up 6 per cent, American Eagle up 10 per cent and Abercrombie & Fitch up 8 per cent.The Limited, which owns the Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales while Gap, the largest US speciality clothing seller, reported a 5 per cent gain, led by a 10 per cent increase at its low-cost Old Navy chain in the US and positive sales at its Gap and Banana Republic brands.Comparable sales at Target, the discounter, rose 0.5 per cent, lower than Wall Street had expected. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports its same-store sales on a monthly basis.January is traditionally a month of transition for retailers, as they dispose of excess holiday inventory and prepare to bring in the spring ranges.
90;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-02-03T21:56:34Z;Wall Street falls after disappointing results;;"Wall Street lingered in negative territory on Wednesday after disappointing company results gave investors an excuse to pause following the market’s strongest two-day rally this year.The benchmark S&P 500 finished 0.6 per cent at 1,097.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 10,270.55 but the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 2,190.91.US stocks fell almost 4 per cent in January on concerns over new banking regulations and the pace of economic growth in China. However, the S&P 500 index staged a recovery earlier this week on the back of positive manufacturing data, rising 2.7 per cent over Monday and Tuesday.But Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, weighed on the market on Wednesday, dropping 2.3 per cent to $18.62. The group missed quarterly estimates and also gave a disappointing outlook, citing the impact of a stronger dollar on its international sales.Walgreen, the retail pharmacy chain, fell 5.9 per cent to $34.62 after posting a surprise drop in January sales. Revenue from stores open for more than a year fell
1.1 per cent after analysts had expected a 2.2 per cent gain. The chain blamed falling prices for generic drugs and the fact that January 2010 had contained one weekday less than the previous year.Western Union showed the steepest decline on the S&P 500, losing 8.9 per cent to $17.17. The world’s largest money-transfer business reported a 6.6 per cent decline in quarterly profits and gave a pessimistic outlook for the coming year. It was the first time in five quarters that the company managed to only meet the consensus estimate rather than beat it.The series of corporate disappointments overshadowed the release of positive unemployment data. Private companies in the US last month cut jobs at the slowest rate in two years, according to the latest survey by ADP employer services.“Wall Street remains reticent to move ahead in the face of data suggesting only modest expansion,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Investors’ muted response conveys the perspective that every silver lining comes with a cloud attached. What the street wants to see is job creation and so a slower pace of lay-offs isn’t providing enough impetus at present.“Each positive earnings report seems to come complete with some sort of revenue or profit caveat,” he added.Polo Ralph Lauren posted better-than-expected quarterly profits but the fashion group missed its revenue forecast, sending the shares down 8.4 per cent to $78.51.The media industry was also in focus. AOL reported a decline in quarterly revenues due to continued weakness in the advertising market but the shares still climbed 2.4 per cent to $25.23 because the results were better than expected.AOL, which Time Warner spun off last December, also reported a profit compared with a loss in the previous year.Meanwhile, Time Warner swung to a quarterly profit and became the second media company to raise its dividend this week. But investors were quick to claim profits and the shares dropped 2.1 per cent to $27.90.After the market’s close on Tuesday, News Corp had also announced it would raise its dividend by 25 per cent after the media group’s quarterly results beat expectations.Improving demand for advertising and the success of its 3-D movie Avatar, which has brought in more than $2bn in ticket sales, allowed the group to increase its revenues by 10 per cent over the period. News Corp also sharply increased its full-year earnings guidance, helping to boost its shares 7.1 per cent to $13.67.Shares in Alcoa initially rose after UBS upgraded the country’s largest aluminium producer to “buy”. Analysts at the bank noted that the stock’s recent correction was overdone given the longer-term prospects for Chinese growth and re-stocking by US and European businesses. The shares were later down 1.1 per cent at $13.49.But McDonald’s gained 1.8 per cent to $65.21 as Goldman Sachs added the fast-food empire to their “conviction buy” list."
91;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2010-01-01T19:25:00Z;Fashion patriarch fronts a model of success;;"There is a ritual at the end of every Ralph Lauren fashion show. After the final model parade, Mr Lauren appears on the runway to take his bow, and his family – wife Ricky, sons David and Andrew, daughter Dylan, David’s girlfriend Lauren Bush, who used to model for the brand – rise to their feet in a standing ovation, followed by hugs and kisses.It is a rite of patriarchal devotion that has become as intrinsic to the brand as its polo player logo. Mr Lauren, 69, founded the company 42 years ago. It counts his brother Jerry as executive vice-president of men’s design, and his son David as senior vice-president of advertising, marketing and corporate communications; Ralph Lauren remains the largest shareholder.But he insists it is “not a family company. It’s a public company built on an individual vision. There are 41 people in the company who have been here 21 years or longer, and only one of those [Jerry Lauren] is actually a member of my family. I’ve had an outside president almost since I started.”This conscious balancing act between the image of overt family involvement and the insistence on active external management is one of the hallmarks of the Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. The group embraces the numerous Ralph Lauren lines, extending from high-end luxury to jeans and athletic wear and home wear, as well as the accessible Club Monaco, Chaps and American Living brands.Revenues for fiscal 2009 were $5bn, and the company has been one of the few fashion and luxury success stories during the recession.“They ended 2009 with a very strong balance sheet, with liquidity of about $1bn, and a very small debt,” says Dana Telsey, chief executive of the Telsey Advisory Group. Operating profit for the second quarter of last year was almost $250m.This has enabled the company to pursue an aggressive expansion strategy, taking direct ownership of its Japanese licences and opening an elaborate new flagship store in Paris in the spring. Almost 50 per cent of capital expenditure is now dedicated to international growth.“It’s the only fashion company I know managed like a Fortune 500 company,” says an industry source who has worked with many high-end fashion brands, including Ralph Lauren.William S. Susman, president of Financo, an investment bank dedicated to the retail sector, says it was Mr Lauren’s decision to “institutionalise” his company by taking it public in 1997, long before most family run European brands had even considered the idea, that set the tone for the management strategy.“He made it a global business with family members,” Mr Susman says.He believes it was a decision aimed at ensuring the brands’ legacy and continuity, and that it has largely succeeded. The strategy positions Mr Lauren, the company’s chairman and chief executive, as the guiding light of the company.His role is complemented by president and chief operating officer Roger Farah, 56, a highly respected fashion executive hired in 2000. Mr Farah functions as the merchant and corporate strategist. According to insiders, however, the classic corporate/creative divide that exists at many fashion companies – where the stereotype has the manager shielding the creativity of the designer from the distractions of finance – does not hold true at Ralph Lauren.“It’s not like Ralph is protected from business decisions,” says Candy Pratts Price, who served as the company’s vice-president and creative director in the late 1990s. “Ralph knows everything, and signs off on everything, from stationery to hedging strategies. This can be frustrating if you like decisions made very fast, but it also ensures consistency.”Mr Lauren calls his relationship with Mr Farah a “partnership”. The two men have offices next to each other, and talk, says Mr Lauren, “every day, including weekends”.Marie Driscoll, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s, characterises Mr Farah’s approach as “methodical and low-key”. Ms Pratts Price says: “Ralph is not a yeller. But ‘it’s not me’ is a line you hear a lot.”Mr Susman says: “If something were to happen to Ralph tomorrow, I think the perception is that the brand is so well run, the stock price wouldn’t go down.”This makes Mr Lauren a canny anomaly in the fashion world, where questions of succession have bedevilled brands such as Emanuel Ungaro, which has had a revolving door of designers and directors since its founder retired.However, Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdales, the department store, where Ralph Lauren’s multiple lines make it the biggest wholesaler represented in the store, calls Mr Lauren the “essence” of the brand.Mr Lauren is not unaware that outsiders believe his son is in line to succeed him, but he is quick to damp the rumours: “People ask if David will take over after me, but it’s far from the case at this time. It’s not a foregone plan.”"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 9,742.20 and the Nasdaq Composite, which led the previous session’s gains, edged 0.3 per cent down to 2,124.04.On Monday, Wall Street recorded its biggest daily gain for over a month after a series of merger deals boosted hopes of economic recovery.“After yesterday’s surge, that number [the consumer confidence reading] attracted some selling,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon. “But we’re at the end of the quarter and I suspect we’ll probably see the market continue its advance over the next few days.”Energy stocks dragged the market downward on Tuesday after oil prices sunk lower on a weak demand outlook. Chevron fell 1.1 per cent to $70.91 while ExxonMobil lost 0.8 per cent to $69.07.KBR, the engineering, construction and services company, gained 1.8 per cent to $23.32 after winning a contract to work on a gas project at Saudi’s Shaybah oilfield.Pharmaceuticals stocks also weighed on the Nasdaq. Repros Therapeutics dropped 13.9 per cent to 93 cents after the company said the Food and
Drug Administration requested additional data on the company’s lead drug, Proellexin, in order to resolve the clinical hold placed on it.Sequenom shocked the market by announcing that it had dismissed nearly its entire top management team as a result of a scandal involving the mishandling of data on its pre-natal Down’s syndrome test. Its shares dropped 39.2 per cent to $3.46.However, Astrotech, which owns and operates spacecraft pre-launch facilities, soared 157.5 per cent to $3.10 after saying it was considering options to boost shareholder value, including a possible sale of the company.At the same time, the Texas-based company posted a profit in the fourth quarter compared with a loss in the same period last year.Consumer stocks lifted the market from the opening bell. Walgreen, the US pharmacy chain, rose 9.2 per cent to $37.35 after the company’s quarterly results beat expectations.The company said profit had fallen, mainly due to weak sales of summer merchandise and the costs of refurbishing its stores.As part of a widescale restructuring plan, the retailer has also cut back on store openings and reduced its workforce but said the measures would take time to pay off.Some of Walgreen’s rivals also benefited from the optimism in the sector with CVS Caremark rising 3.4 per cent to $36.07.Citigroup gave a boost to carbonated soft drinks makers after saying the sector offered good opportunities for growth. Coca-Cola was rated “buy” in new coverage at the firm, which cited markedly better earnings growth in 2010. Its shares rose 0.3 per cent to $53.31.Dr Pepper Snapple Group was also rated “buy” and rose 2.9 per cent to $28.55.Polo Ralph Lauren gained 4.2 per cent to $77.38 after Goldman Sachs upgraded to “buy” and said it expected a near-term recovery to drive sales.Gannett, the largest US newspaper chain and publisher of USA Today, rose 17.6 per cent to $11.74 after forecasting third-quarter earnings above expectations.Lamar Advertising rose 6.6 per cent to $27.16 after Barclays Capital raised the billboard owner to “overweight” and raised its price estimate, saying the company had managed to contain costs."
93;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2009-09-14T10:55:16Z;John Lewis targets upmarket fashion market;;John Lewis is launching a push into upmarket fashion, taking on the likes of House of Fraser by focusing on designer labels.The employee-owned company, which is seen by many as a bellwether for the UK high street, is defying the trend of retailers moving into lower budget lines to attract cash-strapped customers, and focusing its fashion arm on more upmarket brands.Andy Street, chief executive of John Lewis, said: ”This is really crucial for us. We have an outstanding business in homewear but have underplayed our hand in fashion.”John Lewis will stock 30 new brands, and over 200 brands on its new website, which goes live on Monday. The new brands include Stella McCartney lingerie, Ralph Lauren and Orla Kiely accessories.“Our customers are more premium than those of Harrods or Harvey Nicks, and this reflects that,” said Peter Ruiz, the group’s head of fashion.The move is in contrast to the position being taken in its homeware department, where the company has launched a value range to compete with cheap non-food offers at supermarkets.But John Lewis believes there is still room to move upmarket in its fashion business, which has been the fastest growing area for the company during the recession.The company’s new Cardiff store, which is due to open on September 24, will be the first to stock the full line of new fashion brands. The shop floor for women’s wear will differ significantly from those in other John Lewis stores, offering wider spaces in which to shop, private areas with free fashion advisers and what Mr Ruiz describes as a “sense of theatre”.Tony Shiret, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “The clothing market is being squeezed in the middle, with some customers moving to discounters such as Primark and TK Maxx, so a move to extend the line at the upper end is a sensible idea.”The move will bring John Lewis into direct competition with House of Fraser, which was hit by the bankruptcy of Baugur, the Icelandic investment group which held a controlling stake in the company.“If you want to be really Machiavellian John Lewis might be putting itself in a position where it can take over stores from House of Fraser if it is forced to sell them,” said Mr Shiret.John Lewis may also be able to snap up market share from the gap in the market left by Principles, the fashion company that collapsed after its backer, Mosaic, was placed into administration by Kaupthing, the failed Icelandic bank.Online fashion sales have been growing even faster than the in-store business, however, and it is this arm of the group that will see a major overhaul, overseen by Robin Terrell, managing director of John Lewis Direct.Online fashion sales currently make up only a small proportion of total online sales, and John Lewis executives want to move it closer towards the 30 per cent seen in its physical stores, which would mean adding £70m in revenues.Analysts have been sceptical of the potential for growth in online fashion, saying many customers prefer to try on clothes before buying. But John Lewis executives think their offer to collect and refund any unwanted item after delivery will convince people to buy online.But they admit plans to deliver items in luxury boxes or with hanging materials may drive up prices. “Customers want value, but that does not necessarily mean low price,” said Mr Terrell. “They want to know when they will get it and when they do, it won’t be crumpled up and unwearable.”John Lewis will report its interim results on Thursday, with Waitrose, its supermarket business, expected to do well following the launch of its value range.
94;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2009-08-05T21:02:17Z;Banks buck wider Wall St retreat;;"US stocks declined on Wednesday but the benchmark S&P 500 index managed to stay above 1,000 as the market pared some of its early losses sparked by downbeat economic data.The ADP employment report suggested that private employers cut more jobs in July than expected, which weighed on markets at the start of trading.Equities then extended those losses following the release of figures showing output in the service sector in July was weaker than expected.The ADP report is considered an indication of the unemployment rate, which will be released on Friday, and investors focused on this more than the Challenger jobs report, which suggested fewer companies announced job cuts in July than a year ago.But positive words from UK bank Lloyds, which said that its loan impairments had peaked, along with figures showing mortgage applications rose more than 4 per cent last week, drove buying in US bank stocks even in the face of negative data.Citigroup rose 10.2 per cent to $3.58 while Bank of America rose 6.5 per cent to $16.66 and Wells Fargo gained 5.7 per cent to $28.02.After the closing bell, Cisco and News Corp released their quarterly earnings and both companies beat estimates.Industrial stocks were the significant drag, led lower by Quanta, the biggest US builder of powerlines, which missed earnings estimates after being hurt by continuing weakness in the energy sector. Its shares fell 1.2 per cent to $23.17.The S&P dropped 0.3 per cent to 1,002.72, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to close at 9,280.97.The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,993.05.“The economic news suggests that the economy is bottoming but the turn is going to be slow,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments.There were mixed signs on consumer activity as several blue-chip companies reported quarterly results. Shares in Whole Foods, the upmarket grocery chain, bounced 15.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company beat estimates for sales, profits and margins.Kraft also showed resilience in the food sector after the company, which counts Oreo cookies among its well-known brands, beat analysts’ expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook.But the shares slipped a fraction lower to $28.33
following a recent spike on the back of similarly good numbers from rivals General Mills and Kellogg’s.There were more negative signs on customer spending, however, from Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer group.The company’s revenues disappointed Wall Street and, even though earnings were slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations and the company maintained its full-year guidance, its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $53.91.Meanwhile, Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing company, rose 7.1 per cent to $68.31 after stronger sales and cheaper supply chain costs helped the company post stronger profits and margins than expected.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Electronic Arts saw its shares rise
following impressive results, fuelled by strong sales of The Sims 3 video-game and tight cost
controls.But the stock ultimately lost 6.8 per cent to $20.40, after John Riccitiello, chief executive, warned of continued weakness in the sector, saying orders from retailers remained low.Garmin jumped 23.8 per cent to $33.66 after the satellite navigation system maker beat its earnings estimates and significantly improved profit margins following steep cost cuts.Two of the best-known car rental companies found gains. Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 14.2 per cent to $20.02 after the company exceeded estimates, having successfully raised its prices and cut costs last year.Some industry analysts now predict the company could become a takeover target for a bigger rival.One of those rivals, Avis, announced a quarterly loss with rental volumes remaining low. But the shares closed up 5 per cent to $9.39 as the company said demand had begun to stabilise."
95;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2009-07-18T01:44:02Z;Dark clouds loom over summer sales;;The summer sales have come earlier and discounts are deeper and more widespread than last year as the high street attempts to recoup heavy losses in the recession.Price cuts of between 50 per cent and 75 per cent are commonplace as retailers struggle to tempt reluctant shoppers through their doors.But since some shopkeepers will be forced to raise prices this autumn to recoup a slew of higher costs, the current sales season could be the last chance to bag a bargain.“[It is] probably enjoy it while it lasts,” said Neil Saunders, consulting director at Verdict, the retail research group. “This may be the final fling for the consumer for hefty discounts.”Data from Ernst & Young, the professional services group, show that retailers this year launched sales on average more than 10 days earlier than last year.“The discounts seem to be a lot sharper …which I think is required because there has been a lot of pre-summer discount activity,” said Mr Saunders. “So therefore to make more of a spectacular sale, you have got to go a bit deeper.”For many retailers, sales signs have been a permanent fixture since Christmas.Late spring is typically when retailers avoid discounting, hoping summer ranges will be sufficient to lure shoppers inside. However, research by Verdict suggests one in 10 items of clothing were marked down in May, compared with only 2 per cent in the same month last year.Continuous mark-downs risk dampening the impact of the summer sales. “If you keep shouting ‘sale’ from the rooftops, it starts to lose its efficacy,” said Richard Hyman, strategic retail adviser to Deloitte.For now, shoppers seem to be responding. Since John Lewis launched its biannual clearance event, offering up to 50 per cent off selected goods, the department store has seen a welcome pick-up in sales.Weekly revenue has been down 4.2 per cent on average in the period since the beginning of its financial year in February. But in the second week of the clearance event to July 11, sales were only down 1.6 per cent.However, the trend for deep discounting may not have much longer to run. Retailers face higher costs at Christmas, with a VAT increase scheduled for the middle of this year’s winter sales period. Since many also pay dollars for goods from south-east Asia, a slumping pound has further raised their input costs.Although the pound has strengthened recently, this still leaves shopkeepers facing a 5-10 per cent cost hike, according to one retailer. Marks & Spencer – seen as a high street bellwether – has already warned of a probable 3 per cent increase in prices in the autumn.But one luxury goods retailer pointed out that orders for items to be sold this autumn and winter were placed after the economy deteriorated: “[Discounts] may be very significantly reduced on what we have previously seen. Everyone has bought inventory so much more prudently.”Guy Salter, deputy chairman of Walpole, which represents the UK luxury goods industry, said: “For the luxury sector, I would say that already we’ve seen – depending on your point of view – the best or the worst of the discounting.”The direction of consumer confidence remains unclear, however. Retailers will soon be approaching the anniversary of interest rate cuts, while unemployment remains a risk for many.Given the expected cost increases, and the uncertainty surrounding consumer confidence, Sir Philip Green, owner of the Top Shop and BHS chains, warned last week that the final three months of this year were the “ big unknown” for retailers.If demand takes another lurch downwards, retailers could find themselves having to slash prices once more. And as they will have paid more for their stock, the financial pain will be all the more severe.
96;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2009-06-12T15:04:30Z;Powerful new entrants burst into the world of luxury watchmaking;;"Forty-five watches is a high number to figure in a launch collection, but Swarovski displayed no fear with its presentation at the Baselworld trade fair earlier this year.The family owned company has 26,000 employees with operations in 120 countries, 1,300 stores and concessions, and sales in 2008 of €2.5bn ($3.5bn). Prices range from £333 to £1,080. Swarovski is a powerful new entrant in the watch field at a time when fresh names on dials are scarce.Aside from that of Ralph Lauren in Geneva in January, the biggest launch of a new watch brand this year so far has been that of Graff Luxury Watches. Laurence Graff chose to present this new chapter in his life – he is now 70 – in the historic Les Trois Rois Hotel on the banks of the Rhine in Basel. Like so many jewellers, he had long been contemplating an entry into the highest level of luxury watchmaking. Along the way, the company has produced a few diamond-set watches, but he resolved to orchestrate a collection of timepieces that actually resemble diamonds. In January 2008, he employed Michel Pitteloud, who was then in Geneva with Harry Winston, sometimes considered his rival in business.Asked why such a launch is taking place amid global financial difficulty, Mr Pitteloud replies: “We will only produce 900 watches this year. It’s a small output, and they are different …hard to compare with anybody else’s. Even in this crisis, our prices are not crazy; they are competitive.”The collection, in which models are priced between £15,000 and £250,000, and all in limited editions, makes clever use of its creator’s name. The initial men’s collection offers a ChronoGraff automatic sports watch, with a black dial, a handsome 45-mm case diameter, cased in three different golds, all mounted on a black rubber strap.Then there is the MasterGraff Tourbillon (of which only 30 will be made), again with an automatic movement and similar case and strap details, except that the bezel is set with 28.8 carats of diamonds The same applies to the Graffstar Classic Design, except that it is mounted on a crocodile strap. For the ladies, the collection comprises four models: Lady ChronoGraff Sports Watch, Lady Graffstar Classic Design, Lady Graff Superstar Classic Design and BabyGraff.Tiffany as a watch brand is not in the new launch category, but Baselworld in March was the occasion of the launch of the new Tiffany Watch Co, within the capacious bosom of the Swatch Group. Its new collection revisits some great Tiffany collections, such as Atlas Cocktail (retailing at up to £17,000) and the Tesoro (up to £20,000). They recall a breakfast time with Audrey Hepburn, but recollections should stretch right back to 1854 when Charles Tiffany and Antoine Norbert de Patek began a long manufacturing relationship in Geneva. It was Tiffany who made the watches for Patek Philippe.Over the years, many great family jewellery companies have turned to the watch sector for increased markets. Bulgari and Hermès are respected examples. Swarovski and Graff have arrived with great optimism, based on product quality, an eye on the collectors’ market and the stability of gemstone prices. Perhaps this is why Buccellati Watches was registered in Italy last month. So yet another family-owned and very long-established jewellery and high fashion concern can see future profits in the time of the day."
97;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2009-05-27T20:40:59Z;Wall Street falls as GM talks founder;;US stocks sold-off on Wednesday as Treasury yields jumped and investors reacted to latest data on the housing market and some disappointing corporate earnings forecasts.General Motors confirmed that bondholders rejected the carmaker’s offer to swap $27bn in debt for equityGM acknowledged it had failed to secure agreement from holders of $27bn in bonds for a contentious debt-for-equity offer and said its directors would meet “to discuss GM’s next steps”.The setback, which was widely expected, clears the way for the carmaker to seek bankruptcy protection on or before June 1, the deadline set by the US government for GM to meet conditions for future financial aid, including the debt exchange. GM shares were trading 20.1 per cent lower at $1.15.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 1.9 per cent to 893.06 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent lower at 1,731 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 8,300.02 points. The stock market responded in muted fashion as home resales rose by 2.9 per cent to an annual rate of 4.68m after falling by a revised 3.4 per cent in March, the National Association of Realtors said.In earnings news, bookseller Borders Group posted a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday. Its shares rose 1.2 per cent to $2.60. Polo Ralph Lauren’s earnings plunged 57 per cent for its fiscal fourth quarter as a result of $69m in write-downs and restructuring charges. Roger Farah, Polo Ralph Lauren chief financial officer, said the company expects economic uncertainty to continue throughout the new fiscal year. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $54.03.Monsanto shares fell 6.3 per cent to $79.88 after the world’s largest seed producer said 2009 earnings will be about $4.40 a share, the lowest point of its forecast range of $4.40-$4.50, because of stronger-than-expected competition in its herbicide business. This missed analyst expectations of $4.59 a share.In corporate news, SanDisk rallied 14.3 per cent to $15.52, making it the top gainer in the S&P 500. The move came after Samsung Electronics renewed a patent-licensing agreement with Sandisk, which makes flash memory chips.Stock market investors remain unsure about long-term prospects of a recovery, in spite of encouraging signs in recent weeks.A survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Wednesday found that more than 90 per cent of economists predict the US recession will end this year, although the recovery is likely to be bumpy. The survey is generally in line with the outlook from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his colleagues.About 74 per cent of the forecasters expect the recession – which started in December 2007 and is the longest since the second world war – to end in the third quarter of this year.The troubled financial sector remained in focus on Wednesday as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said higher trading revenues at big banks helped the industry earn a $7.6bn profit in the January-March period compared with a record loss of $36.9bn in the fourth quarter last year. The profit was 61 per cent below the $19.3bn earned in the same period last year and followed the first quarterly loss for the industry in 18 years.Shares in Bank of America fell 0.6 per cent to $10.91 after the company said it had generated $26bn in its recent capital-raising plan.PNC Financial Services, another stress-tested bank, said it had raised $600m in a common stock offering. Its shares fell 5 per cent to $41.11.Citigroup shares were 1.9 per cent lower at $3.70 as the head of its Asian operations ruled out selling the US group’s stakes in Chinese and Indian banks.Ajay Banga, chief executive of Citi in Asia-Pacific, told the Financial Times that the bank, which the US government rescued last year, also planned to expand lending across the region in spite of the “challenging” economic environment.The S&P Financials index fell 3.9 per cent. Wall Street stocks had staged a sharp recovery on Tuesday as figures showed that consumer confidence improved much more than expected in May. That erased early concerns about the impact of North Korean nuclear tests and a record fall in house prices.
98;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-05-28T22:15:16Z;Ralph Lauren aims for sales boost abroad;;Polo Ralph Lauren, the American fashion and luxury brands company, on Wednesday set itself a strategic target of doubling its sales in both Europe and Asia through new store openings and increasing its wholesale business.Roger Farah, chief operating officer, said on Wednesday that while the US currently accounts for 65 per cent of brand revenues “ultimately we’d like to have the US, Europe and Asia each representing one third of our revenue”.The growing importance of the Polo’s international business was highlighted by its fourth-quarter results, which were boosted by strong sales in Europe.Net income advanced 41 per cent to $103.5m, or $1 a share, more than double Wall Street’s consensus expectations, while revenues climbed 20 per cent to $1.24bn. Polo’s shares jumped over 10 per cent to $68.75 on the news.The company said that while sales in the US had been affected by the downturn in consumer demand, overall comparable year-on-year sales at its global network of around 300 luxury fashion stores had increased 6.8 per cent, excluding additional currency gains.Wholesale revenues jumped 25 per cent, following the US launch of Polo’s new American Living clothing and home furnishings brand at JC Penney’s mid-range department stores. American Living is the first brand to be created by Polo’s new Global Brand Groups, and covers product in 40 different categories. In spite of being launched amid the current consumer downturn, Mr Farah said the range was performing well, and indicated that Polo would also explore the possibilities of marketing its new brand in overseas markets.In the US, he also said that Polo had “seen a bit of stabilising of the business as we head into late spring and early summer …it gives us some sense that the fall, holiday business may have been a low point”.Internationally, he highlighted performance improvements in Japan, following a move last year to take full control of its operations there from its former licencees. Polo, he said, would take steps to “bring the Ralph Lauren brand more in line with the luxury status we enjoy in the rest of the world”.In Europe, the company will open two stores over the coming 12 months in Paris, including a new flagship store on Boulevard St Germain.
99;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-05-28T20:41:19Z;US stocks climb in volatile session;;Wall Street stocks climbed for a second session on Wednesday, after a stop-start day of trading that featured bad news from regional banks, a lurch in oil prices that boosted related stocks but trimmed advances elsewhere and a steady rally in materials.A drop in crude prices initially sent markets into positive territory, a trend reinforced by data showing an unexpected rise in orders for core durable goods in April.By mid-afternoon in New York, oil prices had made an abrupt U-turn, retracing earlier declines. This combined with a sell-off in financials to forestall the positive momentum - but only temporarily.A rally in materials stocks, which followed some commodity prices higher, helped kick the broader equity markets back into the black in late afternoon.By the end of the day, materials had added 2.8 per cent, breaking a four session loosing streak and powering to their biggest one day gains in a month.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,390.87, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.4 per cent at 12,594.03. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,486.70.On Tuesday, falling crude prices and some post-holiday cheer helped markets bounce back from their biggest weekly fall in three months. The momentum carried investors through another round of dismal housing statistics and a survey showing languishing consumer confidence.The consumer discretionary sector held onto narrow gains on Wednesday, adding 0.4 per cent thanks to decent results from American Eagle Outfitters and Polo Ralph Lauren.American Eagle shares, which have lost 36 per cent of their value over the last year, clawed back 8.1 per cent to $18.61.Polo Ralph Lauren surged 11.7 per cent to $69 after the clothing brand reported an unexpected increase in fourth-quarter profit, helped by its new line for JC Penney and sales in Europe.Expedia also made ground, advancing 4.7 per cent to $22.75 on speculation that chairman Barry Diller might attempt to take the internet travel agency private.Despite pockets of outperformance, the picture for retailers remains bleak. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, weekly chain store sales stalled last week as gasoline prices continued to drag on consumer spending.Investment banks were in the spotlight again on Wednesday after JPMorgan became the latest brokerage to cut its earnings estimates for the sector, citing Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley in particular.JPMorgan analysts argued that less effective hedges, slowing client activity and yet more write-offs would hurt results. The group advised investors to steer clear of the sector.The sector swung between gains and losses during the day before settling up 0.4 per cent. Lehman slipped 1 per cent to $36.84, hit also by suggestions it might need to raise more capital, while Goldman and Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $174.83 and 1.3 per cent to $42.77 respectively.AIG, the insurance group, was among the sector’s biggest fallers, dropping 4.7 per cent to $34.91 after a Citi analyst suggested it might need more capital on top of the $20.3bn it has raised.Regional commercial banks also came under pressure after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loans that are unlikely to be repaid.KeyCorp slumped 10.4 per cent to $19.66 and was followed down by Regions Financial and Huntington Bancshares, which dropped 5 per cent to $18.08 and 4.9 per cent to $9.04 respectively.Commercial banks, as measured by the KBW index, have lost over 12 per cent of their value since the start of the month and are down about 37 per cent since their highs in February 2007.Energy-sensitive stocks such as carmakers swung from profits to losses as energy prices rebounded above $130. Ford fell 0.3 per cent to $6.78 while General Motors lost 1.6 per cent to $17.15.The volte-face in oil prices also helped energy groups overturn early losses and snap a four-session losing streak. Chevron rose 0.8 per cent to $100.42, ConocoPhillips added 2.1 per cent to $92.56, while the sector as a whole rose 1.5 per cent.In materials, Ashland, Allegheny Technologies and Monsanto were among the leading gainers, advancing 5.2 per cent to $58.19, 5.1 per cent to $76.73 and 5.3 per cent to $125.32.
100;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-05-28T02:50:38Z;Japanese consumers: Shrinking concern for labels;;Guillaume Brochard knew he was right to bet on the Japanese market when the diamond-encrusted pandas sold out in a day.The five sparkling figurines – 6cm high and sporting 15 carats of diamonds and a €19,000 ($29,963) price tag – were made exclusively for sale in Japan by Qeelin, the Franco-Chinese jeweller founded five years ago by Mr Brochard and his Hong Kong-based designer, Dennis Chan.Its baubles – mostly pendants shaped like bears, bells and lotus roots – have been a hit in Japan, where they are available at a single boutique in Tokyo’s Roppongi district. One woman bought 27 smaller and (slightly) lower-priced panda pendants “to give out to friends”, Mr Brochard says.Qeelin does not advertise and came to Japan with next to no name recognition and none of the history or sales infrastructure enjoyed by big rivals such as Cartier and Bulgari. But that is less of a handicap than it would have been a few years ago, Mr Brochard says, particularly for producers targeting the top end of the market.“There is an elite of Japanese that is distancing itself from the traditional ‘mass luxury’,” he says. “They are now more eager to embrace true luxury, which means exclusivity.”Rich Japanese, in other words, are seeking out products that will be recognised and appreciated by their rich and cultivated friends, even if no one else knows who made them. That is a big shift in what has been a notoriously label-conscious market, and marks Japan out from its up-and-coming neighbour, China. “The Chinese haven’t reached this level yet,” Mr Brochard says. “They still like brands you can recognise from 100 metres.”Back in the 1980s, Japan led the world in the so-called democratisation of luxury, as middle-class consumers splurged on designer handbags and jewellery. But “lux-aholic behaviour” has waned, say researchers at the Japan Market Resource Network, a consultancy. Although many people drew down their savings to feed brand addictions through the 1990s economic slump, others decided that the mass-produced joys of Uniqlo and Muji suited them just fine. “Today it is socially acceptable to buy off-price or from discount stores,” JMRN says.As a result, sales of high-end brands have stagnated – pricey pandas notwithstanding. Antoine Belge, analyst at HSBC, says Japan is the world’s most mature market for luxury goods, and predicts that most brands will register “low single-digit” sales growth in the country “for the foreseeable future”.Yet the stakes remain high in a country that generates some 14 per cent of sales for European luxury companies (and more for the bigger names). Weak overall growth also hides gaps between winners and losers. The migration of demand to the high and low ends of the market has benefited “accessible luxury” brands such as Coach – which now has 147 locations amid double-digit sales growth – as well as ultra-exclusive labels such as Bottega Vaneta – a brand as pricey as it is logo-light.At the same time, “brands like Polo and Prada, which both have high levels of brand awareness and market penetration, are losing momentum,” says JMRN, as buyers feel “they are not worth their premium prices”.Big luxury groups are responding to market shifts by offering limited-edition goods even as they cash in at the lower end. Some established brands are also going incognito to increase exclusivity: Kanebo, the Japanese cosmetics maker, has generated its strongest domestic sales growth with its RMK and Suqqu lines, neither of which trade under the Kanebo brand.Many foreign brands are taking the opposite tack, boosting visibility with flashy new flagship stores, some of which offer more than clothes and jewels. At Armani’s 12-story, 6,000sq metre flagship store in Ginza, customers can spend Y65,000 ($627) for a three-hour spa treatment or dine on Japanese beef with celery root flan at the Armani Ristorante. Armani sank $20m into the new space last year, its biggest-ever investment in a single store.Such investments are designed to knit brands more tightly into their customers’ social lives. They also generate new revenue streams without diluting the value of luxury groups’ core offerings – a big risk with more conventional brand expansions.Looking ahead, luxury companies will have to deal with Japan’s shifting demographics – the number of working women aged 30-44 has increased by 15 per cent since 1997 and created a new class of high-earning female consumer. The country’s low birth rate, meanwhile, means the number of young first-time buyers will shrink.In another switch, many “Japanese” luxury buyers may not be Japanese at all, as tourists from China and even Russia increasingly pick up the slack from domestic consumers. “Wealthy Chinese travel to Japan to get things they can’t get in China,” says Richard Collase, head of Chanel in Japan.Chinese signs abound in department stores and some 10,000 retailers now accept debit cards issued by Chinese banks.Luxury shops have encouraged the trend by stocking items not available outside Japan – in part to avoid piracy but also because Japan serves as a test market for the region. “Japan is a showroom for the rest of Asia,” says Mr Collase.
101;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-04-28T20:57:45Z;Materials drag Wall Street down;;A three-day winning streak for US stocks came to an end on Monday as sagging materials stocks offset advances in the consumer staples and discretionary sectors, which were buoyed by news of a takeover and stakebuilding.Mars, the private confectionery group, said it would buy chewing gum group Wrigley for about $23bn in cash. Warren Buffett, the investment guru, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are financing the deal.The two companies combined would have a significant share of the global market, placing pressure on rivals such as Hershey to bulk up in order to compete.Wrigley shares rose 23.2 per cent to $76.91. Hershey added 4.6 per cent to $36.32.Shares in Ford added to their strong run last week, jumping 9.5 per cent to $8.21 after Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire activist investor, bought a 4.7 per cent stake in the company and said he planned to buy more.General Motors followed Ford higher, climbing 2.6 per cent to $21.94.Materials stocks lagged however, dragging down broader markets as traders took profits ahead of Wednesday’s interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve.Monsanto fell 2.8 per cent to $121.99 and Dow Chemicals slipped 1.7 per cent to $40.16.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,396.35 despite trading in positive territory for most of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 12,871.75 while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1 per cent to 2,424.40.Last week a late rally in financials helped equity markets to their first back-to-back weekly gains since February. But the sector was mixed on Monday and slipped back at the close as swingeing downgrades from Morgan Stanley took their toll. The brokerage slashed its 2008 profit forecasts for large banks by $17bn, saying it expected more capital raising and dividend cuts.Morgan Stanley itself fell 1.5 per cent to $49.91 while Ambac and MBIA advanced 7.8 per cent to $4.16 and 5.8 per cent to $10.41 respectively as investors covered short positions. An index of financial stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Microsoft was in focus again as investors awaited its next move in the battle for Yahoo. The software company’s ultimatum for Yahoo to accept its $42.5bn takeover offer or risk a proxy battle and a lower bid ran out on Saturday.Microsoft shares fell 2.8 per cent to $28.99 while Yahoo shares fell 1.4 per cent to $26.43.Telecoms companies were the strongest gainers in the S&P 500 last week, and they added to that run on Monday after Verizon Communications reported first quarter results in line with expectations.Verizon shares, which have lost 20 per cent of their value in the past six months, rose 2.5 per cent to $37.98. Peer Qwest Communications added 1 per cent to $4.95.Consumer discretionary stocks will come under scrutiny this week, as the first economic stimulus cheques begin to show up in taxpayers’ bank accounts.Economists expect the rebates to give a short-term boost to consumer spending, although many surveys show families intend to pay down debt with the money.Those funds will come too late to help RadioShack’s first quarter results. The consumer electronics retailer said both earnings and sales fell, knocking its shares 13.5 per cent to $15.13.Some of its peers fared better. An upgrade boosted Big Lots shares 3.8 per cent to $26.73, while Polo Ralph Lauren rose 2.3 per cent to $63.05.In other corporate news, Continental Airlines declined 1.5 per cent to $16.96 after the carrier said it would remain independent, despite weeks of speculation that it would merge with United Airlines.Conversely, US Airways surged 20.4 per cent to $8.62 after reports that it was in advanced talks with UAL. UAL fell 2.6 per cent to $14.81.This week marks the final peak of the 2008 first quarter earnings season as five Dow components and 125 S&P 500 companies release results. So far analysts have been pleasantly surprised.UBS analysts said: “First quarter non-financial earnings continue to come in better than expected . . . We do believe that the S&P 500 has improved its ability to weather cyclical risks in general owing to more foreign profits and strong balance sheets.”
102;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-04-20T20:51:50Z;Sector analysis: Asia and technology leading the way;;"The key trends in this year’s Brandz Top 100 rankings – the strength of leading technology and mobile communications brands, the power of innovation, the rise of Asian and especially Chinese brands – all emerge in this detailed look at 16 business categories.This year, insurance companies have been given their own category rather than being lumped in with other financial institutions. Some additional research in laundry care (fabric detergent and fabric softener/conditioner) and deodorants has covered some of the brands in the category. Spirits is an entirely new category and gives fresh insight into the performance of companies such as Diageo, which owns five of the Top 10 brands.The following is an edited version of the Brandz sectoral findings, with additional comments for the fastest-growing categories, and the two new ones, from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, director of the Brandz programme at MBO, and Anna Chen, associate director.Apparel• There is an increased link between sport and lifestyle, leading to a smaller distinction between sports and regular apparel brands – many consumers are wearing more sportswear, but not participating in more sports activities.• The sporting goods industry has benefited from global sporting events such as the World Cup and the forthcoming Beijing Olympics, which have placed the industry in the limelight. In China, rising disposable incomes and interest in western sporting events have created an opportunity for western sports brands.• Retailers are placing more focus on online channels as more and more consumers turn to e-retailing.Brand highlights: Ralph Lauren is seeking better control over its products to maintain its prestigious brand image, and has seen strong demand for its “collection” products.Esprit is the one brand from this category to feature in the overall list of top 20 risers. It has not deviated from its original aim, says Ms Chen – focusing on affordable, casual clothing that is not overly trendy and thus likely to fall out of fashion quickly. Esprit is also a relatively rare example of a global mass market brand, says Ms Seddon – while others such as Zara and H&M are still becoming global.Beer• In the west, smoking bans, shrinking core markets and a widening choice of alternative alcoholic beverages have conspired to stunt the growth of the beer market, although the 2006 World Cup and a spate of unusually hot weather have softened the blow.• Companies are increasing their focus on emerging markets.• Domestic beers in developed markets face stagnant volumes while imported premium brands see strong growth.• In the US, a preference for imported premium beers and for healthier options has boosted the “luxury imported light” category,with sales almost twice those of imported regular beers.• There has been consolidation in the brewing industry as companies seek to secure brands and national positions as well as broaden global footprints.Brand highlights: Skol’s results come from long-term brand renovation work and significant outreach to young men. The Stella Artois brand grew beyond the UK, with good results in North America and eastern Europe. For Beck’s, innovative products such as Beck’s Green Lemon have helped refresh the brand image and attract interest.Cars• The strong brands benefit from cool new designs, fuel efficient and green models in an environment where gas prices are rising.• Recent business conditions have been characterised by increases in crude oil and raw materials prices, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and structural changes in demand.• Development was influenced by dynamic growth in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, whereas the traditional car markets (US, Japan and western Europe) recorded zero or negative growth.Brand highlights: Porsche capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. Fiat’s revenues reached a record high, due to the success of the Punto, Panda, Bravo and light commercial vehicles.Coffee• The global coffee market has experienced slow but positive sales growth, leading to good results for most brands.• A big characteristic is innovation and movement towards quality/premium products.• Fair trade sales have significantly increased.• Nestlé and Kraft dominate instant coffees and the whole category as a result.• Consumers are turning to ground coffee and/or stopping consumption of instant coffee.Brand highlights: Nespresso has capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. The brand is leading the “premium” trend because it is positioned as almost a luxury coffee – sold only at top department stores and its own “boutiques”. So the product can be sold at a relatively high price.Fast Food• Consumers are returning to fast-food restaurants as efforts to revamp the industry’s image through healthier and better quality offerings pay off.• Growth in the number of outlets is forecast to slow down as operators focus on maximising sales from existing stores with later hours and increased menu variety.• Asia offers great opportunity for fast food operators to expand. Western fast-food brands hold an aspirational status and are regarded as a treat.• Coffee houses have reached a level of maturity in leading markets, which means that profits are substantial but not as large as early 2000.• Competition is also increasing as major retailers have or are developing their own-brand coffee shops.Brand highlights: The category was the fastest overall riser in the previous year’s rankings and is still doing well. McDonald’s and Burger King remain the sector’s “Yin and Yang” in terms of strategy, as Ms Seddon puts it, yet have both recorded big rises in brand value. Meanwhile KFC’s “new fast food” positioning in China has strengthened the brand’s No 1 position, far outstripping McDonald’s.Apart from Wendy’s, the one brand whose value declined, by 25.2 per cent, was Starbucks. This partly reflects the decline in the “business value” element of the calculation and the fact that the brand has fallen from its peak position.But MBO’s experts point out that Starbucks’ “brand contribution” is still rising and the brand remains fundamentally strong.Howard Schultz, the chairman and founder who this year returned to the post of chief executive, is given credit by Ms Seddon for realising early that the company, in its dash for growth, may be losing something essential to the brand – the “smell of fresh coffee in the stores”.Financial Institutions• Many US and British banks have been affected by the subprime crisis.• Chinese banks have had two big years but it is hard to tell how much of their performance is due to better management and how much to the exceptionally favourable economic conditions.• To maintain a competitive edge, banks need to both provide a service that clients perceive as being personalized and focus on a specific area rather than a wide range of functions.• Leading banks and financial services companies are making proactive attempts to be more “green”.Brand highlights: The impact of last summer’s credit squeeze can be seen in the declines or small rises in brand value for Citi, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, whereas Goldman Sachs, up 45 per cent, is benefiting from taking a contrarian line to its rivals. “They saw the credit crunch coming and actually bet against the subprime mortgage market,” says Ms Seddon.Citi’s 10 per cent decline in brand value has allowed Bank of America to claim top spot. Mr Walshe notes that 10 years ago, Bank of America hardly registered as a brand, but that acquisitions, rebranding and “shouting about what it is and where it stands in the marketplace”, have made a big impact.The inexorable rise of the Chinese banks is also charted by the Brandz rankings, with ICBC, China Construction Bank and Bank of China all achieving big rises in brand value. Standard Chartered Bank benefits from its presence in Asia. The increases would have been greater if MBO had not adjusted for the so-called “Shanghai bubble” on stock markets last year, which would have given an inflated overall view of the banks’ brand value.Insurance• Leading insurance companies are positioning themselves for a future that requires significant changes in the way they do business (unprecedented volatility, a changing customer base and exacting regulators).• New markets will help drive profits, as developed economies see slower growth in demand for insurance.• Insurers collectively spent $2bn last year on advertising, surpassing the beer, entertainment and soft drink industries.Brand highlights: The Aviva brand (a new entry) is not used in the UK, where it trades as Norwich Union. Net income increased 26 per cent with special help from the UK and the Netherlands, acquisitions and rapidly growing organic start-ups.Axa’s net income rose significantly, including the acquisition of Winterthur, the former insurance arm of Credit Suisse. Axa wants to address eroded confidence in the sector.Luxury• The global value of the market is around $400bn and it is tipped to grow to $2,000bn by 2010.• There are emerging consumers for “New Luxury” items, products and services that deliver higher levels of quality, taste, and aspiration than conventional ones.• Luxury brands prefer to use standard advertising and marketing formats as they have concerns that interruptive formats have a negative impact on their brand.• There is pressure even for luxury brands to be environmentally responsible. A report by WWF, the conservation organisation, criticised the luxury products industry as being “slow to recognise their responsibilities and opportunities”.• Recently luxury brands have been entering the leisure/construction industries, exporting lifestyle brands to hotels and apartments.Brand highlights: The solid rises in brand value, from an already high base, attest to the importance of innovation – and making a splash about it. “It’s about constantly coming up with something new and creating a buzz around the brands, and all these brands are very good at that,” says Ms Seddon. Consistent application of brand management principles has resulted in very similar brand value increases across the LVMH brands – Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy. Yet LVMH is a true “house of brands”, says Ms Seddon – each is managed separately and synergies are not exploited because this could have a long-term impact on the share price and the success of the brand. “It’s the opposite of some of the car companies, who make the same chassis for all their cars and just stick different top pieces on it,” she says. “There is no same car under different labels here. The employees stay within one brand, they don’t jump from one to another, so they live the principles of the brand.”Elsewhere, Gucci has branched away from the conservative approach typical of brands in this category through the creation of a strong online corporate identity, allowing it to stand out among competitors.Mobile Operators• Mobile phones are ubiquitous, so network operators are focused on getting customers to spend more.• The biggest influence on the growth of the market has been the advent of 3G technology, which enables facilities such as video calling and game downloads.• The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has led to price pressure.• As markets approach saturation point, providers are focusing on strengthening existing customer relationships. At the European level, competition is increasing because of the introduction of Europe-wide services.Brand highlights: Vodafone, Movistar and Orange are expanding globally from bases in smaller markets, while China Mobile has built a very strong brand in one huge market. “It’s a premium-priced brand, unlike its competitors, and it is not just big,” says Ms Seddon. “It is also very much being developed, positioned and marketed as a brand, as opposed to just a product or service.”O2, now part of Telefónica, is maintaining its brand personality, standing for solidity, globalisation and innovation while reinventing itself through marketing efforts such as sponsoring the England rugby team.MTS is the first Russian company to reach the BrandZ Top 100, coming in at 89th.Motor Fuel• Brands are globalising, as is shown by the expansion not only of the BP brand, but also the recent appearance of the Lukoil brand in retail petrol in the US and other markets.• Companies are trying to manage the difficult balancing act of promoting a “green” agenda and sustainability in a credible manner.• The strategic focus for the companies remains on upstream and refining activities – brand-building is at the bottom of the agenda.Brand highlights: PetroChina’s consolidated turnover increased 24.8 per cent and consolidated net profit rose 6.6 per cent.Personal Care• In all areas of the personal care market, products offering additional properties to simply cleaning have been booming (for example, skin-firming for face, whitening for teeth or curl-enhancing for hair).• As manufacturers have extended their offerings, brands have shifted consumer perceptions so that these products are now viewed as beauty products and not simply as toiletries.• A big trend in the sector is the rise of spa-influenced products, which command price premiums.Brand highlights: The sector has some very strong brands that continue to grow, says Mr Walshe. The biggest riser is Nivea. Innovation underlies the strength of the top brands, he says – but this may not necessarily be in the products themselves. “There’s a feeling of communications innovation, which gives you a sense of dynamism about the brand and why, therefore, it’s worth buying it and being seen to use it.”A further point is that brands with a “premium feel” to them, if not actually luxury brands, are doing well. Lancôme and Shiseido, which has expanded beyond Japan, are examples.Unlike in other categories, no strong indigenous brands have yet developed in emerging Asian markets, attesting to the international brands’ marketing and distribution clout and their recognisability.In deodorants, Axe is now the number one deodorant in the US, with strong double-digit growth. The “Axe effect” – giving men the edge in the dating game – underpins all the brand’s campaigns. Branding and marketing is very similar for Lynx, as the Unilever product is called in the UK, Ireland and Australia.Dove associated its deodorant with positive skincare credentials, and positioned it more as a beauty product than a functional one, which helped to increase penetration and achieve a double-digit increase in turnover.Retailing• The race to capture the green moral high ground has gone into overdrive.• Grocery retailers are moving into non-traditional business areas such as digital media services, marking a new position as providers of lifestyle products.• There has been significant growth in online retailing as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop. Many retailers have enhanced multi-channel offers to give a more flexible service.• In line with the trend towards healthy eating, retailers are increasingly displaying nutrition labels on products.Brand highlights: At Amazon, increased product offerings and new initiatives not only improved financial performance but also helped to refresh the brand with consumers.“There is one internet retail success story and this is it,” says Ms Seddon. “It’s about focusing on ease of use and involving the consumer.”They reach out to you by saying: “What books do you want to buy this week? We think you might be interested in this.” At Tesco, meanwhile, the introduction of more healthy foods boosted sales. Wider product choice and a flexible delivery system led to a 30 per cent increase in Tesco.com revenues as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop.At Home Depot in the US, the slowdown in the home improvement market resulted in a decrease of comparable store sales of 4.6 per cent; increasing labour and store costs also reduced profitability.Soft Drinks• The sector is struggling to sustain growth as an unhealthy image drives down consumption of soft drinks, while juices and water are claiming market share. Unsurprisingly, the low-calorie category is faring best.• The sector is dominated by a handful of superbrands and strong promotional support will ensure that the sector continues to grow, even if it is at a slower rate.• Events such as the football World Cup provided good opportunities for marketing, while the sector continues to embrace the web to reach a youthful audience, particularly in the form of websites for music downloading or video uploading.• The inclusion of bottling has boosted business value for all brands.Spirits• The European beverage sector is trading at a higher relative valuation than for more than a decade.• The US market continues to deliver growth in the premium segments.• Emerging markets are increasingly important to profitability and have shown accelerating sales.• Growth in the spirits market is coming from “premiumisation”. Many brands are trying to innovate and extend brands upwards.• Brands have faced greater advertising restrictions, especially around the issue of linking sex to alcohol and responsibility among younger drinkers.Brand highlights: The most valuable spirits brand, Hennessy, is not on the list as it is in the luxury category. Innovations include new flavours to add pizzazz to he big base brands, according to Ms Seddon. Bacardi is a good example with additional flavours to complement the core white rum.Elsewhere, Smirnoff relaunched its Smirnoff Black Label at the premium end of the market and emphasised its copper-pot distillation method.Johnnie Walker has harnessed tremendous growth as a result of price increases, additional investment, a focus on premiumisation and success in Latin America and Asia.Jack Daniels has been boosting market share through a super-premium offer recently redirected at younger drinkers, with a strong bias towards males.Technology• This is a rapidly evolving market driven by technological advancements available at a cheaper price. At the same time, the industry is experiencing a new wave, led by Apple, of sophisticated premium-priced products that command higher margins for design, functionality and trendiness.• The majority of brands have minimal product differentiation and are jostling for a position in the market.• Microsoft is still king in the software category.• The mobile handset category is still growing fast, especially in the Latin American and Asian markets as mobile phones become more affordable.• Apple’s iPhone is having a powerful impact.• After several years of moving at a healthy pace, the search engine industry seems to be sailing off in new directions.• There has been a recent surge of selling and buying of web businesses in which lofty sums are being paid.• The internet has become a principal medium for community, communication, and entertainment – three areas that have collided and are impacting each other’s growth.Brand highlights: Google, leading the Top 100 ranking again, continues to expand its business into different areas: it acquired Double- Click, a vibrant advertising business for banners, videos, and other so-called display ads, and launched an open operating system for mobile phones (free to use), called Android, promising “better, cheaper” mobile phones.BlackBerry and Apple had the biggest rises in brand value for the Top 100.Two other strong performers in the category were: IBM (up 64.8 per cent) which benefited from continued growth in emerging markets, improved cost competitiveness and utilisation levels, and ongoing productivity initiatives. And Siemens, up 61 per cent, had strong financial results throughout the year, powered by multiple acquisitions and strategic alliances. This year, however, has brought a shock €900m ($1,400bn) profit warning that it blamed on a contract cancellation, project delays and capacity issues.Nokia benefited from big year-on-year increases in sales in Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Two company acquisitions during 2007 and four in 2006 have improved process integration and quality, resulting in greater customer loyalty and profitability.According to Mr Walshe, Nokia’s relationship with its customers, already strong 10 years ago, has become even closer. The company’s 38.9 per cent rise in brand value reflects a resurgence after rivals stole a march on it in the clamshell phone market.But Mr Walshe says that “the relationship people have got with the Nokia brand is putting the company in a strong position, so if it ever got out of synch with the product cycle, as can sometimes happen with technology companies, it would be better placed to recover than others”.Bottled Water• While bottled water is thriving as a healthy alternative to carbonated soft drinks, a rise in the environmental consciousness of consumers has put the industry in the spotlight.• Commoditisation and a lack of brand and product differentiation have caused the ”brand contribution” to drop across the category.• Still water has continued to outsell sparkling, with flavoured variants from the big brands thriving.Brand highlights: Perrier has revived its exclusive image, and with its distinctive green bottle, is one of the most recognisable bottled water brands.Volvic, the top brand in the UK, is continuing its positioning as a water for the younger consumer with its “Volcanicity” campaign."
103;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-02-06T21:53:01Z;US stocks sell off amid recession fears;;US stocks extended this week’s sharp losses on Wednesday when a tentative rally fizzled out amid renewed concerns about the US economy sending the Nasdaq back into a bear market.Stocks retreated after Macy’s reported some disappointing sales figures and Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Charles Plosser warned inflation remained a concern. Trading was choppy throughout the session after heavy falls in Asian markets.Nervous traders sold technology stocks ahead of quarterly results from Cisco Systems, a bellwether for the sector, while energy stocks suffered as crude oil prices dropped. Investment banks also came under pressure amid concerns about their exposure to monoline bond insurers.The S&P 500 closed near its lows for the session, down 0.8 per cent at 1,326.45, having earlier rallied 1.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite gave up 1.3 per cent to 2,278.75, leaving the index more than 20 per cent below its October high, a “bear market “ in trader parlance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 12,200.10.Wednesday’s sell-off added to Tuesday’s sharp losses, which were triggered by a dire reading on the January ISM services index. The S&P has now fallen 4.9 per cent this week, erasing a good chunk of recent equity market gains.Some analysts said the selling was not really surprising because a rally in late January had been overdone. S&P 500 companies had risen an average 9 per cent with about 90 per cent of stocks climbing above their 10-day moving average, a potentially bearish indicator.Bespoke Investment Group said the S&P 500’s most shorted stocks – shares acquired on loan, then sold in the expectation they can later be bought back more cheaply – were the ones to rally most since equities hit a bottom on January 22.“The decile of stocks with the highest short interest was up a whopping 17.1 per cent from the bottom, while the decile of stocks with the lowest short interest was only up 5.3 per cent,” it said. “The most recent gains have come from large amounts of short covering.”Wednesday’s light economic calendar was led by a slowdown in US productivity growth. Still, a fourth quarter increase of 1.8 per cent was more than three times better than expected.In spite of Mr Plosser’s more hawkish comments on Wednesday, traders continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates aggressively. The futures market has fully priced in a 50 basis point cut, with a 32 per cent chance of a 75bp cut when the Fed meets in March.“If the US economy has fallen into recession, it seems likely to us that the Fed would cut the funds rate to 2 per cent, or conceivably 1 per cent, by the middle of the year,” said John Ryding, economist at Bear Stearns.Earnings news was led by Walt Disney, which posted a 26 per cent decline in profit from a year earlier when earnings benefited from a divestment. However, the results beat expectations as revenues jumped 9 per cent, and the stock rose 4.8 per cent to $31.50.Time Warner rose 2 per cent to $15.71 after the company said it plans to split AOL’s internet access and advertising businesses. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from $1.8bn to $1bn, again due to an unfavourable comparison, but adjusted earnings beat expectations.After the closing bell Cisco Systems, down 0.8 per cent at $23.08, reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.38bn, in line with estimates.Retailers opened higher after Polo Ralph Lauren’s quarterly net income far exceeded some analysts’ estimates prompting Its shares to climb 10 per cent to $63.19. However, the S&P retail index fell into negative territory after Macyâ€™s, down 4.6 per cent at $23.94, said same-store sales declined 7.1 per cent in January.Homebuilders were also in focus after Toll Brothers‘ chief executive said the company was “not yet seeing much light at the end of the tunnel”. Its shares fell 3.4 per cent to $21.13CME Group fell 17.6 per cent to $485.25 after the the Department of Justice called for clearing houses to be broken off from futures exchanges, posing a direct challenge to its business model and casting doubt on its proposed takeover of Nymex Holdings, which fell 17.6 per cent to $87.88.
104;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2008-01-14T22:07:21Z;Wall St rebounds on earnings hopes;;"US stocks rebounded on Monday after IBM surprised traders with better than expected results, boosting confidence at the start of big week for corporate earnings.Hopes for swingeing interest rate cuts, possibly before the Federal Reserve’s scheduled January policy meeting, also helped repair some of the new year losses.Energy companies and other commodity producers found buyers as crude prices rose and gold prices soared above $900. Retailers stayed under pressure after a profit warning at Sears compounded concerns about the health of the US consumer.The S&P 500 closed at 1,416.25 points, up 1.1 per cent; the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 2,478.30 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4 per cent to 12,778.15.IBM’s preliminary fourth-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent and revenues climbed 10 per cent, as overseas sales received a boost from the weak US dollar. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $102.93.IBM’s results spurred a broad-based rally with strong gains in the technology sector. Intel, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, rose 5 per cent to $23.08; Hewlett-Packardalso put on 5 per cent to $39.84.“In times of high uncertainty small pieces of information can have a disproportionate impact – markets tend to overreact both on the upside and the downside,” Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said.The tech sector has had particularly heavy selling in recent weeks, causing the Nasdaq to slide about 14 per cent from its October peak, amid worries that growth forecasts were too high.Echoing these concerns, Citi Investment Research lowered its view on the software and services sector on expectations of lower second-half demand. “It is not a big surprise that one of the industry’s key purchasers of software (the financial sector) is likely to be much more judicious with its dollars in the next year or so,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist.The fourth-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week with technology companies’ profits forecast by Thomson Financial to rise 22 per cent and energy and healthcare also expected to deliver good earnings growth.A 72 per cent slump in financial company profits is expected to drag average fourth-quarter earnings into the negative for a second successive quarter, averaging an 11.3 per cent decline for the S&P 500. Citi reports on Tuesday, with earnings from JPMorgan on Tuesday and Merrill Lynch on Thursday.Investors are preparing for more losses with Citi taking as much as $24bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and cutting up to 24,000 jobs, according to a CNBC report.Citi, up 1.8 per cent at $29.06, is seeking as much as $14bn from Chinese, Kuwaiti and public market investors to ease pressure on its balance sheet, while Merrill Lynch, 2.3 per cent higher at $55.97, is looking to raise about $4bn.Retailers faced continued pressure amid fears for the health of consumer spending. Department store operator Sears said fourth-quarter earnings came in far below Wall Street expectations due to higher mark-downs and falling same-store sales.Goldman Sachs advised investors to sell the shares, which fell 5 per cent to $91.38, and downgraded several retailers. Coach, the handbag chain, fell 4.2 per cent to $25.72 and Ralph Lauren, the fashion house, lost 4.3 per cent to $52.90 after Goldman cut its rating on the stocks from “buy” to “neutral”.Consumer companies slid last week after a cautious outlook at American Express and weaker earnings guidance at Tiffany, the jeweller, led to fears about wealthy consumers, previously considered more immune to a downturn.Agribusiness continued its buoyant form after Cargill said second-quarter earnings had jumped 44 per cent. Monsanto gained 5.5 per cent to $127.25 while Archer Daniels Midland put on 3.4 per cent to $45.14.General Mills, the cereal maker, rose 0.7 per cent to $56.54 after a JPMorgan analyst upgraded the shares.Transport stocks benefited from a brokerage upgrade after Bear Stearns raised the trucking sector from “market underweight” to “market weight”. Ryder System jumped 6.4 per cent to $46 and YRC Worldwide gained 7.1 per cent to $14.86.Healthcare stocks ended five days of gains. Schering-Plough reported disappointing results from a cholesterol drug study and shares fell 8 per cent to $25.52."
105;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Sears shares fall as holiday sales disappoint;;Sears Holdings, the third largest US retailer, on Monday saw its shares hit their lowest level since the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart on a disappointing holiday sales report and gloomy earnings guidance.The retailer, controlled by hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert, blamed “increased competition and the negative impact of unfavourable economic conditions” for a 3.5 per cent decline in comparable sales during November and December.It said steep discounting had reduced its gross margins 200 basis points for the nine-week holiday period.As a result it said it expects earnings of $2.59- $3.48 a share for its fourth quarter, down from $5.33 a share a year earlier, and well below analysts’ forecasts.Since the $11bn merger, Mr Lampert’s management team has struggled to improve the performance of both Sears and Kmart, after arguing initially that their falling comparable sales would eventually be offset by improved profit margins.Shares in the merged company rose to a peak of $195 in March last year, supported by speculation that Mr Lampert would either use Sears cash to deliver a transfomative deal, or sell off additional real estate assets. Its shares on Monday fell below $90 for the first time since the merger, when they were priced at about $125.Mr Lampert in November accused media and financial commentators of ignoring “the strength of our company and the progress that we have made” since the merger.He also dismissed criticisms that his team had not been reinvesting in the store network, saying it had spent more than $1bn on the stores “over the past several years”.But it has also continued to use cash to repurchase shares, saying on Monday that it had spent $513m to acquire 4.9m shares at $105 per share over the past 10 weeks. It spent $900m on share buybacks in the third quarter, paying about $131 per share.Goldman Sachs’ retail analysts on Monday issued a downgrade of Sears’ shares from “neutral” to “sell”, which was planned before the latest disappointing sales news. “We expect share loss to accelerate and margin shortfalls to intensify over the next several quarters,” Goldman said.The downgrade was part of a review of the retail sector, which saw Goldman cut its earnings guidance for 2008 by 12 per cent. It also downgraded Coach and Ralph Lauren from buy to neutral, citing what it called “growing cracks across aspirational and high end” spending.Tiffany, the jeweller, has lowered its quarterly earnings forecast after disappointing holiday sales in the US. The National Retail Federation on Monday predicted US retail sales would slow to 3.5 per cent this year, the slowest growth since 2002.
106;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2006-07-24T21:26:15Z;Wall Street gains on earnings and deal news;;Wall Street closed sharply higher on Monday in a broad-based rally, buoyed by news of takeover deals and better than expected results at the start of another busy week for the earnings season.Hospital operator HCA rose on news that it had agreed to be bought out by a private equity consortium in a deal worth about $33bn. The deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history.Shares in HCA, which reported a sharp fall in second-quarter earnings, gained 3.4 per cent to $49.48.Other stocks in the healthcare sector were also higher. Schering Plough gained 5.7 per cent to $20.55 after swinging into profit in the second quarter and beating Wall Street estimates with sales growth of 11 per cent.Drugmaker Merck bounced back, adding 4.3 per cent to $38.95 after it raised its 2006 outlook and reported that profit nearly doubled in the second quarter.Pfizer also pushed higher, adding 4 per cent to $24.79.ATI Technologies, maker of graphics chips, leapt 18.8 per cent to $19.67 after an announcement that it would be bought by Advanced Micro Devices in a deal worth $5.4bn. AMD fell 4.8 per cent to $17.39.Nvidia, the main competitor of ATI Technologies, rose 10.1 per cent to $19.56, mitigating some of the 44 per cent drop it had suffered since the beginning of May.Crude prices ticked higher amid continuing violence in Israel and Lebanon. ConocoPhillips climbed 3.4 per cent to $65.78, and Marathon Oil rose 4.3 per cent to $87.78.By the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.7 per cent, or 20.62 points, at 1,260.91, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.1 per cent, or 41.45 points, at 2,061.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent, or 182.67 points, at 11,051.05.Henry McVey, chief US investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, raised his forecast for 2006 earnings per share growth to 11.4 per cent but cut his 2006 forecast for the S&P 500 from 1,400 to 1,350.“The swing factors for the 2006 increase include upward revisions to energy and materials, though these are offset partially by a deterioration in our outlook for the housing-sensitive consumer durables [shares],” he said.But the changing outlook for interest rates led to the downward revision in Mr McVey’s forecast for the S&P 500. “We under-estimated how high short-term and long-term interest rates would go . . . and we underestimated the underlying inflation outlook,” he said.Fashion label Polo Ralph Lauren rose 15.7 per cent to $55.40 after it raised its fiscal first-quarter forecast for revenue and operating margins on strong sales.American Express added only 0.1 per cent to $50.66 in spite of reporting a 13 per cent rise in second-quarter profit. Investors had not been expecting a charge related to the company’s rewards program.
107;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2006-04-26T20:24:28Z;Jones Apparel beats expectations;;Jones Apparel Group, which last month put itself up for sale, on Wednesday said first quarter profit dropped 70 per cent on the sale of the Polo Jeans business.In April, Jones sold the Polo Jeans licence back to Polo Ralph Lauren and said it would use the proceeds to explore strategic options, including acquisitions and share repurchases.Excluding the sales of the jeans business and other items, earnings beat expectations, sending its shares up 2.6 per cent to $34.94 in late morning trade.Jones, which is in the midst of a corporate restructuring, owns brands such as Jones New York and Anne Klein and operates retailers Nine West and Barneys New York.First round bidding for the $5bn company is drawing to a close with lead contenders said to be private equity players, including Cerberus Capital Management, Bain Capital and Texas Pacific Group, Women’s Wear Daily reported.Net income fell to $25.8m, or 22 cents a share, from $87m, or 71 cents a share, a year ago. Stripping out the loss from the sale of the Polo Jeans business, severance costs and a change in accounting methods, adjusted earnings per share were 66 cents. On that basis, the company beat analysts’ expectations of 53 cents a share.Net sales slipped to $1.2bn from $1.34 a year ago.Sales from stores open at least a year - a key measure of a retailer’s performance known as same-store sales - rose 0.9 per cent at Jones’ footwear and read-to-wear stores and 6.6 per cent at Barneys, its luxury retailer.
108;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2006-03-21T21:47:05Z;Jones Apparel ponders sale;;"Jones Apparel Group, which owns brands such as Jones New York and Anne Klein and operates retailers Nine West and Barneys New York, yesterday said it was exploring a sale of the company.Its shares closed up over 13 per cent at $34.84.Speculation of a sale had intensified after published reports that the company was considering a sale of the entire company as well as just the Nine West business. In a statement, Jones said that “contrary to recent press reports” it was not considering the “divestiture of any of its businesses or divisions”.Jones, which is in the midst of a corporate restructuring, has seen profit fall for two consecutive years.It faces a decline in sales as its biggest customer, Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, has reduced orders from clothing makers as it combines with May Department Stores and launches its own-label brands.Jones generated $5.1bn in sales last year and has a market capitalisation of $4bn.Over the past several years it has acquired a number of brands, and
clothing and footwear licences in an effort to diversify its portfolio.In 2004, Jones made a surprise foray into the luxury market with its purchase of Barneys New York, the retailer, for about $400m. The move gave the company exposure to the fast-growing luxury segment and has helped boost earnings.In January, Jones said fourth-quarter profit rose 63 per cent, helped in part by strong sales at its Barneys chain.Last month, Jones sold the Polo Jeans licence back to Polo Ralph Lauren and said it would use the proceeds to explore strategic options, including acquisitions and share repurchases.Jones has hired Goldman Sachs as financial adviser."
109;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2005-11-22T22:48:48Z;Ralph Lauren in talks over Safilo licence;;Ralph Lauren is considering pulling the lucrative licence to make eyewear under its name from Safilo, the Italian company preparing one of Europe’s biggest public offerings this year.The US fashion house is holding talks with both Safilo, with which it has a contract until the end of next year, and Luxottica, the other Italian group that makes many of the world’s most coveted sunglasses under licence.The two companies dominate the global market for expensive eyewear and fight over almost every deal. Luxottica was dealt a big blow when it lost its Armani licence to Safilo in 2003. The Ralph Lauren negotiations come at a very sensitive time for Safilo, however.The Padua-based company started the roadshow related to its IPO this week. Its offer documents state Safilo made 55 per cent of its 2004 sales of about €1bn ($1.17bn) from just four licences: Armani, Dior, Gucci and Ralph Lauren. Analysts estimate that the Ralph Lauren sales accounted for about €100m, or 10 per cent of the total.Safilo’s managers, who are in London on the IPO roadshow today, have expressed confidence that there will be a successful extension of their 15-year relationship with Ralph Lauren.Industry experts say it is normal for a licensor to hold talks with more than one company as its contract comes up for renewal. People close to the negotiations said Luxottica had recently been pushing for exclusivity in the talks. A final decision on the licence is expected early next year.Safilo this week pointed to the joint development of a Ralph Lauren eyewear store on Madison Avenue in New York as a sign of the two companies’ good relationship. The store opens on Friday. Safilo’s design team is working on next year’s Ralph Lauren collection, and there are plans to open stores in Moscow and Tokyo.Luxottica would not comment on Tuesday, while Safilo would not add anything to its roadshow statements. Ralph Lauren said: “We have no information at this time on this matter.”Safilo’s offering of new shares and most of CSFB’s large holding in the company should take place next month and will be worth €670m-€1.1bn. The company will raise €300m-€450m from the transaction. The offer is being co-ordinated by Merrill Lynch, SanPaolo IMI and UniCredito.Additional reporting by Vanessa Friedman in London.
110;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2005-11-04T20:09:14Z;Solo stores lift Ralph Lauren;;Polo Ralph Lauren, the luxury retailer, on Friday underscored a growth strategy driven by new brands and selling through its own boutiques not department stores, as it said quarterly net income rose 31 per cent.The company has expanded the number of its standalone stores, which are highly profitable because they sell more full-priced premium merchandise than department stores.The stores “create an environment to purchase more luxury,” said a Polo Ralph Lauren spokesperson.Polo Ralph Lauren’s retail strategy comes as consolidation of large department stores such as Federated and May leaves fewer outlets and hurt demand at rival clothing retailers.Liz Claiborne, the US fashion group, last week cut forecasts for the fourth quarter and next year after reporting a 2 per cent rise in quarterly earnings.Polo Ralph Lauren has also launched new brands and is strengthening its accessories business. It this July bought Ralph Lauren Footwear, the company’s worldwide footwear licensee, for $110m.Ralph Lauren, chief executive, said: “Our focus on building new brands, such as Rugby and luxury accessories, expanding our retail and extending our international business has proven to be the right investment for our company.”Net income for the second quarter reached $104m, or 97 cents per diluted share, compared with $79m, or 77 cents per diluted share, last year.Quarterly net revenues increased 15 per cent to $1.027bn compared to $896m last year. Operating income increased 45 per cent to $177m versus $122m last year.Retail sales in the first half of fiscal year 2006 increased 16 per cent to $745m. Total company comparable-store sales increased 6.7 per cent. Retail operating margins improved 330 basis points to 10.1 per cent in the first half.Wholesale sales in the first half of fiscal-year 2006 increased 23 per cent to $915m. Wholesale operating income in the first half was $189m compared to $97m last year.
111;RL;Ralph Lauren Corp;2005-02-02T17:34:28Z;Hilfiger tumbles while Ralph Lauren soars;;The fortunes of two US fashion brands diverged on Wednesday as Tommy Hilfiger's pre-tax profit tumbled while rival Polo Ralph Lauren said its net income had more than doubled.Hilfiger, under investigation by federal prosecutors on tax-related matters, said it would delay the release of net income and earnings per share figures for the third quarter of 2004 “pending the completion” of an internal review related to the government probe.Pre-tax income fell by 59 per cent to $12.6m from $30.4m a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned pre-tax income of $19.9m compared with $33.6m. Revenues fell by 5 per cent to $427.9m from $450.6m a year earlier.“Our results continue to reflect a challenging US department store environment, as well as higherthan expected promotional activity during the falland holiday seasons,” said David Dyer, president and chief executive.The company is working to revive the brand's image after consumers tired of its once iconic “All-American” red, white and blue look.Last March it launchedthe higher-end “H Hilfiger” collection.But on Wednesday, Hilfiger said that starting with autumn 2005 deliveries it would no longer distribute its H collections to US department stores, but would start a transition to a new specialty store concept that it planned to develop.This would result in special charges of $12m to $15m in the fourth quarter.The company also plans to re-introduce its Tommy Hilfiger Crest collectionsfor men and women in an attempt to “more effectively address” department store consumers' needs for dressier, casual attire.Last month the company announced plans to streamline its struggling US wholesale business, including cutting about 200 jobs and closing its young men's jeans division.Separately, Polo Ralph Lauren said that third-quarter net income roseto $74.8m, or 72 cents a share, from $35.4m, or 35 cents a year earlier, matching analysts' estimates.Revenues rose by 38 per cent to $888m from $645.4m a year earlier.
