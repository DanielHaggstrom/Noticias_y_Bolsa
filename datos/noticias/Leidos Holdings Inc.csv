Other principal US exports to China include soyabeans, cars, computer chips and industrial machinery.Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek, a New York-based research group, said: “If someone wants to make a political statement, the single easiest way to have an impact on the US stock market is to cancel a Boeing order.”At the market close, Boeing’s shares were down 5.2 per cent, and Caterpillar’s had fallen 5.7 per cent. Shares in Arconic, which makes aerospace components, fell 6.1 per cent.Boeing and Caterpillar declined to comment on Mr Trump’s plans.Business groups, however, were outspoken in their criticism. Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, welcomed Mr Trump’s focus on China’s theft of US intellectual property, but added that tariffs were “likely to create new challenges in the form of significant added costs for manufacturers and American consumers”, as well as potentially provoking retaliation.The only lasting solution would be a “fair, binding and enforceable trade agreement with China that requires them to end these practices once and for all,” he added.One of the strongest responses to the plans came from the National Retail Federation, which said the tariffs would “punish ordinary Americans for China’s violations”.Matthew Shay, the NRF’s president, added that middle- and working-class Americans were “just starting to see the benefits of tax reform in the form of bigger paycheques and higher wages”, and a trade war would “erase those gains and result in higher prices for a wide range of consumer products and basic household goods.”There were also strong words from an agricultural industry group called Farmers for Free Trade. Brian Kuehl, the group’s executive director, said the tariffs would “put a target on American farmers’ backs”.He added: “Given that China is the second-largest export market for American farmers and ranchers, the pain from retaliation could be significant.”The Information Technology Industry Council warned that the tariffs would “cause harm to US workers, businesses, and economic growth”.On Monday, the group led a group of 46 US industry and trade associations in making a last-ditch appeal to Mr Trump, writing a letter warning that “the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the US economy”. The business groups said the tariffs would provoke retaliation, stifle US exports, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.One of a few companies not joining the denunciations was Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor. Marillyn Hewson, chief executive of Lockheed, said at the ceremony that “we very much welcome this action.”The company in a statement praised the administration’s “focus on the critical need to protect US defence and aerospace industry intellectual property.”Roger Krone, chief executive of Leidos, an IT company that does work for the US government, praised the administration for “taking tangible steps to not only protect US companies in the marketplace, but also to protect billions of dollars of research and development that can make the difference on the battlefield”.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock and Patti Waldmeir
1;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2017-10-24T12:58:45Z;Lockheed Martin slips after quarterly results miss Wall St estimates;;Lockheed Martin on Tuesday lifted its full-year earnings outlook but posted disappointing third quarter results, sending shares in the world’s largest defense contractor lower in pre-market trade.The Maryland-based company said it now expects to earn between $12.85 to $13.15 for the full year, up from its previous projection for earnings between $12.30 to $12.60 a share. The company also boosted its net sales outlook to between $50bn to $51.2bn aided by a $200m property gain, up from $49.8bn to $51bn.Lockeed said that it is adopting new accounting standards that are reducing net sales by 2 per cent next year. Factoring that in, the maker of F-35 jets said it expects sales to rise 2 per cent in 2018, that was shy of the 2.9 per cent increase that Wall Street had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters data.Net earnings fell to $939m or $3.24 a share in the third quarter, compared with $2.4bn or $7.93 a share in the year ago period when results were lifted by a one-off gain from its move to merge its information systems business with Leidos Holdings. However, quarterly EPS also missed Wall Street expectations of $3.27, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Net sales rose 5.3 per cent to $12.17bn, shy of the $12.8bn that analysts had been looking for.Shares dropped 1.5 per cent in pre-market trading to $316.35. They have risen 28 per cent so far this year as of Monday’s close.

According to the SAIC, “problems like the quality of goods purchased online and false advertising were rather glaring,” with complaints chiefly centred on issues including:Substandard quality of goods, counterfeit products, fake promotional offers, refusal to follow through on “seven-day returns with no questions asked” as offered, discrepancies between real goods and those advertised, leaking of customers’ personal information, delayed shipments, slow deliveries and goods being damaged in transit.The administration partly attributed the rise in complaints to growing awareness of consumer rights and improved ability to file complaints online.But it added that the complaints also reflected “a storm of certain real issues” that had arisen during the development of online markets and which “require attention from regulatory authorities at every level.”

Earnings per share rose 6.7 per cent to $3.01.The sale of the IS&GS business follows a strategic review announced by Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, last July. That came as the company revealed it had reached an agreement to purchase the Sikorsky helicopter business from United Technologies for $9bn.Lockheed launched the IS&GS review partly to reduce overall debt in the wake of the Sikorsky purchase.The company planned to undertake the transaction through a tax-efficient vehicle known as a Reverse Morris Trust, it said. It would use the $1.8bn cash proceeds to pay down debt, pay dividends or buy back shares.Military contractors’ IT and services businesses have fared particularly badly amid the slowdown in US government military spending. The big contractors’ flagship programmes — including Lockheed’s F-35 joint strike fighter — have largely been protected.Ms Hewson said the sale was an “important milestone” in the company’s “portfolio reshaping” strategy. She added: “The combination of our proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a new leader in the government IT sector with a diversified portfolio, greater scale and improved efficiency.”Roger Krone, Leidos’s chief executive, said the combined company would have the scale and access to markets that would enable it to grow further. “The new company will be better able to offer cost-effective solutions to our customers,” he said.Shares in Lockheed, the world’s biggest military contractor, fell 0.5 per cent to $209.93 by close of markets in New York.

In August, a replica Goldman Sachs was found to be operating in Shenzhen, a manufacturing boomtown right on the doorstep of Hong Kong.But Disney did manage to secure backing from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which regulates the consumer goods trade. Last month the SAIC promised a “special operation” complete with emergency teams to help protect Disney trademarks and actively monitor online sellers for fakes.The enhanced crackdown comes before the US media group opens its first theme park in mainland China in spring.The five hotels have been fined by the city’s business regulator, which found the lodgings had used the Disney trademark on signs and promotional materials, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday.“The hotels not only infringed trademark rights but are also suspected of unfair competition,” the article quoted the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce as saying.The hotels, all owned by the privately owned Shenzhen Vienna Hotels Group, were hit with a combined penalty of more than $15,000, the report said.Calls to the lodgings in the city’s Pudong district went unanswered. An automatic ringtone identified one of the premises as the Vienna Shanghai Disney.Disney is developing a long-awaited $5.5bn theme park in Shanghai with state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. The park was originally expected to open before the year’s end, although delays have pushed back the official date until spring next year.The company opened its largest store in the city in May, as it looks to tap into China’s fast growing market.Among other multinationals battling counterfeiters, Apple has had its work cut out: counterfeit stores, complete with blue t-shirted staff and knock-off Genius Bars that could fool even the most eagle-eyed observer, have been a feature of the commercial landscape in China for years.Additional reporting by Ma Fangjing

More than 40 per cent of goods sold online in the country last year were either counterfeit or poor quality, the official Xinhua news agency said this week, quoting an SAIC study. The report added that customer complaints about online orders hit 77,800 last year, a jump of 357 per cent against 2013.The American Apparel and Footwear Association asked the USTR to reinstate Alibaba’s website Taobao on its “notorious markets” list of marketplaces that reportedly engage in piracy and counterfeiting.Taobao was put on the list in 2011 but removed in 2012 after it made efforts to address the problems of counterfeiting.Juanita Duggan, President of AAFA, said “the company’s unwillingness to make serious reforms” was the main reason for seeking to reinstate it.Disney is developing the $5.5bn theme park in Shanghai with China’s state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. It opened its largest store in the city in May, as it looks to tap into China’s fast-growing film market.
7;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2015-07-28T16:11:17Z;China: unintended consequences;Shares have fallen again. They were not supposed to;"This was not supposed to happen. Everything was supposed to be calmer by now. After a hairy week or two earlier this month, the Chinese government’s efforts to settle the country’s stock markets were intended to produce a more serene environment. But on Monday China’s indices had one of their biggest ever one-day falls. On Tuesday they struggled to stay flat after opening sharply down again.That is not for want of trying on the part of the Chinese authorities. They have deployed well-tested measures, as well as some made in China. Selling pressure, and supply, have been stemmed by bans on sales by large shareholders, cancellation of initial public offerings and suspension of shares from trading. Buying has been augmented by government funds. To ensure a healthier market, margin financing has been reined in. None of this has worked. Investors are clearly still twitchy despite China’s protestations that it will stand behind markets.They may have good reason. Even after all the recent share price falls, Shanghai and Shenzhen have returned 71 and 86 per cent over 12 months, respectively, leaving ample room for profit-taking. The Shanghai Composite index trades at 19 times historical earnings, which is not cheap enough to attract bargain hunters.And China’s economic slowdown is real. This week, the Caixin purchasing managers’ index hit a 15-month low — although, given the index’s bias towards traditional manufacturing industries, it may omit much of the modern economy. Still, multinational companies are feeling the impact: from the UK’s Burberry to United Technologies of the US, recent results have been dragged down by China.Yet despite the near-term concerns, China’s appeal to corporate investors does not seem to have dimmed. This week, General Motors said it would spearhead its strategy into emerging markets with Chinese partner SAIC; and Delta Air Lines said it would buy 4 per cent of China Eastern Airlines. The stock markets may be subject to the volatility that comes with youth but longer-term potential for growth remains intact."
8;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2015-07-13T02:32:32Z;Foreign car brands on top in China, despite SUV surge;Western brands still rule but domestic brands gain traction, especially in SUV market;"At first glance, foreign car companies seemingly exert a near stranglehold on China’s car market. However, the reality is rather more complex, with most sales derived from Sino-foreign joint-ventures (JVs), thereby benefiting domestic and foreign automakers. In addition, both foreign and domestic-foreign JVs are facing more competition from domestic brands that are consolidating their share of the fast-growing SUV market in particular.According to our 1Q15 Consumer Brands Survey of sophisticated urban consumers, 86.5 per cent of prospective buyers plan to purchase a foreign-brand car in the coming 12 months. While this was down 1.1 percentage points year-on-year, it nevertheless points to the dominance of foreign car brands over their domestic counterparts. However, foreign automakers are not the sole beneficiaries of this trend, with joint ventures between domestic and foreign automakers accounting for the bulk of foreign-brand sales in China. Based on available company and industry-association sales and delivery figures, we estimate that around 90 per cent of Volkswagen-brand vehicles sold in China during the first five months of 2015 were made by its two China production joint ventures – Shanghai Volkswagen, a JV between Volkswagen and SAIC, and FAW Volkswagen, a JV between Volkswagen and China FAW Group Corporation.Volkswagen remains the most popular car brand in our consumer surveys. However its popularity – and Volkswagen-brand sales and deliveries – are coming under strain. 20.8 per cent of prospective car buyers said they would be inclined to buy a Volkswagen-brand model in the coming 12 months, down 6.6 percentage points year-on-year. The popularity of Volkswagen’s higher-end Audi brand, meanwhile, remained flat year-on-year at 10.9 per cent. This was also reflected in both Volkswagen Group and its JV’s delivery and sales growth figures during the first five months of 2015. Shanghai Volkswagen’s sales during the first five months of the year were down 7.5 per cent year-on-year; FAW Volkswagen’s rose just 0.4 per cent year-on-year, while Volkswagen Group said its China-wide deliveries were down 1.1 per cent year-on-year during this period. That compares with 2.1 per cent year-on-year passenger vehicles sales growth during the first five months of 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).This trend is not limited to Volkswagen, however. Faced with a less optimistic near-term view about new car sales and build-up of inventories, major JV automakers, ranging from SAIC-GM to Beijing Hyundai, have announced production cuts in 2015. Chang’an Ford has also decided to lower its production capacity in China to reduce dealers’ inventory burdens. Other manufacturers are lowering prices in a bid to rekindle sales. Shanghai Volkswagen lowered its suggested retail price for several popular models in April, in the first major round of price cuts by the JV since 2010. We expect more JV automakers to follow suit should sales remain sluggish and inventories high.Meanwhile, domestic-brand sales are gaining some traction, albeit from a relatively low base. A combined 7.9 per cent of prospective car buyers said they were inclined to buy a domestic-brand car in the next 12 months, up 1.5 per cent year-on-year. CAAM, meanwhile, reported a 4.1 percentage points rise in domestic brands’ share of domestically made passenger vehicle sales during the first five months of the year to 42.1 per cent – these numbers include rural sales and do not include imported vehicles.We see this rebound in domestic-brand vehicle sales as due to several factors. Firstly, domestic brands are well positioned to tap into rising demand for larger vehicles, in particular SUVs – especially at the lower end of the market. SUV sales rose 47.7 per cent year-on-year during the first five months of the year to 2.2m vehicles, while sales of sedans declined 4.16 per cent to 4.9m during the same period. Domestic brand Great Wall’s H6 is China’s top-selling SUV, with more than 292,380 H6 vehicles sold during the first five months of 2015, up 54.3 per cent year-on-year. The H6’s guide retail price is Rmb99,800-158,800 ($16,075-25,580), compared with a guide price of Rmb199,800-315,800 for the top-selling foreign brand SUV model in China, the Volkswagen Tiguan.As well as outcompeting on price, domestic carmakers are also slowly closing the quality gap with foreign brands. According to a survey by J.D. Power and Associates in 2014, Chinese brands encountered 131 problems for every 100 vehicles, down from 155 in 2013. By contrast, foreign brands had 95 problems per 100 cars.The recent stock market rally may also have exerted at least a mild temporary downward drag on high-end car sales, again likely hitting higher-priced foreign-brand car sales harder than their lower-priced domestic equivalents.Our Car Buying Sentiment Index among consumers with annual incomes in excess of Rmb300,000 has averaged at 65.1 since November 2014, compared with an average reading of 68.1 in the preceding 12 months, suggesting that some may have deferred additional car purchases in order to allocate more money to the stock market. The likely impact on car sales has been mild, however, with our overall Car Buying Sentiment Index remaining broadly stable over this period. Moreover, with the outlook for A-share markets uncertain, the impact is likely to prove temporary.FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

9;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2015-05-07T02:35:38Z;Alibaba faces sceptical investors ahead of results;Palpable sense among analysts that Chinese ecommerce group’s honeymoon is over;When Alibaba publishes its quarterly earnings in New York today, the Chinese ecommerce group will face an increasingly sceptical crowd of investors.There is a palpable sense among analysts that Alibaba’s honeymoon — which saw the ecommerce group break records with last year’s $25bn New York listing— is over.Since November, Alibaba’s share price has fallen from more than $119 to $79 earlier this week — the first time its shares have dipped below $80 since its record-breaking initial public offering in September.Analysts will be watching the earnings announcement for any evidence of sluggishness in revenue growth, which undershot expectations at Alibaba’s previous results statement in January. They will also be looking for clarity on government attempts to regulate ecommerce and how this will affect the company’s profits.“There is a lot of concern about just how sustainable is the hype around Alibaba,” said Shaun Rein, head of China Market Research Group, the Shanghai-based consultancy. “The share price went out of control after the IPO but all the hedge funds we were talking to said: ‘We want to get in before anyone else does, and we want to get out before anyone else does’.”Analysts’ average target price for Alibaba stock hit a peak of $122.09 in January, according to Bloomberg, and since then it has fallen to $107.25. The target reflects analysts’ expectations for the shares 12 months hence.Alibaba will be hoping that Thursday’s earnings announcement receives a better reception than its previous one in January, which sent its stock down 10 per cent on weaker than expected revenues. But perhaps most of the damage was due to Alibaba’s dispute with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, a Chinese regulator.In January SAIC said it had found evidence of bribery, fake listings and counterfeit goods on Taobao, Alibaba’s most popular consumer marketplace.The attention from regulators spooked some investors, said Chi Tsang, internet analyst covering Alibaba for HSBC in Hong Kong.“Some think the government may yet force Alibaba to drop all these merchants that are selling fake goods, and if so, what is that going to do to sales on Taobao?” he asked.Mr Tsang is, however, the stock’s most bullish analyst, according to the 47 surveyed by Bloomberg, with a price target of $136 per share. The most bearish is PingAn Securities, which forecasts $82.13.Mark Natkin, director of Marbridge Consulting, the Beijing-based internet consultancy, said the SAIC row had “planted a coconut-sized seed of doubt in everyone’s mind” about Alibaba’s business model.“The SAIC’s report didn’t tell anyone anything they didn’t already know,” he said. “The fact that there are a lot of fake products on Taobao has never really bothered anyone, but now that the government seems serious about regulation, people don’t know what cleaning that up will mean for Alibaba’s bottom line.”The lower than expected revenues in January, added Mr Tsang, partly reflected a switch to mobile by many users — a platform that generates smaller revenues because merchants are unwilling to pay as much for mobile advertising.Mr Rein said another concern was that Alibaba was paying the price for its pre-IPO corporate shopping spree, and a hiring glut that raised staff headcount by nearly 50 per cent.Jack Ma, Alibaba’s chairman and founder, recently responded to accusations of bloat by declaring a hiring freeze along with other austerity measures, such as not paying workers a traditional spring festival bonus.“They obviously pushed hard to get great numbers to have a super awesome IPO,” said Mr Rein. “But it’s hard to maintain that momentum. It might have been better to have slightly weaker IPO numbers, and then just kick butt in the coming quarters.”Cao Lei, director of the China Ecommerce Research Center in Alibaba’s home city of Hangzhou, said the acquisition spree last year — in which the company made more than $6bn of new investments in the lead-up to its IPO — had been a failure. “The abundance of companies it acquired last year have not apparently contributed to its existing business,” said Mr Cao.“For the moment Alibaba does not have many tricks in the bag to impress the market,” he said.Alibaba, citing a pre-earnings quiet period, declined to comment.
11;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2015-03-11T08:29:18Z;Knock-off Apple Watches go on sale in China;Suspiciously affordable versions of the devices are already on offer on Chinese websites;Fake Apple Watches — or at least watches that appear similar to the new devices and are suspiciously affordable — have gone on sale across China, as consumers jump the gun before the genuine items are available next month.On ecommerce websites such as Alibaba’s Taobao, the watches appear nearly identical to Apple’s product, right down to the distinctive digital crown controller on the side of the device and four sensors on the underside.Most do not have a brand marking, and cost Rmb250-Rmb500 ($40-$80) — about a tenth to one-fifth of the price of the cheapest Apple watch exhibited this week by Tim Cook, chief executive of the Cupertino-based group.Revealed on Tuesday and scheduled to go on sale on April 24, Apple’s gold-cased luxury model costs up to $17,000 and appears to be aimed at wealthy Chinese buyers. In his multimedia presentation at the launch, Mr Cook highlighted that WeChat, China’s most popular chat app, could be used on the Apple device.The early proliferation of fakes will not help Apple’s hopes of replicating the success of its iPhones in China, which is the world’s second-largest market for the smartphones behind the US.Chinese knock-offs collectively demonstrate the speed, boldness and uncanny accuracy with which China’s counterfeiters can mimic even pioneering products.Sellers have been fairly brazen about the provenance of their wares — on Taobao the “iwatch” was advertised with the slogan “Knockoff Apple watches have hit the market!”But the seller cautioned: “If you are the kind of person who wants to compare a Rmb200 product with a Rmb3,000 Apple watch which has not been released, then this watch is not for you. Also, please stop asking us if this is the actual Apple watch.”As early as January, Chinese companies were hawking knock-offs at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, costing as little as $27.The Apple Watch fakes seen by the Financial Times at CES ran a version of Google’s Android operating system, redesigned to resemble Apple’s iOS.Taobao is owned by Alibaba, the US-listed group that handles 70 per cent of China’s online commerce. The knock-offs were also seen on other ecommerce websites and have been on sale this week in shopping centres.Chinese authorities have been cracking down on online counterfeiting. In January, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), a regulator, criticised Alibaba for allowing fakes on its websites. Alibaba said it was taking the matter seriously and was “dedicated to the fight against counterfeits”.On Monday, Zhang Mao, head of the SAIC, said the regulator was seeking harsher punishments for merchants caught selling counterfeit goods, adding that ecommerce was growing at a faster pace than regulations and laws could cope with, and that companies and the government should co-operate.Additional reporting by Ma Fangjing
12;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2015-01-29T17:38:36Z;Alibaba slams regulator over critical report;Ecommerce group’s shares slide 10% as revenue misses forecasts;"Alibaba blasted a critical report published this week by a Chinese state regulator calling it an “inaccurate and unfair attack”, as the ecommerce company reported lower than expected revenue that sent the shares down more than 10 per cent on Thursday.Joe Tsai, executive vice-chairman, denied claims by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce that the company had been informed of a probe and accompanying white paper on the sale of counterfeit goods on its markets last July. He also rejected suggestions that it had requested that publication of the report be delayed until after its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in September.“The first time we saw the white paper was when it was posted on the SAIC website yesterday,” said Mr Tsai. “We want to make it absolutely clear that Alibaba has never requested the SAIC to delay the publication of any report.”The company announced a 40 per cent year-on-year increase in revenues in the quarter ended December to Rmb26.2bn ($4.2bn). Wall Street analysts had forecast they would be $4.4bn, according to a survey by Bloomberg.But analysts were also focused on the developing situation surrounding the SAIC’s white paper, which it released on Wednesday, saying it had discussed the document’s conclusions with Alibaba at a meeting last July. The SAIC added that in “order not to impede Alibaba’s preparations for its initial public offering, the meeting was private and confidential”.This raised questions as to whether Alibaba had withheld important information from investors in advance of its IPO, which could potentially result in legal action in the US.On a call to investors and analysts, Mr Tsai denied that the July meeting referred to by the SAIC touched on the subjects covered in the white paper.“Like all international companies across the globe, we from time to time meet regulators in the normal course of business. The meeting last July was no different. at this meeting we discussed working together to create a process of addressing key areas of consumer protection and orderly market place operations in online commerce,” he said.Mr Tsai also noted that the SAIC appeared to have removed the white paper from its website.Analysts said it was difficult to predict how the situation with the SAIC would develop, though Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA, a Beijing-based consultancy, said that the disclosure issued highlighted a common problem for Chinese companies as they expand abroad.“The problem is that in China not everything is black and white. In the US, the rules are very clear — this form has to be filed here and that form has to be filed there,” he said. “In China, there are a huge number of potential risks out there and you just never know which are going to coalesce into anything.”The potentially damaging SAIC investigation in counterfeit goods indicates that the company’s size, success and central position in the consumer economy — which China is trying to promote — do not give immunity from regulatory oversight.

Read moreMr Clark said “it was a rude awakening for Alibaba as a public company”.The SAIC’s publication of the white paper seemed to come in response to taunts hurled from an Alibaba social media account at the regulator on Tuesday regarding a separate report released by the SAIC on January 23. That report gave low marks to Alibaba for its policing of counterfeit goods being sold on its websites. Alibaba referred to the SAIC as a “crooked referee” on its account on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.Following the contretemps, “It looks like both sides have been told to cool it” said Mr Clark, citing the SAIC’s decision to take the white paper off its website.One bright spot for Alibaba was the growth in mobile users. The company said on Thursday that mobile users hit 265m at the end of December, up 95 per cent from the same period a year ago.Mr Tsai’s intervention capped a tumultuous week for the company. It was caught off-guard on Tuesday night when Yahoo, which owns a 15 per cent stake in the company, said it would spin off its holding into a publicly listed entity as a way to save taxes."

Nu Skin said the fine related to “the sale of certain products by individual direct sellers that, while permitted for sale in Nu Skin China’s retail stores, were not registered for the direct-selling channel”.The company also said six employees had been fined a total of more than $200,000 for unauthorised promotional activities.The fines appeared to conclude an investigation launched in January after a series of articles in the official People’s Daily newspaper claiming that Nu Skin operated a “suspected illegal pyramid scheme” and “brainwashed” staff. The company denied the allegations.Nu Skin said that “the company is already taking steps to correct the issues raised in the SAIC reviews and is not aware of any other material enforcement investigations currently pending in China”.“We remain committed to working co-operatively with the Chinese government to ensure the healthy, long-term growth of our business,” Dan Chard, president of global sales and operations, said in the statement.The Beijing watchdog warned that it planned to “increase the level of regulation of the direct sales market” and “sternly investigate and punish any behaviour that violates the law or regulations in the direct sales sector”.[Herbalife] welcomed the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will co-operate fully with the FTCAmway, the market leader by sales in China, welcomed the move, saying “the SAIC notice today is actually good news for us. We have a strict policy on our direct-sales management and an internal penalty system to ensure that our sales staff behave properly. We actually hope the government will enhance the regulation of direct sales since that will help our customers distinguish proper direct sales from pyramid sales”.Herbalife, the US-based nutrition and weight loss company, is also active in China. Earlier this month the US Federal Trade Commission opened a formal investigation into the company.Herbalife said it welcomed the inquiry “given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations”.In China, a government investigation preceded by a high-profile attack in state media fits a pattern that has become familiar to global companies including Apple, GlaxoSmithKline, Volkswagen, Samsung, KFC and Walmart over the past year.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan
14;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2013-09-13T10:56:14Z;Bayer under investigation in China;;Bayer is being investigated in China over a “potential case of unfair competition”, as foreign pharmaceutical companies continue to come under scrutiny on the mainland.“We can confirm that a local branch of the AIC [Administration for Industry and Commerce] visited one of our offices in China at the end of August to investigate a potential case of unfair competition. We are fully co-operating with the authority,” the German drugmaker said on Friday.”However, it is unclear whether the investigation is related to the corruption probe that has involved GlaxoSmithKline and other foreign pharmaceutical companies in China.Bayer declined to respond to queries about whether any illegal payments to doctors or hospitals were involved.The company has “very strict compliance rules in place, which clearly forbid incompliant behaviour of our employees,” it said in the statement.The involvement of the AIC could suggest the visit to Bayer’s office was made in connection with a three-month anti-corruption investigation by the central government’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) into several industries including the drug sector.Industry insiders also speculated that the probe was likely to be related to the corruption investigation.However, Iris Wang, drug analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “We cannot jump to the conclusion that for sure Bayer is facing a graft probe.”China announced in July that it was looking into whether UK-based GSK made illegal travel payments to doctors, and several other foreign drugmakers have since also been accused of paying illegal incentives to doctors to prescribe their drugs.The national SAIC said it would look for “bribery, fraud and anti-competitive practices” in a wide range of industries that touch the lives of consumers, from drugs and medical services to school admissions.That same month, regulators launched a separate investigation into drug prices at 60 pharmaceutical companies in China.Jason Mann, a pharmaceuticals analyst and managing director of Fenex Capital Management in Hong Kong, said: “From my view Bayer has been seen as a good corporate citizen in China so these investigations have really come a long way if even Bayer is potentially in the crosshairs.”Additional reporting by Zhang Yan in Shanghai
15;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2013-08-15T08:25:55Z;China widens probe into drug pricing and corruption;;Pressure on pharmaceutical companies operating in China intensified on Wednesday as mainland authorities announced a broadening of their investigation into drug pricing and corruption in the healthcare sector.The government of Shanghai – whose public hospitals buy a large proportion of medicines sold in China – instructed hospitals to look for corruption in the purchasing and prescribing of drugs, as well as in clinical trials conducted with hospital participation.In an apparently unrelated move, the central government’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) announced that it would look for “bribery, fraud and anti-competitive practices” in a wide range of industries that touch the lives of consumers, from drugs and medical services to school admissions. According to the official Xinhua news agency, SAIC will also examine car dealerships and real estate agents.Separately, China Central Television reported on Thursday that the National Development and Reform Commission would review pricing practices in a range of sectors including autos, energy and telecommunications, citing Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC’s anti-monopoly bureau. Mr Xu oversaw a recent investigation into the baby formula market in which six companies, including five multinationals, were fined a total of $110m.The NDRC is responsible for policing illegal pricing activities while SAIC examines other business practices that can reduce competition, such as territorial restrictions imposed on distributors.Wednesday’s news that additional government authorities are getting involved in the China drug probe came as Novartis said it was investigating whistleblower allegations that it pressured a senior saleswoman to bribe doctors to drive sales of one of its oncology medicines.A Chinese newspaper said a former Novartis sales representative told the paper that she was ordered to secure Rmb650,000 ($106,000) in sales of one of the Swiss company’s drugs by providing Rmb50,000 to doctors.A Novartis spokesperson said the company started an internal investigation upon hearing of the allegations. “Novartis takes allegations of misconduct seriously and will take appropriate actions depending on the findings once the investigation is concluded.” The company added: “It is important to note, however, that this employee made a claim to Novartis in the amount of Rmb5m”.Over the past few weeks, Chinese media have carried a steady stream of stories alleging corruption and other irregularities in the healthcare industry, following the announcement of a probe into alleged bribery by staff at GlaxoSmithKline. Police say as much as Rmb3bn was routed through Shanghai travel agencies in order to bribe doctors, and GSK has admitted that some of its staff may have broken Chinese laws.Last week, the authorities started a probe into Sanofi, which is facing whistleblower claims that staff bribed hospital doctors in China. According to the official Xinhua news agency, Beijing municipal authorities have formed a task force to investigate whether Sanofi staff paid more than 500 doctors approximately Rmb1.7m in bribes disguised as “research grants”. Sanofi said it took the claims “very seriously” and was investigating.The Shanghai Municipal Health and Planning Commission broadened the focus of its investigation from drug companies to hospitals and doctors. It called on them to “do a good job in prevention, investigation and punishment of commercial bribes in clinical prescriptions”, as well as improving regulation of clinical trials.Local industry experts say there are anecdotal signs some hospitals are barring visits by pharmaceutical sales representatives in ways that could affect drug sales, at least in the near term.The SAIC investigation, which is due to begin on Thursday and last for three months, appears to be targeted more broadly, taking in a wide range of industries apart from pharmaceuticals. “The campaign will strictly root out commercial bribery and practices that limit competition and protect consumers rights and interests. It will also strengthen regulation over agents and middlemen and root out fake advertising,” the SAIC said.Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell in Beijing
16;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2013-07-05T16:55:33Z;China’s watchdogs show they have teeth;;Tetra Pak became the latest multinational to be targeted by Chinese regulators on Friday, with the launch of an antitrust investigation against the European food packaging group.The announcement followed a probe into the pricing practices of 60 drugmakers by the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s main economic planning agency, and another pricing investigation against baby formula makers.The unveiling of three probes involving foreign companies within the space of one week has led to concerns that multinationals are being targeted by the Chinese authorities – and that their high hopes of the vast Chinese market could be disappointed.Baby milk manufacturers including Nestlé agreed to slash prices in China by up to 20 per cent almost immediately after regulators unveiled their investigation.However, lawyers and corporate executives said that while antitrust activity was intensifying, the government’s moves were not a campaign against foreign companies, but more a sign of the country’s evolving antitrust regime.“I don’t think foreign companies are specially targeted by government in these campaigns. More Chinese companies are involved and I still think the government is stricter with domestic companies,” said Li Changqing, a Chinese antitrust lawyer.“But all of them are good signs that the government is trying to improve the enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law, which is new and was barely enforced before.” The investigations also showed that the government was more serious about inflation and was trying to bring prices down, he added.Even so, companies and lawyers are likely to watch the Tetra Pak case – launched by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce – particularly closely. SAIC is in charge of registering and managing industrial and commercial companies.“It brings SAIC into the game, which has not done any major antitrust cases. We can now expect SAIC to follow NDRC in becoming more activist and more confident,” said an antitrust lawyer in Hong Kong.Following the toxic formula scandal of 2008, when poisoned Chinese infant formula killed six babies and sickened hundreds more, Chinese parents have flocked to foreign formula in the belief that it is safer.Zhang Mao, head of SAIC, said in a speech published on the regulator’s website on Friday: “To enhance antitrust law enforcement, SAIC has filed a case against Tetra Pak Group for possible abuse of market dominance and has organised more than 20 provincial and municipal [departments] to conduct relevant investigations.”Tetra Pak confirmed SAIC had asked the company to provide information concerning its business in China, but said it had not received formal notice of any investigation. “We are co-operating and providing whatever information they require,” it said. China is Tetra Pak’s biggest market by revenue.When China adopted its Anti-Monopoly Law in 2008, it split the regulatory responsibility between the Ministry of Commerce, which deals with merger oversight, and NDRC and SAIC for the so-called “behavioural” aspects of competition, such as market dominance.Analysts say SAIC’s role is likely to cover practices other than pricing, which falls into NDRC’s area of responsibility. “The Tetra Pak case should help us understand what to expect from SAIC as a regulator in this field,” the Hong Kong lawyer said.The government probe into drug pricing mainly targets mainland companies, and only a handful of multinationals, including Astellas of Japan, Merck of the US and GlaxoSmithKline in the UK.The government has been expanding access to medical insurance and deepening the services it covers in recent years and, like administrations everywhere, it is eager to bear down on costs. Official statistics put China’s total pharmaceutical sales in 2011 at $71bn.“All over the world, regulators want cases that directly impact consumers. That applies to the formula case. It will probably be very popular,” said Sebastien Evrard, a partner at Jones Day in Beijing.Foreign-made formula in the $12bn-a-year market is sold in China through multiple layers of distributors. According to lawyers, the investigation covers the relationship between manufacturers, distributors and retailers.It also looks at attempts by the branded companies to force retailers not to offer their product below a certain minimum price – a practice known as resale price maintenance – which is illegal under Chinese antitrust law and in many other countries.A can of foreign formula in China can be up to twice as expensive as its equivalent in Europe.But while the investigation targets five foreign brands, it also involves two Chinese companies, Zhejiang-based Beingmate, which said it will cut prices soon, and Guangzhou-based Biostime. Chinese dairy groups Mengniu and Bright Dairy said they were not involved.Some lawyers argue the baby milk investigation represents a logical next step in NDRC’s evolution as an antitrust regulator. In January, the department followed regulators in other countries in fining foreign LCD panel makers for operating a price cartel.Shortly afterwards, it handed another hefty fine to Moutai and Wuliangye, China’s leading makers of baijiu, the homegrown spirit, over resale price maintenance.“With those two cases, they signalled that they were ready to target foreign companies and that they were ready to move against resale price maintenance, so the formula companies should have seen it coming,” said one lawyer.Additional reporting by Yan Zhang in Shanghai and Neil Hume in Sydney

And in the process he has exposed another deep link between the government and Wall Street because Mr Snowden learnt of these spy games in the employ of consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton.Booz Allen is one of several private sector consulting firms (known as SETA providers: systems engineering and technical assistance) that have proliferated in sensitive military and intelligence activities in a post 9/11 world. These firms have benefited as America needed to quickly have access to and ramp up the latest technical knowhow. In the process it received the ostensible benefits of outsourced labour such as variable costs and competitive pricing. Booz Allen is a well-known consultancy (it had already separated its non-government business) and has a market capitalisation of $2bn. But names such as SAIC, CACI, ManTech are less well-known yet all have market caps over $1bn. The average share price appreciation in the past year of the four is 24 per cent. Private equity has also taken a liking to SETA. Pentagon scrutiny has also led the defence equipment makers to divest their consulting units. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, for example, sold their SETA businesses to Veritas Capital and KKR respectively. And SRA International and DynCorp were standalone defence consultants that were also acquired by financial sponsors.Investors are right to worry that the Booz Allen breach could lead to less reliance on private sector contractors. But the technical ability that they possess (and that the government does not) makes them too valuable to just summarily cast aside. The larger threat comes from a nation finally exhausted by a decade of a constant war on terror and the steady drip of revelations about how Big Brother is watching.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
18;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2013-05-03T10:20:14Z;China’s electric cars: socket shortage;;"China got a bit of a late start on the internal combustion engine and has yet to produce a globally-competitive home-grown automaker. So Beijing decided several years ago that it might be better to leapfrog that entire generation of cars and go straight to electric vehicles instead.Unfortunately, it’s proved harder than expected to build an affordable and practical electric car in China; despite hefty government subsidies, private sales of electric cars have not got off the ground. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there is no public infrastructure for charging private vehicles (taxi fleets have proven easier to convert to electric). But in Shanghai, at least, things might be changing.The Shanghai city government has decided to try jump starting the industry by subsidising rentals of electric cars in one of the city’s districts – perhaps not coincidentally, the same Jiading district where state-owned automaker SAIC makes its own compact e-car, the Roewe E50.Ray Zhang, CEO of Chinese car rental market pioneer eHi, told the Financial Times in an interview at the time of the just-ended Shanghai auto show that his company will rent the E50 for about the same price as a petrol-powered car – Rmb100-150 ($16-24) a day – but charging it will cost about a tenth of the cost of buying petrol. The purchase price to eHi of the pure electric E50 will drop from Rmb230,000 each to Rmb130,000 thanks to subsidies from the Shanghai and Jiading district governments.The catch will be: where exactly will drivers recharge? Zhang is not too clear on that yet. He says eHi has 30 shops in Shanghai and about half could have charging stations installed (though they have not yet done so). In addition, he says, “the Shanghai government already has about 1,000 charging stations that we didn’t know about. We’re getting a map of those.” However, he cautions, they may not all be fully functional.Zhang has prior experience with offering electric cars for rental: eHi experimented with renting out a plug-in electric hybrid from BYD, the Chinese carmaker, in the southern city of Shenzhen where BYD is based. “But customers had a lot of problems with them, like the windows would not roll down, which is a problem at toll plazas,” he says. Problems like that have plagued BYD not just in its electric models, but also in its conventional ones.It will take time to change attitudes, perhaps even in Shanghai. Namrita Chow of IHS Automotive in Shanghai says: “Although the Chinese government aims to increase the number of electric and alternative fuel vehicles on its roads, a lack of infrastructure and consumer confidence has resulted in slow growth of the sector.”Zhang says eHi has so far only managed to obtain 50 cars for the Shanghai rental scheme, but hopes to have 200 by the end of the year. Demand is strong, he says, noting that “it’s the politically correct thing to do for corporations that want to fulfil their social responsibilities,” and also for multinationals that have carbon footprint reduction targets globally. Most corporate interest so far has come from Fortune 500 companies operating in China, he says – and most private customer interest from green consumers who want to see whether it’s worth paying well over the odds for a car with no leg room and a driving range of only 150 to 200 km. “I would not suggest you take it out of town,” says Zhang.He does suggest, however, that some companies might find renting an electric car has an unexpected benefit: “If an employee uses it for personal errands the cost would be low [because charging costs less than petrol],” he points out. Perhaps President Xi Jinping might want to rent a few as part of his anti-corruption campaign: they must be cheaper to run than all those Audis.With additional reporting by Yan Zhang in ShanghaiRelated reading:

19;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;US attitude to contractor mergers unclear;;The collapse of merger talks between EADS and the UK’s BAE Systems has left a significant question hanging not only unanswered but unasked: namely what would be the attitude of the US Department of Defense to mergers between its suppliers?Following the abandonment of EADS’s tie-up with BAE, the sixth-biggest US military contractor by annual revenues, US defence companies still do not know whether falling defence spending has made the Pentagon relax its opposition to further consolidation among its big suppliers.After the end of the cold war some US industrial companies – such as Chrysler, General Motors and Ford decided to spin out or sell off military subsidiaries as defence spending fell. The Pentagon then encouraged a wave of consolidation in the 1990s: Northrop and Grumman merged in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin and Boeing in 1997 took over McDonnell Douglas.Some similar fragmentation has already taken place during this defence slowdown: Northrop Grumman spun out its shipbuilding operations in March last year, for example, while SAIC, a provider of sophisticated professional services to the military, decided in August to split itself in two. However, so far the Pentagon has said it is reluctant to see mergers of big suppliers – but stressed it would still treat each deal on a case-by-case basis.“The reality of those kinds of policy pronouncements is that they can always change,” says Pierre Chao, managing partner of Renaissance Strategic Advisors. “In some ways, they’re also administration personality-specific.”Behind much of the current confusion about the industry’s future shape lies uncertainty about the Department of Defense’s budget. Military programmes could face 9.4 per cent across-the-board cuts from January if legislators are unable to agree before then on an alternative programme to close the US budget deficit.Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, one of the top five suppliers, said last month that such cuts could prompt the Pentagon to reassess its opposition to mergers among its biggest suppliers.There has been speculation that, in such a scenario, Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft maker, and General Dynamics, the armoured vehicle maker, might team up to take over BAE together. However, people familiar with the thinking of the two companies – both of which are in the midst of leadership changes – pour cold water on the suggestions.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says that while the Pentagon and other regulators encouraged the mergers that gave the industry its current shape, the mood now is very different.“The policy makers at the Pentagon now believe that there was too much concentration back then,” Mr Thompson says. “So they’re not going to permit major combinations.”That means, Mr Thompson and Mr Chao suggest, that corporate activity among military contractors in the foreseeable future is likely to consist mainly of groupings amid smaller operations. Following the collapse of the planned BAE-EADS merger, there is very little to prompt other big contractors into action, says Mr Thompson. “They’re waiting to see who wins the White House,” he says.
20;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2012-09-03T10:26:34Z;US military contractors – war horses;A tough battle that will not be won by financial engineers;The past decade or so has been a good time to be a contractor working for the US military or intelligence agencies. Between 2000 and 2010 the military budget grew 9 per cent a year, to about $690bn, faster than the budget as a whole or any of the big budget items besides Medicare. The Department of Homeland Security had a fiscal 2010 budget of $55bn, $15bn more than five years before.More recent years have been tougher. In 2010 both the secretary of defence and the CIA director went on record in the Washington Post voicing serious concerns about how many key jobs were being filled by contract employees. But the debate is not just over who should fight wars or collect intelligence. It is about how many soldiers and spies the country can afford. Hence the 2011 Budget Control Act and its threat of sequestration. If Congress is unable to agree to cut the federal budget by $1.2tn over 10 years, automatic cuts kick in next year with the axe falling heaviest on the military.Shares in the largest contractors that make the fanciest weapons systems – Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin – have held up over the past few years. Smaller contractors that specialise in providing personnel and technical support have had a tougher time. L-3, SAIC, ManTech and CACI International have all lagged behind the wider market badly. SAIC announced last week that, in an effort to create shareholder value, it would separate its low-margin IT and services arm from its higher-margin technology solutions business. This follows two other separations of lower-value divisions by Northrop Grumman (it spun off Huntington Ingalls) and L-3 (Engility). Neither of the earlier moves has generated much in the way of outsize returns, as a recent Credit Suisse analysis shows. This industry faces a tough battle, one that will not be won by financial engineers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
21;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2012-08-06T18:17:42Z;Saab owners seek $3bn payout from GM;;The owners of bankrupt carmaker Saab are suing General Motors for $3bn, claiming the US company blocked a sales and production deal in China that would have kept the Swedish brand afloat.Netherlands-based group Spyker filed suit against GM in the United States District Court in Detroit on Monday, seeking compensation for “unlawful actions GM took to avoid competition with Saab Automobile on the Chinese market”.The legal action marks the latest in a long series of mishaps around the failed Swedish car brand, which GM sold to Spyker in 2010 and which was declared bankrupt in December of last year.Faced with dwindling sales and cash reserves, Spyker last year agreed a deal with Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile that would have seen the Chinese group pump money into Saab in exchange for equity in the Swedish concern and the right to make and sell its cars in China.GM, which retained some preferred shares in Saab after the sale to Spyker, opposed the agreement because it thought it could jeopardise its existing interests in China, where it makes cars and commercial vehicles with Shanghai Automotive, or SAIC.Saab built cars such as its flagship 9-5 based on GM technology, and the US carmaker was also nervous about having its intellectual property transferred to third parties in China.Spyker on Monday claimed that it had suffered “massive damages” as the result of what it claimed were unlawful actions on GM’s part.“We owe it to our stakeholders ourselves that justice is done and we will pursue this lawsuit with the same tenacity and perseverance that we had when we tirelessly worked to save Saab Automobile, until GM destroyed those efforts and deliberately drove Saab Automobile into bankruptcy,” said Victor Muller, Spyker’s chief executive.Spyker said that it had secured the money needed to pursue the lawsuit from an unnamed third-party investor and would seek “a very substantial share” of Saab’s award if it was successful.“We have reviewed the complaint, and it is completely without merit,” GM said on Monday. “We will vigorously defend the company against these baseless allegations.”The Detroit carmaker decided to wind down Saab in early 2009 as it prepared to file for reorganisation in bankruptcy protection in the US.Even at the time, industry participants doubted that any new investor would succeed in building a viable business out of a niche volume-car brand with fewer than 100,000 annual unit sales, especially given Saab’s reliance on GM for its intellectual property.When Saab announced its deal with Youngman, analysts also expressed scepticism that China’s government would have signed off on its investment in the Swedish concern.In June, Saab’s bankruptcy receivers sold the carmaker’s assets to a group of Chinese and Japanese investors, who said they planned to make an electric car based on the brand’s small 9-3.
22;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2012-06-03T16:47:22Z;Growth hopes spur shake-up at Volkswagen;;Volkswagen has made extensive changes to its management in its attempt to become the world’s biggest carmaker and invigorate vigour into a merger of its trucks businesses.In a sweeping, swift and decisive shake-up, the German carmaker has created a new board-level management function for its China business, replaced three top executives at Audi, and tapped Leif Östling, chief executive of Swedish truckmaker Scania, to lead the integration of VW’s three truck brands.The changes hinted at dissatisfaction at the pace of growth at Audi and VW’s desire to plough ahead with extracting more synergies from closer integration of Scania with MAN and VW’s heavy vehicles.VW said the “management realignment” aimed to give momentum to its strategy of overtaking Toyota to become the world’s biggest carmaker by 2018, while preparing the group for a tougher market environment.“Our company has grown strongly and become more international in recent years. This fundamental reorganisation is the right response,” said Martin Winterkorn, VW’s chief executive.Senior executive cadres converged in Stuttgart on Friday, ostensibly to commemorate designer FA Porsche at the sports car producer’s brand museum. Ferdinand Piëch, VW’s chairman, used the event to organise marathon board meetings and execute the reordering of management at the German group’s 10 car and truck brands.Jochem Heizmann, formerly head of VW’s commercial vehicles division, will head up its business in China, where the group is the market leader but faces tough competition and a slowing market.VW is investing €14bn before 2017 in China with its local partners FAW and SAIC. In its last fiscal year the carmaker sold 2.3m vehicles in the country – more than a quarter of its global sales – and reported an operating profit of €2.6bn.Mr Östling will step into Mr Heizmann’s shoes heading commercial vehicles, taking responsibility for overseeing the integration of the MAN, Scania, and VW truck brands. VW has recently increased its control at MAN.A VW executive, who asked not to be named, said: “Now that they have all the clearances from the competition authorities, they can move ahead and go full throttle on the truck business to get all the synergies going.”Arndt Ellinghorst, head of European automotive research with Credit Suisse, said: “From an industry perspective, this is probably what should happen. It seems MAN is a bit behind the curve and Piëch wants Scania to fix it.”Mr Östling told Reuters his task would be “to coach the different co-operations and to urge on that sensible co-operations emerge” between Scania, MAN and Volkswagen.At Audi, VW drafted Wolfgang Dürheimer from its British luxury limousine brand Bentley to oversee the premium brand’s technical development and cadre of about 6,000 engineers.Mr Dürheimer, who was part of the team that developed Porsche’s profitable Cayenne sport utility vehicle, had been at Bentley barely more than a year.Luca di Meo, head of group marketing and VW’s flagship car brand, was brought in to head sales and marketing. Audi will also appoint a new purchasing chief.Despite Audi reporting record global sales, VW executives said the Ingolstadt-based carmaker and its ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ (‘Advancement through technology’) brand slogan needed momentum if it hoped to achieve its goal of overtaking BMW as the industry’s top-selling premium producer.Within and outside VW, the shake-up fuelled speculation and rumours about who is being lined up to replace Mr Winterkorn when he steps down as chief executive in 2016.Karl-Thomas Neumann, often named as a successor, was ousted from his job heading China in the changes. Mr Winterkorn said VW would look for “new tasks” for Mr Neumann in the company.

Ford said the move is part of the company’s “largest expansion in 50 years”, aimed at boosting global sales by 50 per cent from 2010 to about 8m vehicles a year by mid-decade.VW and GM were early entrants in China and remain far more powerful there. Ford formed its first joint venture in China only just over a decade ago, while VW has been producing cars in China since the 1980s. GM and VW each produced more than 2m vehicles in China last year.Ford, which produces cars jointly with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and Mazda, has recently stepped up dramatically the pace of its expansion in China: two weeks ago it said it would invest $600m to expand capacity at its facility in Chongqing, central China, the largest manufacturing base for the company outside its home in southeastern Michigan.The company said it would bring 15 new vehicles and 20 new powertrains to China by 2015, increasing the company’s relatively limited product range available on the mainland. Ford is expected to unveil a sport utility vehicle at the Beijing car show, which opens on Monday, hoping to tap rising mainland demand for more fun, individualistic kinds of vehicles among younger buyers.Meanwhile Ford’s US rival in China, GM, played down speculation that it had reached a deal with its Chinese joint venture partner, SAIC, to regain equal equity control of their joint venture by buying back 1 per cent of the equity sold to SAIC when GM was in financial straits in 2009. That deal had a proviso to allow GM to buy back the stake, so long as SAIC continued to be able to claim the joint venture’s revenues under new Chinese accounting rules.The Wall Street Journal said on Thursday that agreement had been reached to split the venture into a sales arm and an operational arm, with GM and SAIC sharing control of the operational side equally. But GM said that negotiations on the matter are “ongoing” and that there was “no specific date set” for the repurchase. Any such deal would require government approval.

However, the company has been battling on several fronts, including criticism by labour and environmental groups of its supply-chain, difficulties in managing its distribution and retail chain, and the trademark dispute.Proview Electronics (Taiwan), another affiliate of Proview’s Hong Kong-listed group parent, was the first to register the trademark in a dozen other markets including the European Union and several Asian countries before 2004. Proview Taiwan sold those trademarks to Apple in 2006. Only after Apple started selling the iPad in China did it realise Proview Shenzhen had a claim to the trademark there.In December, a Shenzhen court rejected a demand by Apple to have the ownership of the China trademark transferred to its name. Apple has appealed against the decision, but legal experts have said the appeal is unlikely to change the outcome of the court case.Proview Shenzhen said it felt encouraged by the court ruling, and has renewed attempts to fight Apple on the retail front. Late last year, the company filed two lawsuits against large Apple resellers in Shenzhen and Huizhou, two southern Chinese cities. Last week, it requested a temporary restraining order over iPad sales in a Shanghai court, which has yet to decide on it.Proview Shenzhen has also filed multiple complaints to local commercial authorities against retailers offering iPads, demanding sales be frozen because of the pending legal action. The Shijiazhuang move marks its first small success in its long drawn-out battle.Apple’s iPads remain on sale at electronics retailers in Beijing and many other cities. An Apple representative in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.
25;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2012-01-09T22:09:45Z;GM searches for growth in niche markets;;"General Motors is set on defending its crown as the world’s biggest carmaker by scouring every corner of the globe for new sales opportunities, Joel Ewanick, GM’s chief marketing officer, said on Monday.“We’re going to go after every little piece, every little niche everywhere in the world”, Mr Ewanick told the Financial Times at the Detroit auto show. “We’re not leaving any stone unturned.”GM was the undisputed leader in global car production and sales until 2007, when it was overtaken by Toyota as its financial woes deepened.More recently, the two companies have vied with Volkswagen for the number one spot. Data for 2011 have yet to be finalised.OICA, the industry association that collates production figures, is expected to confirm GM’s claim to be the industry leader in 2011.However, some industry consultants dispute GM's inclusion of Wuling-brand vehicles made by its joint venture with SAIC in China, maintaining that VW outsold the US group last year. LMC Automotive and IHS Automotive last month placed GM at number two by production after VW and Toyota in third place because of the impact of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami disaster this year, which disrupted its production.GM’s latest drive to expand its global reach is focused on Chevrolet, its flagship brand.Mr Ewanick cited a drive to freshen Chevrolet’s line-up in Brazil, where Fiat, Volkswagen and GM, the three market leaders, are locked in an intensifying battle with a flock of newcomers, such as South Korea’s Hyundai.Elsewhere, GM is introducing a diesel version of the Chevrolet Colorado mid-sized pick-up truck in Thailand, a market long dominated by Toyota.Despite car production and sales rebounding strongly, there is little celebration. Car companies are unlikely to recover their pre-crisis output levels for many years, in what experts are calling ‘the new normal’ for the industryGM is also stepping up the globalisation of Cadillac, its upmarket brand. Plans are afoot to start building Cadillacs in China later this year.Mr Ewanick said plans are also on the drawing board for a right-hand drive, diesel version of the ATS, Cadillac’s smallest model, which was unveiled in Detroit on Sunday.Besides Chevrolet and Cadillac, GM has five regional nameplates – GMC and Buick in North America; Opel and Vauxhall in Europe and Holden in Australasia.Asked whether Cadillac could hope to compete successfully against the likes of BMW and Mercedes Benz on their home turf, Mr Ewanick said: “I’m going to have fun trying.”"
26;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2012-01-09T16:59:35Z;GM sales buck trend for China slowdown;;General Motors, the biggest foreign automaker in China, defied a slowdown in the Chinese car market to reach record sales last year of 2.55m vehicles.GM said in a statement on Monday that sales rose 8.3 per cent last year, well below 2010’s 29 per cent but significantly above an expected 4 per cent rise in sales for the total Chinese market, which is the world’s largest. Ford also announced its 2011 China sales yesterday, saying they increased 7 per cent.Total market figures for last year are expected to be released within days by the China Association of Auto Manufacturers (CAAM), which has previously forecast sales would grow by less than 5 per cent in 2011, compared to 46 per cent in 2009 and 32 per cent in 2010. Auto market analysts attribute the decline to Beijing’s tightening of credit policy last year, and the withdrawal of tax incentives introduced after Beijing’s 2008 economic stimulus package.Withdrawal of the incentives hit domestic car companies disproportionately hard, because they are strongest in the segments of the market favoured by incentives: small cars. This has allowed foreign automakers – including GM – to increase their market share at the expense of locals.Foreign market share, which was 69 per cent in 2010, may have risen by two to three percentage points last year – though the vast majority of foreign-branded cars are made in China, by joint ventures between foreign and Chinese companies.“The natural preference of the Chinese consumer is to buy as much car as they can afford. If they can afford to buy a multinationally branded car, they will”, says Bill Russo, of Synergistics auto consultancy in Beijing, former head of Chrysler in China.“As the Chinese market develops, Chinese consumers are becoming more mature – and that is challenging Chinese auto brands, while benefiting US and European brands,” says Mr Zhang Junyi, of Roland Berger consultants in Shanghai.Mr Russo says he expects GM to maintain strong sales growth this year. “If you look at the future, you have to be very bullish about GM in China. Their Baojun product line (the joint venture brand launched recently with partner SAIC) will give them a significant boost in tapping into growth in lower tier markets,” he said.GM has repeatedly welcomed the slowdown in China’s overheated market. As Dan Akerson, GM chief executive, said in Shanghai in November: “You can’t have totally unbridled growth in a country evolving as quickly as China.”Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
27;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-12-18T21:32:30Z;Car industry grows to record size in 2011;;The car industry grew to a record size in 2011, despite weathering a year that began with Japan’s earthquake and ended with a gathering sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone.Both IHS Automotive and LMC Automotive (formerly JD Power Automotive Forecasting) estimate that sales of cars and light trucks will have grown by about 4 per cent this year to 75m.Forecasters are predicting that car sales and production will grow further next year, but have trimmed their estimates because of worries about the impact Europe’s debt crisis will have on demand.The industry’s 2011 expansion was much slower than the low double-digit growth rates carmakers saw in 2010, when they were rebounding from a crisis that prompted the biggest government bail-outs for any industry outside banking.Eastern Europe, including Russia and Turkey, reported the fastest growth in car sales this year, followed by South America, according to IHS. The recovering car market in the US grew faster than China’s cooling one, up 9 per cent this year, the consultancy says, compared with China’s 5 per cent.“We are seeing North America grow more than China both in relative and absolute terms,” said IHS analyst Christoph Stuermer.In Japan, where the earthquake and tsunami disrupted carmakers’ manufacturing operations and buying, the market contracted by more than 20 per cent this year.IHS and LMC predict that Volkswagen will surpass General Motors and Toyota to become the industry’s largest producer for the first time this year. However, their forecasts do not include GM’s Wuling brand vehicles made by its Chinese venture with SAIC, which will give it the highest reported production in the industry.IHS forecasts that light vehicle sales will grow a further 4 per cent in 2012 to nearly 78m. LMC believes they will grow 5 per cent next year to just under 79m.The forecasts bode well for an industry that is sensitive to credit market conditions and consumer demand.Western Europe’s car market, which was flat this year, will contract by about 5 per cent more next year, forecasters say.Christian Klingler, VW’s head of sales, said on Friday that the company was “preparing for a very challenging year in 2012”.Arthur Maher, LMC analyst, said: “The European carmakers are bracing themselves for a recession, and the downturn may be more severe in the first half of the year.”
28;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-12-18T15:42:41Z;VW predicted to accelerate ahead;;Industry forecasters say that 2011 will have been the year that Volkswagen pulled ahead of all of its competitors to become the world’s largest carmaker. Most have the German carmaker at the top of their production and sales league tables, writes John Reed.But General Motors is likely to report higher global production than VW this year according to OICA, the industry association that collects them, and lay claim to the crown of industry’s biggest carmaker itself.The discrepancy comes down to statistical issues on which the German producer is maintaining a tactical silence.Forecasting groups LMC Automotive (formerly JD Power Forecasting) and IHS Automotive expect VW to end this year as the world’s largest carmaker, by production and sales. They have GM as number two and Toyota, the top seller since 2008, falling to third place because of the impact of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami disaster this year, which disrupted its global production.IHS forecasts VW’s full-year production at 8.45m units, followed by GM with 8.1m. LMC expects VW to produce 8.66m light vehicles this year, and GM just more than 8m.However, LMC forecaster Jeff Schuster expects GM to report global production of 9.23m vehicles this year, more than VW.The bigger number will include vehicles GM makes in China under the Wuling brand through its joint venture with SAIC, China’s biggest carmaker. LMC disallows the numbers from its count because GM does not majority own the brand.“Wuling is sold under the SAIC group,” says Mr Schuster. “GM does not have a controlling interest in the Wuling brand, so we do not recognise it as part of GM.”IHS, too, counts vehicles GM makes in China under its own brands such as Buick and Chevrolet, but does not count the Wuling vehicles. “We are objective: We very bluntly say VW is biggest,” says Christoph Stürmer, an analyst with the group.When asked by the Financial Times during a recent investor call whether VW, because of its strong sales this year, needed to move forward its goal of becoming the world’s biggest carmaker by 2018, Hans Dieter Pötsch, chief financial officer, deftly dodged the question.“We can only say that we have a very clear strategy in place . . . that could lead to that [number one] position,” he said.“But for us it’s much more important that we become the best company in the automotive industry.”IHS Automotive’s Mr Stürmer has an explanation for VW’s reticence on the topic. “VW doesn’t talk about it because Winterkorn and the board are worried about taking the steam out of the engine,” he says. “They want to keep their guys hot and still working towards the 2018 goal.”VW will not in any event hold on to its spot on consultants’ rankings as the industry’s top producer in 2012, analysts say. With Toyota now fully recovered from the earthquake, it will probably lay claim again to the top spot.Additional reporting by Chris Bryant

31;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-10-12T18:01:20Z;BAE warns of uncertainty over US contracts;;BAE Systems warned of “significant uncertainty” over future levels of US military spending but the defence equipment manufacturer said it remained confident of winning orders in spite of constraints on government expenditure in many of its principal markets.The FTSE 100 company, which last month confirmed that it was planning to lay off 3,000 from its UK workforce of 40,000 in response to slackening demand for military aircraft, said it remained on track to deliver underlying earnings a share for the full year that would be “broadly similar” to 2010.BAE, in a trading update covering the period from July to October, said it would continue to implement big cost reductions to “address changes in customer priorities and, in some areas, reduced business activity”.BAE – the UK’s biggest manufacturer by sales and the world’s second-largest military equipment maker – has already cut 15,000 jobs globally in the past two years.Though BAE made delivery of the first of 24 Typhoon aircraft to the Royal Saudi Air Force during the period, an overall slowdown in government orders for the fighter jet was partly blamed for the job cuts at the company’s UK plants.The uncertainty in the US over the future commissioning of defence equipment programmes is weighing most heavily on the company. Protracted political divisions in Congress over the authorisation of US government spending was also unwelcome, it said.“Some near-term disruption to trading is anticipated as the US administration again operates federal budgets under a Continuing Resolution,” it added.The company generated 43 per cent of its turnover in the US in the first six months of the year, followed by the UK on 27 per cent. Saudi Arabia was the company’s next largest market, accounting for 12 per cent of BAE’s sales, followed by Australia on 6 per cent.In spite of spending cuts in its main markets, BAE insisted it was well placed in pursuing “significant new business opportunities”.In August, BAE along with Northrop Grumman was awarded a $450m contract working on an armoured vehicle project for the US army. The award is being disputed by rival SAIC. The award of a $850m contract to operate an army ammunition plant in the US to BAE in May is also being disputed by the incumbent contractor.BAE added that it remained in discussions over the possible sale of Typhoon fighters to Oman while India was also considering buying the aircraft.The company, which is in the middle of a £500m share repurchase programme, added it planned to bring forward £157m of pension deficit funding in the final quarter of the year. Revised deficit funding agreements are expected to be finalised by the end of the year following triennial funding valuations on two of its largest UK pension schemes.The burden on a revised agreement could be exacerbated by recent falls in yields on UK government gilts that last month saw the aggregate shortfall of British corporate pension schemes near record levels.BAE shares, down 22 per cent over the year, fell 4.4p to 276.7p in early trading on Wednesday.
32;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-09-20T18:36:23Z;GM and SAIC join forces on electric cars;;General Motors and SAIC Motor Corp have agreed a joint venture to develop and build electric vehicles and their parts in China.Engineers from the US carmaker, its Chinese partner and their existing Shanghai-based Pan Asia Technical Automotive Centre joint venture will work together to develop structures, architectures and components for battery-powered cars, the two companies said on Tuesday.GM and SAIC said they were making an equal investment in the project but did not disclose how much they were investing. The agreement follows a memorandum of understanding on strategic co-operation they signed last November, when SAIC also bought about 1 per cent of GM’s shares in its initial public offering.The electric vehicle architecture will be the first to be jointly developed by the two companies, whose Shanghai GM carmaking joint venture unveiled an electric “concept” car based on their Chinese Sail small car at the Guangzhou auto show last year.GM and SAIC said that vehicles resulting from the partnership would be sold in China under the Shanghai GM and SAIC brands but that SAIC and GM would also use the technology to build electric vehicles overseas for their own purposes.The US carmaker and its main Chinese partner signed the JV agreement after a meeting of GM’s board in Shanghai. GM in December 2009 ceded a 1 per cent controlling stake to SAIC in their Shanghai GM JV, giving the Chinese partner 51 per cent control, but GM’s chief executive Dan Akerson has recently said he would like to buy the stake back.The agreement on electric vehicles deepens the symbiosis between America’s and China’s top-selling carmakers, and would appear to set a new high-water mark for the sharing of sensitive technology between them. China is pressing foreign carmakers such as GM to share more of their technology with their local partners, including by developing indigenous car brands.GM last year launched in the US the Chevrolet Volt, an extended-range electric vehicle that it plans to sell in Europe from next year as the Opel/Vauxhall Ampera. Last month, GM and South Korea’s LG Group announced an agreement to design and engineer electric vehicles together.China – which is looking to reduce the environmental and energy impact of its car-buying boom – last year launched a pilot programme aimed at promoting electric and rechargeable hybrid vehicles in five cities. However, foreign-built electric vehicles such as the Volt are not eligible for subsidies to buyers of fuel-efficient cars under the scheme.Chen Hong, SAIC’s president, said the agreement would help his company and GM “bring about our goal of leading the automotive industry in new energy vehicles”.Tim Lee, GM’s head of international operations, said the project “demonstrates the broad range of benefits made possible by the strong partnership between SAIC and GM”.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language.

Booz shares fell 6.4 per cent to $15.02.“The whole sector faces a tricky dilemma. The amount of bid opportunities has actually gone up, because after budget negotiations the government now has a backlog of contracts to put out to tender. So companies have increased spending around business development,” Mr Loomis said.“But if those contracts are not awarded so projects can be ramped up, and revenue starts flowing, it could be difficult.”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.2 per cent at 1,204.42, ending a four-day rally.Financial stocks fell 2.4 per cent, more than any other sector.Goldman Sachs was down 3.5 per cent to $112.16 after writing down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.The Federal Reserve Board had alleged a “pattern of misconduct and negligence” at Litton.Bank of New York Mellon outperformed the sector, despite the departure of chief executive Robert Kelly late on Wednesday.BNY Mellon shares were only down 0.2 per cent at $20.63 after Rochdale Securities analyst Dick Bove said the bank was sitting on a “staggering” cash pile.Semiconductor companies had a volatile day after analysts disputed whether burgeoning demand from smartphone manufacturers will be enough to compensate for falling sales to computer makers.Shares in Nvidia outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index by more than 1 per cent, after Kaufman Brothers analyst Mike Burton initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. The Nasdaq was down 1.3 per cent at 2,546.04, but Nvidia shares were only off 0.2 per cent at $13.28.“We view Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the convergence of mobility and computing,” Mr Burton said.Glen Yeung, Citigroup’s technology analyst, also said smartphone demand could offset falling industrial demand ahead of an industry conference.“We expect the tone from chip companies to reflect uncertainty … we do not, however, expect chip companies to lower guidance en masse, reflecting the dearth of actual order cuts quarter-to-date.”That pushed Micron Technology and SanDisk, which manufacture Dram memory chips used in computers and phones, into positive territory in early trading. But Micron closed at $5.74, down 2.9 per cent for the day and SanDisk dropped 1 per cent to $36.27.Manufacturers with exposure to industries other than computing had outperformed in August but on Thursday their shares were pushed back as investors traded on enthusiasm for smartphones.Applied Materials, a company whose chips end up in solar panels, was off 2.3 per cent at $11.06.Novellus, whose semiconductors are used in various industrial processes, fell 3.3 per cent to $27.05 after the company used a mid-quarter update late on Wednesday to lower revenue targets.Not every analyst shared the enthusiasm for smartphones. Mr Yeung’s Citigroup colleague Henry Kim predicted a “double-dip in DRAM”.“We are revising down our global memory industry revenue forecast by 19 per cent on weaker pricing from low demand and expect industry revenue to decline by 13 per cent year on year in 2011 earnings,” Mr Kim said.Robert Lea, South Korea-based semiconductor analyst for Jefferies, who initiated coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor with a hold rating, was also downbeat on the sector.“Semiconductor industry inventories [excluding memory] have risen for seven consecutive quarters to an estimated 81.5 days”, while at the same time, “revenue growth has stalled”, Mr Lea said.TSM shares were down 0.7 per cent at $11.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent for the day at 11,493.57, pushing it back into negative territory for the year to date.
35;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-04-22T18:23:13Z;Telematics makes inroads in China’s car market;;"China is taking the art of multi-tasking while driving to new levels.The Roewe 350, the homegrown midsize model from SAIC, comes with in-car software that allows occupants to trade stocks, play poker, post to the Chinese version of Facebook and exchange instant messages.That is not to mention helping drivers who had too much to drink locate where they parked their car, the morning after.Zhu Jiajie, sales manager at Anji Auto Sales, an SAIC dealership in Shanghai, says the package has proved so popular that some buyers choose Roewe just to get it.Most Chinese car manufacturers do not offer such “telematics” services, though more are expected to launch them soon.Mr Zhu says stock picking and social networking is meant to be done by the driver only at red lights or in traffic jams.But it is hard to believe that China’s tech-savvy and entertainment-obsessed drivers, many of whom are newly licensed, adhere rigorously to the manufacturer’s suggestions.Chinese drivers need telematics for much more than in-car distraction. In a country that has built 639,000km of new roads in the past 5 years – and is on track to have a highway network that exceeds that of the US – in-car navigation systems are vital. Drivers are often confronted with roads where recently there were none – or no road where previously there had been one.Simple, screen-based GPS navigation systems are relatively inexpensive. But telematics providers like OnStar, the General Motors service which is the market leader in China, offer more – a live human navigation assistant who answers at the touch of the OnStar button. The assistant’s maps are more up to date than those installed in the car at purchase and can provide turn-by-turn driving instructions (without the annoying simulated voice tones).“Chinese customers really are using our navigation service a lot, much more frequently than in the US”, says Jon Hyde, general manager of GM Shanghai OnStar.He says that Chinese customers call the OnStar call centre four to five times more often as their (usually older and more experienced) US customers.GM, which is increasingly shifting its centre of gravity to Asia, is making a big play for the China telematics market.OnStar waives the Rmb1,580 ($243) service fee for the first year, in OnStar-equipped vehicles.But OnStar does more than direct customers to the nearest Starbucks or hotpot restaurant.OnStar can unlock cars with the keys left inside; alert the owner when the car needs an oil change; help police retrieve stolen cars; find cars lost in the shopping mall carpark; and most attractive of all, for many buyers, OnStar crash sensors send an automatic alert to the operator in case of accident.The operator calls the emergency services – and then stays on the line to comfort the driver until help arrives.OnStar this week announced a new service that allowed customers to use their smartphone to turn their lights or ignition on and off – even from a distance.However, OnStar has chosen not to offer entertainment services. “It’s a very competitive space,” says Mr Hyde.Synovate, a China-based auto consultancy, estimates there could be 10m telematics users by 2015."
36;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-04-10T19:06:33Z;MG to produce first all-new car in 16 years;;MG will this week begin fully-fledged production of what it is describing as its first all-new car in 16 years.On Wednesday the brand, owned by China’s biggest carmaker SAIC, will begin assembling the five-door “fastback” that it will also later offer as a saloon.The cars will be assembled from Chinese-made bodies and engines by a small cohort of workers at MG’s plant in Longbridge, Birmingham, in the UK.The model will have a tauter suspension in the UK than in China, where most drivers favour a softer ride.The MG6 will start from about £15,500 ($25,340), selling for up to £19,000 for a top range version with extras like colour satnav, a reversing camera and advanced climate control. MG said the car would aim to compete with rivals’ similarly sized models such as the Skoda Octavia and Ford Mondeo and Focus.The company plans to launch the car – which SAIC already sells in China – in the UK, but may later expand elsewhere in Europe. It will mark the latest step in the British brand’s path back from near-oblivion under new Chinese owners.When SAIC acquired most of the bankrupt MG Rover’s assets from its receivers in 2005 it moved the focus of the business back to China’s booming market, where it makes cars under the MG and “Roewe” brands.However, it maintained MG’s Longbridge facility, which employs about 400 people, as primarily an engineering and design centre which is now moving back into production.In addition to the MG6, the facility designed the smaller MG3, which is now going on sale in China but also may be made at Longbridge. At the Shanghai auto show this month the brand will premiere another UK-designed “concept” model, the MG5, that may also later be produced at Longbridge.The assembly of cars from Chinese-made kits in the UK will mark an unusual reverse twist on the industry’s usual pattern of European, US or Japanese carmakers assembling cars from kits in emerging markets like China.MG’s first post-bankruptcy model made in the UK, the two-seater TF, was launched during the recession and sold barely 1,000 units.Industry analysts have given the MG6 largely positive reviews, but say the car may struggle to make its mark on Europe’s stagnant, oversupplied car market.“It’s a good-looking car, and the MG brand still means something to people, but I think they’re going to find it tough,” said Chas Hallett, editor of Autocar magazine.However, he added: “They may have more success with future cars.”
37;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-03-20T20:25:49Z;Foreign groups told to make Chinese cars;;"Foreign carmakers wishing to build new plants or add capacity in China’s burgeoning car market are being told by the government that if they wish to expand, they must develop a low-cost local car brand. While Beijing has spoken of promoting local car brands, no central government ruling or written policy is known to exist on the subject.However, automakers confirm that the issue is cropping up in their negotiations to expand existing plants or build new ones.French producer PSA Peugeot Citroën, which is pushing its cars upmarket globally and, until recently, rejected the notion of producing low-cost cars, confirms that it is now studying the possibilities.Philippe Varin, the group’s chief executive, recently told the Financial Times that developing a local brand was “part of the deal” in its new joint venture with Chongqing-based producer Chang’an, which is installing capacity to produce up to 200,000 cars a year from 2012 in Shenzhen.He said that Peugeot was considering offering some of the low-cost cars for export to other markets, but added that the French group had yet to make a final decision.Volkswagen, which is seeking to build a new 300,000-vehicle plant in Foshan, southern China, confirms that it is in talks with its Chinese partners FAW and SAIC to develop local brands.Industry analysts say that the local brand issue has been specifically linked in the expansion talks, but VW – said to be reluctant to roll out a new brand – declined to confirm this.“I believe there are changes to the policy coming,” said the head of China operations of one foreign carmaker, who asked not to be named.“All the multinational companies are working with their joint venture partners on what the ramifications are.”Some reports suggest that as much as 30 per cent of additional capacity would have to be devoted to the indigenous brand.In most countries, governments bend over backwards for automakers, dangling tax breaks or other sweeteners to carmakers to induce them to build plants.But amid blistering competition by producers to cash in on China’s booming car market – due to grow 10 to 15 per cent in the current “slow” year – the deck is stacked in the government’s favour.Mike Dunne, president of Dunne & Co, an industry consultancy, said: “Nothing is written down, but when automakers go to apply for capacity expansion, in their application it’s clear that they should have a plan for an indigenous brand with jointly owned product rights and some provision for new energy vehicles.“Foreigners want more capacity; China is saying: ‘We want more own brands’.”From China’s perspective, co-operation with foreign carmakers has yielded little in terms of development of local brands or transfer of intellectual property.Lang Xuehong, automotive analyst with Sinotrust , said: “During 10 years of trying, China has become a big factory for foreign companies, and their Chinese partners didn’t get advanced technology.“Through this industrial policy they would like Chinese carmakers to get IP in order to own this market”.Some foreign carmakers believe a drive into local brands makes questionable business sense at a time when most are trying to reduce complexity.“None of the manufacturers freely opted for having local brands added to a complex brand portfolio that they all already had,” said Engelbert Wimmer of PA Consulting, which advises the industry.“It’s clearly something driven out of the political class in China with long-term interests in mind.”But General Motors, which recently launched its Baojun local brand, insists it is the right move commercially for the company.“We made this decision a number of years ago that it made sense to play in this area of the market,” said Kevin Wale, head of GM in China.He predicts that GM can sell 4m-6m Baojun-branded cars in the next five years. “By itself, it is a bigger market than Germany,” he said.VW, meanwhile, said that it sees a local brand as “an opportunity to get into new market segments, especially those we have not been able to get into so far”.However, the carmaker said that the discussion is at an “early stage”.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen"
38;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-03-15T17:32:59Z;Mahindra confident on Ssangyong’s future;;Mahindra & Mahindra is confident it can revive South Korea’s Ssangyong Motor – the embattled sport utility vehicle maker that it agreed to buy last year – as it lays out its plans for the business.The Indian company said on Tuesday it would turn round the brand by introducing Ssangyong vehicles to India and by bringing over its car financing business to South Korea as part of a drive to boost sales by 50 per cent to 121,000 vehicles a year.Mahindra agreed to buy a 70 per cent stake in Ssangyong, South Korea’s smallest carmaker by sales, in November for Won522.5bn. The global economic downturn had forced the company into bankruptcy protection in January 2009 after four years under Shanghai Automotive’s management control. Ssangyong exited court-led bankruptcy protection on Monday.Ssangyong said that under its new owner, Won240bn ($211m) would be spent on product development and branding this year.The two brands also hope to reduce costs through joint global purchases and sharing global sales networks.“We bring financial stability and investment as well as a futuristic focus with our offerings in alternative fuels and electric vehicles,” said Anand Mahindra, the company’s vice-chairman.“Ssangyong brings us the key to global markets with its strong technology base, its complementary product portfolio and its strong global dealer network.”However, he said there were challenges Mahindra would face in the integration process. “We cannot underestimate the difficulties of integrating two companies from different countries and different cultures.”In order to minimise any culture clash, Ssangyong would be run independently by largely Korean management with its Korean brand retained, Mahindra said.Lee Yoo-il, former court-appointed manager for Ssangyong, was named as the carmaker’s chief executive.“It will not be easy to turn round the company given strong competition in the market,” said Lee Sok-je, analyst at Mirae Asset Securities. “But it can survive as a niche market player unless Mahindra repeats SAIC’s [mistakes].”SAIC purchased a 51 per cent stake in Ssangyong in 2004, the first overseas takeover by a Chinese carmaker.Ssangyong’s labour union said the Chinese managers had a hard time integrating the unit into its operations and that SAIC failed to invest sufficiently on new product developments. The Korean employees also attacked SAIC over technology transfer issues.Like Mahindra, SAIC also tried to introduce Ssangyong’s vehicles to its home market, but it failed to turn round the company as the global economic crisis hit demand for SUVs.However, Ssangyong’s operating loss narrowed to Won55bn last year from Won293bn in 2009 partly because of the popularity of its new Korando C, one of two models Mahindra wants to introduce to India.Ssangyong’s sales dropped in 2009 due to falling global demand and protracted strikes, but they nearly doubled to Won2,070bn in 2010 from Won1,067bn.
39;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2011-02-18T19:36:31Z;Beijing presses carmakers to share technology;;Foreign carmakers are bowing to pressure from Beijing to transfer more technology to their Chinese partners by launching jointly-designed brands aimed at small car buyers on the mainland, the world’s largest vehicle market.Global carmakers are eager to placate Beijing, but also hoping the move will help them compete for buyers at the low end of the Chinese market, which has been the fastest growing, and most competitive segment, in a country where 13.8m passenger cars were sold last year.Beijing has been pressuring all foreign-Chinese joint venture carmakers to develop indigenous brands as part of the drive to boost “indigenous innovation” – a policy which has sparked complaints from multinational companies about enforced transfers of technology.“All joint ventures of foreign car manufacturers – like FAW Volkswagen and SAIC Volkswagen – have been asked to develop local brands,” says Karl-Thomas Neumann, head of VW in China, confirming talks about a joint brand with the German carmaker’s two local partners.“Chinese people are frustrated by China’s slow pace at standing on its own feet to make cars,” says Mike Dunne of Dunne and Co, an Asian auto consultancy. Chinese manufacturers have about 30 per cent of their domestic market, even after a generation of joint venture co-operation with the world’s largest carmakers. “They have tried the conventional joint venture approach for 25 years and the results have been much less than they had hoped for in terms of Chinese companies securing technology,” says Mr Dunne. “Now they want to force the matter”.SGMW, the joint venture between General Motors, SAIC, and Wuling, maker of mini-commercial vehicles in China, recently produced its first joint own brand car, the Baojun 630. It is aimed at “first-time buyers in the country’s second and third tier markets,” says Kevin Wale, GM’s head of China. Nissan and its joint venture partner Dongfeng Motors showed its Venucia indigenous small concept car at the recent Guangzhou auto show. It will launch in 2012. Honda and Guangzhou Automobile Group will sell an own brand car called the Li Nian GM says the rationale for its move is purely commercial. “With Baojun we can get access to a market of about 6m vehicles that otherwise we would leave untouched,” the company says. Matthew Tsien, vice-president of SGMW, says the company plans to introduce one new Baojun model every year, including sport utility and multi-purpose vehicles. VW sees an indigenous brand as “an opportunity to get into new market segments, especially those we have not been able to get into to so far”.Chinese manufacturers dominate the mainland market for cheap small cars, but foreign manufacturers have increasingly gone downmarket to meet them head-on, introducing cheaper smaller cars to bid for market share in an area that experienced high growth in the last two years due to government tax incentives.“This allows them to keep their own brands above the fray,” says Mr Dunne. Foreign brands in China enjoy a reputation for quality that could be jeopardised if they go too far downmarket with their global brands. Beijing will hope to export these joint-venture brands overseas but industry executives are sceptical. “If they think they can export these, they can forget it,” says one foreign carmaker, noting that most Chinese car brands are not ready for export – and joint venture cars will still be seen, overseas, as Chinese cars.Some foreign carmakers say they see the drive for joint venture brands as nothing more than a “technology shakedown” to force them to share technology with their domestic partners and eventual rivals. They point to Chinese government proposals that all new energy vehicle joint ventures should be majority controlled by the Chinese partner, instead of the more common 50:50 arrangement. That proposal caused a backlash among multinational manufacturers, and could be revised.
40;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-11-18T02:18:52Z;Booz Allen shares jump in post-IPO trading;;"Booz Allen Hamilton, a consultancy specialising in high-security US government defence work, saw its shares jump in their first day of trading after an initial public offering that raised $238m.After pricing at $17, the lower end of its projected price range, the shares rose 13.2 per cent in post-issuance trading, to $19.25.The US IPO market is enjoying a resurgence after struggling for much of 2010. On average, the 125 US flotations in 2010 have risen 8 per cent in their first day of trading.“Nobody was able to convince me the market would be better a year from now than it is today,"" said Ralph Shrader, chief executive of Booz Allen. “We’re confident of what we can do over the next six months.”Booz Allen is majority owned by an investment fund controlled by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, which acquired Booz Allen in 2008 following its split from Booz & Co., a private-sector management consultancy. After the offering, Carlyle will still own 71 per cent.Mr Shrader said that the proceeds from the IPO would go toward paying down Booz Allen’s $461m in buyout-related debt, which bears a 13 per cent interest rate.Shares of government consulting groups have not performed well this year, as investors believe that fiscal austerity in the US will likely shrink defence budgets. The largest public group, SAIC, has seen shares drop 19.5 per cent this year, at $15.25. ManTech International is down 17.5 per cent, to $39.88.Booz Allen, however, is seen by analysts to have unique qualities. Seventy-one per cent of its employees have security clearance with the US defence department, and 49 per cent have top secret clearance.“Booz Allen is well positioned to benefit from cybersecurity, which will not see its budget cut as much, and a focus on efficiencies. They focus on how government can do more with less,” said Paul Bard, director of research at Renaissance Capital, an IPO research group.The company has pointed to 32 per cent increase in the backlog of its work, as well as an 18 per cent compound annual growth rate, excluding acquisitions, since 1995. Booz Allen had revenues of $5.1bn in the fiscal year ending in March, and net income of $200m.Mr Shrader said: “We certainly do well when government budgets are expanding, but we believe the kind of things we do offer value even when they are not.”Analysts have also focused on Booz’s potential in the non-government space, as global companies seek to expand their cybersecurity defences.“Their non-compete with Booz & Co. expires next year. We expect they’ll have a significant effort on the commercial side as well as the government side,” said Dan Daly, a director with Kennedy Consulting Research & Advisory."
41;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-11-05T17:29:20Z;Tencent rival row triggers monopoly complaint;;A Beijing-based consumer rights activist has filed an anti-monopoly complaint against Tencent, in a sign that the world’s third-largest internet company by market capitalisation faces growing opposition against its unmatched power in the Chinese market.Tencent runs QQ, which with more than 600m active accounts is the world’s largest instant messaging tool.The company has used this customer base to push into a range of internet services, including online gaming, social networking, music and film downloads, and online shopping.Tencent’s latest expansion into security software has put it into conflict with Qihoo, the provider of 360, China’s most widely used antivirus programme – a fight that is becoming a test for Tencent’s strongest asset: the loyalty of its immense user base.In September, Qihoo 360 claimed that QQ software was scanning data from its users’ computers, and released a tool that it said would block such moves and protect users’ privacy.Tencent reacted by suing Qihoo for alleged unfair competition. After a Beijing court accepted the case this week, Tencent said it would terminate services to those QQ users who use 360 software on their computers.This sparked a flood of complaints from QQ users and triggered the anti-monopoly complaint.Wang Fengchang, chief executive of Laweach, a website that organises consumer complaints, submitted the complaint to the State Administration for Industry & Commerce on Friday.The complaint, which has been seen by the Financial Times, demands that the SAIC open an anti-monopoly investigation into Tencent and fine the company Rmb1.24bn ($186m), or 10 per cent of its 2009 revenue.Mr Wang accuses Tencent of abusing its 80 per cent share of the instant messaging market.“Tencent’s attempt to use its controlling market position to force internet users to make a choice between two softwares is malicious monopolistic behaviour, and its demand that users uninstall software is unfair competition,” the complaint said.China’s anti-monopoly law defines companies with a market share above 50 per cent as having a controlling, or dominant, position, and forbids them to abuse this position by refusing or limiting business transactions with certain counterparts.Tencent rejected the allegations raised by Qihoo. “Tencent operates its business legally and welcomes monitoring from outside parties,” the company said.Analysts said Tencent’s ultimatum to users reflected its confident position.But one user on a QQ messaging group wrote: “These companies are getting too arrogant and the government should step in and restore order in the market.”
42;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-10-05T18:21:16Z;MG plans first all-new car in 15 years;;MG, the Birmingham-based British carmaker owned by China’s Shanghai Automotive (SAIC), will by the end of the year begin producing its first all-new car in 15 years, and from 2011 relaunch in the UK as a “value” brand.The company, which mainly provides design and engineering services for SAIC’s growing Chinese operations, will in the fourth quarter of this year begin assembling the MG6 at its Longbridge plant.The first cars will be made from knocked-down kits brought from China. However, if the new model proves successful, MG plans to increase the amount of assembly it does in the UK – and thus give new life to what was once one of Europe’s largest car plants.MG has given London-based advertising agency DCH a brief to remind carbuyers of its heritage, without dwelling on sepia-tinged nostalgia for models made by MG Rover, which went into administration in 2005. “We’ve got to get across the idea of having a great past with a bright, exciting future”, says Guy Jones, MG Motor’s UK sales and marketing director.When MG Rover collapsed, SAIC bought intellectual property rights to some of its cars and engines. Much of its production equipment was packed up and shipped to Nanjing Automobile, with which SAIC has since merged.At the time, its top engineers set up a consultancy with Ricardo to advise SAIC, which the Chinese carmaker bought in 2007.The site employs 300 engineers and about 30 design staff, and has developed or contributed to several SAIC cars, including its Roewe 550 model, which went on sale in May. It also did work on Roewe’s 350 saloon and the MG Zero, a “concept” car SAIC unveiled at the Beijing auto show in April that will form the basis for a new small car.China’s carmakers are becoming more proficient at producing smaller and cheaper cars but struggle to compete with foreign brands in designing larger, higher-specification cars. None has yet scored a big export success in western Europe or the US. “There’s still a lack of capability in Shanghai, and probably will be for years, to design a new vehicle from a clean sheet of paper”, says David Lindley, head of SAIC’s technical centre.With its main focus on China, MG currently only makes its TF sports car in tiny volumes in Longbridge. The car is a rebooted version of a design produced before MG Rover went into administration and has struggled to compete with comparable models with more up-to-date features.While its then-owner NAC spoke of selling 50,000 cars a year when the vehicle was relaunched in 2007, the company now acknowledges that sales have been “in the hundreds, not thousands”.MG is hoping for more success with the MG6. It says that potential buyers of the car in customer clinics have compared it with Ford Motor’s Mondeo, Skoda’s Octavia, or even a small BMW.While the company shrinks from comparisons with other low-priced car brands, Skoda, Kia and Hyundai have been among the industry’s best-performing marques during the downturn. “Desirable cars and affordable prices is a good combination for a post-recession period”, says Mr Jones.The company will sell the MG6 in a five-door fastback version, followed by a four-door saloon, and sell it for £16,000 to £20,000 – a modest price for a car of its size. If MG manages to revive its brand in Britain – and later in Europe – it will have ample room to expand on the sprawling Longbridge site, whose facilities include a mothballed paint shop.MG’s rebirth on booming car sales in China is part of a wider trend across the car industry, where the country’s rise as the world’s largest vehicle market has redefined the business. Elsewhere in Britain, Changan – another large Chinese carmaker – recently set up a research and development centre in Nottingham due to employ 200 people by 2013.While MG Rover’s failure hangs heavily over its Chinese-owned successor company, MG officials discourage comparisons between the two. When establishing the new engineering unit, managers recruited people from other carmakers and brought new furniture on to the site to break with the past. “MG Rover was a failing business that couldn’t fund new investment, and couldn’t survive”, says Mr Jones. “This is the polar opposite – part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in the world”.
43;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-10-01T16:18:27Z;From hybrids to self-driving vehicles;;General Motors – with the memory of the worst crisis in its history still fresh – indulged in a futuristic flight of fancy at the Shanghai Expo.The US carmaker and its Chinese partner SAIC unveiled in March their vision of a car for 2030: a self-driving, networked bubble-car run on electric power, and small enough to park in your living room.It was called EN-V (for Electric Networked Vehicle) and came in three variants with Chinese names: Xiao (“laugh”), Jiao (“pride”) and Miao (“magic”)“Miao will transport you magically and seamlessly through the urban landscape,” GM and SAIC promised. “You can play your favourite video games or hold a videoconference with your colleagues around the world.In Europe, Audi, the German luxury carmaker owned by Volkswagen, this year staged a competition for architects to imagine what urban landscapes and driving would be like two decades hence.Like GM and SAIC, the winner of the €100,000 ($136,238) prize offered a vision of automated driving in cars wired up to the surrounding environment.“The car will transform from being a viewing machine for manoeuvring in traffic towards a sensorial experience machine,” the architectural firm J. Mayer H. said. Cars would “interact with the urban context in completely new ways”.The year 2030 is a long way off, even by the standards of automaking, with its long product cycles.However, both projects indicate how automakers see the future of driving: electric-powered, networked to the surrounding environment, and decidedly urban.The crisis that sent GM into bankruptcy court – and even dented sales at Germany’s more-resilient luxury carmakers such as Audi – accelerated big, long-term changes already afoot in the car industry, and suddenly brought the future closer.The industry’s centre of gravity tipped decisively to Asia, where China replaced the US as the world’s largest vehicle market in 2009. Before the crisis, analysts had predicted this would take up to a decade.By 2050, more than 2bn people in emerging markets will become first-time buyers, demanding low-cost cars, according to PA Consulting.Many of them live in large cities, where policymakers contending with smog and packed streets are realising that automobiles can no longer be large, costly hunks of metal that pollute for a few hours of the day then sit idle for the rest of the time, occupying valuable space.Electrification of cars, already a growing trend among automakers, accelerated during the crisis.Governments in the US, the UK, France and elsewhere earmarked stimulus grants or soft loans for producers of electric and plug-in hybrid cars and their batteries, and made subsidies available to early buyers.Electrification will fundamentally change the way cars are manufactured and sold, and transform carmakers’ relationships with their customers.BMW’s family of electric vehicles due out in 2013, code-named “Megacity”, will feature a lightweight carbon-fibre and plastic shell on an aluminium chassis.It will mark an industry first in terms of both materials and architecture, a radical departure from mass-produced cars’ usual “unibody” form.Electric motors are mechanically simpler than internal combustion engines, and so will reduce some of the money automakers earn on service in the years after they sell a car.On the other hand, carmakers will have to offer warranties on the batteries through the life of a car – an obligation, but one that holds the promise of longer relationships with their customers.But to keep new customers interested, carmakers will have to raise their game and make cars more like those most coveted devices of the digital age: smart phones, with their portals to social networks and endless upgradeability.While millions of people in China, India and Brazil buy their first cars, something else is happening in the developed world. Younger people in Europe have been telling pollsters that the one device without which they cannot live is not a car, but a phone.Enter the smart car: an automobile wired to the internet and – increasingly – other cars and roadside infrastructure. Drivers increasingly demand a seamless transition from the social networking, entertainment, and communications networks they use at home to their cars.“If you look back over the past 10 years, everything within the car got connected to everything else, with computers steering everything,” says Peter Schwarzenbauer, Audi’s head of marketing and sales.“The change over the next 10 years will be that the car gets connected to its environment.”The car of the future, rather than just losing value in the driveway, might do a better job of earning its keep, too.Utility companies are studying schemes that would see electric cars recharging during the night when rates are low, then either using the power during peak hours or selling it back to the grid.If cars are inexorably converging with phones, automakers are also realising that they need to make their products just as adaptable.Customisation is already a lucrative business line for carmakers – notably for urban mini­cars such as Fiat’s 500. For its forthcoming A2, Audi is studying the possibility of selling mobile phone-like “apps” allowing customers to download and activate features already engineered to the car, such as stiffer suspension or heated seats.Carmakers are also reaching out to the sceptical hard core of young drivers unsure whether they want to own a car at all.PSA Peugot Citroën recently launched a scheme that allows drivers to pay for “mobility units” used to rent a car, scooter, or even a bicycle. Most big automakers now are studying “mobility” – a new industry-wide buzzword.Amid all this blue-sky thinking, profound doubts remain around customers’ acceptance of new products such as plug-in cars.While decisionmakers clamber to subsidise “silver bullet” technologies, for example electric powertrains and lithium-ion batteries, some of the industry’s biggest technological strides are coming in relatively prosaic areas such as downsized and turbocharged engines.There is also the perennial question of what carbuyers will value enough to buy.“The big question today is not the technology,” says Patrick Pelata, chief operating officer of Renault. “The big question is what customers need, and how much they will pay for it – all our strategy is driven by that.”Renault and its partner Nissan announced in April a partnership with Daimler allowing the three companies to pool costs in small and electric cars, vans, and other technologies.Automakers, while offering customers endless variants in the showroom, are radically simplifying their manufacturing, building more cars on fewer platforms with a greater commonality of parts.Ford’s new Focus midsized car, for example, will have 80 per cent of parts in common in its different versions around the world.And amid all the doubts about the future, there are reasons for optimism too: while the politically correct term these days is “mobility”, it looks like driving has a future. All the entrants to Audi’s urban design competition included cars.
44;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;China’s SAIC shows interest in GM float;;Last week Hu Maoyuan, chairman of SAIC, raised speculation that China’s most powerful domestic carmaker might take a stake in General Motors’ upcoming initial public offering.Mr Maoyuan said that SAIC “will watch GM’s IPO closely, and think carefully if we should purchase the shares or not”.The notion that the “new GM” might attract prominent foreign shareholders such as SAIC should come as no surprise for a company that sold 72 per cent of its vehicles outside the US last year, and 39 per cent in emerging markets.But, amid a bearish mood on world capital markets, where Chinese investors are among the biggest confirmed or rumoured bidders for assets lately, the remarks by SAIC’s boss drew notice.If SAIC’s mild expression of interest proved indicative of bigger plans by Chinese or other foreign shareholders in the IPO, it would almost certainly spark political controversy in GM’s home market.SAIC is GM’s main carmaking partner in China, where the Detroit carmaker now sells more vehicles than the US. The companies have two joint ventures making cars and mini commercial vehicles, and plan to join forces to sell small commercial vehicles in India as well.Bill Russo, head of the Synergistics auto consultancy in Beijing and former head of Chrysler in China, says he “wouldn’t be surprised” if SAIC bought into the IPO – if they are allowed to by the US government, GM’s biggest shareholder.“It becomes an emotional issue that somehow the identity of GM would be transformed from a North American-centred to an Asian-centred company”, if SAIC took a big share, he adds. “But that is happening anyway – the global centre of gravity of the auto industry is shifting to Asia”.Another China-based industry insider, who asks not to be named, says that a large stake for SAIC is unlikely, though for political reasons: “I am absolutely certain they would love to have a share …but they do not want to upset the US about this.”GM’s IPO will be one of the biggest and an important milestone for President Barack Obama’s administration in an election year in which Americans are bitterly divided over its handling of the financial crisis that pushed GM into bankruptcy last year.The US Treasury is expected to sell its 60.8 per cent stake down to a minority when GM lists shares in New York and Toronto this year as Washington begins to exit the shareholding that earned GM the pejorative nickname “Government Motors”.For now, few Americans are expressing concern about the possibility that Chinese or other foreign shareholders might now buy a big stake in their largest domestic carmaker.Daniel Howes, a columnist for the Detroit News, speculated last week that the IPO might see “a not insignificant number of those shares fall into the hands of foreign investors seeking the credibility (and technology) that could come with a sizable share of a restructured and recapitalised GM”.The notion of an emerging-market carmaker making a play for GM or a portion of its assets and technology is not out of the question.Last year Russia’s Sberbank teamed up with Canadian supplier group Magna International in a bid to buy GM’s European Opel-Vauxhall business and leverage its technology to build cars at Russian automaker Gaz, owned by the tycoon Oleg Deripaska. GM’s board later decided not to sell the company’s European arm.Separately, Mr Deripaska as recently as mid-2007 held just under 5 per cent of pre-bankruptcy GM, but later sold the stake.GM and Gaz have long-running ties, and in the past held talks on developing a low-cost car for Russia. Basic Element, Mr Deripaska’s investment company, declined to comment on GM’s upcoming offer.GM’s pre-bankruptcy shareholder base included many foreign shareholders, and it plans to court them again. Its advisers, led by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, plan an international leg of the road show for the IPO, which could raise about $12bn to $16bn.Analysts and people close to the company say that the “new GM” has many provisions in place to ensure against an unwanted takeover from outside.GM now operates under Delaware law. Its IPO prospectus includes many deterrents to sovereign wealth funds or strategic non-US investors that might want to assume control.Under various provisions outlined in the offer prospectus, GM could “delay, defer, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt” by a stockholder – though the issue would be moot in the case of a friendly stake taken by a close ally like SAIC.GM’s S-1 filing also includes various selling restrictions on GM shares outside the US. US law also requires a strategic investor who buys more than 5 per cent of a listed company to file a 13D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Amid tough market conditions that have seen other IPOs scuppered this year, some analysts say GM’s biggest challenge will be to place the shares successfully at all.“There’s a lot of risk with this IPO”, says George Magliano, director of research for North America with IHS Automotive.
45;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-06-05T00:18:29Z;How to make the most of the Expo;;"First of all, you need to know how to get in. The best trick is to avoid all the pedestrian entrances around the Expo’s perimeter, which can be beset by queues, and instead ask any taxi driver to take you to the Madang Road metro station in central Shanghai (or go there by subway line 9). There you can board a special subway line straight to the heart of Expo.And then what? Unless there is a handy typhoon to keep the crowds down, avoid the Pudong area of Expo for as long as possible; your appreciation of Shanghai, the Chinese and your own sanity could depend upon it. Pudong has the high profile national pavilions, including China and the US. Leave those until night-time, when they show to their best advantage anyway. Start the day on the west bank or Puxi side of Expo, where the corporate world has spent millions doing what World Expos do best: prototyping the technologies of the future, and showcasing a few cool gizmos.Let the capitalists entertain you: General Motors may be a mere shadow of its former self, but you would never know it from GM’s Expo pavilion. Built jointly with SAIC, the giant Chinese carmaker, GM is displaying an electric mini-car that parks itself, cannot crash, and is small and light enough to park in the closet of a high-rise apartment.Traditionally, GM thinks big for Expo: at the 1939 New York World’s Fair, General Motors proposed the US interstate superhighway system, which was built a couple of decades later, and transformed America. This time GM has designed a networked transportation system based on roads, cars, buildings and car parks that talk to each other.Coca-Cola is serving Cokes at its pavilion that freeze when you open them; the joint China Telecom/China Mobile pavilion gives every visitor a handheld “dream machine” that interacts with the big screen; Shanghai’s state-owned enterprises have built a “dream cube” that changes its exterior colours when the people inside wave their arms; and the State Grid is putting on an edgy light show. In today’s China, even public utilities are showing off.Adjacent to the corporate pavilions is the thematic heart of Expo, the prosaically named Urban Best Practices Area (UBPA). This Expo is dedicated to making urban life bearable so cities from around the world have brought their best thoughts on urban living to show off here.Hamburg has brought its “passive house”, which stays cool in summer and warm in winter without using conventional air conditioning. The house’s filigree metal shutters automatically close and open with the sunlight, and its triple-glazed windows and triple-ply walls maintain 25°C inside even when it is 40°C outdoors.Next to Madrid’s “bamboo house” is the three-storey “air tree”, like a massive umbrella covered in solar panels that drive a giant fan that can reduce the temperature beneath by 8°C to 10°C in summer. It is a great place for a picnic lunch.And after lunch, take a turn on one of the state-of-the-art bicycles at the Odense pavilion, complete with 300m bike path and Danish designer crash helmets. Do not miss the cargo bike, a kind of three-wheeled barrow that can transport kids or groceries or granny, and is touted by Odense as a wise alternative to a second car.And when the lights go on, catch a ferry to the Pudong side of the river, to view the dazzling light show of the assembled national pavilions, and the two majestic neon-lit bridges that frame them – without queuing for hours to view pavilion interiors that are almost universally disappointing (exceptions are the UK, Italy and Canada, the latter designed by Cirque du Soleil).Do yourself the special favour of skipping both the Chinese and US pavilions: the two superpowers have produced embarrassingly bad offerings. The US pavilion feels like a thinly veiled advertisement for the companies that paid to build it. And at the China pavilion, visitors are subjected to a train ride through a blasted neon dystopia that, the Expo website tells us, gives “an appreciation of the great wisdom and achievements in China’s urban development from ancient to modern times”. To judge from that, the ultimate achievement was to do away with people altogether.If you must, find a pavilion with a wait time of less than two to four hours, and go inside. Then repair to the UK pavilion: it may look a bit like an upended toilet brush, but at night, with all its 60,000 transparent rods lit up and waving, it is pure magic.Patti Waldmeir is the FT’s Shanghai correspondentThe Shanghai Expo runs until 31 October.

46;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-06-04T23:42:04Z;Ssangyong puts six bidders on shortlist;;Ssangyong Motor, the South Korean sports utility vehicle maker that was put under bankruptcy protection last year, has shortlisted six international and domestic bidders to buy the embattled carmaker in a deal worth up to $500m.Ssangyong said on Friday it had selected six out of seven companies that had submitted letters of intent but declined to confirm which company had been disqualified from the bid process.A person close to the sale said that among those to have expressed an interest in making a bid were France’s Renault, India’s Mahindra & Mahindra, local companies Seoul Invest, a private equity fund, and YoungAn Hat, which owns a maker of buses.Analysts expect Ssangyong to fetch between $300m and $500m.Another person familiar with the matter in Europe said Nissan, Renault’s partner, was leading the Franco-Japanese alliance's bid with support from Renault Samsung Motors, its existing South Korean venture. Renault and Nissan both declined to comment.In spite of losing ground to bigger South Korean carmakers such as Hyundai Motor, Ssangyong remains appealing to foreign brands because of its strength in SUVs and large sedans.South Korea’s smallest carmaker has been under court protection since early 2009 after seeing its sales slump during the global crisis.China’s SAIC bought a controlling stake in Ssangyong for $500m in 2004 but could not hold on to it because of mounting losses at Ssangyong during the crisis.Last year Ssangyong asked a court to allow a five-for-one writedown of the stake held by SAIC, followed by a further writedown at a later date. SAIC now holds only 6.2 per cent of Ssangyong.Analysts warn that it will not be easy to turn round lossmaking Ssangyong, given the falling popularity of its cars, its ageing production facilities and the activism of its labour union.However, they expect Renault to become a frontrunner, given the synergies that the deal would bring to its South Korean unit, Renault Samsung.Renault runs a factory in the South Korean port city of Busan, which it acquired from Samsung in the wake of the Asian financial crisis more than a decade ago.While Ssangyong only has 2 per cent of South Korea’s car market after suffering losses over the past two years, analysts believe that Renault Samsung could use Ssangyong to expand its product line-up by adding SUVs and some sedans.A deal with Mahindra & Mahindra would help one of India’s biggest motor manufacturers expand its portfolio and gain access to Ssangyong’s expertise in SUV manufacturing.“Mahindra & Mahindra has been invited by Ssangyong, Korea to participate in the bidding process,” the Indian group said on Friday.
47;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-05-19T17:43:56Z;GAC plans own-brand vehicles;;"Guangzhou Automobile, or GAC, the China joint venture partner of Honda and Toyota, intends to begin production of its own brand vehicles in September, reflecting Chinese carmakers’ determination to carve a slice of the world’s largest vehicle market.The company will produce “no fewer than 30,000” Chuanqi-brand sedan cars in its first full year of production, according to Zhang Fangyou, chairman. “[The initial output] will depend on the market reaction,” he told the Financial Times. “We are relatively confident.”GAC is a 50:50 partner with Japanese rivals Honda and Toyota, both of which have successful joint ventures in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province. GAC is controlled by the Guangzhou municipal government.The company’s 50 per cent interest in Guangqi Honda is currently held by Denway Motors, a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary. GAC on Wednesday unveiled a proposal to buy out the company and secure its own listing on the Hong Kong exchange through a share swap. It is offering investors 0.38 of a GAC share for each Denway share.GAC is being advised by JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corp on the transaction, which values Denway at HK$41bn (US$5.3bn) and GAC at HK$80bn.Group executives say the privatisation and listing of GAC shares will create a cleaner shareholder structure and let Denway investors benefit from the larger group’s development.GAC also has production partnerships with Fiat, Hino and Mitsubishi.Its various ventures are expected to produce just over 1m vehicles this year, making it China’s sixth-largest manufacturer. The group says it leads the domestic “mid-to-high-end sedan market” with a
29.5 per cent share, compared with 25 per cent for Shanghai Automotive.SAIC, which has 50 per cent in two competing joint ventures – with General Motors and Volkswagen in Shanghai – has launched its own-brand sedans.GAC is putting the final touches on a manufacturing facility in Guangzhou that will have first-phase capacity of 100,000 Chuanqi sedans. Production is scheduled to begin in September. The group is also eyeing overseas markets."
48;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-04-29T23:03:23Z;Expo guide: Dip into the future with cars that talk to bicycles;;From Crystal Palace to caramel corn, international expositions are all about the newest new things in architecture, technology – and even food. Some Expos leave no mark at all on world history, but others live for decades in the memories of those who visit them.Shanghai is already the world’s largest and is shaping up to be one of the memorable ones, so visitors will have to pick and choose to make the most of it. While everyone else is queuing for hours at the China pavilion, the smart traveller will head to the west bank of the Huangpu river, known as Puxi, where the corporate and urban best practices pavilions are located.In the pavilion shared by GM and SAIC, the big Chinese automaker, visitors can watch volunteers drive GM’s mini urban concept car, so small and light it can be parked in the closet of a high-rise apartment, and so “smart” it cannot crash.The two-seater measures 1.5m by 1.4m and weighs 200kg (without passengers). It drives itself, parks itself and can talk to other cars, pedestrians, cyclists and traffic lights to avoid accidents and traffic jams.Also in the corporate section is Coca-Cola’s “Happiness Clinic” – surely good for a laugh, if nothing else – and the Cisco pavilion, where visitors can experience life in the year 2020, when we will all be even more relentlessly “connected” than now.China’s state-owned enterprises have their own pavilion, the Dream Cube, which uses the power of the masses inside to change the exterior appearance of the pavilion. Next door is the urban best practices area, where the city of Hamburg’s pavilion is a “passive house” that maintains a 25 degree C temperature without traditional heating or cooling.Madrid has built a five-storey house made of bamboo, and in the Liverpool pavilion, visitors can take a 3-D imaginary ocean liner from Shanghai to the British port while listening to the Beatles and watching Liverpool play Everton at football.At the main Expo site the China and US pavilions will get top billing. US organisers say their queue will be 1.5 hours long on a good day – but the 4D schmaltzy movie on show inside may not be worth the wait.The China pavilion is a striking piece of architecture, which may be worth a look, but with the organisers promising an inside experience that “will give visitors an appreciation of the great wisdom and achievements of China’s urban development”, one is tempted to take a detour to the UK pavilion instead.It may look like a giant upended toilet brush, but the waving acrylic rods that cover it will have cool light effects at night.The Spanish pavilion, with its wickerwork walls, seems most appealing so far, while the worst-pavilion winner, Cuba, looks like an abandoned urban petrol station covered in graffiti. Clearly there is something for everyone.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen.
49;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2010-01-31T23:01:56Z;Geely aims to protect Volvo’s luxury image;;Geely, the private Chinese automaker that is closing in on a $2bn deal to buy Volvo from Ford, says it plans to run the Swedish group as a separate entity to protect its brand image both in China and overseas.Freeman Shen, Geely’s vice-president for international operations, told the Financial Times the company had no plans to move Volvo’s main production base or research and development operations to China in the near future.“We want to be careful not to damage the Volvo brand,” says Mr Shen, a US-educated former China head of Fiat Powertrain Technologies, Fiat’s engine development and manufacturing unit.“We don’t want the image of a luxury car made in a third world country [where labour is cheap]. We want the image of a European luxury car, albeit owned by a Chinese owner.” The deal is expected to be signed before China’s lunar new year holiday begins on February 14.Mr Shen made clear that Geely’s goal was to run Volvo profitably as a global luxury brand – not to cannibalise it for either talent or technology to strengthen the company’s existing business in China, which focuses on mostly low-end and some mid-market models. The two companies – Volvo and Geely Auto – will be kept operationally separate.Auto industry analysts are sceptical that Geely, which has never made a big acquisition of an overseas auto brand or run a car business overseas, can turn Volvo round.Car industry history is littered with failed brand acquisitions, including one close to home: the acquisition of South Korea’s Ssangyong Motors by SAIC, the Chinese state-owned auto giant, which ended with Ssangyong being put into receivership. “I don’t assume for a moment that they can successfully run Volvo overseas,” says a senior auto industry insider in Shanghai, noting that cultural integration will be difficult for Geely, which he calls “the most Chinese of Chinese auto companies”.Mr Shen says Geely is aware of the pitfalls, and is studying the lessons of deals such as SAIC-Ssangyong. He expects Volvo to perform better under Geely’s control because “Geely is not fettered by 100 years of automotive history and Mr Li Shufu [Geely’s head] is more flexible, willing to try new ideas and learn from other countries and companies, and will provide better motivation to Volvo’s management”. A study of the global auto industry by consultancy Arthur D Little forecast that Geely would be one of five Chinese automakers to make it into the “exclusive club of global OEM [original equipment manufacturers] champions” by 2020.The strength of the Chinese market will be key to boosting Volvo’s near-term profitability, Mr Shen said, noting that Geely is considering building new production facilities for Volvo in China, where current production is very small.At least 10 provincial and municipal Chinese governments are wooing Geely with incentives to build a plant in their area, but no decision has yet been made. The deal does not depend on shifting Volvo production to a lower-cost base in China. Volvo produced 310,000 cars globally last year, according to Ford, and Geely’s goal for Chinese production of Volvos is 200,000 within five years. Luxury car sales rose 29 per cent last year in China, according to JD Power, the auto consultancy. Cultural integration will be a big challenge, but Mr Shen says that in some ways Swedes are more similar to Chinese than to Americans, since both are “less outspoken”.
50;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-12-08T19:55:34Z;Car sales race ahead in China and India;;Passenger car sales for November in the two fastest growing emerging markets, India and China, provided a further sign that momentum in the car industry is shifting to Asia.China car sales nearly doubled during the month against a year earlier, while in India sales rose 61 per cent on the back of a rebounding economy and a recovery in the car finance market.The robust growth in the two markets follows a landmark transaction in Asia this week when General Motors announced it was ceding majority control of its thriving Chinese passenger car venture to SAIC, its state-owned Chinese partner.The deal was part of a move that will take the Shanghai-Detroit partnership into a $650m joint venture, under which the two groups will produce low-cost vehicles in India.The shareholding change could mark a shift in the balance of power between carmakers in the US and China, now the world’s largest and fastest growing car market.A total of 1.04m passenger cars were sold in November in China, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said this week, helped by heavy lending by state-owned banks and tax cuts targeted at smaller vehicles.In the first 11 months of the year, 9.23m passenger cars were sold in China, up nearly 50 per cent from a year earlier and well ahead of the 6.76m vehicles sold in the whole of 2008, official data showed.The unexpected strength of the Chinese market has bolstered the appetite of some Chinese carmakers to make acquisitions of distressed car assets overseas, although no such deal has yet been completed.China’s market has gone from strength to strength this year, catching car market analysts and industry executives off guard, and making east Asia a bright spot in an industry suffering from the effects of the financial crisis.Market analysts are expecting continued growth in early 2010, especially if, as expected, Beijing continues with its programme of lowering the taxes on cars.In India, vehicle sales growth was boosted by a low base effect from a year earlier but was still ahead of expectations, with suppliers unable to match the pace of the growth.Car sales rose 61 per cent to 133,687 in November from 83,121 a year earlier, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.Between April and November, carmakers have sold 1.22m passenger vehicles, 20 per cent more than a year earlier.Trucks and bus sales in the country doubled from a year earlier to 40,847 units in November.
51;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-12-04T19:06:24Z;China looks to amass distressed auto assets;;A quarter of a century ago, China set out to create a modern automobile industry, almost from scratch. It seemed a daunting prospect.But now the global financial crisis has catapulted China into pole position as the world’s largest auto market, and the financial strength of China’s carmakers has made them bidders of last resort for some of the western world’s favourite distressed auto assets.Is China’s car industry at a turning point, poised to launch out on the great global venture Beijing has always dreamt of?Beijing must have been pleased to see that on Friday China’s biggest automaker, SAIC, gained control of Shanghai GM, its car-making joint venture with General Motors – and one of GM’s most attractive businesses.GM insisted that the deal, which gives SAIC 51 per cent of Shanghai GM, was worth it, since it paved the way for a potentially profitable joint venture between Detroit and Shanghai to sell low-cost vehicles to emerging markets starting with India. With a new $650m joint venture in India, this would give SAIC-GM joint ventures in all the important Asian markets bar Japan (where foreign automakers do not normally get much of a look in).Then came news that another big state-owned Chinese automaker, Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Corporation (BAIC), had arranged a Rmb20bn ($2.9bn) line of credit with Bank of China. BAIC has made no secret that it is interested in GM’s Saab brand, which the Detroit carmaker plans to sell if it can find a suitable buyer by year end. BAIC, which has already approached Saab’s management about buying machinery to produce its outgoing 9-5 model, now has the money to buy the brand, should GM be ready to sell to a Chinese competitor.Earlier in the week, banking sources said Geely, one of China’s largest privately-owned automakers, had arranged $1bn in finance for its bid for Volvo.Many auto market analysts remain sceptical of whether Chinese automakers can make a success of distressed brands that failed under US or European management. Some question whether the deals will ever get done: the Volvo sale has dragged on for months, and GM said this week it would give its attempt to find a buyer just one more week after a bid led by Sweden’s Koenigsegg that included BAIC as a minority partner fell apart.The only such deal yet signed – in which GM will sell its Hummer unit to the heavy equipment maker, Sichuan Tengzhong for about $150m – has not yet gained Chinese government approval.But SAIC’s deal with GM to sell cheap cars and mini commercial vehicles to India could be different. It’s strong financial position could help GM take a bigger share of the Indian market, while giving SAIC a foothold in one of the world’s fastest growing car markets.“This could be what China always wanted: forget BAIC and Saab, Geely and Volvo – what SAIC has done is potentially much bigger,” said one Shanghai-based auto analyst. It is still early days in the quest for global power of the Chinese automaker. But on Friday was a potentially significant day in the story of foreign automakers in China, at the very least.Many analysts were baffled by GM’s decision to give up control of one of fastest growing and important joint ventures. “It’s ceding precious ground,” says Mike Dunne, an auto analyst who focuses on Asian markets. “Nobody in the industry wants to give up ownership”.But Ashvin Chotai, managing director of Intelligence Automotive Asia, a UK-based consultancy, said that the decision to team up with SAIC in India – which unlike China does not require foreign carmakers to take a local partner – could be interpreted as a sign of GM’s confidence in the two companies’ relationship.“GM doesn’t have to work in India with SAIC, but it has chosen to,” he said. “Without any government pressure or restrictions, they’ve chosen to work in India with a partner.”He said that the two companies’ move into India was a significant development for the commercial vehicles market, which is dominated by local producers.
52;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-12-04T18:56:30Z;GM cedes control of China venture;;General Motors is to cede majority control of its thriving Chinese passenger car venture to its state-owned Chinese partner, SAIC, as part of a deal that will also take the Shanghai-Detroit partnership into a new $650m joint venture selling low-cost vehicles in India.The deal, announced on Friday in Shanghai, underlines the aggressive overseas ambitions of Chinese carmakers and could mark a symbolically important shift in the balance of power between carmakers in the US and China, now the world’s largest and fastest growing car market.And in a sign that another large state-owned Chinese carmaker, Beijing Automotive Industry Corp, might be keen to buy GM’s Saab unit, Bank of China said it had arranged a Rmb20bn ($2.9bn) line of credit for BAIC, enough to finance a potential bid.The Beijing-based carmaker has said it remains interested in Saab, and has talked with its management about buying production equipment for its outgoing 9-5 model. BAIC was part of the consortium led by Koenigsegg, the Swedish luxury car maker, which pulled out of talks to buy Saab last week.GM and SAIC plan to form an equally controlled joint venture to make and sell small cars and mini commercial vehicles in India, and eventually in other emerging markets.Nick Reilly, head of GM’s international operations, said GM would contribute about $300m-$350m in assets to the $650m venture, including its existing manufacturing plant in India.The move will give SAIC and GM their third big partnership in Asia, alongside joint ventures in China and Korea.Mr Reilly said the 1 per cent stake in Shanghai GM which would be sold to SAIC was worth about $85m. GM was selling the stake to its Chinese partner so that SAIC could consolidate earnings from Shanghai GM, which it is prevented from doing under Chinese accounting rules without a majority stake.“Without consolidating Shanghai GM, they can’t reflect the true value of the company,” Mr Reilly said.“Over the past decade, SAIC and GM have created one of the world’s most successful automotive industry partnerships,” Mr Reilly said.“Both companies felt this was the proper time to deepen co-operation beyond China’s borders.”He also said: “It doesn’t have anything to do with GM’s restructuring.”Car market analysts said the deal made obvious sense for SAIC but questioned what GM had got in exchange for stepping down to junior partner in Shanghai GM.“Why would any automaker give up a 50-50 relationship in the largest, fastest growing and most promising auto market in the world?” asked Michael Dunne, a car consultant specialising in Asian markets.People close to GM said the deal was motivated by a desire to strengthen trust with SAIC and ensure the success of the Indian partnership.In a separate development, GM has agreed to take control of its Canadian manufacturing venture with Suzuki, buying the Japanese group’s 50 per cent share for an undisclosed sum.The move comes a year after the companies ended a longstanding capital alliance. GM, which owned as much as 20 per cent of Suzuki earlier this decade, sold its remaining 3 per cent stake in November last year.By buying Suzuki’s half of the Ingersoll, Ontario, plant, GM will be able to move more production to Canada, where costs are lower than in the US. GM said it planned to double overall capacity at the plant to 40,000 vehicles annually.Suzuki has shifted its focus from North America to emerging markets such as India, where its affiliate Maruti Suzuki controls half the market.With additional reporting by Jung-A Song and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
53;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-09-11T17:56:51Z;Car plant echoes to whisper of output;;Seen from Longbridge, MG Rover’s former base, the business’s industrial legacy five years on looks decidedly threadbare.In one portion of the cavernous and mostly deserted plant – once one of Europe’s largest – China’s Shanghai Automotive (SAIC), owner of the rump MG brand, began making its TF two-seater sports car last year in small numbers for the UK and Ireland, using Chinese and European parts.The company will not comment on production volumes, but acknowledges they are modest. “It’s not MG Rover numbers – it’s a single model we’re producing,” says Peter Brooking, marketing manager for MG Motor UK.Most MG cars are now made in China. In 2006, a year after buying rights to the brand from MG Rover’s liquidators, Nanjing Automobile Corporation moved an entire production line from Birmingham to its hometown halfway across the world in 4,900 shipping containers.SAIC, which has since taken over NAC, also bought rights to some Rover models, made now under the Roewe brand.Notwithstanding the much-diminished output at Longbridge – or the thousands of jobs lost when MG Rover collapsed– other brands from its erstwhile portfolio are thriving under new ownership.BMW has built the Mini brand to annual production of more than 200,000 cars, from only about 12,000 a year before the Munich carmaker bought it. It now employs about 3,500 people, from a few hundred when MG Rover owned it.Norbert Reithofer, BMW’s chief executive, announced plans last week to bring production of two new models to the brand’s plant in Cowley near Oxford in a move expected to create 1,000 or more jobs.Land Rover, sold to Ford Motor and then to Tata Motors last year, has arguably also fared better under new owners. It recorded its highest-ever sales in 2007 as Ford was selling it.The brand’s sales have wilted over the past year – down 38 per cent in the first half of 2009 on a year ago – but together with Jaguar it remains one of Britain’s largest carmakers.“There is a strong argument to say that even if you take into account the sad demise of MG Rover, the UK motor industry is much better off than it was,” says Paul Everitt, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
54;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-02-19T01:57:33Z;Right chance, wrong time for China carmakers;;"Each day brings a new rumour about a troubled US carmaker peddling brands to China: one day Ford is rumoured to be selling Volvo to Chery, one of China’s biggest car companies; the next day General Motors is said to be selling Hummer to little Sichuan Motors.Nothing is impossible in China but, as US automakers scramble to raise funds, car industry insiders in China say they do not expect Beijing to take over Detroit in the near future. They say that most Chinese companies lack the money, the expertise or the appetite for risk required to buy a foreign auto brand now – and many lack all three.“Chinese automakers find the prospect of owning a foreign brand tantalising but it’s the right opportunity at the wrong time,” says Mike Dunne of JD Power, the auto consultancy, in Shanghai. “Uncertain economic conditions make them skittish: surviving at home is the number one priority.”He adds that things could be different if market conditions change, noting that some companies have cash or could secure government funding. But sources close to some of China’s biggest automakers say they know they do not have the expertise to manage a foreign brand in a downturn abroad, especially at a time of depressed sales at home.The failure of Shanghai Automotive (SAIC), China’s biggest carmaker, to make a success of its high-profile acquisition of 51 per cent of Ssangyong, the South Korean automaker that was recently placed in bankruptcy protection, is a cautionary tale that has not been lost on Beijing.SAIC says it has learned from its problems with Ssangyong’s labour unions, and the experience will make it “more confident and experienced about purchasing and operating overseas operations” in future.But sources close to the company say not to expect another acquisition soon. “Our current priority is obviously to capture domestic market growth,” SAIC says.Zheng Jun, auto analyst at Citic Securities, says auto assets currently up for sale are not a good match for Chinese companies anyway.“The core competence of Chinese manufacturers lies in low-cost management,” Mr Zheng says, noting that “it would be very hard for Geely to leverage the purchase of Volvo, because Geely hardly has any know-how in luxury brands”.Volvo speculation often focuses on Geely and Chery, which recently won a Rmb10bn ($1.46bn) line of credit from China’s Export-Import Bank. But industry insiders say they do not believe Chery will buy a foreign brand.Meanwhile, Ford has made preliminary contacts with Chinese car companies in its quest to sell Volvo, industry insiders say."
55;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-01-12T17:01:43Z;SAIC urged to help Ssangyong;;South Korea’s financial regulator called on China’s Shanghai Automotive (SAIC) to do more to help save its Ssangyong Motor unit after the Korean carmaker was last week forced to file for bankruptcy protection.The plea came as Ssangyong’s union voted in favour of a strike and called on the South Korean government to inject cash into the country’s smallest carmaker.“The top shareholder, lead creditor and the court should make efforts for Ssangyong’s survival,” Rhee Chang-yong, the deputy head of the Financial Services Commission, told a local radio station.The South Korean government has previously refused to come to the assistance of Ssangyong unless SAIC, which paid about $500m for a 49 per cent stake in Ssangyong in 2004, put in additional capital.But Mr Rhee said on Monday, Seoul was considering aid to ensure job security at Ssangyong as well as its parts makers. He added that the government would decide whether to help Ssangyong after a Korean court had ruled on whether to accept the filing for bankruptcy protection.The Seoul Central District Court said yesterday it had frozen Ssangyong’s debts and obligations for the time being until it made a decision on whether to accept Ssangyong’s application for court receivership early next month.Ssangyong is one of South Korea’s first big casualties of the global crisis that has led to a slump in demand for cars. The carmaker has been hit by falling demand for sports utility vehicles and funding difficulties.SAIC, which last month injected $45m into Ssangyong to provide short-term liquidity, has been reluctant to provide additional support to its Korean unit.Last week SAIC said that putting Ssangyong into receivership was the best option for the unit. SAIC said then that it would work with all parties to help “normalise” Ssangyong’s operations. However, the Chinese carmaker declined to comment further on Monday.Ssangyong’s main union said on Monday that 71 per cent of its 5,160 union members had voted in favour of a strike but that they would not go on strike immediately. “We should be prudent about launching a strike in consideration of the difficult situation,” said Lee Chang-geun, a union spokesman.“We will deal with this legally and are taking procedures to hold SAIC accountable.”The union said it might be willing to accept wage cuts and job sharing as part of a restructuring plan.Ssangyong has said it plans to reduce salaries by up to 30 per cent over the next two years and downsize its workforce through a voluntary retirement programme.
56;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-01-09T18:12:12Z;Ssangyong Motor files for receivership;;Ssangyong Motor filed for court receivership on Friday to avoid bankruptcy, becoming one of South Korea’s first big casualties of the globalcrisis that has led to a slump in demand for cars.The move to place the smallest of Korea’s carmakers into receivership ends Shanghai Automotive’s four-year management control over the Korean carmaker. SAIC’s 2004 purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Ssangyong was the first overseas buy-out by a Chinese carmaker.Ssangyong, which has reported four consecutive quarters of losses, called the move an “inevitable choice” to cope with acute liquidity problems after its car sales dropped 30 per cent last year. It added that Choi Hyung-tak and Zhang Haitao had both stepped down as co-chief executives.The news came as Hyundai Motor, Korea’s largest carmaker, said it would cut production at its domestic plants by 25-30 per cent to offset a slump in demand.SAIC said on Friday that its board agreed that putting Ssangyong into receivership was the best option. The Chinese group added it had been in discussion with Ssangyong on its cashflow problems but that nothing had emerged from the talks.Last month, SAIC injected $45m into Ssangyong to provide short-term liquidity, but is reluctant to provide additional support, citing Ssangyong’s high labour costs and slumping demand for sports utility vehicles.The South Korean government and creditors have refused to aid Ssangyong – which idled its main production line for three weeks last year and delayed payment of salaries – unless SAIC puts in additional capital.“The application means the exit of SAIC from Ssangyong. SAIC itself has seen its earnings deteriorate rapidly in recent months so it did not have room to aid Ssangyong,” said Lee Sang-hyun, analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities.The court will decide whether to liquidate Ssangyong or revive it after consultation with creditors.Ssangyong said on Friday it would try to cut costs by reducing salaries by up to 30 per cent over the next two years and downsizing its workforce through a voluntary retirement programme.Korea Development Bank, Ssangyong’s biggest creditor, estimates that Ssangyong needs Won600bn ($443m) of new financing to stay afloat. And Ssangyong has to pay back Won150bn of maturing debt in April.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai
57;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2009-01-01T18:22:29Z;New models made exclusively for China;;At the Beijing auto show in April, Volkswagen lifted the wraps on the Lavida, a car that shared some components with the Golf but was conceived, born and would be sold entirely in China.Europe’s largest carmaker now sells more VW-brand vehicles in China than it does in Germany, and the Lavida was brought to life by a Shanghai design team that took cues from Chinese comic-book warriors, cultural motifs and a mythical 32-year-old target customer known as Mr Chen.“This is a Chinese car made in China, but with VW brand values,” says Holger Dietze, an executive with VW in China, showing off the Lavida.VW has partnered in a joint venture with China’s SAIC to produce the Lavida and has pre-sold more than 30,000 units since premiering in July.“Have you seen a VW like this? It looks a little bit Chinese,” Mr Dietze jokes.In addition to mining Chinese culture and iconography, VW pored over demographic trends and focus-group data when designing the car.The process illustrates the extent to which models are now being made exclusively for China.Foreign carmakers have for years chopped and changed their existing models for Chinese tastes, loading them with features favoured locally like extra chrome highlights and light-coloured interior upholstery and trim.Some stiffen their cars’ suspension so they can handle China’s potholed city streets.BMW and Audi, VW’s premium brand, make a longer wheelbase of their existing A4 and 7-Series models for China, where stretch models are popular for businessmen who use chauffeurs. Audi installed a heated cup-holder into its A8 model after noting Chinese drivers’ preference for green tea.But with the industry’s centre of gravity now moving to China, carmakers are now designing models exclusively for the market.As demand for cars slumps almost everywhere else, China’s market is still growing in single digits year-on-year.“China is so fresh and young, they don’t have the burden of the old historical cars,” says Friedhelm Engler, director of design for GM’s Shanghai-based Pan-Asian Technical Automotive Centre, which designed two recent Buick and Cadillac models. “We can react to the needs of the customer.”VW, looking to target younger Chinese consumers, spent three years designing the concept car that became the Lavida.The project was originally called “Model Y” for Generation Y – the up-and-coming young Chinese clients that VW hopes to win.VW’s Shanghai team designed the new car with Mr Chen, its ideal young customer, in mind.The car was given headlamps like the eyes of Nezha, a mythical Chinese warrior, who had magical weapons and fought evil spirits.Its front grille was designed with Chinese-style hatching.The Neeza concept car premiered in 2006, before being modified in production form as the Lavida, minus some of its wilder design elements such as front-opening rear-end “suicide” doors.To lure demanding Chinese customers in one of the world’s most competitive car markets, VW used higher-specification electronics in the Lavida, which it now plans to use in Germany.“They can learn something from us,” says Mr Dietze.While spending more on electronics in the car than it would in Germany, VW spent less on other things Chinese customers care less about, like the car’s rear axle.As China’s car market broadens from early, wealthy adopters in rich coastal cities to its burgeoning middle class, other carmakers are joining VW in pursuing younger trendsetters.Three-box sedans remain the most popular car shape in China, where European-style hatchbacks have yet to catch on.Their popularity makes many of the vehicles on Chinese roads reminiscent of mid-20th-century America.Designers say that the bulky, three-box shape is culturally embedded in a country where the idea of “face” is important and powerful men have always ridden above the crowds, whether in sedan chairs or luxury cars.“If you look at history, that’s how emperors travelled here,” says GM’s Mr Engler. China could join other countries in shifting to smaller cars, he adds, as parking becomes a growing problem in congested cities such as Shanghai.Ford recently launched a shorter, “two-box” version of its five-door Focus compact in China.The car has sold well among upwardly mobile under-30 Chinese, says Nigel Harris, vice-president of Ford’s Chinese operation.The company also had a focus-group examine a five-door hatchback version of its new Fiesta small car. The result? “They really loved the five-door, but said, ‘My parents won’t approve, so I’ll get the four-door’,” says Mr Harris.
58;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
59;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2008-10-19T21:32:52Z;Geely pushes for electric black cabs;;Geely, the Chinese carmaker that co-owns the company that produces black London taxis, has met UK government officials about bringing electric-powered cabs to the UK capital.“One of our ideas is to convert London taxis [to electric cars],” Li Shufu, the company’s chairman, told the Financial Times in an interview. “We are doing research on this project.”Geely owns about 23 per cent of Manganese Bronze, the UK-based producer of black London cabs, and 51 per cent of a Shanghai-based joint venture that will produce the cars in China starting in December.Mr Li said he had discussed the idea of electric taxis with Boris Johnson, London’s mayor, at the Beijing Games in August.Earlier this year, Manganese Bronze signed a research and development agreement with Tanfield Electric Vehicles to develop all-electric plug-in taxis.The company has seen its share price slump in recent weeks after Transport for London ordered hundreds of the company’s TX4 cabs off the streets after a series of engine fires.Geely, like China’s other carmakers, is developing its own plug-in hybrid and electric cars, including an electric version of its Panda city car that it may seek to sell in Europe. Geely’s plan to build London taxis in Shanghai is one of a string of investments by Chinese companies seeking to apply low-cost production to iconic overseas assets.Rival carmaker SAIC recently relaunched production of MG TF sports cars in Birmingham, and the group makes Roewe-brand cars in China largely based on tools and designs formerly owned by bankrupt MG Rover.LTI Shanghai Automobile, the joint venture, plans to sell the Shanghai-built cabs to taxi operators, hotels and other buyers in China and overseas, eventually building 10,000 vehicles a year.“We think the taxi can present a kind of British culture, which is traditional and iconic and elegant,” said Yu Wei, general manager. “British people have a really serious culture, and Chinese people are hard-working. If we can combine [British] culture with [Chinese] diligence, together we can produce a very good product.”
60;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2008-07-09T16:57:33Z;SAIC’s new model appeals to national pride;;Nationalism is never far below the surface in China. But will it help Shanghai Automotive (SAIC), China’s largest locally-owned carmaker, sell its sporty, stylish home-grown car, the Roewe 550?The model, star of the Beijing car show, was launched to great fanfare last month as SAIC’s highest profile “made in China” vehicle. Chinese carmakers have a reputation for imitating foreign brands, and selling barely-disguised copies as home-grown cars.But the Roewe 550 is different. SAIC recruited former Rover engineers to work with Chinese engineers to design the car, partly in the UK and partly in China.For SAIC and for China, much is riding on the Roewe 550’s success, said Mike Dunne of JD Power.The 550’s derivative predecessor, the Roewe 750, largely flopped.“If they strike out again, it will be highly significant for the prospects of a state-owned company designing, building and marketing cars in China”, Mr Dunne said.SAIC is touting the vehicle’s range of digital devices (a big attraction for Chinese consumers) and has given the car a push-button start – because luxury cars in China often offer such features. But a key is still needed to open the car, and to insert into the push-button ignition.At a Shanghai showroom recently, an SAIC saleswoman started her sales pitch about the 550 by pointing out that the exterior looked like a BMW.In spite of Chinese nationalism, consumer pragmatism often wins the day. “They ultimately say, it’s my money and I’m not going to go with the flag,” said Mr Dunne.Zhang Shi, an office worker who saw the car at a Shanghai shopping mall, said: “Usually, for domestic made cars, you have to give up the looks to get a lower price or better function.”Additional reporting by Yang Jie in Shanghai
61;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2008-04-20T17:35:57Z;China carmakers go green in drive for profit;;China’s carmakers are embracing next-generation cleaner-car technology, motivated more by profit and pragmatism than any special love for the planet.Rising manufacturers such as Chery Automobile and Geely are developing or launching hybrid, electric and other alternative-energy vehicles, betting that China can follow its successes in mobile phones and digital technology by becoming a leader in greener cars.On Sunday at Auto China, China’s largest motor show, Geely showed an electric car with the slogan “I’m going green” emblazoned on the side, which it said it planned to introduce next year.Shanghai Automotive, or SAIC, China’s largest domestic carmaker, said it would be producing more than 10,000 hybrid cars a year by 2010, including those made by its joint venture partners, General Motors and Volkswagen. Chery premiered a planned hybrid that it will pilot at the Olympic games.Their belief – and that of their supporters in government – is that China is positioned to vault past existing automotive models into the new technologies, which require regulators’ support in areas such as tax policy and investment in new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.Given China’s size and ability to set standards, the argument goes, they might then dominate the next generation of carmaking as well as key supplier industries such as lithium-ion batteries.“Chinese manufacturers all want the next big opportunity to leapfrog their competitors,” says Jian Sun, a partner with AT Kearney in Shanghai.China is due to eclipse the US as the world’s largest car market in about a decade but this is contributing to heavy pollution and urban congestion.However, the local industry’s push into greener cars appears to be motivated mostly by China’s preoccupation with energy security and a desire to build a world-class auto industry.“China is a country that is short of energy,” Jin Yibo, Chery’s assistant general manager, told the Financial Times. “Chery believes this is the future trend of the Chinese automobile industry.”Carmakers also need to raise their game as weak demand in the US and Europe makes China’s burgeoning market a central competitive arena for the global industry.“Chinese carmakers are trying to move up the value chain and the brand-positioning chain,” says Michael Dunne, of JD Power, a consultancy.
62;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2008-04-20T17:16:02Z;SAIC plans UK comeback for MG TF roadster;;Shanghai Automotive (SAIC), China’s largest locally-owned carmaker, is to resume production of the iconic MG TF roadster at its UK plant in July, according to its president.With plans to resume MG production at its plant in Longbridge, the carmaker is also to consider exporting its own-brand, Chinese-made Roewe cars to Europe, Chen Hong told the Financial Times on Sunday.In the wake of Tata Motors’ recent purchase of Jaguar and Land Rover, the TF’s relaunch is being followed by the industry as a test case for an Asian manufacturer’s skill in managing a well-known European premium car brand.SAIC, which merged with its smaller regional rival Nanjing Automobile last year, intends to resume production of the TF at the end of this month in China, three months before its planned production date in the UK.“We will try to launch production at the end of July and bring the car to market at the end of August,” Mr Chen said.MG has 55 dealers in the UK, and also plans to sell its roadster in Europe.NAC bought the MG brand and its production assets in 2005, and shipped most of the plant to Nanjing. SAIC acquired the rights for some of the carmaker’s models, which it renamed Roewe.SAIC, which has joint ventures with General Motors and Volkswagen – China’s two largest foreign carmakers – wants to build up its own brand to cash in on China’s booming car market. Mr Chen said a possible launch of export sales into eastern and western Europe was being considered.In a country in which carmakers are establishing themselves and fighting foreign brands for market share, SAIC touts its British ties.Its stand this week at the Auto China show in Beijing was adorned with images of Tower Bridge, William Shakespeare, a red telephone booth and a teapot with cup of tea.The TF model has a large fan base in Europe and the US, but has been off the market for three years in an industry characterised by rapid product improvements. Mr Chen said its pricing would be “competitive”.SAIC delayed the TF relaunch because of the merger as well as concerns about ensuring its quality. “The manufacturing consistency is stable, and we’re very comfortable with the quality,” Mr Chen said.Supplier company Stadco, which had been expected to provide body panels for the TF, withdrew from a supply deal. The brand will now source them from China, Mr Chen said.
63;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2008-02-04T23:04:43Z;MG roadster poised to return;;China’s Shanghai Automotive (SAIC) hopes to begin producing the MG TF roadster in Nanjing in May and at its plant in Longbridge, UK, within three months of that date, a senior executive said yesterday.But SAIC admitted the car’s long-awaited relaunch could be delayed again as it grapples with quality issues and rebuilds tooling bought in 2005 from bankrupt MG Rover and shipped to China by Nanjing Automobile (NAC), with which SAIC merged in December.“We want to begin production of cars at Longbridge as soon as possible, but the first priority for us is the quality of the product,” Chen Hong, SAIC’s president, told the Financial Times yesterday.“If we launch the product on the UK market and don’t have sufficient quality to meet customers’ expectations, we damage the brand.”The relaunch of MG’s two-seater, which has a passionate UK and US following, will mark the highest-profile European debut yet for a Chinese-made car. SAIC has selected 50 dealers to sell the car, and distributed a teaser brochure of the roadster with the slogan “A New Journey”.MG is also studying at least three new models, including a replacement for the TF, which it hopes to produce from 2010, Mr Chen said. However, the carmaker is still building a supply base in China and Europe that would allow it to meet European quality standards. About 70 per cent of the cars’ content, including their engines, will be made in China, and 30 per cent in Europe.“From the point of view of SAIC, more time is needed for quality,” Mr Chen said.Other Chinese carmakers, including Chery Automobile, have recently postponed export plans over quality concerns. Some early Chinese cars exported to Germany have performed poorly in crash tests and been derided in the motoring press.“They realise the eyes of the world are upon them,” a person close to SAIC’s management said yesterday.SAIC is one of China’s biggest and most ambitious carmakers, with joint ventures with General Motors and Volkswagen. It acquired some of MG Rover’s model rights and makes a version of the Rover 750 saloon in China, rebranded “Roewe”.NAC had planned to relaunch the MG TF last year, before being sidelined by the merger.The May launch schedule for the MG TF was “very tight,” Mr Chen acknowledged. The UK production launch would come “one, two or three months later”.
64;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2008-01-15T22:57:57Z;Timing will be everything for Chinese carmakers;;Once again, Chinese car companies are grabbing a large slice of attention at the Detroit Motor Show. There were two companies last year: this year five.BYD, which started life making batteries for mobile phones, is even talking about bringing a hybrid to the US by 2010.Among industry executives, it is almost a given that within a few years, one or two Chinese companies will have made the transition to global players. Yet there is less than meets the eye to the Chinese delegation at Detroit.The two companies considered most likely to do well overseas – Chery and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) – have given the show a wide berth. Once the most aggressive, Chery has delayed its plans to enter the US until it improves its engines, while SAIC has yet to outline export plans. Of the five companies at Detroit, only Geely has a strong position in the Chinese market, although BYD is gaining ground. One of the companies, Li Shi Guang Ming, does not even have a licence to sell cars in China.Therein lies the risk for China’s carmakers. It will only take one company to mess up on engine quality or service standards in the US to damage the reputation of the entire industry. China’s cost advantage will not last for ever but enter the US too soon, and the sector will be set back years.Chance of a lifetimeEvery student of history should remember the Battle of Lepanto. For those who might have forgotten, it took place in 1571 in the waters off western Greece and was the last major naval battle to be fought solely between rowing vessels.The Holy League, a coalition of the Republic of Venice, the Papacy, Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Duchy of Savoy and the Knights of Malta, routed the Ottoman fleet. As a result, the Holy League gained temporary control of the Mediterranean, protected Rome from invasion and prevented the Ottomans from advancing into Europe.More than four centuries later, a new coalition of European interests is being formed to block what they consider is an undesirable and extremely dangerous incursion by the South Koreans into European shipbuilding.Brussels too has launched an in-depth investigation into the purchase by South Korea’s STX shipbuilding group of a 39.2 per cent stake in Aker Yards, the Norwegian shipbuilding group.The French were the first to sound the alarm. After all, the former owner of Aker Yards – the flamboyant Norwegian self-made businessman Kjell Inge Rokke – was considered in France as the saviour of the famous Alstom shipyards when he bought 75 per cent control of the Saint-Nazaire and Lorient yards two years ago. The French became nervous when he later sold his controlling stake in Aker Yards, and positively appalled when the South Koreans moved in.So was the Norwegian group’s management, which has enlisted the support of investment banks, including JPMorgan, to help it devise alternative strategies to contain the South Koreans. And now the Italians have not only joined this new coalition but indeed are being urged to lead it by their European partners, just as they did in 1571 against the Turks.The Europeans fear the South Korean move will undermine their leadership in building high technology giant cruise ships and large ferries. The South Koreans have already said they wanted to enter the cruise ship market and intend to transfer European know-how and design back home. Through Aker Yards, they now control the French yards that built some of the world’s most famous cruise ships and transatlantic liners such as the Normandy and more recently the Queen Mary 2.As for Fincantieri, Italy’s state-owned shipbuilding group, as the world’s leading cruise ship manufacturer it would have everything to lose if the South Koreans entered the market and acquired European cruise ship expertise via Aker’s French and Finnish yards.French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his advisers have discussed with Italian premier Romano Prodi and his aides the possibility of a European response to the threat. The idea, which is gaining growing industry and political support across Europe (the Germans are also worried) would be for Fincantieri to merge with Aker Yards and take control of the Norwegian group. This would involve a friendly bid and, as an added bonus, would finally enable the Italian government to privatise part of the Italian shipbuilding group.Rome has wanted to open up Fincantieri’s capital for months. Given the company’s fine financial and industrial form, the management has also been dying for a flotation to support more growth and expansion. The problem is that one small but radical union has been opposing any state sell-off and has managed to block the process. Rather than acting as the South Koreans’ secret weapon, perhaps it will see sense and not sabotage a once in a lifetime opportunity for Fincantieri to consolidate its own European leadership and see off the Korean threat at the same timeworld.view@ft.com
65;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2007-09-07T16:46:26Z;Chrysler names new Asia chief;;Chrysler announced another high-profile management appointment on Friday after it persuaded Phil Murtaugh, the former head of General Motors’ successful China business, to run its Asian operations.The news comes a day after the US group, which was taken private by Cerberus Capital Management last month, announced that Toyota’s respected North American head Jim Press was joining its senior management team.For the past year Mr Murtaugh has been an executive vice-president at Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation, one of China’s largest and most ambitious carmakers.His departure will be a blow to the international expansion plans of the Chinese group, which two years ago bought some of the assets of the UK’s Rover group and has since launched its first own-brand car in the Chinese market.Mr Murtaugh said the Chrysler job was “an offer I just cannot turn down”.Before joining SAIC, Mr Murtaugh was chairman of GM’s China operations for five years and played a central role in building up the business from nearly scratch to the second-largest brand in the Chinese market.He was instrumental in forging GM’s successful joint venture with SAIC.Chrysler has a minimal presence in the Chinese market, selling just over 5,000 cars in the first half of the year.However, it recently signed a manufacturing joint venture with Chery, another of the country’s most ambitious carmakers, to make small cars for both the Chinese market and overseas.Bob Nardelli, Chrysler’s new chairman, has made striking new international alliances one of the priorities for the US carmaker and Mr Murtaugh will have the task of building new partnerships in Asian markets.He has close knowledge of Chery, especially after GM launched a lawsuit against the Chinese company for allegedly copying one of its small-car models, which was later settled out of court.When SAIC first acquired assets from Rover, the Chinese group set an ambitious target for beginning exports of the new models.However, after Mr Murtaugh arrived at the company, SAIC set a more cautious path, saying it would focus on its home market first.Mr Murtaugh’s main responsibility was trying to turn round Ssangyong, the struggling Korean carmaker that SAIC controls.
66;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Chinese carmakers moot merger;;"Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation (SAIC) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the parent of rival Nanjing Automobile under which the companies will discuss “all-round” co-operation and a possible merger of their auto operations.Such a merger would bring together two state-owned companies currently competing head-on in China, with saloons based on designs and technology acquired from defunct British carmaker MG Rover.It would also be a boost for Chinese government efforts to promote consolidation in the auto industry as part of its strategy of cultivating domestic champions capable of effectively competing with international rivals.SAIC’s listed arm, Shanghai Automobile, said in a statement that the MOU
had been signed after “friendly, frank and honest” talks between its parent and Nanjing Auto’s controlling shareholder Yuejin Auto Group.However, Shanghai Auto stressed that the MOU did not “constitute any substantive commitment” and there were “numerous uncertainties” about the prospects for future co-operation.Nanjing Auto has long been seen as an acquisition target for rivals such as SAIC, which is China’s largest carmaker and produced 1.34m vehicles last year, according to state media.Shanghai Auto is determined to build its own-brand car business and recently began producing a version of the Rover 75 saloon based on rights acquired before the UK company went bankrupt.However, Nanjing Auto surprised Shanghai Auto by winning the bidding for MG Rover’s operations and its famous brand, and is also producing a model based on the Rover 75 for the Chinese market.SAIC is seen by some as unenthusiastic about acquiring or merging with Nanjing Auto, which is financially weaker and whose joint venture with Fiat of Italy is seen as one of the domestic industry’s also-rans.Shanghai Auto’s statement made clear that the impetus for co-operation came from the government, saying the MOU was “in accordance with strategic requirements for development of the Yangtze River Delta”.Hu Maoyan, chairman of SAIC, said in April that his company was looking forward to cooperating with Nanjing Auto and that state assets should be used “more efficiently and effectively”.Institutional interests often make Chinese state companies resistant to efforts by Beijing to promote consolidation or to restrain competition.Local leaders in Nanjing and Shanghai – the two most important cities in the Yangtze Delta – could also prove unwilling to accept any loss of influence over companies that they see as pillars of the industrial development."
67;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2007-04-15T21:10:05Z;Nanjing unveils MG sports car plan;;Nanjing Automobile Corporation, the Chinese auto company, plans to restore production of the iconic MG TF sports car and other models at Longbridge, near Birmingham, to about 50,000 within two years.The company, which began producing MG cars in its home city last month, also plans to develop a new, “very good sports car that would fit in with the brand” by 2009, according to its top executive in the UK.“Within two years we would like to get our market share back, and get good products with a UK focus,” Wang Hongbiao, chairman of NAC (UK) told the Financial Times in an interview. The brand, which NAC bought from MG Rover’s administrators in 2005, sold 44,337 cars in 2004 and 54,306 in 2003.Production at Longbridge will resume in late May or early June and reach the “lower thousands” this year, and about 25,000 in 2008. Employment could reach 500-800 by the end of next year, against 140 now.NAC has invested about $500m (£250m) in the MG project to date, including in its Nanjing plant, which has the capacity to produce 200,000 cars.Longbridge will source some parts from China for its UK-made MGs, including engines and gearboxes.Mr Wang also said a plan to license assembly of MG cars in Ardmore, Oklahoma, was “going very well”, although NAC had not yet signed an agreement.The company’s relaunch of MG marks the first takeover by an emerging Chinese carmaker of an established western brand and its manufacturing assets.Shanghai Auto or SAIC, NAC’s regional rival, bought South Korean car producer Ssangyong in 2005.Founded in 1947, NAC produced China’s first-ever light truck, during the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong’s drive in the late 1950s to “catch up with the British and overtake the US”.MG will face tough competition in the high-performance car segment, dominated by more experienced companies such as BMW and Volkswagen’s Audi marque.MG’s Chinese owners are looking to reassemble a network of 50 UK dealers.In China, NAC has lagged behind competitors such as SAIC, which bought rights to former Rover models after MG Rover’s collapse.NAC’s main joint venture partner, Italy’s Fiat, has underperformed other foreign carmakers in the Chinese market.In China, Mr Wang said MG was considering replacing the MG TF’s soft top with a hard top to take into account weather and pollution. “We are taking traditions from the British, and positioning it as a Chinese model,” he said.
68;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2006-11-17T22:02:48Z;SAIC puts brakes on Rover export plan;;Shanghai Automotive (SAIC) has postponed plans to export Rover-based cars to Europe and the US in order to concentrate on the Chinese market, a senior executive said on Friday.Phil Murtaugh, the former head of General Motors in China who now runs Shanghai Auto’s international operations, said the company would only begin to export the cars once they had become successful in the local market.His comments are the latest indication that the much-hyped invasion of the US and European car markets by Chinese brands will be much slower than had been expected. Chery and Geely, two other ambitious Chinese carmakers, have also recently delayed their planned entry to the US market. Shanghai Auto executives said earlier in the year that they hoped to begin selling the Rover-based cars in the UK and some other European countries from 2007.“We have to get it right at home before we go outside of China,” said Mr Murtaugh in the first interview he has given since moving to Shanghai Auto in September. “I do not know when we will start exporting.”Shanghai Auto bought the rights to the designs of two Rover models shortly before the UK carmaker collapsed last year. Another Chinese company, Nanjing Auto, later acquired the rights to several MG models. The Rover name is owned by Ford and Shanghai Auto is launching its cars in the Chinese market under the new brand-name Roewe, although analysts believe it will try to acquire the rights to the Rover name from Ford when it launches its vehicles overseas.State-owned Shanghai Auto is considered one of the Chinese companies with the best chances of successfully building its own car brand because of its manufacturing pedigree – its joint ventures with General Motors and Volkswagen are the biggest carmakers in the fast-growing Chinese market.Mr Murtaugh said the company would be able to build quality cars but the biggest challenge it faced was establishing a good customer service system, of which few Chinese companies had any experience.Although a number of multinational companies are considering exporting cars from their plants in China, Mr Murtaugh said there was little chance that the carmaking industry would shift to China, as many other manufacturing sectors have, because wages were rising quickly.“There are not going to be too many more years when you will see low-cost and China in the same sentence,” he said. “It is really expensive to put cars on a boat and ship them around the world. Why do you think the Japanese and Koreans have invested so much in new plants in the US?”A number of senior industry executives are in Beijing this weekend for the country’s annual motor show, a sign of the increasing importance of the Chinese market to the auto sector.DaimlerChrysler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said the company was still discussing a manufacturing deal with a number of potential partners to make small vehicles for the group. One of the companies involved in the talks is believed to be Chery, the Chinese company.
69;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2006-08-31T08:20:52Z;Ssangyong Motor ends seven-week strike;;South Korea’s Ssangyong Motor said on Thursday its union had agreed to end a seven-week strike that crippled production at the country’s smallest carmaker.The company, owned by China’s SAIC, has agreed to drop a lay-off plan in return for workers accepting a wage freeze. It also agreed to have “prior consultation” with the union before reassigning workers.Ssangyong’s workers began a partial strike on July 14 and expanded it to a full-time strike on August 14, demanding the company withdraw its plan to cut 554 employees. The strike has cost the company 17,200 units worth Won380bn ($400m) in lost production.“The workers will return to work tomorrow and we expect operations to be normalised soon,” a company spokesman said on Thursday.Ssangyong’s shares surged 8.66 per cent to Won4,575 on Thursday, outperforming a 0.85 per cent rise in the broader market.The strike came as Ssangyong had just started showing signs of a turnround. It swung to a net profit of Won5.7bn in the second quarter, helped by tough restructuring, compared with a Won67bn net loss a year ago.SAIC is planning to invest about $2bn in Ssangyong by 2010 to more than double sales to 340,000 units. The bulk of the investment will be spent on expanding capacity and developing new models and engines. Ssangyong is South Korea’s fourth-largest automaker with a 5.4 per cent market share.The strike underscores the difficulties that foreign investors face in doing business in South Korea. Production at Ssangyong’s two Korean plants have come to a halt since mid-August as workers baulked at the Shanghai management’s plans on restructuring and transferring technology to China.SAIC is the third foreign investor taking over a Korean carmaker, following GM’s $400m purchase of bankrupt Daewoo Motor in 2002 and Renault of France’s acquisition of Samsung Motor in 1999.South Korea’s auto industry has been plagued by frequent strikes led by militant labour unions. Workers at Hyundai Motor, the country’s largest automaker, ended a month-long strike last month, which cost about $1.36bn in lost production.The management at GM Daewoo Auto & Technology also concluded wage talks with the union this week after a partial strike, offering a 5.2 per cent raise in base salary.

71;LDOS;Leidos Holdings Inc;2005-05-31T19:09:46Z;Next for the west are cars ?Made in China?;;"The road to Damascus is a strange place to assess the future of one of the world's most important industries.Yet the Syrian capital is the focus of an experiment that has the potential to reshape the automotive business.For the past year or so, several Chinese car companies have been shipping vehicles to countries in the Middle East in a trial run for exports. From there, the Chinese are planning an assault on the car markets of the developed world. Chery, the most ambitious, plans to launch five specially developed models in the US in two years' time.These may be early stages but the Syrian experiment could be the start of an unstoppable shift in the global automotive sector. A first sign came when Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) - which last year bought Ssangyong, a South Korean maker of sports utility vehicles - recently tried to take control of MG Rover.From T-shirts to televisions, Chinese manufacturers have cut a swath through a number of industries over the past 10 years, as aggressive entrepreneurs harnessed low-cost, hard-working labour. Goods made in China have come to dominate consumer electronics, white goods, furniture and textiles among other sectors.""Looking at what has happened in other industries: it is clear that the Chinese companies are good at competing on price and cost,"" says Sun Jian, a consultant with AT Kearney in Shanghai. ""In 10 years, the local carmakers will become strong competitors.""Those other sectors employ many thousands of people but they pale in comparison with the motor industry, which last year accounted for 4 per cent of US gross domestic product. It is crucial in Germany, where one in seven jobs relies directly or indirectly on the car industry. If Chinese manufacturers can repeat the same low-cost formula that they have used so successfully in consumer electronics, they could prompt the rest of the motor industry to transfer significant parts of its production to China. With popular anxiety about the competitive threat from China on the rise, the prospect of China exporting huge volumes of cheap cars is one to strike fear in many western politicians.From the start of China's economic liberalisation in the 1980s, the government has had its eye on creating an indigenous car industry. By forcing multinationals to enter the country through joint ventures, Beijing's leadership hoped the Chinese companies would quickly learn the necessary skills. However, progress was slow. Although many local companies made a good living through the joint ventures, their partners let them go only so far. They learnt about manufacturing but they were shut out of the design and research needed to create their own brands.By 2004, the government was getting frustrated. A new policy document made clear that it wanted local companies to take aggressive steps to develop their own technologies and brands. One industry executive says the big Chinese companies were ordered to hurry up.SAIC, which is controlled by the Shanghai city government, is the Chinese company that has made the biggest effort to acquire development skills. Indeed, it could still end up with some important Rover assets. It believes it has acquired exclusive intellectual property rights to two Rover models, although this is disputed by the administrators of the UK company.The real prize from the originally proposed deal would have been the engineering teams, car development capabilities and the Rover brand. SAIC has since hired Ricardo, a British engineering consultancy, to conduct research and development. According to people close to the company, Hu Maoyuan, SAIC's long-standing chairman, begins every internal meeting with a pledge to develop the company's own brands.Geely is one company trying out its wares in Syria. Unlike most of its Chinese rivals, Geely is a private company, which some analysts believe might give it an entrepreneurial edge over its state-owned rivals. Founder Li Shufu, a farmer's son, made his fortune manufacturing motorcycles and has turned his attention to cars. Brilliance China, BMW's new joint venture partner, meanwhile plans to introduce an up-market model into the German market later this year. Brilliance, based in Liaoning province in north-east China, is controlled by the local authority after Yang Rong, its chairman and biggest shareholder, was accused of unspecified ""economic crimes"" and fled the country.The company that is really making a stir, however, is Chery. Founded only eight years ago in the poor eastern province of Anhui, Chery gained notoriety with its $3,500 (?1,900) QQ mini - a car that General Motors claims is so similar to its own Korean-designed Chevrolet Spark that it is taking legal action against the company in China.Earlier this year, Chery announced a plan to start selling cars in the US in 2007 with a target of 250,000 vehicles in its first year, reaching 1m within five years. Annual sales of 250,000 would give Chery a market share in the US similar to that of Volkswagen or BMW, according to Goldman Sachs, and account for 10 per cent of all car imports into the US.To build models especially for the US market, Chery has hired AVI, an Austrian company, to develop the engines and two Italian design companies including Bertone, which has developed cars for Lamborghini and Maserati. It has also contracted a distributor in the US by the name of Malcolm Bricklin, whose previous experience includes bringing the Yugo and the Subaru to the US market.Chery does not plan to squeeze its way into the market by selling low-margin mini-cars, as other new entrants have done. Instead, it is aiming for the premium end of the market but at prices 30 per cent below those of its rivals. Mr Bricklin believes China's car industry can establish itself in developed markets much more quickly than the 20 years it took the Japanese or the 10 years the South Koreans needed. ""Everything is speeded up,"" Mr Bricklin says. ""Everyone knows everything because all the mistakes have been made before.""When the Japanese started exporting cars, they had to overcome the country's reputation for unappealing products, as well as the psychological barrier of having been at war with the US only a generation before. ""There were so many disadvantages that Japan had that China doesn't have,"" says Mr Bricklin, who runs a company called Visionary Vehicles.There is no shortage of ambition on the part of the Chinese companies. Yet, as they devise their strategies for entering the car markets in rich countries, they face a series of obstacles. Selling cars in the US would require skills in design, branding and marketing that Chinese companies have not yet shown a great aptitude for. ""The branding and R&D that you need in these industries are not easy for Chinese companies; it is not where their strengths are,"" says Arthur Kroeber, editor of China Economic Quarterly. ""I do not have a lot of optimism about Chinese finished goods over the next five to seven years."" Lin Xiaogang, chief executive of Huachen Auto Group, a Chinese car manufacturer, adds: ""It is difficult to compete with those companies that have accumulated brand equity over a number of years.""Quality will be another vital issue. For any newcomer, a failure to produce reliable cars can be fatal. This is especially true for a product that will have a ""Made in China"" tag, with all the associations of low-cost manufacturing that this carries.Moving too quickly is risky. While Hyundai is now considered a great success story, Jim Park, an industry consultant, points out that its entry into the US in the early 1990s was plagued with problems about quality. ""Hyundai messed it up for other Korean companies for a decade in the US,"" he says. ""They [the Chinese] will be aggressive, but they need to be careful."" Sun Jian, at AT Kearney, adds: ""Whoever is first, if they get it wrong, they hurt their brand and on a larger scale they turn people away from Chinese-made cars."" Mr Bricklin dismisses these concerns. ""Cars are going to be coming all over the place from China,"" he says. ""This [argument] that they are not going to get the quality is just nonsense.""Finance could be another problem. Developing and marketing new models requires deep pockets. SAIC and Chery can at least rely on strong backing from their respective local governments. Geely, on the other hand, has the problems that all private companies face in China in trying to secure funding. It was recently listed on the Hong Kong stock market but only through the backdoor acquisition of another listed company.In addition, the Chinese do not yet have the luxury of a secure home market. When Japanese and South Korean companies began developing their own models, they could rely on having a large chunk of their domestic market for a long period, which both guaranteed a reasonable flow of revenues and gave them some space for trial and error. The Chinese companies are trying to introduce their models into a domestic market that will soon be populated by every big multinational carmaker and that the former head of Volkswagen in China recently called ""the most competitive market in the world"".The multinationals are also not going to let the Chinese wander in unhindered. In an indication of the response they can expect, GM said last month it would try to prevent Chery from registering a trademark in the US on the grounds that its brand was too similar to Chevy, the nickname for GM's Chevrolet brand.Advisers to Geely say that, when it tried to buy a specialised machine tool used to make gearboxes, the company took more than a year to find a supplier willing to sell to it - a delay they put down to pressure on the machinemaker from multinationals. d4 Nor is it yet much cheaper to produce cars in China. Although assembly line workers at Daimler- Chrysler's Chinese factories earn $1.95 an hour, compared with $49.50 at its German plants and $36.50 in the US, labour is only a small part of the overall cost. Many components have to be imported, the factories are sub-scale and logistics can be inefficient in China. ""Even today, many of the components used in passenger cars are priced above world market levels,"" says Jack Perkowski, the American founder and chief executive of Asimco, a Chinese parts maker. As factories grow and local parts prices drop, the cost of Chinese vehicles will also fall, but this will take time.There are plenty of reasons, therefore, why the Chinese companies might stumble. However, if they succeed, it could force the automotive industry into a big rethink. Every one of the world's biggest car companies has been plunging investment into China in recent years with an eye to supplying the country's growing middle class. As yet, only Honda has set up a plant to make cars specifically for the export market. But as costs in China fall as a result of rising volumes and economies of scale, the other companies will begin to think much harder about using China as an export base.The political consequences of this are not hard to predict. When DaimlerChrysler raised the prospect last month of exporting cars from China to the US to sell under its Chrysler badge, American unions reacted angrily and Chrysler was forced into a rapid retraction. ""Anyone who is familiar with the union situation and the political situation here will tell you there will be a backlash,"" one Chrysler official said.The US is already talking tough about China's currency and its exports of textiles. In a recent article called ""The end of the love affair with China"", Jonathan Anderson, a UBS economist, described how the developed world had moved in recent months from admiration at China's economic advances to trepidation at the competitive threat. If China were to start taking big chunks of the car markets in rich countries, any romance would truly be over.Spending is big in an awkward marketThe surest way to rile a China-based automotive executive is to ask: is China the new Brazil?Back in the mid-1990s, when Brazil was emerging from two decades of rampant inflation, the automotive industry pumped in billions of dollars of investment in the hope that a sustained consumer boom was under way. A few years later, the economy hit a wall, car sales slumped and the new factories were left running at only half capacity, incurring big losses.This decade, China has witnessed dramatic growth in car sales, which prompted an unprecedented investment spree by global vehicle makers. According to Automotive Resources Asia, a consultancy based in Shanghai, multinationals will invest $12bn-$14bn (?10bn-?11bn) in China over the next five years.Yet just as some of these new factories are coming on stream, the rate of growth in the market has slowed sharply. Within a few years, analysts believe, capacity could be close to 6m cars a year while domestic demand will be around 3m.So does the Brazil comparison hold? At least in one respect it does. The mid-1990s boom in Brazil was partly a one-off release of pent-up demand from 20 years of instability. The recent boom in China has been fuelled by the throwing off of economic and political restraints that depressed consumption.However, there is a second factor driving the Chinese market that makes it very different from Brazil. The Chinese economy is growing at around 9 per cent a year and is not expected to slow sharply for a number of years. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people in China begin earning enough money to make them potential car buyers - and barely 1 per cent of the population have one. The expected growth rate of demand, with estimates of 10-15 per cent a year, is well above any other significant market in the world. It is likely, though, to be a very different market from the one car makers have experienced so far in China, where the first movers enjoyed the highest profit margins in the world for several years.According to Clint Laurent, chief executive of Asian Demographics in Hong Kong, many of the initial customers were government and company bosses or ?petrol-heads?, people prepared to spend a large sum for a fancy vehicle. The new generation of customers wants practical, smaller cars and is more cost-conscious.Chinese companies appear to have stolen a march in attracting these new customers. The fastest growing model over the last few months has been Chery?s QQ mini, one of the cheapest cars in the world, which has doubled sales since last year.Rising capacity and slowing growth have led to steep cuts in prices on many vehicles, while companies are having to work much harder to sell their brands. This has hammered profits at the joint ventures of the western manufacturers that lead the market. Volkswagen, the German car maker that is China?s biggest, lost ?17m ($21m) in the country in the first three months of the year compared with a ?106m profit in the same period last year. Chinese profits at General Motors of the US, whose joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp is the second biggest in the country, slid 80 per cent to $33m.Kate Zhu, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, summarises the outlook as: ?Worsening overcapacity, rising costs, tight industry financing, sluggish demand and ongoing price wars.? The long-term prospects remain more buoyant than almost anywhere else but the fat profits of the last few years are past.What Shanghai sought from LongbridgeThe world?s car manufacturers have long shared the concern of music and video producers about rampant piracy by Chinese companies, with cars copied right down to the steering wheels. But Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp has turned the tables by seizing on intellectual property laws to protect its acquisitions in Britain.SAIC, China?s biggest carmaker, has promised a robust defence of vehicle and engine designs that it bought for ?67m last year from MG Rover. It is, in effect, seeking a veto over potential buyers of Rover?s remaining assets.?We reserve the right to fight if needs be,? SAIC says, adding that it is willing to license its designs to a buyer of Rover, which is being auctioned by administrators. SAIC has distanced itself from claims of piracy by selling its stake in Chery, a local carmaker accused by General Motors of copying its Daewoo Matiz, sold in China as a Chevrolet Spark.Suggestions of possible legal action from people close to SAIC have had some effect: at least four potential buyers of Rover are withholding their bids until the intellectual property ownership is clarified.For SAIC, control of the rights is important. Even though its rescue of Rover has been abandoned, it is preparing to produce two former Rover models in China.Why was China?s biggest carmaker interested in Rover? The answer is that SAIC grew through joint ventures to assemble cars designed by Volkswagen and GM, not by coming up with its own designs.Rover should have been able to provide SAIC with two key elements it needed to break this reliance on foreign joint ventures.The first was the Rover marque. ?SAIC wants a brand,? said one person familiar with its Rover bid. ?The Rover name can do well in China, where it is exotic.? BMW, which owns the name but had licensed it to Rover, which sub-licensed it to SAIC, may revoke the Chinese rights to use it. But it remains unclear whether SAIC wants to use the marque any longer. Its advisers have warned that the brand depended on British production, just as the BMW name depends on German output.The second element was the ability to design and engineer cars. SAIC has learnt production and purchasing skills but cannot create a car from scratch. Even for low-technology minibuses it had to turn to Liuzhou Wuling, a rival, and GM for help.The purchase of designs for the 25 small car, 75 large car and engines has given SAIC the basics and it has taken on Ricardo, the British engineering consultants, to help with research and development work. As a result, SAIC has got most of what it wanted without Rover?s heavy losses.SAIC?s decision not to go ahead with the rescue of Rover was vindicated last week. The administrators of Rover revealed that the failed company owed ?1.4bn to creditors but that after paying off mortgages it only had assets worth an estimated ?85.5m available.The Chinese company denies that it cherry-picked the best of Rover, saying it bought the designs in good faith to help Rover. ?The ?67m deal was done to provide them with urgent funding to keep the business afloat whilst the negotiations continued,? it said.Its lawyers are examining whether it can defend the designs it thought it bought against claims by the administrators that it owns only the 2 per cent of the cars that were not shared with the MG brand.Whatever the final outcome, the legal questions are a sad end for the first foray by a Chinese carmaker into western markets."
