But it is now battling a rival bid from US-based Lockheed Martin to supply 12 anti-submarine helicopters, their associated communication and weapons systems, and support services.Leonardo, the incumbent supplier to the South Korean navy and one of the leading aerospace and defence companies in the UK, was the only company to submit a proposal following an initial round of bidding in 2018.Leonardo said it was best placed to meet the Korean navy’s requirements, adding: “The company always welcomes a fair and transparent competition across all geographies.”Purchasing US arms will definitely play a positive role in the defence cost-sharing negotiations and the MH-60R Seahawk will probably be selectedSeoul balked at the original US demand to massively increase its contribution to hosting US troops from $870m a year to around $5bn. Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, signalled during a meeting with Donald Trump at the UN last September that Seoul would increase American weapons purchases. Last month Mr Harris said that while the two sides remained “apart” on a deal, Washington had softened its position.Shin In-kyun, the head of Korea Defense Network, a Seoul think-tank, said it appeared highly likely that South Korea was under pressure to select the US-made helicopter.“Purchasing US arms will definitely play a positive role in the defence cost-sharing negotiations and the MH-60R Seahawk will probably be selected,” Mr Shin said, referring to the Lockheed Martin helicopter commonly referred to as the “Romeo”.US allies in Asia and Europe are watching closely because Mr Trump has fired frequent broadsides at allies over their reliance on the US for defence, prompting accusations from critics that Washington is trying to monetise alliances.The Financial Times reported in December that the Trump administration had lobbied Japan to choose a US defence company to develop jointly a replacement for its F-2 fighter jets, rather than use a British alternative developed by BAE Systems, the UK defence contractor.Both the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, the agency handling the tender, and South Korea’s defence ministry declined to comment.Concerns over the transparency and fairness of the bidding process have been raised directly with DAPA by diplomats and South Korean lawmakers, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Leonardo Wildcat helicopter is a cheaper option for the South Korean navy than the Lockheed Martin alternative, experts say. However, Lockheed Martin said the company was “confident” its MH-60R was “the right aircraft for the Korean Navy”.“As the threat environment continually evolves, the US Navy will continue to invest in capability upgrades, thereby making those capability upgrades more affordable,” the company said.The broader cost-sharing Special Measures Agreement between the US and South Korea — which has been restricted to covering labour, logistics and construction costs — has been renegotiated every five years since it started in 1991. However, last year only a single-year understanding was reached after the two sides failed to agree on Mr Trump’s demand for the sharp increase in Seoul’s contribution.On Wednesday, United States Forces Korea issued a 60-day notice of potential “administrative furlough” from April 1, meaning that around 9,000 South Koreans working for US armed forces face not being paid if a new SMA deal is not secured.South Korea’s defence budget is among the top 10 in the world, at around $42bn, making it an important market for the global defence industry. According to US data, American weapons sales account for roughly 80 per cent of South Korea’s defence imports, reflecting close military ties and the dominant position US companies enjoy in the market.

The contracts were so poorly written that the department rather than the contractors footed the bill for all the financial and time overruns, reducing incentives to minimise costs, the NAO said.In a damning investigation into the three projects, the NAO said the MoD and its prime contractors lacked commercial expertise.Designs for the projects were more costly than necessary, while construction began before the requirements had been agreed or the design completed, so adding to the number of expensive changes required. This contributed to around half of the total £1.35bn cost increase, the NAO said. Poor oversight also meant problems took years to discover.Despite this, the contractors responsible for overseeing the projects received millions of pounds in additional management fees due to the delays, further inflating the bill for taxpayers.BAE Systems, for example, received an additional £10m in management fees, taking the total so far to £16.5m, on a project building new facilities at the MoD shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, which will enable submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles to be built using a modular technique.The NAO said the MoD recognised that its contract terms were “particularly favourable to the contractor as, for example, BAE Systems has no liability for costs and damages relating to non-performance.”In a statement BAE said: “Working alongside the MoD and our partners in the Dreadnought Alliance we remain committed to delivering the Dreadnought programme to cost and schedule.”AWE also earned additional fees when work was deferred on the building of a new facility to assemble nuclear weapons at Burghfield near Reading. The additional fees were paid even though the NAO found that AWE had not “adequately” overseen its subcontractors and twice received formal notices from the MoD for poor performance. Delays to the project — called Mensa — have also meant the MoD has had to spend an additional £21m keeping existing facilities going.Although the contractors on two of the projects have since agreed to renegotiate terms, Rolls-Royce has not yet reached agreement on its project, which involves overseeing the building of a facility in Raynesway to house nuclear reactor cores that can be used in Dreadnought submarines, the NAO said.Rolls-Royce said in a statement: “The planning, construction and commissioning of a new nuclear-regulated facility is a highly complex and intricate project. Our existing facilities have been in use since the 1950s so this really is a once-in-a-generation construction project and we’re working closely with the MoD to ensure this important facility faces no further delays.”Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “Although it has recently introduced changes to enhance its oversight of the projects and improve its contracts with suppliers, it [the MoD] should have learnt earlier from past mistakes and the experience of others in the nuclear sector.“Instead, the MoD’s failure to mitigate commercial and delivery risks early on has led to project delays and cost increases, as well as impacting its wider work.”At the time of publication, AWE had not commented on the NAO report.

It is considering three options: collaborating with BAE; working with Lockheed Martin, the US maker of the F-22 and F-35 jets; or developing a plane domestically.The US air force is worried that choosing a UK fighter would create difficulties in interoperability with both the US military and other US-made aircraft used by Japan, which could complicate joint operations. American officials are also concerned that opting for a British jet would anger President Donald Trump, just as Washington and Tokyo are engaged in tough talks about how much each should pay towards maintaining their alliance.The US stunned Japan in July when it said it would request a fourfold increase to $8bn when the allies renegotiated the “special measures agreement” that determines their contributions.It is not over. The momentum could shift back since there are lots of variablesEric Sayers, a Japan expert at Beacon Global Strategies, an advisory firm, said Japan would be making its fighter jet decision just as tensions “could be boiling” over cost sharing.“Tokyo should be able to make its own sovereign decision about which option . . . to replace the F-2,” he said. “But President Trump has a record of taking a transactional approach to alliances and the Abe government should not expect he will view the special measures agreement negotiation and this large procurement decision as separate.”Mr Trump has made Japan, and his own military officials, nervous by threatening to withdraw troops unless Tokyo pays more. He has also frequently touted Japanese purchases of US weapons in his meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Taro Kono, the Japanese defence minister, recently told the Financial Times that he was open to collaboration with a European programme such as Tempest, underlining the concerns in Washington.One senior US defence official stressed that Japan should view interoperability as “a significant factor” to consider. “Because of the importance of the alliance and the current security dynamics in the region, we would obviously prefer the Japanese work with the US on their future fighter programme,” the official said.“There are a few examples of going it alone that have taken too long, cost too much and not done much for interoperability.”Michael Green, a former top White House official with close ties to the Abe administration, said the Pentagon’s lobbying was paying dividends after Tempest gained early momentum.“The US government is organising itself around a campaign for an American fighter. And in the Japanese government, some of the big pieces have shifted so that the momentum is shifting towards a capabilities-based decision which would benefit a design based on an already existing US platform,” said Mr Green. “But it is not over. The momentum could shift back since there are lots of variables.”Japan has long dreamt of building a domestic aircraft to match its famous second world war-era Zero fighter. The project to build its own plane gained urgency last year when Mr Abe opted to buy 105 fully-assembled F-35s from the US.One Japanese executive said that had left local industry desperate for a new fighter programme to work on.The US has proposed jointly developing a fighter based on the F-35 and F-22. But it would limit the use of Japanese technology, resulting in a “black box” fighter with no access to the source code required for independent upgrades — something the Japanese air force would like and many lawmakers consider essential to sovereignty.“The most important thing for a future fighter aircraft is capability,” said Itsunori Onodera, a Diet member and two-time defence minister. “Then there is data links, including to US networks. And then it is also necessary to have freedom to upgrade.”Mr Onodera said Japanese industry did not have the capability to go it alone and the cost per unit of building exclusively for the domestic market would be prohibitive. He added the similar timeline of the Tempest made collaboration with the UK a “reasonable possibility” but the decision would depend on capability, cost and the potential for upgrades.The decision will be up to Mr Abe, who will have to choose between independent technology and nationalist hopes or the US alliance and his prized relationship with Mr Trump.The Japanese defence ministry said on Tuesday that it did not intend to select a specific, defined aircraft at this stage of development. “Moreover, we exchange various opinions with our US allies on matters such as interoperability,” the ministry said.Follow Demetri Sevastopulo and Robin Harding on Twitter: @dimi and @RobinBHarding"
3;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-10-29T13:40:19Z;Pentagon announces $34bn F-35 fighter jet deal with Lockheed;Agreement would see US defence department buy 478 jets after years of wrangling over price;The Pentagon has announced a $34bn deal to buy a fresh batch of stealth jets from the aerospace company Lockheed Martin, after years of wrangling over the price.Under the terms of the deal announced Tuesday, which includes jets for both US and allied militaries, the US defence department would buy 478 fighter jets from Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed.Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s top official for acquisitions, said “tremendous progress” had been made in talks between the Pentagon and the aerospace company.“This is a historic milestone for the F-35 programme,” Ms Lord said. “[This] will form the backbone of the US and allied fifth-generation inventory for the foreseeable future.”Ms Lord added that the Pentagon had been “laser focused” on “driving cost out, quality up and achieving timely deliveries of our capability to war fighters.”The F-35, which entered US service in 2015 after a protracted development period, is designed to be difficult to observe on radar and is expected to become the mainstay fighter aircraft for the US and its allies in the first half of the century.Earlier this summer, the US formally expelled Turkey from the F-35 programme in a bid to protect the technology after Ankara took delivery of a Russian air defence system despite American objections.Ms Lord said there had been “no change” to that decision, and that the Pentagon anticipated that the Russian S-400 system purchased by Ankara “would be operational by the end of the year.”The Trump administration threatened Turkey with sanctions under the 2017 Countering America’s Adversaries though Sanctions Act — known as Caatsa — if it proceeded to buy and operate the S-400. So far, Caatsa sanctions have not been issued.

But Greenpeace said it was unclear what this figure included.It pointed out that in 2017 the government’s deep-sea mining working group was shown a report by the National Subsea Research Initiative, a research body, warning of the environmental impact on the seabed.“The activities involved in subsea mining could have detrimental impacts on localised populations as well as an impact on world oceans through the potential extinction of unique species which form the first rung of the food chain,” said the report, which was commissioned by Scottish Enterprise and seen by Greenpeace through a Freedom of Information request.The UN-backed International Seabed Authority, which regulates all mineral activities in international waters, has given countries, including the UK, 29 licences to explore the oceans, covering an area of 1.3m sq km, or five times the surface area of Britain. But mining cannot begin until regulations, being negotiated, are agreed. The ISA expects to have finished them by July 2020.The UK government in 2013 granted Seabed Resources, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, the rights to explore 133,000 sq km of the ocean it had received from the ISA. Seabed Resources said it was waiting for the regulations to be approved before assessing the viability of mining at the sites.Daniel Jones, a principal researcher at the National Oceanography Centre, said scientists still do not know enough about life in the deep sea compared with life on land.“We are finding out a lot more but we can’t answer how organisms will respond to disturbance from deep-sea mining without doing experimentation on the sea floor,” he said. “We are missing quite important information.”The UK government said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep-sea mineral extraction. We have sponsored two exploration licences, which allows scientific marine research to fully understand the effects of deep-sea mining. We will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”Deep-sea mining has had a chequered history. The first company to try to mine the deep sea, Nautilus Minerals, was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in March after financial difficulties. The company had planned to mine around Papua New Guinea.But last month DeepGreen, a deep-sea mining start-up, said it had raised the bulk of the $150m it needed to press ahead with plans to collect mineral-rich nodules from the floor of the Pacific for metals such as nickel and cobalt used in electric-car batteries. The company is backed by miner Glencore as well as shipping group Maersk.DeepGreen said “it is built with a deep appreciation and respect for ocean health and the earth’s environment”.
5;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-06-16T23:32:59Z;Manufacturers upbeat on outlook for defence spending;Contractors express optimism about global market on eve of Paris Air Show;US defence executives sounded a bullish note on the outlook for the industry on the eve of the Paris air show, saying they expected governments to boost spending in new technologies to counter evolving threats.Plans announced by United Technologies and Raytheon last week to merge to form a $120bn aerospace and defence behemoth have raised questions about whether spending in the US, the world’s biggest defence market, will plateau after 2020.But speaking to the Financial Times in Paris, Marillyn Hewson, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor, said she did not anticipate a decline in defence spending globally, noting that “we are seeing defence budgets well supported both in the US and outside of the US”.“Countries realise that the global security environment is not getting less challenging. It is getting more unpredictable,” she told the FT.Governments were investing in new technologies such as hypersonics, autonomy and directed energy, she added.The Pentagon has made modernisation a key priority. By combining their technologies, UTC and Raytheon have said they will be better able to develop new types of equipment for the government, stressing that together they will spend as much as $8bn a year on research and development.William Brown, chairman and chief executive of Harris, which is in the final stages of completing its merger with L3 Technologies, said “the funding [in the US] remains pretty robust”.“There are unspent funds that are still out there yet to flow into the industrial base, something like $100bn, so there is a lot more room to grow the companies,” he told the FT.The company’s merger with L3, he added, was being driven by “an evolving need by our customers for more complete, end-to-end solutions that are technologically advanced and are affordable”.Separately, Ms Hewson said she was confident that Lockheed would win further orders for its F-35 fighter jet in Europe, despite Germany earlier this year deciding to exclude it from its final deliberations to replace its ageing Tornado fleet. Lockheed Martin, she said, was competing in Switzerland and Finland among others.She said she had been “surprised” by Germany’s decision but said Lockheed had not yet given up hope of a possible sale to the country.“I think Germany will continue to look at what their requirements are for the future,” she added.There are unspent funds that are still out there yet to flow into the industrial base, something like $100bn, so there is a lot more room to grow the companiesThe F-35 is a big part of Lockheed’s push to expand in Europe. The company expects to increase its sales in the region by 30 per cent over the next few years. Last year about 28 per cent of its group sales, or $15bn, came from outside the US. It employs about 4,000 people in Europe, with almost half of those at its facility in Poland where it manufacturers Black Hawk helicopters for customers around the world.Lockheed Martin last week agreed a $34bn handshake deal with the Pentagon for 478 new F-35 jets at a lower cost per aircraft. The cost will be roughly $81m per plane for the first lot of jets included in the deal and could be less than $80m for planes produced afterwards.Plans by Germany and France to launch a next generation fighter jet — dubbed the Future Combat Air System — were not “a threat today”, Ms Hewson said.The “F-35 will be the fighter of this time,” she said and could be flying out to 2070.Ms Hewson declined to comment in detail on the outlook for the company’s operations in Turkey. The Pentagon has said it would end the country’s role as a partner in manufacturing and buying the F-35 if it went ahead and bought Russia’s S-400 air defence missile systems. Turkish companies currently produce some of the parts for the F-35, including landing gear and fuselage components.Ms Hewson said the company was continually assessing how it could “mitigate any risk of what might happen around the world in our supply chain”.Suppliers in Turkey, she added, were working on orders for the F-35 but she declined to say whether the company was continuing to place new orders in the country. Lockheed, she said, “would take direction from the [US] government” on that issue.
6;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-05-28T09:28:45Z;Poland plans to buy 32 F-35 fighter jets from US;Warsaw has been accelerating an overhaul of its armed forces;Poland is considering buying Lockheed F-35 fighter jets from the US to replace its ageing Soviet-era planes, in the latest sign of the strengthening ties between Warsaw and the US defence industry.Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Tuesday that Poland had sent a letter to the US requesting a quotation in connection with the purchase of 32 F-35As, as well as a logistics and training package.“Fifth-generation fighter jets are already on the horizon,” he wrote on Twitter. “It’s high time we replaced post-Soviet equipment with the most modern fighters.”Andrew Gollan, a defence analyst at Berenberg, said that the Polish interest was a sign that Lockheed’s F-35 programme was gaining momentum in international markets. Ten countries have already ordered, or have plans to acquire, the fifth generation fighter jet.“The first development programme was awarded in 2001 but it is only in the last two or three years that production has really begun to ramp up,” he said.“Thirty-two F-35As is not a huge number in the context of the programme overall — the US has plans to buy about 2,600 F-35 models and foreign countries have ordered about 700. But it is another international customer and a sign that the programme is already a great success in the export markets.”Mr Gollan said that the current price of an F-35A was around $90m, meaning that a purchase of 32 was likely to cost more than $2.5bn.Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Poland — which is one of only five Nato countries that meets the bloc’s target of spending 2 per cent of national output on defence — has been accelerating its efforts to overhaul its armed forces.Last month, it struck a €380m deal with Italian defence group Leonardo for the delivery of four AW101 helicopters. And last year it agreed a $4.75bn deal with the US to buy Patriot missile defence systems, in what was the biggest weapons procurement deal in its history.Poland is also negotiating with the US over an increased American military presence in the country, which is the linchpin of Nato’s eastern flank — a deal could be announced when President Andrzej Duda visits the US next month.The defence ministry quoted Mr Blaszczak as saying at a defence conference in Warsaw that Poland expected to spend 185bn zloty ($48bn) by 2026 on modernising its armed forces.
7;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-05-12T09:00:24Z;US defence groups in running to take over Royal Navy training;Raytheon and Lockheed Martin up against Babcock for £2bn contract;American companies are in the running to take over the training of UK Royal Navy recruits after the Ministry of Defence chose two US groups to compete for the lucrative contract.Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, two of the world’s biggest defence companies, are pitted against the British defence group Babcock International for the programme, which is estimated to be worth up to £2bn over the next 12 years. The three companies were selected this year and negotiations are now ongoing.The wide-ranging project, nicknamed Selborne, will bring together a number of existing contracts with the aim of delivering all levels of naval personnel training, according to a contract note for prospective bidders. This includes all operational sea training, and training and simulation in military electronic systems. The contract is due to start from 2021.Both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon already provide training and logistics support for the US military. Raytheon trains the US Army under multiple contracts. Richard Daniel, chief executive of Raytheon UK, said the company’s experience of commercial training for car companies was beneficial for its bid.“We are going to take the transformational techniques that we have learnt for commercial training such as General Motors and Honda and combine that with our logistics [expertise],” he told the Financial Times.“You can’t train navy officers and people in the Royal Navy the same way as they have always been trained,” he added.The company is working on the bid with British outsourcer Capita, which has come under fire for a number of high-profile contract failures in recent years. Mr Daniel said the criticism was something “we have been monitoring quite closely” but insisted that he had been “comfortable about what they [Capita] have been doing”.Raytheon, which is best known for its Patriot missile defence system, is among a number of US defence companies looking to expand its UK presence. It has invested more than $200m in the UK since 2015 and its British subsidiary has an annual turnover of about $600m.Given the MoD’s tight budget, Mr Daniel said one of the challenges for companies such as Raytheon was “how do you provide sovereign capability with a relatively small demand at an affordable price”.Babcock, which currently provides large parts of the Royal Navy’s training programme, confirmed it had been selected to bid. The FTSE 250 group is working with defence group Qinetiq, IT company Centerprise International and the Universities of Portsmouth and Strathclyde.Lockheed Martin, which builds the F35 fighter jet, also confirmed that it was in the running for the MoD contract but gave no further comment.
8;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-04-29T04:00:37Z;Germany’s F-35 fighter rebuff raises questions for Nato partners;Lockheed Martin’s Europe chief warns ‘retrograde step’ imperils defence co-operation;Germany’s decision not to buy the F-35 stealth fighter jet is a “retrograde step” that could hamper the country’s ability to operate at the same level as its Nato partners, according to the European head of Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the aircraft.Jonathan Hoyle, vice-president for Europe at the US defence group, said the German decision in January to exclude the F-35 from further consideration as a replacement for its ageing Tornado fleet had caught a lot of governments “on the hop”. The German defence ministry said at the time it had decided to acquire either more Eurofighters from Airbus, the European group, or Boeing-made F-18s.With the German rhetoric in the past three years having been about stepping up its defence capabilities, the decision not to consider the F-35 had prompted questions among other European governments over “Germany’s position going forward, and therefore what does it mean for Nato”, Mr Hoyle told the Financial Times in an interview.He added that during a recent visit to Nato several ambassadors had expressed “disappointment” at the German decision. They had noted that while many of their countries were investing in fifth-generation fighter jet technology by opting for the F-35, “Germany, which has the biggest defence budget, has just taken this retrograde step and isn’t going to be there”.“So when we go off and collaborate together operationally, if you are flying stealth, fifth-generation jets, you don’t want a fourth-generation jet in the middle of your operations because everyone can see that,” he added.The German decision was seen by many defence observers as a signal by Berlin that it remained committed to pursuing a next-generation Franco-German “future combat air system” (FCAS). Paris had previously voiced fears that a German order to buy the F-35, widely seen as the most advanced aircraft on the shortlist, could have made the FCAS project — due to form the backbone of both countries’ air forces after 2040 — redundant.A key issue for Germany, according to defence analysts, will be how a new fleet can continue to carry and deploy US nuclear weapons stationed at Büchel, in the west of the country, as part of Nato’s “nuclear sharing” arrangement. Any replacement for the Tornado will have to be able to do the same and be certified to do so by the US.Germany’s position on defence has come under repeated fire from US president Donald Trump, who has criticised the government for not spending enough. Mike Pence, the US vice-president, renewed the criticism at Nato’s 70th anniversary celebrations this month.Despite the setback on the F-35, Mr Hoyle said Lockheed continued to regard Germany as a “big addressable marketplace”. Lockheed has an interest in a number of significant defence programmes in the country, including heavy-lift helicopters, as well as missile defence, where Germany has a lead Nato role.Europe remains a key growth area for Lockheed, added Mr Hoyle, notably Poland, which will become a regional hub for the group. Poland has pledged to spend 2 per cent of its strongly growing gross domestic product each year on defence as part of a 10-year modernisation plan outlined in 2013.
9;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
10;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-04-23T13:55:33Z;Lockheed Martin blasts past Q1 expectations, lifts 2019 forecasts;Key aeronautics unit boosted by rise in F-35 fighter jet sales;Lockheed Martin boosted its financial guidance for 2019 after a “strong” performance in its first quarter that saw it soar past Wall Street’s expectations.In particular, the company’s main aeronautics unit saw a sizeable bump in revenue owing to higher net sales for its F-35 fighter jet programme.The Maryland-based company said it now expected net sales for 2019 in the range of $56.75bn to $58.25bn, an increase of $1bn at both ends compared to its January guidance. Diluted earnings are now forecast to come in between $20.05 to $20.35 a share, versus $19.15 to $19.45 three months ago.That may help soothe investors who were buffeted earlier this year by an array of aerospace and defence companies who offered cautious outlooks for 2019. In January, Lockheed’s initial guidance fell short of Wall Street forecasts.That seemed like water under the bridge for investors on Tuesday as the company reported a 23 per cent jump in net sales from a year ago to $14.3bn in the three months ended March 31, and a 49 per cent jump in diluted earnings to $5.99 a share. That blew past median forecasts of $12.585bn and $4.26 a share, respectively, in a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Net sales in the aeronautics unit, which makes up nearly 40 per cent of group revenue, jumped 27 per cent to $1.2bn due to higher net sales of about $910m for the F-35.That is the same stealth fighter that crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a drill earlier this month and has prompted US and Japanese forces to race to the wreckage and recover ultra-sensitive technology before Russia or China beat them to it.Lockheed Martin shares were up 3.2 per cent in early trade on Tuesday morning at a six-month high and on track for their fifth consecutive day of gains.
11;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-01-31T21:06:08Z;Germany opts against buying American F-35 stealth fighter;Berlin cuts options for replacing Tornado fleet down to Eurofighter or Boeing’s F-18;The German defence ministry has decided not to buy the US-made F-35 stealth fighter as a replacement for the country’s ageing Tornado fleet, and is instead looking at acquiring either more Eurofighters from Airbus or the Boeing-made F-18.The narrowing of the choice to one European and one US aircraft sets the stage for further intense lobbying of Berlin from manufacturers and foreign governments, underscoring the political sensitivity of one of Germany’s largest military orders for years.By excluding the F-35 from the race, Berlin has already sent a strong signal to France and other European allies that it remains committed to building a next-generation Franco-German “Future Combat Air System”.Paris had voiced fears that a German order to buy the F-35, widely seen as the most advanced aircraft on the shortlist, could have made the FCAS project — supposed to form the backbone of both countries’ air forces after 2040 — redundant.Aside from the Eurofighter, the F-35 and the F-18, Germany had initially also considered the F-15 as a possible Tornado replacement. Both the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin, and the F-15, also made by Boeing, have been dropped from the race. A final decision has yet to be made, defence officials said in Berlin on Thursday evening.German officials said the defence ministry now needed more information from Boeing and Airbus on their aircraft.Airbus said on Friday that it still hoped for an all-Eurofighter order. “That would be a signal in favour of a sovereign Europe, and in terms of jobs and the preservation of knowhow would also be the best and logical solution for Germany. The Eurofighter can, as the UK has shown, take on all the capabilities of the Tornado,” the European manufacturer said.Lockheed Martin said: “We have not been officially notified of a decision on Germany’s future fighter. The F-35 delivers unmatched value as the most capable and lowest lifecycle cost aircraft, while delivering the strongest long-term industrial and economic opportunities compared to any fighter on the market.”There was no immediate response from Boeing.Germany’s decision to narrow down the choice to the Eurofighter and the F-18 reflects careful political calculations — and the desire in Berlin to balance competing demands from two of its closest allies: the US and France. Replacing at least part of the Tornado fleet with an American-made plane would please Washington, which has long clamoured for Germany to raise its defence spending and lobbied hard in favour of a US jet. France, on the other hand, is understood to have argued strongly against a German acquisition of the more advanced F-35, which had the potential to serve German military needs for years. Defence analysts said buying the older F-18 poses much less of a threat to Franco-German plans to build FCAS.It is still possible that the German defence ministry will decide to shun the F-18 and buy only the Eurofighter. That is the solution favoured by key members of parliament, especially those from the Social Democratic party, the junior partner in Angela Merkel’s coalition government.But such a move would raise immediate questions over Germany’s ability to participate in Nato’s “nuclear-sharing” arrangement, whereby US nuclear weapons are kept on European bases, ready for deployment by European planes. In the case of Germany, Tornados are used for the role, which means any replacement needs to be technically capable as well as certified by the US to carry American nuclear warheads.Some analysts doubt the Eurofighter could win that certification before the 85-strong Tornado fleet is phased out, expected to be from 2025.Additional reporting by Sylvia Pfeifer and David Bond in London
12;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2019-01-17T19:17:16Z;US defence stocks boosted by Trump missile plan;;Shares of top US defence contractors were fired up on Thursday after the Trump administration called for stronger missile defence capabilities.The new defence strategy, part of a Missile Defense Review, includes a plan to create a network of sensors in space that can quickly detect enemy missiles. In remarks at the Pentagon, President Donald Trump said the nation’s goal is to “ensure we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States — anywhere, anytime, anyplace.”The government’s report called North Korea an “extraordinary” threat to the US and cited other threats from Iran, Russia and China.Pentagon suppliers that work on missile technology soared as Mr Trump unveiled the plan.Northrop Grumman was the biggest winner in afternoon trading, with shares climbing 2.9 per cent. Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor and the company behind the THAAD missile defence system, rallied 1.5 per cent. Raytheon, known for the Tomahawk and Patriot missiles, posted a 1.3 per cent gain. Boeing was up 1.1 per cent.Boeing won an additional $6.56bn contract from the US military early last year to continue supporting the ground-based midcourse defence system and build more domestic interceptors. In July, the Pentagon said Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon would receive a joint $4.1bn contract for anti-ballistic missile defence work.
13;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-12-10T18:19:49Z;Defence stocks jump after reports say Trump backs $750bn military budget request;;Defense stocks bucked the wider market sell-off to emerge as some of the day’s biggest winners on Monday after reports said President Donald Trump has backed plans for a $750bn defence budget.Lockheed Martin, the $83bn weapons maker, led the sector’s rise, jumping as much as 4.2 per cent to $297.38 for its best day in nearly eight and a half months.Rival Raytheon Co also notched its biggest one-day gain since March 23, rising as much as 4.4 per cent to $172.34Northrop Grumman booked a 4.1 per cent rise to $267.98 while General Dynamics advanced 1.5 per cent to $197.70.Overall the S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense industry index gained 0.7 per cent. This compares to the wider S&P 500, which briefly hit an eight-month low after dropping as much as 1.9 per cent earlier this morning.The rally in military stocks comes after media reports said Mr Trump has backed plans to request $750bn from Congress for defence spending for the 2020 fiscal year. The figure tops the $733bn that many had expected the Pentagon to request and is well above the $700bn that Mr Trump had previously cited.
14;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-12-04T18:12:19Z;Airbus teams up with Lockheed Martin in US air tanker market;European group seeks to enter USAF refuelling market after losing out to Boeing in 2011;Airbus, the European aerospace group, has joined forces with Lockheed Martin to break into the US military air refuelling market, seven years after losing to rival Boeing in a bitter battle over a contract for the US Air Force.The two companies said on Tuesday they had signed an agreement to explore opportunities to meet the growing demand for aerial refuelling services for US defence customers.The team will offer Airbus’s A330 multi-role tanker transport or A330 MRTT to examine “a broad spectrum of opportunities”, the companies said.These could range from the development of a commercial near-term air refuelling capability to support the current fleet, to the development of a stealthy tanker. Although the size of the initial requirement has yet to be determined, the long-term demand is sizeable: the USAF ultimately wants to replace its entire fleet of more than 400 tankers.Airbus is counting on the international success of the A330 MRTT, which has been selected by 12 countries including the UK, France and Australia.“By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well positioned to provide the USAF and allies around the world with the advanced refuelling solutions needed to meet 21st-century security challenges,” said Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed chairman and chief executive.Tom Enders, Airbus’ outgoing chief executive, described the combination of the two companies as a “great industry team”.The news marks Airbus’s second attempt to break into the US refuelling market after losing out to Boeing in 2011, and it could reopen the rivalry between the two groups.The process to replace the air force’s tanker fleet stretches back almost two decades and has cost the careers of two of Boeing’s executives, including former chief Phil Condit, as well as those of several Pentagon officials.The USAF initially offered a $23.5bn leasing contract to Boeing in 2002. But under intense pressure from John McCain, the former Arizona senator who died this summer, the deal unravelled. Congress cancelled the contract after it emerged that Darleen Druyun, a former air force procurement official, had held job discussions with Michael Sears, former Boeing finance director, while she was still in charge of negotiating the terms of the company’s tanker deal.Ms Druyun and Mr Sears were later sent to prison for violating conflict of interest laws.The air force then launched a competition that pitched Boeing against a team of Northrop Grumman and EADS, Airbus’s then parent group. The team won in 2008, only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective.Northrop subsequently dropped out and a rerun of the tender between EADS and Boeing led to the latter winning a $35bn contract in 2011 to build 179 tankers based on its 767 aircraft.The resulting KC-46 programme has, however, been plagued by technological and production problems, and Boeing has incurred more than $3bn in pre-tax charges.
15;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-10-23T12:15:03Z;Lockheed Martin raises earnings guidance after strong third-quarter;;Lockheed Martin raised full-year earnings guidance as it reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings, partly due to rising production of the F-35 fighter plane.The defence contractor reported net sales of $14.3bn for the quarter ended September 30, up from $12.3bn for the year earlier period. The company forecast full year sales of $53bn, at the upper end of guidance given at the end of July for sales of between $51.6bn-$53.1bn. Earnings per shares for the period came in at $5.14, up from $3.32 for the year earlier period and well above market expectations.“Our team achieved another quarter of strong growth leading us to improve our expectations for our full-year financial results,” said Lockheed Martin chairman, president and chief executive Marillyn Hewson.The company raised its full year forecast for diluted earnings to $17.50 per share, up from July’s guidance of between $16.75-$17.05.“The preliminary outlook for 2019 assumes the US Government continues to support and fund the corporation’s key programs. Changes in circumstances may require the corporation to revise its assumptions, which could materially change its current estimate of 2019 net sales, operating margin and cash flows,” the company said in a statement.The US defence industry could risk losing large contracts with Saudi Arabia in the furore over the killing of journalist Adnan Khashoggi. However, analyst Jim Corridore, of CFRA research, said in a note before Lockheed’s earnings that “there exists the chance for contracts to be cancelled, but we see the most likely scenario as a push out in timing of deals in place and a moratorium on new deals until the current geopolitical firestorm becomes more manageable.”
16;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-10-19T21:18:58Z;Canada chooses BAE design for next generation of warships;Type 26 from Lockheed Martin-led group beats rivals to provide backbone of Ottawa’s navy;Canada’s next generation of warships will be built on a design by Britain’s BAE Systems after Ottawa selected an international consortium led by Lockheed Martin as its preferred bidder.The Canadian government said late on Friday that BAE’s Type 26 design had beaten two rival submissions in a competitive tender to provide replacements for the Royal Canadian navy’s frigate fleet. While a final contract award still has to be made the news marks a significant step forward in what is the largest and most expensive military purchase in Canadian history.The selection of the Lockheed Martin-led team marks the second overseas order for BAE’s Type 26 design. BAE in June won a multibillion-dollar contract to supply the Australian navy with nine of the 6,900 tonne multi-mission warships in a competitive tender. The victory was significant in part because work on the first Type 26 for the Royal Navy only started last year and the ship is not due to enter service until 2027.The potential Canadian contract is much smaller and would be a licensing agreement only for BAE. The ships will be built at Irving Shipbuilding of Halifax, Nova Scotia.“These ships will form the backbone of our Royal Canadian Navy and will be Canada’s major surface component of maritime combat power for decades to come,” Public Services and Procurement Canada said in a statement on Friday. A contract award is expected this winter, the statement went on, “with construction beginning in early 2020”.Apart from BAE, the Lockheed consortium also includes CAE, L3 Technologies, MDA and Ultra Electronics. None of the companies was immediately available for comment.The team beat a rival submission from Alion Science and Technology which, along with its subsidiary Alion Canada, had submitted a proposal based on the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën Air Defence and Command (LCF) frigate. Navantia, a Spanish-based company, headed a team that included Saab and CEA Technologies. Its proposal was based on the F-105 frigate design, a ship in service with the Spanish navy.
17;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US temporarily suspends F-35 fighter jet flights for safety check;;The US has temporarily suspended flight operations of the global fleet of F-35 fighter jets for 24-48 hours to check for possible faulty fuel tubes in the engines of the planes, the Pentagon said on Thursday.The department said in a statement that the US military and its international partners, which include the UK, would be also be suspending flight operations temporarily to inspect fuel tubes out of caution after a crash in South Carolina last month raised concerns about whether the part was to blame.The Pentagon said if suspect fuel tubes had been installed, they would be removed and replaced. Those aircraft with “known good fuel tubes” would be returned to flight.“The primary goal following any mishap is the prevention of future incidents,” the department said in the statement.The news is a blow to the programme, the most expensive weapons programme in western history, and to Lockheed Martin, the US defence contractor which builds the jets. Shares in Lockheed Martin fell nearly 2 per cent in trading in the US to $330.33 a share.The Pentagon did not make clear how many aircraft were affected but the operational fleet worldwide is currently over 320 jets. The programme has attracted attention in recent years not just for its capabilities but also for its steep cost and delays.Lockheed Martin said in a statement that it was “actively partnering with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office, our global customers and Pratt & Whitney to support the resolution of this issue and limit disruption to the fleet”.The company later tweeted that flights were “resuming at the Lockheed Martin Fort Worth facility”.The UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement that “not all F-35s had been grounded”. It had “paused some F-35 flying as a precautionary measure while we consider the findings of an ongoing inquiry”.Flight trials from HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier were continuing and “the programme remains on schedule,” it added.The government has pledged to have two squadrons — 24 aircraft — operational from the carriers by 2023.Additional reporting by David Bond
18;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-09-28T04:53:52Z;South Korean defence sector in disarray after $16bn US tender fails;Shares slump after Boeing-led group triumphs in trainer aircraft contract;One of South Korea’s most promising industries was left reeling on Friday after a key arms manufacturer lost a much-anticipated multibillion-dollar contract to sell a fleet of jets to the US Air Force.Shares in Korea Aerospace Industries — South Korea’s sole aircraft maker — plunged as much as 28 per cent after the announcement the US would buy the 350 trainer jets from a Boeing-led consortium at a price tag of more than $9bn, about $7bn less than the air force originally said it would spend.The news triggered a broader rout of South Korean defence stocks, with engine maker Hanwha Aerospace and systems supplier LIG Nex1 falling as much as 12 per cent and 8 per cent respectively amid mushrooming concerns over the outlook for the industry.South Korea’s defence sector has blossomed in recent years on the back of global instability as well as an uptick in demand for the country’s speciality product: artillery.Regarded as modern, reliable and good value for money, South Korean military exports have soared more than tenfold in the past decade, with the bulk of sales coming from buyers in south-east Asia and the Middle East.The US contract, however, offered Seoul the chance to burnish its reputation and sell more advanced military equipment to developed nations.The lost contract is likely to cast a long shadow over the future of KAI, a company marred by controversy in recent years. Several top executives are under investigation for alleged financial improprieties, including price manipulation and accounting fraud.In May, the company became embroiled in the politics of the White House after it was revealed it had paid Michael Cohen, US president Donald Trump’s former lawyer, $150,000 for “advice” on “local accounting standards” in the US.For analysts, securing the deal — which at one point was estimated to be worth $16bn — was crucial to opening profitable markets for South Korean companies.“It is a big disappointment,” said Paul Choi, head of research at CLSA in Seoul. “This [contract] was not just about the US project, but about the potential for exports to other developed nations. People were holding [the stock] in anticipation of a win.”KAI had bid for the contract in partnership with US group Lockheed Martin — a tie-up that many in South Korea believed would give the company an edge.“Even though Lockheed Martin took part in this project in collaboration with KAI, due to Boeing’s low price and the resulting significant price difference, we failed to win the bid,” said the company, which described Boeing’s offer with Saab as “unbeatably low”.KAI had planned to supply its T-50A jets to replace the T-38 Talon aircraft that the US Air Force now uses to train pilots. Despite the setback on Friday, Mr Choi said the company would “not starve” and it still had growth opportunities in its “next generation helicopter project and its maintenance and repair business”. 
19;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Lockheed Martin raises full-year guidance;;Lockheed Martin upgraded its earnings outlook for 2018 after reporting a second-quarter profit that cruised past analysts’ expectations.Revenue at the Maryland-based aerospace and defence company rose 6.6 per cent from a year ago to $13.4bn in the three months ended June, comfortably surpassing the mean forecast of $12.7bn from analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll.Net earnings of $1.2bn, or $4.05 a share, were up by almost one-third from a year earlier and ahead of market estimates for $3.82 a share.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the “strong” results in the second quarter allowed the company “to increase our financial guidance for sales, profit, earnings per share and cash from operations” for 2018.The company now expects to generate earnings of between $16.75 to $17.05 a diluted share, up from its April outlook of $15.80 to $16.10, on revenue of between $51.6bn to $53.1bn, up from $50.3bn to $51.85bn previously. Analysts had forecast earnings of $15.81 a share on $51.3bn in sales.For the June quarter, Lockheed’s missiles and fire control business saw the highest sales growth, of 16.9 per cent to $2.1bn, which was more than twice the pace of that seen in the company’s main aeronautics unit, which saw sales rise 8.1 per cent to $5.3bn. The space business was the only one to see sales shrink from a year ago.Operating profit was up by the most in the company’s rotary and mission systems division, which encompasses helicopters, undersea warfare and missile defence among other things, rising about 26 per cent to $341m. Its missiles and fire control and space units also saw double-digit rises in operating profit.Lockheed shares were up 2.7 per cent in pre-market trade on Tuesday.
20;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-07-18T04:00:47Z;The cold war revival will be very expensive;Nothing eats cash like a weapons programme and Europe is the least efficient buyer;Having been abandoned by Airbus after the Brexit vote as a partner for the next generation of fighter jets, BAE Systems put on a brave face at the Farnborough Air Show on Monday. It unveiled a full-size model of what its planned Tempest fighter may look like in 20 years, and a UK government pledge of £2bn.Given that the programme for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter, built with BAE as a partner, is costing $400bn, that will not go far. “Capable, flexible, upgradeable, connected, affordable,” declared the slogan behind the model aircraft. The last is the biggest stretch.After a post-cold war decline and the squeeze that followed the 2008 crisis, this is a bountiful moment for defence contractors. Not only has Donald Trump raised the US defence budget but he spent last week berating its allies for missing Nato’s spending targets.But nothing eats money like a weapons programme and being told to spend more money quickly on defence is a recipe for waste. Europeans and Americans need to be better shielded from the resurgent military threats of Russia, China and others, but it will not come cheap. It will be particularly inefficient in the fragmented and nationally divided European market.Weapons are inherently expensive, lacking the qualities that help to reduce costs. Like a Formula One car, not only is the product itself bespoke, but it is made up of many unique parts, few of which can be bought off the shelf. The whole point is to have a piece of advanced equipment, on the cutting edge of what is technically possible.BAE showed a model of the Tempest fighter because none of it has yet been developed — not the avionics and sensors, nor the missiles, nor the engines that Rolls-Royce will design if BAE and the Royal Air Force find partners beyond Leonardo, the Italian defence company, and the weapons manufacturer MBDA. The entire aircraft is a prodigious feat of imagination.Nor can these costs be covered by making a lot of the product. Apple compensates for stuffing high technology components such as facial recognition sensors into iPhones by selling millions, but production runs for weapons are tiny. The F-35 was designed for use by Nato allies, but they cost about $90m each, 310 have been delivered, and the target is only 3,000 aircraft.There is also a supply chain constraint. The Pentagon cannot save money by having components acquired globally and weapons assembled in China — it is already wondering whether its supply chains are secure enough. Not only do defence contractors carefully pick and certify suppliers, but they often specify the individual factories that will make each widget.These challenges are big enough for the US, which will spend an estimated $623bn of Nato’s total of $936bn on defence this year. They are even greater for Europe, as the UK’s appeal this week for Tempest partners showed. Despite some consolidation. Europe suffers from fragmentation and lack of economies of scale that the EU has taken only baby steps to address.Brexit does not help but the difficulties are deeper than the muddle into which the UK has fallen. McKinsey, the consultancy, estimated last year that European countries could make savings of 30 per cent by procuring jointly and making weapons platforms operate together. Not only is procurement done nationally but software and systems are often incompatible.Members of the European Defence Agency, the EU’s nascent effort to pool members’ defence efforts, operated 178 major weapons systems in 2016, compared with 30 in the US. Europe has 20 types of fighter jet, while the US has six. If you combine a far lower budget with procurement aimed at supporting domestic companies as well as defending citizens, it is bound to cost a lot.Governments would dearly like to prevent themselves being locked into expensive and inflexible weapons systems that often operate long after they were to be replaced because of the cost of building new ones. They dream of fighter aircraft that are upgradeable in the manner of iPhones, rather than having obsolete technology flying around 30 years after launch.The Pentagon now talks of “creative compliance” — speeding up innovation by giving contractors incentives to innovate rapidly rather than being hamstrung by bureaucracy. If the RAF finds the partners to build Tempest, it wants the aircraft to be reconfigurable and to have open architecture, rather than being stuck with software that is ageing before the first test flight.It all sounds highly rational but history hangs heavily over defence procurement and President Trump’s effort to propel allies into ramping up budgets rapidly will make it heavier. His metric of success is spending money rather than spending it efficiently, and Europe has not performed well at either.It is a fine call whether European defence integration or sixth-generation jet fighters will take off first. Meanwhile, an industry with a severe supply side problem will try to solve it by raising demand. The model of a Tempest has one advantage over fighters that actually fly: it was cheap.john.gapper@ft.com
21;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-07-15T21:31:57Z;Lockheed chosen to launch Britain’s commercial space age;Company allocated grants of £23.5m to develop remote site in Scotland;Lockheed Martin will take Britain into the commercial space age after winning government grants totalling £23.5m to launch small satellites from a remote area of the Scottish Highlands.The sparsely populated area around Tongue in Sutherland, which is at the northern tip of Scotland and roughly 56km from the Dounreay nuclear site, has been chosen for the UK’s first space port to launch small satellites into polar orbit. They are expected to be used mainly for earth observation and other data-gathering tasks.Two launch consortiums have been chosen to develop commercial vertical launch services at the site, and aim to send the first rockets into space from the early 2020s. In total, the government has awarded grants of £33.5m to operators and local enterprise agencies to develop launch capabilities in Britain.Lockheed, the US aerospace and defence company, which is working with US partners Moog and Rocket Labs, has won the biggest share of funding after pledging to develop and build cutting-edge satellite launch technology in Britain.Patrick Wood, Lockheed Martin’s international business development director, said some 375 jobs would be created over time. The aim was to expand Lockheed’s footprint in the UK as it seeks a foothold in other British space programmes such as the Skynet military communications system. Lockheed had also pledged to help British startups to develop ideas to exploit the data gathered in space.A second grant of £5.5m has been awarded to Orbex, a UK-headquartered European space start-up, to develop its orbital launch vehicle, called Prime, to deliver small satellites into Earth’s orbit. Earlier this year, Orbex executives indicated the company would build a factory close to the launch site in Scotland.A further £2.5m funding will go to the Scottish Highlands and Islands Enterprise to help build the space port.The funding kick-starts the ambition cited in Britain’s first national space policy, launched in 2015, to take 10 per cent of the £400bn global commercial space market by 2030.The government is keen to tap into booming global demand for small satellite launches as the costs of accessing space tumble. It estimates that horizontal and vertical launch services could be worth £3.8bn to the British economy over the next decade, while the global market for small satellite launches is expected to be worth some $25bn over 20 years.However, many details need to be ironed out in supplementary legislation before rockets can be launched from British soil. Most important, the government will have to make clear how liability for launches would be shared if the private sector is to be able to access affordable insurance.The government had originally planned to back at least two port sites, one for vertical launch and a second for horizontal, where specially adapted launch aircraft will take off from a runway. However, horizontal technology, which will also be the vehicle for space tourism, is still some way from being commercially viable.Greg Clark, the business secretary, has also awarded a £2m grant for a horizontal development fund. Cornwall was one of the contenders for the funding, and has plans to develop horizontal launch capability from Newquay airport.Mr Clark said the awards aimed to make Britain “the first place in mainland Europe to launch satellites . . . the UK’s thriving space industry, research community and aerospace supply chain put the UK in a leading position to develop both vertical and horizontal launch sites”.
22;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-07-10T04:00:30Z;Germany heads for political dogfight over replacing the Tornado;Whether Berlin opts for a European or US aircraft, one of its allies will be angered;"The first Tornado fighter jet roared across the sky over Germany in 1974, ushering in a new era for the country’s air force.The twin-seater combat aircraft served as the backbone of the Luftwaffe in the closing stages of the cold war and the turbulent years that followed. In 1999, a squadron of German Tornados took part in combat missions above Bosnia — the first by the Luftwaffe since the end of the second world war. Now the ageing plane is heading for retirement — leaving the government in Berlin with a difficult choice that touches military, political and even nuclear sensitivities and that is bound to antagonise at least one of Germany’s closest allies. The government will decide this year which model should replace the Tornado when the 85-strong fleet goes out of service, starting in 2025.One of the tasks the new aircraft will have to replicate is the ability to carry and deploy US nuclear weapons — one of the core capabilities still provided by the Tornado and its most contentious by far. Defence officials agree there is no time to develop a new plane, meaning the lucrative contract will go to the maker of one of four existing aircraft: the Eurofighter, which is built by a consortium of German, British and Italian groups; or one of three US-made plans — the ultra-modern F-35A (Lightning II), the F-15E (Strike Eagle) or the F/A-18E/F (Super Hornet).[Buying a US jet] would be a sign of goodwill at a very difficult moment in the German-US relationship. It would be a symbol for TrumpThe size of the order has yet to be determined but is likely to be worth billions of euros. “This is a real fork in the road,” said François Heisbourg, a French defence analyst. “The decision will impact the future of the nuclear mission, the long-term future of the aerospace industry in Europe as well as defence relations between Germany and America on the one side and Germany and the rest of the Europe on the other.” The politics of the looming decision are delicate in the extreme. At a time when Germany is under attack from President Donald Trump over the level of its defence spending and yawning trade surplus with the US, handing the order to a US company would deliver obvious political rewards.“It would be a sign of goodwill at a very difficult moment in the German-US relationship,” said Christian Mölling, a defence expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “It would be a symbol for Trump. We could say: ‘Look! We are buying from you!’” Claudia Major, a defence analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, said: “Buying American means hoping for American security guarantees — and it would strengthen the transatlantic relationship.”But the downsides are also clear: buying a US aircraft would make Germany more reliant on the US at a time when doubts over Washington’s commitment to its European allies are on the rise. It would also deliver a severe blow to Europe’s — and Germany’s — defence industry, with potentially grave long-term consequences.Only last year, the French and German governments agreed to build a new fighter plane from scratch, a landmark project dubbed the Future Combat Air System. However, the new aircraft would go into service no earlier than 2035. Without the Eurofighter to keep factories humming in the meantime, the continent’s aerospace industry could end up badly weakened. “A possible order of the Eurofighter would secure the preservation of expertise in military aviation in Germany and Europe. It would also keep value added at home,” a spokesman for the defence ministry in Berlin said.Opting for the Eurofighter, however, has one obvious drawback. One of the pillars of Nato’s nuclear deterrence doctrine is known as “nuclear sharing”. Under this, countries that do not have nuclear weapons provide pilots and aircraft to carry US warheads stationed in their own territory.In the case of Germany, that capability is provided by the Tornados of the Luftwaffe’s tactical air force wing 33 in Büchel, western Germany. The Eurofighter, in contrast, is neither built nor officially certified to take that same role. The certification to carry such nuclear weapons can be granted by the US alone — and some defence experts doubt that Washington would be in a rush to do such a favour to a European rival.Whatever the outcome, the stakes are high. “Germany’s entire role in Nato’s nuclear sharing arrangement hangs on this. It doesn’t just affect us but the whole alliance,” said Ms Major. As the political debate enters the crucial phase, European and US defence contractors are jostling for position. Lockheed, maker of the F-35, argues that its plane is the most advanced by far and that any order would come with significant contracts for German industry. “At its core, the [German decision] boils down to capability versus supporting the indigenous industrial base. We would expect if Germany selects the F-35 there would have to be a robust industrial package that goes with that,” said Steve Over, the director of Lockheed’s F-35 international business development. But the German arm of Airbus, a leading partner in the Eurofighter consortium, believes its offer will ultimately prevail. “If they choose the Eurofighter it will simply mean adding new capabilities to an aircraft they already have rather than getting a new aircraft into their inventory. We all know how painful that process would be in terms of training, overhaul and maintenance — everything would start from scratch,” said Florian Taitsch, a spokesman for the group. Speaking at the ILA air show in Berlin earlier this year, Germany’s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled she had a “clear preference” for the Eurofighter. But other parts of the defence establishment appear to have a different view, with the Luftwaffe said to prefer the F-35A for military and political reasons. “The Americans and the Luftwaffe want Germany to buy an American aircraft, and the political leadership in Berlin wants a European solution,” said Mr Heisbourg. “There is a lot riding on this decision.”"
23;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-06-19T16:35:48Z;Turkey rounds on US Senate move to block sale of F-35 jets;Move underscores poor relations between Nato allies who have clashed on range of issues;Turkish officials have criticised a US Senate vote that could block transfers of the F-35 fighter jet to Ankara, a move that reflects increasing tensions between two Nato allies and which could ultimately hold up the sale of 100 planes worth close to $10bn.Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim described the move, which came just days before Sunday’s Turkish elections, as “lamentable”, against the spirit of the Nato partnership and said Ankara could look for alternatives, in comments published by the Turkish broadcaster Haberturk. A bipartisan clause added to the National Defence Authorisation Act — passed by the Senate late on Monday by a vote of 85 to 10 — would prohibit transfer of F-35s to Turkey until a plan is submitted to cut Ankara from participation. Turkey is one of 14 Nato members that have signed up both to buy and help produce the stealth jet, along with the UK, Norway and Israel. Pentagon officials and US lawmakers are concerned by Turkey’s stated intent to install a Russian air defence system, which they fear would put the secrets of the F-35 and the data it collects at risk.The S400 Russian anti-aircraft weapon, which Turkey has said it will acquire next year, has the capacity to launch surface-to-air-missiles and relies on a powerful radar system along with autonomous detection and targeting that US officials worry could compromise the secrecy of the F-35, America’s flagship stealth fighter. The US has a provision to issue sanctions waivers to allies who buy military equipment from Russia but experts insist these cannot be extended to the F-35 system. “[Turkish president Recep Tayyip] Erdogan’s already paid a lot of money to Russia so we need to tell Erdogan that we’re not trying to create problems between him and [Russia president Vladimir] Putin, but that there is a huge concern over the F-35 specifically,” said James Jeffrey, former US ambassador to Turkey. “This is a real strategic threat to us.” Eric Edelman, a former senior Pentagon official who was also ambassador to Turkey, said the S400 risked compromising systems on the F-35. “The Pentagon is in a very difficult bind. Folks there had been hoping this problem would blow over and that they could talk the Turks out of it, because Turkey is too important an ally. They also didn’t want to give Erdogan the opportunity to pose as a defender of Turkish national honour against the Americans in the elections.” Mr Erdogan is seeking to drum up the support of nationalist voters ahead of this weekend’s elections. Analysts said the Senate vote could bolster the Turkish president, feeding into his narrative that foreign powers are conspiring to damage the country. US officials have said relations between the two Nato allies have in recent months reached their lowest ebb since Turkey’s invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974. In addition to disagreements over Syria and other issues, the Senate vote reflected US concern at the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who is being held in Turkey after being charged with terrorism in the wake of a 2016 coup attempt that Ankara believes was spearheaded by a Turkish resident of the US. US officials see the detention of Mr Brunson as an unacceptable bid to secure a swap. But the US has also been making overtures to Turkey. Last month, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo reached preliminary agreement for a US-backed Kurdish militia, which Turkey views as a terrorist group, to leave the strategic Syrian town of Manbij at Turkey’s request. The diplomatic outreach risks being overtaken by Congress, however. The bill could undergo further changes in the reconciliation process with the House of Representatives, and is not expected to become law until later in the summer. Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-35, said it still expected to hand over the first F-35 aircraft to Turkey in a ceremonial exchange in Texas on June 21. Turkish pilots are due to be trained on the F-35 in the US, but the warplanes themselves are not scheduled to leave the country for at least a year, giving the Pentagon time to find a solution should the new law pass.Follow @KatrinaManson and @LauraPitel on Twitter

25;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed shrugs off F-35 spat to lift outlook;;An ongoing dispute with the US defense department over one of its fighter jets failed to cloud Lockheed Martin’s outlook for the year.Shares in US aerospace and military-contractor briefly rose before turning negative even as the company topped expectations for its first quarter results and raised earnings guidance for 2018.The company is now targeting earnings of $15.80-$16.10 per share on sales of as much as $51.85bn. That’s up from its previous forecasts of $15.20-$15.50 in earnings on sales of between $50bn-$51.5bn.The guidance nudge comes even as the US department of defense said this month that it has stopped accepting deliveries of F-35 jets because of a contractual dispute over who would foot the bill to fix a production error. The US military is one of Lockheed’s biggest customers and a key source of sales and profit.Lockheed boosted sales by nearly 4 per cent during the March quarter to $11.6bn, ahead of Wall Street estimates for a slimmer rise to $11.24bn. The growth was driven primarily by the aeronautics and rotary and mission systems divisions. The two units, Lockheed’s biggest by sales, booked revenue gains of 7 and 3 per cent respectively.Net income came in at $1.15bn, compared to the $789m recorded last year and the $959.7m analysts had predicted.The results from Lockheed are likely to boost optimism over the sector, which is expected to benefit from rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia as well as higher US military spending. Boeing, Raytheon and General Dynamics are among those expected to report results in the coming days.Lockheed shares rose as much as 1 per cent to $361.99 in opening trade, putting it briefly within striking distance of the all-time high of $363 set earlier in February before giving up those gains to trade down 1.5 per cent.
26;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-03-28T15:29:50Z;Poland strikes $4.75bn Patriot missile defence deal with US;Warsaw places biggest arms order with eye to security on Nato’s eastern flank;Poland has struck a $4.75bn deal with the US for a Patriot missile defence system, the central European country’s biggest weapons procurement.The linchpin of Nato’s eastern flank has been accelerating its drive to modernise its armed forces since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in neighbouring Ukraine in 2014.The country is one of the few members of the Nato alliance to spend 2 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence, and last year pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030.Andrzej Duda, Poland’s president, on Wednesday hailed the deal, which includes four radar and four combat stations, 16 launchers and 208 PAC-3 MSE missiles, as a “unique and historic moment that ushers Poland into a new world of ultra-modern technology and weaponry”.“This is a new chapter in the history of the Polish army, a huge step forward for the entire Polish army,” he said. “This is a lot of money but we know, also from our historical experience, that security has no price.”Relations between Warsaw and Washington have been hurt this year by the fallout from a law passed by Poland that would make it a crime to falsely accuse the Polish nation or state of Nazi war crimes.The US raised concerns over the impact the law could have on freedom of speech, and took the unusual step of warning publicly of “the repercussions this . . . legislation, if enacted, could have on Poland’s strategic interests and relationships — including with the US and Israel”.However, the diplomatic tension was not enough to derail the long-awaited deal, which comes as relations between Moscow and the west have hit a new low in the wake of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter in the UK this month.The British government has said that it was highly likely that the attack was ordered by the Kremlin, and this week more than 20 European and Nato countries expelled Russian officials and suspected spies in the biggest diplomatic offensive against Russia since the cold war.The Polish defence ministry said the defence system would be used to combat short-range ballistic missiles, self-propelled rockets, as well as manned and unmanned air strikes, and would be able to neutralise enemy targets “within seconds”.Most of the system is made by Raytheon, the US defence group, while the missiles are made by rival Lockheed Martin. The deal includes the provision of technical, logistic and training equipment.Poland is negotiating with the US to buy further systems as a second phase of its military overhaul.
27;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US businesses react with alarm to Trump’s China tariffs;Shares in exporters hit by fears that measures will prompt trade war with Beijing;US businesses responded with alarm to President Donald Trump’s announcement of wide-ranging tariffs on imports from China, warning that they would raise costs for American consumers and risked provoking a damaging trade war.Business groups from a range of industries expressed a common view: they shared Mr Trump’s concerns about intellectual property violations and unfair trading practices by China, but thought his decision to use tariffs to address the problem would be counter-productive.As US shares dropped in response to the tariffs on Thursday, some of the worst-hit companies were US exporters, including Boeing and Caterpillar, because of fears that China would take retaliatory measures.China was the third-largest market for US goods exports last year, with aircraft and aircraft parts the largest category. Other principal US exports to China include soyabeans, cars, computer chips and industrial machinery.Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek, a New York-based research group, said: “If someone wants to make a political statement, the single easiest way to have an impact on the US stock market is to cancel a Boeing order.”At the market close, Boeing’s shares were down 5.2 per cent, and Caterpillar’s had fallen 5.7 per cent. Shares in Arconic, which makes aerospace components, fell 6.1 per cent.Boeing and Caterpillar declined to comment on Mr Trump’s plans.Business groups, however, were outspoken in their criticism. Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, welcomed Mr Trump’s focus on China’s theft of US intellectual property, but added that tariffs were “likely to create new challenges in the form of significant added costs for manufacturers and American consumers”, as well as potentially provoking retaliation.The only lasting solution would be a “fair, binding and enforceable trade agreement with China that requires them to end these practices once and for all,” he added.One of the strongest responses to the plans came from the National Retail Federation, which said the tariffs would “punish ordinary Americans for China’s violations”.Matthew Shay, the NRF’s president, added that middle- and working-class Americans were “just starting to see the benefits of tax reform in the form of bigger paycheques and higher wages”, and a trade war would “erase those gains and result in higher prices for a wide range of consumer products and basic household goods.”There were also strong words from an agricultural industry group called Farmers for Free Trade. Brian Kuehl, the group’s executive director, said the tariffs would “put a target on American farmers’ backs”.He added: “Given that China is the second-largest export market for American farmers and ranchers, the pain from retaliation could be significant.”The Information Technology Industry Council warned that the tariffs would “cause harm to US workers, businesses, and economic growth”.On Monday, the group led a group of 46 US industry and trade associations in making a last-ditch appeal to Mr Trump, writing a letter warning that “the imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the US economy”. The business groups said the tariffs would provoke retaliation, stifle US exports, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.One of a few companies not joining the denunciations was Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor. Marillyn Hewson, chief executive of Lockheed, said at the ceremony that “we very much welcome this action.”The company in a statement praised the administration’s “focus on the critical need to protect US defence and aerospace industry intellectual property.”Roger Krone, chief executive of Leidos, an IT company that does work for the US government, praised the administration for “taking tangible steps to not only protect US companies in the marketplace, but also to protect billions of dollars of research and development that can make the difference on the battlefield”.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock and Patti Waldmeir
28;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-03-05T21:09:53Z;Lockheed Martin says long-term contract will help against tariffs;Aluminium and steel ‘not a large proportion’ of content, says finance chief;Lockheed Martin is negotiating a long-term purchase agreement which would insulate it against the effect of proposed new US steel and aluminium tariffs until 2021, chief financial officer Bruce Tanner said on Monday.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Tanner said the company — one of the largest US defence contractors — is discussing an agreement for aluminium for the C130 military transport plane, one of the biggest users of the metal in the Lockheed portfolio but which represents only about 2 per cent of sales. The metals “are not a large proportion of our content”, he added.Even without a long-term contract, the potential hit from the 10 per cent aluminium tariff proposed by President Donald Trump would only be “in the hundreds of thousands of dollars”, a small proportion of the price of planes which sell for $65m to $70m each, he said. “It’s not an inconsequential sum by any stretch of the imagination but it’s probably not as large as a lot of folks would think,” he added. “It’s not like it would have a huge impact.We have more exposure for aluminium than steel but even there it’s not a significant portion“We have more exposure for aluminium than steel but even there it’s not a significant portion . . . for the lion’s share of our growth programmes, like the F35 [fighter plane], it’s not that significant.”Defence contractor stocks were hit hard last week by news of the proposed aluminium tariff and a larger 25 per cent tariff on steel. Lockheed Martin shares have fallen more than 3 per cent since the announcement last Thursday.But Wall Street analysts say defence contractors’ exposure to the metals is smaller than many investors believe. Lockheed’s suppliers would probably be more affected by squeezed margins, however, as those locked into long-term contracts cannot pass on the raised costs. Jim Corridore, defence analyst at CFRA, said: “We think the market has overreacted to the impact of aluminium and steel tariffs on the sub-industry.”Tariffs would lead to higher input costs, he noted, but aluminium prices rose about 30 per cent and steel prices 40 per cent last year without any tariffs — “while the companies themselves largely saw higher profit. Large backlogs, strong demand and lower tax rates should help more than tariffs would hurt.” Mr Tanner said the lack of details about the tariffs made it difficult to estimate total impact. For example, Lockheed does not know whether titanium — which is used to make the F35, which accounts for about 25 per cent of Lockheed sales — would be covered. “It doesn’t appear so,” he said.
29;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-03-04T15:22:25Z;The backlash against shareholder value;Many Americans believe corporations must address social and political issues;It used to be that there was just one metric for corporate performance — share price. These days, not so much. In the age of Donald Trump and #MeToo, companies are expected to wade into the murky waters of politics.The most recent mass high school shooting in Florida has added urgency to the issue, with BlackRock, the asset manager, floating the idea of leaving gun makers out of index funds and retailers like Dick’s and Walmart taking assault-style weapons off their shelves.This follows months of corporate stands on everything from immigration to sexual harassment to LGBT rights, a wave of activism punctuated by Merck chief executive Ken Frazier’s resignation from the president’s manufacturing council following Mr Trump’s failure to condemn a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last August. A few days later, the council was disbanded.The calls for companies to be judged on something more than share price have been growing for some time. Larry Fink’s most recent annual letter to BlackRock shareholders, which included a demand for more “purpose driven companies”, was a big turning point in the backlash against the shareholder value theory that has been the guiding force for companies for four decades. It is one thing when liberal academics and politicians call for a new kind of “stakeholder” capitalism. It’s another when the largest asset manager in the world does it.I surveyed a number of chief executives about Mr Fink’s letter at the World Economic Forum in Davos. While all were supportive of the general principle, most also expressed some frustration, not because Mr Fink wasn’t right but because he wasn’t clear. Senior executives know that judging companies only by share performance does not work because it engenders short-termism — research and development as a percentage of revenue has declined since the 1980s, in part because the share price usually suffers when companies announce this kind of spending. But they do not know what the new playbook is.“What does this really mean in practice?” asked the chief financial officer of a large multinational. “What are the new metrics that we are being judged on? And what happens if we fall short?”One of the things going for shareholder value was that it was precise. As long as shares rise quarter on quarter, you are doing your job. It is also clear it was a limited metric, one that has arguably resulted in far less corporate risk taking and innovation, and also one that disproportionately benefits senior executives, particularly large company chief executives who typically get more than half their compensation in stock. This incentivises short-term decision making.Perhaps most importantly, it’s a philosophy that does not appeal nearly as much to millennial consumers or workers, who demand that companies think about a broader group of stakeholders and a more complex set of political and social issues. A study released last week by the Global Strategy Group shows that two-thirds of Americans believe that corporations have a responsibility to address key social and political issues. It also found that those that do have far higher favourability ratings than those that don’t. Lockheed Martin, a company that said and did nothing following Charlottesville, had a significant drop in favourability ratings.Lockheed Martin, a company that said and did nothing following Charlottesville, had a significant drop in favourability ratingsSome of this depends on your politics. Corporate activism is far more popular among Democrats than Republicans (among the few memorable examples of any rightwing activism were arts and crafts store Hobby Lobby’s fight against mandatory birth control coverage by corporate insurance, and restaurant chain Chick-fil-A’s opposition to same-sex marriage). But the risks of non-action seem to outweigh those of action. Recent research shows that issues like Apple’s stand on LGBT rights made liberals much more likely to want to buy Apple products, but it did not make opponents less likely to purchase them.While I’m all for chief executives speaking out on issues that matter to them, I’m less keen on activism as a metric for corporate performance. This is not to say that we do not need to move beyond the mythology of shareholder value — we do. But my own guidelines would be more quantitative.Here are two things that boards might take into account, aside from share price, when judging corporations. First, executives should manage human resources as well as they manage capital. In a world awash with cash but facing a talent shortage, we need to start thinking of labour as an asset rather than simply a cost liability (this could be encouraged by changes in the tax code and accounting standards).Second, we should look more closely at corporate R&D as a percentage of revenues. Academics have found that private companies spend about twice as much on productive capital expenditure as public ones of the same type and size. It is a measure of how the pressure of adhering to shareholder value theory can kill innovation in its crib.Companies clearly need to think about more than investors. Consumers and workers are demanding, and getting, more political engagement from corporate America. But politics is risky. Investors should stick to economic metrics when they value corporations. They just need broader and better ones.rana.foroohar@ft.comShareholder returns are not the sole criterion on which CEOs are judged / From Quintin Price, London, UK

The US military-industrial complex only gets more complicated. On Monday, one of the prime US defence contractors, General Dynamics, announced it was acquiring CSRA for nearly $10bn.CSRA sounds dull enough. But it comprises one of the set of alphabet-soup private-sector contractors (along with SAIC, CACI) that service the Pentagon and other federal agencies. Last week, Congress and President Donald Trump revised the constraints from the Budget Control Act. Informally, that law was known as “sequestration” and put a hard lid on defence and social spending. Now that Uncle Sam is spending like a drunken sailor, it is no surprise that defence contractors will try to take advantage.General Dynamics already had an information technology outsourcing unit with $4.5bn in annual revenue. By adding CSRA that rises to $10bn in revenue, making it the second-largest government IT provider. Its willingness to double down is unique. The leading government IT provider, Leidos, is partially a spinout of General Dynamics rival, Lockheed Martin.*In the past, General Dynamics has admitted that its M&A record was “broken”. It likes the IT services segment because of the combination of relatively high profit margin and low risk. General Dynamics said on Monday it believed service businesses were disproportionally hurt compared with defence product programmes by the 2011 sequestration law. As such, service should commensurately bounce back.Shareholders in General Dynamics were neither enthusiastic nor shocked by the deal. The company’s shares basically remained flat. Defence prime contractors have rallied sharply in recent years — not just on the back of a Trump bump (General Dynamics shares are up 60 per cent in the past two years) but also from heavy buyback activity. Shareholders might be wondering if the $10bn for CSRA would be better spent on repurchasing more shares. Such disciplined thinking is no longer at the fore in an era unconstrained by austerity.* This article has been amended to reflect the status of LeidosLex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

31;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed climbs as profits top estimates;;Shares of defence contractor Lockheed Martin were up over 3 per cent in premarket trading after the company announced adjusted earnings per share well above Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of last year.The Maryland-based company reported adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.30 in the fourth quarter, well above market expectations of $4.06. Revenue for the final quarter of last year at $15.1bn was up 10 per cent over the year earlier period and also above market expectations.Like many US defence companies which took large one time charges in the fourth quarter relating to US tax reform, Lockheed’s took a net one time charge of $1.9bn primarily related to the tax law passed at the end of last year. Lockheed reported a net fourth quarter loss from continuing operations of $715m, or $2.50 per share, as a result.“We delivered outstanding performance as we completed 2017, which enabled us to end the year with strong sales growth, $6.5bn of cash from operations and a backlog of nearly $100bn, while also returning over $4.0bn to our shareholders,” Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed CEO, said in a statement.“Looking ahead to 2018, we remain focused on meeting commitments to customers, pursuing new business growth opportunities, investing in innovative solutions to prepare for the future, and returning value to our shareholders.”
32;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-01-24T06:24:43Z;Small satellites and big data: a commercial space race hots up;Investors see opportunities for cheap rocket technology and launch pad in New Zealand;Peter Beck has always been fascinated by space. As a teenager he built his own rockets, strapping them to bicycles and other vehicles in sometimes hair-raising experiments. But his love of engineering paid off on Sunday when Rocket Lab blasted three small satellites into orbit from a private launch pad on an 8,000 acre sheep and cattle farm in rural New Zealand — a “world first” that some believe could revolutionise the space industry.“Our rocket is one of the tools that is enabling much more access to space. It will allow some really cool things to happen that will have significant effects on humanity,” says Mr Beck, a 40-year-old engineer with boundless enthusiasm. “You are seeing the democratisation of space. Space is tipping from a government dominated domain to a commercial domain.”Rocket Lab is part of a wave of innovators driving a new space race. But unlike the 20th century cold war version between the superpowers, it is focused on developing commercial rather than military technologies. Consumers have for years benefited from internet, television and GPS navigation signals from space but developments in satellite technology are unleashing a plethora of services, from tracking commercial shipping to monitoring crops, cattle and pollution.The race is being fuelled by a new generation of miniature satellites, so-called nanosatellites or CubeSats, which are typically no larger than a shoebox, cheaper to build and easier to deploy than traditional bus-sized versions. The ability to mine big data, the falling costs of accessing space due to rocket innovation and a surge of investment by billionaires, such as Elon Musk of Tesla, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Virgin’s Richard Branson, and more recently venture capitalists, are combining to provide a boost to the industry.Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates the space market — ranging from the manufacture and use of infrastructure, to space-enabled applications such as satellite phones and weather services — is worth $339bn. It predicts this will grow eightfold due to the boom in satellite deployment, ancillary services and launch capabilities by 2045 to $2.7tn and produce “more advances in the next few decades than throughout human history”. Investors funnelled $2.8bn into space start-ups in 2016, a record amount for a second consecutive year in a sector where governments and their militaries remain the big spenders.The US, which appeared to temporarily lose interest in space after the end of its shuttle programme in 2011, appears once again to be prepared to lead. In December President Donald Trump asked Nasa to send Americans to the moon for the first time since 1972 and to prepare for trips to Mars. But experts warn the lack of a specific timeline or funding details means the announcement should be treated with caution.Commercial opportunities are tempting new countries to join the competition. In 2016 New Zealand established a space agency and last month legislation setting out a regulatory framework aimed at encouraging space businesses came into force. Australia, one of just two OECD countries without a space agency, along with Iceland, is setting up its own in March.“Australia can’t afford to be left behind,” says Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at Australian National University. “Almost every aspect of our modern lives is dependent on satellite infrastructure and this makes us very dependent on other countries’ space infrastructure.”At an industrial park on the outskirts of Adelaide, Italian rocket scientist Flavia Tata Nardini is hoping Fleet Space Technology, the company she co-founded with aerospace engineer Matthew Tetlow, can put Australia at the forefront of the nanosatellite industry. “When I arrived in Adelaide four years ago there were very few companies involved in space technologies. That is changing fast,” she says. “Now there are 55 space start-ups which have raised A$20m [$16bn] over the past six months.”Ms Nardini worked previously at the European Space Agency and TNO, a technology organisation based in the Netherlands. Fleet plans to launch 100 nanosatellites into orbit to provide internet connectivity for millions of sensor devices based in remote locations on Earth. It is targeting the mining, oil and agricultural industries, which are beginning to deploy large numbers of sensors to collect data that can then be mined to improve efficiency.“Technology has progressed to the point that nanosatellites are small, light and significantly cheaper to build than the traditional billion-dollar satellites,” says Chris Willshire, an automation and robotics engineer at Fleet. “It allows us to develop them a lot faster and launch them far cheaper than we used to.”In the past satellites could only be built and launched by multibillion-dollar companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin — one of the world’s biggest defence contractors — and Orbital Sciences Corporation. Today, start-ups and even universities are developing and launching them into orbit.In November UNSW Canberra, an Australian institution with a focus on defence, launched its first CubeSat, to help predict the orbit of space junk — disused satellites and other debris. To date, almost 900 nanosatellites have been launched into space and 560 remain in orbit, according to the Nanosats.eu online database.Planet Labs, a San Francisco company founded in 2010 by three former Nasa scientists, owns one of the satellites blasted into space by Rocket Labs on Sunday. In February it launched 88 of its Dove nanosatellites on a single rocket — the largest constellation ever to reach orbit from a single launch.The Californian company now has a network of 200 satellites that capture images of the Earth’s surface every day. The US government and humanitarian agencies used it to map the impact of deadly hurricanes in Florida, Puerto Rico and Texas last autumn. In New Zealand, farming groups are using the technology to estimate pasture cover to better direct livestock towards grazing.“This technology is a first for New Zealand and has not been previously commercially viable due to the frequent cloud cover over the country,” says Ian Ritchey, from Planet Labs. “Planet’s ability to capture images daily effectively counters this issue.”Spire, a satellite company based in San Francisco, bought two slots for its earth imaging devices on Sunday’s launch. Rocket Lab launch charges start from about $100,000 for a nanosatellite but prices vary depending on the payloads they carry and overall weight.“Getting into space is the biggest bottleneck we face,” says Jenny Barna, director of launch at Spire. “There is always a backlog in the US CubeSat community. [But] Planet and Spire always have CubeSats on the shelf. If Rocket Lab can do what it says then it could be a game changer for the small satellite industry.”Nanosatellites are launched into low-earth orbit — 500km-2,000km above Earth and far below the 36,000km “geostationary” altitude of larger communications satellites. This means they usually drop out of orbit and burn up in the atmosphere within two to three years, thereby requiring regular replacement and frequent launches. But blasting rockets into orbit is a complicated, expensive and risky process.The Atlas 5 rocket developed by United Launch Alliance — a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing and a mainstay for satellite deployments in recent years — cost about $109m to launch, in December 2016. It faces tough competition from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which developed the Falcon, the world’s first re-usable rocket, that can now be launched for about $62m.Yet one in 20space launches ends in failure, according to XL Catlin, an insurance underwriter, and delays are common due to technical challenges and bad weather. This month a multibillion-dollar spy satellite built by Northrop Grumman, which was launched by SpaceX, failed to reach orbit and was assumed to have been lost. In May the first test launch of Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket failed to reach orbit due to a technical fault.Another risk factor is that companies are not making money on space, according to BofAML, which says it is difficult to achieve due to the high levels of capital expenditure required to access the industry, delays and launch failure. SpaceX is “not currently profitable and may never be”, it says.However, experts say Sunday’s successful Rocket Lab launch, which cost just $5m, could mark a significant breakthrough. “For the smallsat and nanosatellite industry, this changes everything,” Spire’s Ms Barna says. “Now we have our own private ride if we want it — to where we want, when we want.”To keep costs down Rocket Lab uses carbon composite materials in its rockets rather than aluminium, which is a heavier and costlier material. Electric motors and lithium batteries drive the turbo pumps in the engine, rather than the more complex and expensive gas generators used in traditional rockets. The company 3D prints its engines, which dramatically reduces the time it takes to build each rocket.“Price is an important aspect but the most important thing [for potential clients] is frequency. The US went to space 21 times last year. We are licensed to launch every 72 hours over the next 30 years,” says Mr Beck.New Zealand’s remote location on the edge of the Pacific Ocean and lighter air traffic make it ideal for regular rocket launches, requiring fewer airspace closures than in US skies. The trajectory of a launch from the site at Mahia, on the east coast of the country’s North Island, takes the Electron over open water and is well suited to putting satellites into a north-to-south orbit around the poles.“We have the right geography and the launch angles to access space at a very high frequency,” says Peter Crabtree, head of the New Zealand Space Agency. “And now we have a great regulatory regime in place, which has been developed in close co-operation with the space industry.”Mr Beck was a big driver behind the Wellington-based agency and the new regulations, which enable frequent launches. He re-registered Rocket Lab as a US company in 2013, as it began attracting significant funding from Silicon Valley. But he realised frequent launches from the US would be difficult given the busy airspace and views New Zealand as the alternative.The decision to carry out launches from New Zealand required the government to establish a regulatory regime that conformed to US Federal Aviation Administration rules and needed Washington and Wellington to sign a bilateral treaty enabling the transfer of sensitive technologies between the two countries.“If you write that in your business plan it’s a pretty tough call. But the treaty was signed in one and a half years,” says Mr Beck. He puts the success down to Wellington’s willingness to lobby Washington, the country’s membership of the Five Eyes intelligence network and a US government that saw the advantage in frequent low-cost launches from a partner country.Rocket Lab has worked with the US defence department on engine projects and has attracted undisclosed funding from Lockheed Martin. The company, which is valued at NZ$1.4bn ($1bn) having raised NZ$200m, has also caught the eye of US venture capitalists eager to tap into a fast-growing sector.“Beck is the closest person I’ve seen that could be compared to Elon Musk,” says David Cowan, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, which manages $4.5bn of investments, including stakes in Rocket Lab and Spire. “Every time we have a board meeting I’m simply blown away by his inventions.”Bessemer, one of the world’s oldest venture capital companies, was among the first to embrace the space industry. And also one of the first to make money from a sector that requires significant upfront investment and patience to allow companies to generate revenues. In 2014 Bessemer cashed out its investment in SkyBox, a satellite imaging company bought by Google for $500m, to focus on the potential of space.“This was a defining moment for the industry. The exit attracted a lot of attention from the VC community and gave partners confidence in the space industry,” says Mr Cowan. “Up to that point many people thought we were crazy investing in the sector.”Richard Rocket, his real name, a co-founder of research company NewSpace Global, says the main thing holding back the industry is access, rather than price. He says there are about 50 companies around the world trying to build rockets specifically for small satellites and predicts that: “You are going to see a swath of customers across the board wanting to access space.”Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San FranciscoThe new corporate space race should provide a vast array of useful services on Earth and possibly future profits. But it may have a negative impact on the environment due to increases in space junk.US government researchers are already tracking at least 20,000 pieces of debris, larger than 5cm, in orbit, which have broken off from rockets, satellites and spacecraft. There are estimated to be millions of smaller pieces of junk, such as flecks of paint, which are untraceable.This debris whizzes around the planet at speeds about seven times faster that of a bullet and can cause enormous damage when they collide with satellites or other man-made structures in space. In 1996 a piece of space junk tore off a 2m chunk of a French spy satellite.Space missions can manoeuvre their craft to avoid the larger junk but as more debris enters orbit the problem is forecast to grow.“We are talking about literally thousands of satellites launching over the next decade and this will add to the amount of space debris in orbit,” says Marco Caceres, analyst at Teal Group, an aerospace and defence consulting firm, who warns tighter regulation is needed. “We are only starting to debate how to solve this problem.”Boeing, Samsung and SpaceX have all announced plans to launch thousands of satellites into orbit, prompting researchers to warn of more collisions and the creation of more junk. Some fear this could spark a chain reaction of collisions, known as the Kessler syndrome, whereby the amount of space junk orbiting the planet could make the use of satellites unfeasible for generations to come.
33;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2018-01-16T09:33:06Z;Norway oil fund sells out of BAE Systems in latest ethical investment move;;Norway’s $1.1tn oil fund has sold out of UK defence group BAE Systems and eight other companies as well as banning them from its portfolios in the latest in a series of high-profile ethical investment decisions.The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday that it had excluded BAE, Aecom, Fluor, and Huntingdon Ingalls Industries as well as maintained an earlier ban on Honeywell due to their involvement in the production of nuclear weapons.The oil fund has also banned from its portfolios Evergreen Marine, Korea Line, Precious Shipping, and Thoresen Thai Agencies because of “risk of severe environmental damage and serious or systematic violations of human right”. Pan Ocean has been placed under observation to see if it should be banned for the same reasons. Atal, a Polish property developer, was also excluded due to human rights risks.The Norwegian fund has excluded more than 100 companies – including big names such as WalMart, Boeing, Philip Morris and Rio Tinto – for a variety of reasons as it aims to be seen as an ethical investor.Most of the exclusions are due to Norway’s parliament banning companies that produce certain things such as coal, parts for nuclear weapons, and tobacco. Some relate to individual corporate behaviour such as causing environmental damage.The exclusions led to sharp criticism from Orde Kittrie, a law professor at Arizona State University. He wrote in an article in the Wall Street Journal that the bans on the likes of Boeing, Honeywell, and Lockheed Martin related only to their involvement in producing nuclear weapons for the US – and that Norway, as a member of Nato, relied on that for its defence.He added:Rather than praise Norway, [US president Donald] Trump should be holding it accountable for how it chooses to spend – or not spend – the vast fortune it received from geography’s lottery. As a Nato member whose defence is subsidised by the US, Norway should not be investing in enemy governments [such as Iran] while undermining allies and American defence contractors.
34;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-12-11T22:54:32Z;Trump aims for the moon — and then Mars;President’s directive changes priorities for Nasa but sets no target date;President Trump has officially set returning astronauts to the moon as the first goal of the US space program, after nearly a year of debate at the White House over changing the priorities left by the Obama administration.The formal decision to aim for the moon, 45 years to the day after the last human landing, came at a White House signing event where Mr Trump was flanked by a number of former astronauts. However, his official directive to Nasa did not set a target date, or outline any new programs that would be needed to put people back on the lunar surface.Returning to the moon would be “a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars” and “refocus America’s space program on human exploration and discovery,” Mr Trump said. “That’s what our country is doing again — we’re dreaming big.”The Trump administration has been looking to set a highly visible goal for the country’s space program, and earlier this year established a Space Council, under vice-president Mike Pence, to set strategy.The White House had initially hoped to bring forward a planned test of the Space Launch System — the rocket designed to take humans to Mars, the focus of Obama space policy — and use it instead for a high-profile mission flying astronauts around the moon. However, Nasa concluded that it could not hit the short-term deadline the Trump administration had been pushing for, leaving the first manned test of the SLS set for 2023.The idea of refocusing instead on the moon as a goal has been gaining support this year in the US, and could open up new opportunities for the country’s private space industry.Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, has already pitched the White House on building a lander to take equipment to the surface of the moon. Earlier this year, he said that a “permanently inhabited lunar settlement is a difficult and worthy objective. I sense a lot of people are excited about this.”The new interest in the moon shown by Mr Bezos’ private space company, Blue Origin, was followed by a change of heart by rival space entrepreneur Elon Musk. He had previously been dismissive of landing humans on the lunar surface — or even building a space station around the moon to act as a way station to Mars — instead advocating direct missions to the Red Planet.In September, however, Mr Musk put forward a new vision for his company’s Mars rocket, arguing that it could be used to support a manned lunar base, as well as ferrying people to different locations on earth at high speed.The White House hinted on Monday at working with companies such as these, commenting that the moon was “within reach of America’s private space industry.” One company, Moon Express, is hoping to put an unmanned vehicle on the moon soon, as a prelude to establishing a base to be used for mining.However, it also reasserted its support for the traditional contractors for Nasa programs, confirming that the SLS and Orion spacecraft, for which Boeing and Lockheed Martin are prime contractors, were still central to the US space program.
35;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-12-11T04:16:09Z;Global arms sales rise for first time in 5 years;Researchers say 2016 was the fifth-deadliest year since the cold war;Arms sales by the world’s 100 biggest weapons companies have increased for the first time in five years, hitting $374.8bn in 2016.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute on Monday publishes its annual assessment of global arms sales by the top 100 companies producing weapons and providing military services. Last year saw the end of five consecutive years of decline with a 1.9 per cent increase in total sales.The report comes as global tensions rise in regions such as Southeast and east Asia and the Middle East. The Peace Research Institute in Oslo estimates that while the number of conflicts fell globally in 2016, it was the fifth-deadliest year since the end of the cold war.Sipri’s assessment shows that the biggest weapons makers are selling almost 40 per cent more than they were 15 years ago, when its study of the top 100 began. In a separate report this year, Sipri found that the global transfer of big weapons systems had risen over five years to its highest volume since 1990, due to a sharp rise in imports by the Middle East.“The growth in arms sales was expected and is driven by the implementation of new national major weapons programmes, ongoing military operations in several countries and persistent regional tensions that are leading to increased demand for weapons,” the report states. Those weapons programmes include substantial investment in naval and air capacity, including submarines in the US and UK, as well as new-generation combat aircraft such as the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin. The US, with the world’s largest defence budget, has identified spending this year of $45bn on aircraft and related systems and $27bn on shipbuilding and maritime systems.According to Sipri, the top 10 weapons-producing companies accounted for 52 per cent of the total $374.8bn in sales last year, with combined revenues of $194.8bn. A dozen companies have shared the top 10 rankings for the past 15 years.The report does not include Chinese companies, due to a lack of data on weapons sales. However, it estimates that at least two — Avic, the aircraft producer, and Norinco, the land system producer — could be ranked in the top 10.Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest arms company, significantly widened its lead over Boeing as number two, in part due to the acquisition of Sikorsky helicopters and also due to the ramp-up in production of the F-35, the fifth-generation combat jet and the world’s most expensive military procurement programme.US and western companies dominate the list, accounting for 63 of the top 100 places, and together claim 82.4 per cent of total sales in 2016. Sales by the 38 US-based companies came to $217.2bn, up 4 per cent on 2015, driven by big costly programmes but also strong growth in military services.Total sales by western European companies remained stable. Reflecting intensifying tensions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, South Korean companies showed particularly strong sales increases, helping to drive a 12.3 per cent increase in sales by “emerging producers”.Rob Stallard, defence analyst at Vertical Research, said increased weapons sales would continue to support investor interest in defence companies.“The risk environment globally may not be as severe as at some points in the past, but it does seem to be heightened,” he said in a report last week to clients. “The majority of countries do seem to be reacting to this with increased defence spending, which doesn’t appear to be waning anytime soon. So while defence multiples, at least in the US, may be at peak levels, we think they are justified.”
36;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-10-24T16:16:50Z;Lockheed Martin drags on the S&P 500;Defence contractor’s shares fall as third-quarter results disappoint;Lockheed Martin was among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Tuesday as disappointing third-quarter results managed to overshadow a brighter full-year outlook.Shares in the world’s largest defence contractor fell more than 2 per cent to $313.59 — trimming its year-to-date gain to 25 per cent — after net earnings in the third quarter fell to $939m, or $3.24 a share, from $2.4bn, or $7.93 a share, a year ago when results were lifted by a one-off gain.Analysts had forecast gains of $3.27 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Net sales rose 5.3 per cent to $12.17bn, shy of the $12.8bn that analysts had been looking for.Despite missing expectations, Lockheed said it now expects earnings per share of between $12.85 to $13.15 for the full year, up from its previous projection of $12.30 to $12.60. The company also lifted its sales outlook to between $50bn and $51.2bn, from an earlier range of $49.8bn to $51bn.The slide in Lockheed shares came as Wall Street pushed deeper into record territory with upbeat results from Caterpillar and 3M helping lift the Dow.By midday in New York, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 23,459.65, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent to 2,569.67. Meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to 6,603.52.Elsewhere, shares in McDonald’s rose 1.6 per cent to $165.92 after the burger chain said global same-store sales climbed 6 per cent in the three months to the end of September, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts and signalling that its turnround is on track.The organic sales figure exceeded consensus forecasts for a 4.7 per cent rise. Last quarter, the company reported global same-store sales jumped 6.6 per cent — its best rise in 5 years.Total sales in the third quarter fell 10 per cent to $5.75bn, although this was in line with consensus forecasts, due to a refranchising effort in China that was expected to weigh on revenues in the quarter.Net income jumped to $1.88bn, or $2.32 a share, from $1.28bn, or $1.50 a share, a year ago. Analysts had predicted $1.77 a share.Net income was lifted by the sale of about $850m of McDonald’s businesses in China and Hong Kong as the company shifts to a franchise model. Excluding that impact, diluted earnings were $1.76 a share.Whirlpool shares declined more than 10 per cent to $163.64 after the maker of washing machines and refrigerators cut its full-year earnings outlook citing the rising cost of raw materials and an unfavourable pricing environment.Meanwhile, Biogen shares fell 4.6 per cent to $313.39 amid concerns about sales of the company’s spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza, which totalled $197.6m in the US and $271m overall but were shy of some analysts’ estimates. However, the drugmaker’s third-quarter revenues and earnings topped estimates.
37;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed Martin slips after quarterly results miss Wall St estimates;;Lockheed Martin on Tuesday lifted its full-year earnings outlook but posted disappointing third quarter results, sending shares in the world’s largest defense contractor lower in pre-market trade.The Maryland-based company said it now expects to earn between $12.85 to $13.15 for the full year, up from its previous projection for earnings between $12.30 to $12.60 a share. The company also boosted its net sales outlook to between $50bn to $51.2bn aided by a $200m property gain, up from $49.8bn to $51bn.Lockeed said that it is adopting new accounting standards that are reducing net sales by 2 per cent next year. Factoring that in, the maker of F-35 jets said it expects sales to rise 2 per cent in 2018, that was shy of the 2.9 per cent increase that Wall Street had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters data.Net earnings fell to $939m or $3.24 a share in the third quarter, compared with $2.4bn or $7.93 a share in the year ago period when results were lifted by a one-off gain from its move to merge its information systems business with Leidos Holdings. However, quarterly EPS also missed Wall Street expectations of $3.27, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Net sales rose 5.3 per cent to $12.17bn, shy of the $12.8bn that analysts had been looking for.Shares dropped 1.5 per cent in pre-market trading to $316.35.

After taking office, US President Donald Trump set the goal of agreeing a total of $110bn in arms sales to Riyadh over the next 10 years.According to Friday’s statement, the proposed sale:“will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country. This sale furthers U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, and supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of Iranian and other regional threats. This potential sale will substantially increase Saudi Arabia’s capability to defend itself against the growing ballistic missile threat in the region.”The proposed sale “will not alter the basic military balance in the region”, the statement added.Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are the principal contractors for the THAAD system. Lockheed’s shares are up 0.42 per cent today, while Raytheon has registered an 0.2 per cent advance. Neither moved appreciably after the announcement.

41;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed Martin lifts guidance amid rising F-35 production;;Rising production of its F-35 combat jets helped Lockheed Martin deliver second quarter results ahead of forecasts.The world’s largest defense contractor also raised its guidance, with full year diluted earnings per share now expected to come in between $12.30-$12.60, up from the $12.15-$12.45 it was forecasting just three months ago. Net sales are projected to be between $49.8bn-$51bn, compared to its prior estimates of $49.5bn-$50.7bn.Shares in Lockheed, which set a new record high of $290.06 on Monday, climbed another 0.9 per cent to $291 in early trade on Tuesday.For the three months to June 25, net sales rose by nearly 10 per cent to $12.68bn, ahead of the $12.42bn the market was expecting.The gains were powered by the near 20 per cent jump in sales in its all-important aeronautics unit, which includes the F-35 stealth fighter, the world’s biggest defence programme.Net income fell nearly 8 per cent during the quarter as a result of lost sales following the sale of its IT business last year. Adjusted for this, net income for continuing operations was up 4.7 per cent at $942m, or $3.23 a share, easily topping analysts expectations of $904.1m or $3.01 per share.The F-35 is Lockheed’s largest source of profit and growth, with the aeronautics business accounting for 41 per cent of total group revenue and operating profits during the second quarter. Lockheed is ramping up production of its latest stealth fighter as the F-35 starts to enters service with US forces and the first of the 11 allies that have also ordered the aircraft.Unlike any previous combat aircraft programme, Lockheed is continuing to develop the F-35 as it delivers aircraft, which means the early version of the aircraft have limited capabilities and will require upgrading. The jet is in effect a flying super-computer, with each aircraft running more than 8m lines of code.This approach combined with delays and the rising costs of the programme, has put Lockheed under pressure, including from President Donald Trump, to bring the unit costs of the aircraft down to levels previously agreed with the Pentagon.Lockheed has delivered 229 F-35s since the first aircraft rolled off the production line in 2011. The company has indicative orders for just under 3,200 aircraft from its 12 customers, although as with most large defence programmes those numbers aLockheed said it had delivered 229 F-35s since the first aircraft rolled off the production line in 2011. The company has indicative orders for just under 3,200 aircraft from its 12 countries, although as with most large defence programmes those numbers are susceptible to spending cuts.Analysts at Stifel, wrote in a note: “Given the size of the programme, a significant degree of Lockheed’s earnings power will be determined by its ability to increase margins on F-35 which is why we’re encouraged by Lockheed again citing higher risk retirements on the programme and a 17.1% incremental margin.”Lockheed shares are up 16 per cent so far this year, and the company now boasts a market value of more than $84bn. The gains have been largely driven by expectations that defense spending will continue to grow under the Trump administration even if other federal departments are seeing their funding slashed. Tensions with North Korea and turmoil in the Middle East meanwhile have further supported demand.
42;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-05-22T21:06:52Z;US defence companies lifted by Saudi deals;Lockheed Martin and Boeing stand out after Saudi Arabia signs a flurry of deals;Shares of defence and aerospace companies Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing all rose on Monday, after a weekend of deals between US companies and Saudi Arabia.US President Donald Trump began his first foreign trip with a stop in Saudi Arabia, where a $110bn arms package was announced that the White House hopes will help Saudi Arabia and other gulf states combat terrorism in the region and ward off threats from Iran.Shares in Lockheed rose 1.6 per cent to $277.03 after signing a $6bn deal to assemble 150 Blackhawk helicopters in the kingdom. It is part a broad array of announcements over the weekend that signal intent from Saudi Arabia to purchase more defence equipment from the company.Raytheon also inked agreements for local defence contracts. Its share price climbed 0.6 per cent to $161.19. Investors also judge Boeing to be a winner from the weekend’s deals, with its shares rising 1.6 per cent to $183.67. The company has secured aircraft and helicopter contracts, announcing on Sunday that it has agreed to a potential sale of 16 wide-body commercial aircraft to a Saudi airline. The news of the potential commercial wide-body jets order comes at a time of weakness in the market.“While these are not firm orders, it suggests the potential for having these firmed up is better today than it was before the weekend,” Cai Von Rumohr, senior research analyst at Cowen, said of the Boeing announcement.The advances in the defence stocks follow a turbulent week in trading on fears the administration will not be able to pass its pro-growth reforms. The S&P 500 recorded its biggest one-day fall since September on Wednesday, but has since recovered all but 0.2 per cent of its losses after a 0.5 per cent gain to 2,394.02 on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.4 per cent to 20,894.83 on the day, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8 per cent to 6,133.62.Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is investing $65bn in foreign asset managers as part of a plan to diversify the economy away from oil. Nearly a third of that will be put into a fund run by Blackstone to invest in US infrastucture. Andrew England discusses the move with Simeon Kerr, FT Gulf correspondent, and Arash Massoudi, M&A correspondent.“The fact [the Saudis] are willing to make an announcement of this magnitude at this point suggests they are happier with Trump and his approach than they were with Obama,” said Mr Rumohr.The week is also likely to continue positively for defence stocks, said Chris Higgins, an analyst at Morningstar. Mr Trump is expected to propose an increase in defence spending for the 2018 budget.Separately, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund has also announced a large investment in US infrastructure through a new Blackstone fund. The sovereign Public Investment Fund intends to invest $20bn into Blackstone’s new vehicle, with a further $20bn coming from other investors. The group’s stock price rose 6.7 per cent to $31.88.Elsewhere, Ford’s stock price rose 2.1 per cent to $11.10 after the carmaker said it was replacing Mark Fields as chief executive with Jim Hackett. The company’s shares have fallen almost 9 per cent this year.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.5 per cent to 6,112.79.Aerospace and defence stocks were up 1.5 per cent to lead the gains, including a 2.6 per cent increase in shares of Lockheed Martin, a company at the centre of the arms deal. Shares in L3 Technologies were also up 2.5 per cent, while Boeing shares gained 1.8 per cent.The gains extend the rally seen over the previous two trading days, after the S&P 500 had its worst trading day in eight months last week.The benchmark index has now made up all but 0.5 per cent from last Wednesday’s fall, as solid earnings have provided solace and policymakers pledge continued progress on promised reforms.Moving ahead, analysts at Citibank say “investors should be prepared for a period of continued headline risks and that some delays in Trump’s policy agenda are likely, with some policies ultimately de-railed”.Delays to regulatory and tax reform may dampen optimism on growth, they say, but the “key for markets will be the degree to which investors’ views on policy diverge from the Fed’s”, which could delay an increase in interest rates.
44;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Trump discusses bolstering security ties with Gulf states;US president hopes to rekindle a strategic relationship grown frosty under Obama;President Donald Trump discussed bolstering security ties with Gulf states on Sunday ahead of delivering a much-anticipated speech in Saudi Arabia on Islam, a showpiece of his nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe.The US president received a warm welcome from traditional allies on the tour that so far has been focused on arms and investment deals valued at between $280bn and $380bn and regional opposition to Iran.This contrasts with the more wary relationship between the previous US administration and Sunni Gulf states, which were highly suspicious of Barack Obama’s signature nuclear accord with their rival Iran.On Sunday Mr Trump told King Hamad of Bahrain that there “has been a little strain [between the US and Bahrain] but there won’t be strain with this administration”.Before meeting Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, on Sunday, Mr Trump added: “One of the things that we will discuss is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the United States.”President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi of Egypt feted Mr Trump as “a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible” — a comment that drew a laugh and the remark “I agree” from the US president.The arms deals agreed on Saturday included a $110bn arms package that the White House said would help Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states face Iranian threats and contribute to counterterrorism operations, “reducing the burden on the US military”, a White House official said.The value of the deals signal a revived partnership that promises Saudi investment into US infrastructure in return for US arms deals for the kingdom.Saudi Arabia is also looking for US support as Riyadh tries to transform its oil-reliant economy after the sustained drop in crude prices triggered a budgetary crisis and rapid deceleration.The kingdom hopes to cement this renewed commercial partnership with a common vision to check Iranian ambitions in the Arab world.Mr Trump on Saturday began a number of political and economic meetings with the Saudi leadership.The king accompanied Mr Trump up a red carpet at the royal terminal of Riyadh’s airport, with the president’s wife Melania following at the back of the small welcoming committee.Mrs Trump, who like many foreign dignitaries did not cover her head or wear the black abaya robe, was nonetheless conservatively dressed in flowing dark trousers and blouse, accessorised with a gold belt.As the president landed, dozens of chief executives from Saudi Arabia and the US were convening at a forum where they discussed Saudi financial flows into America, and how the US could help diversify the kingdom’s oil-reliant economy.“The government is taking a back seat and putting the private sector as the locomotive to drive the economy,” said Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister. “There will be risks but we will work with you to mitigate it.”Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, signed more than $50bn worth of deals on Saturday, around $22bn of which were new memorandums.When deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Washington this year, the White House estimated that Saudi investment pledges could rise to about $200bn.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin signed a $6bn deal to assemble 150 Blackhawk helicopters in the kingdom, supporting 450 jobs. Raytheon and General Dynamics also signed agreements to support the localisation of defence contracts.On Sunday Boeing said it had signed several defence and commercial deals with Saudi Arabia, including the potential sale of up to 16 wide-body commercial aircraft to a Saudi airline, but put no value on the deals. News of the potential commercial wide-body order — the jets in question are expected be twin-aisle 777 and/or 787 jetliners — comes at a time when the wide-body market is soft.The aerospace and defence company said the agreements also included an unspecified number of Chinook helicopters. The US department of state last year informed the US Congress that the administration intended to sell 48 Chinooks to Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom also wanted to acquire an unspecified number of Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft which are based on the 737 commercial aircraft, the company said in a statement.Boeing will also form a new helicopter servicing joint venture in Saudi Arabia, and a Saudi joint venture to provide military maintenance and support to Boeing and non-Boeing products, which analysts said could be one of the most valuable elements of the overall package.The deals support Prince Mohammed’s plans for the world’s third-largest spender on arms to create a domestic industry led by the newly formed company Saudi Arabia Military Industries. The kingdom wants to source half of defence spending locally by 2030 from 2 per cent now.Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund pledged $20bn for a $40bn Blackstone US infrastructure fund, with $20bn to be raised from other parties. Blackstone said it expects, with debt financing, to invest $100bn in infrastructure projects, mainly in the US.“This potential investment reflects our positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the US as announced by President Trump,” said Yasir Al Rumayyan, managing director of PIF.PIF was also an anchor investor in SoftBank’s Vision Fund, which on Saturday finalised its first close at $93bn.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Chicago
45;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Lockheed Martin trims earnings outlook, sales miss;;Lockheed Martin, the US defence contractor, reported disappointing first-quarter sales and lowered it full-year earnings outlook on Tuesday but modestly lifted its sales guidance.The Maryland-based defence contractor said net sales rose nearly 7 per cent to $11.06bn, below estimates of $11.2bn. Meanwhile, profits slid to $763m or $2.61 a share in the three months ending on March 26, compared with $898m or $2.91 a share in the year ago period. Earnings of $2.61 a share from continuing operations were also shy of Wall Street expectations of $2.79 a share.The results reflected two charges, a $120m charge recorded at its Rotary and Mission Systems division for a program to design and install an integrated air missile defense system for an international customer and a $64m asset impairment charge on an equity investment. Separately, the net earnings from continuing operations included a special charge of $80m tied to workforce reductions at the company’s Aeronautics division.*“While our net earnings were impacted by certain adjustments, we increased our outlook for full year cash from operations by $300m to at least $6bn and we continue to position the company to deliver outstanding value to customers and shareholders,” chief executive Marillyn Hewson, said.Lockheed also lowered its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $12.15 to $12.45 a share, compared with its initial outlook of between $12.25 to $12.55 that it delivered in January. However, it modestly lifted its sales projections for the year.“Investors are apt to be disappointed by Lockheed’s Q1 “miss” & ’17 guide tweak despite solid underlying ops and cash since they break the chain of “beat & raise” quarters,” Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen, said.The results come a day after the Government Accountability Office said that “cascading F-35 testing delays” could costs the Department of Defense $1bn more than it has currently budgeted. “Program officials estimate that a delay of 5 months will contribute to a total increase of $532 million to complete development,” according to the report. “The longer delay estimated by GAO will likely contribute to an increase of more than $1.7 billion, approximately $1.3 billion of which will be needed in fiscal year 2018.”Lockheed has pledged to save its F-35 customers more than $5bn over 20 years on a programme that was criticised by Donald Trump over its high costs.So-called war stocks have seen their shares rally under Mr Trump as the president has moved to increased the US defence budget and amid rising geopolitical tensions. Mr Trump has also pressured Nato members to shoulder their own defence burdens.Lockheed, which hopes to draw 30 per cent of its total sales overseas in the next few years, has previously noted that if Nato members fulfill their pledges to spend 2 per cent of their GDP on defence it could result in a $100bn boost in spending across organisation.Lockheed shares, which have climbed nearly 11 per cent so far this year, fell nearly 4 per cent in pre-market trading to $265.32.Note: Piece amended to clarify charges associated with Lockheed results.
46;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-04-09T19:05:12Z;Space’s next frontier entices upstarts and mainstays;Overlapping ambitions could usher in ‘golden age’ of innovation;The US space establishment, led by Nasa, has trained its sights back on the moon — and a budding commercial space industry is champing at the bit to follow.The space agency earlier this year said it was studying the feasibility of sending astronauts in an orbit around the moon for the first time since the 1970s, with a flight possible in 2019. The mission would bring forward the first manned trip for Orion, a spacecraft designed to eventually reach Mars, and is the latest sign that Nasa sees the moon as both test bed and stepping stone for venturing out into the Solar System.Less than two weeks later, Elon Musk, boss of SpaceX, declared his own intention to send two space tourists around the moon before the end of next year. And last week, executives of Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’ private space company, spoke publicly for the first time about their own lunar dream: a robotic lander that would deliver cargo to the surface, supporting future Nasa missions.The overlapping government and commercial ambitions point to a symbiosis that could usher in what Mr Bezos describes as a “golden age” of innovation in space. But they also hint at a budding competition that could make the next big leap in space exploration very different from the collaborative, government-led ventures that have characterised space development in the past.A growing number of space start-ups riding on Nasa coattails hope that the agency’s activities in “cislunar” space — the region between the Earth and the moon — will create the conditions for a sustainable commercial ecosystem of suppliers and other adventurers.———-Rocket options: Nasa SLSThe rocket that Nasa has commissioned to take the Orion spacecraft to the Moon and beyond. With a projected cost of $10bn when development began, the Space Launch System is modelled on the Saturn rockets that once carried the Apollo missions. (photo: Nasa)———-As things stand now, “the whole space industry is too small,” according to Mr Bezos. Speaking at the industry’s main annual gathering in Colorado last week, he put the total space launch market at only $2.5bn a year. The high cost of putting people or cargo into space has throttled demand, he says: “The reason is we don’t fly very often.” Supplying bases on the moon — like a deep-space Amazon — would be one way to overcome that hurdle.The renewed hopes for a return to the moon — and with it, the higher level of activity that would help to support commercial space industry — partly reflects optimism about the Trump administration. Nasa’s budget escaped the cuts proposed for some other agencies in the new president’s budget. Mr Trump has hinted at an ambitious space programme, talking recently of “American footprints on distant worlds”. Voyaging to the moon would generate much quicker political results than a Mars exploration, which Nasa has put more than 15 years from now.A pass around the moon would also do wonders for the lead contractors of some of Nasa’s most ambitious long-term projects — Lockheed Martin, which is building the Orion spacecraft, and Boeing, which is leading the development of the Space Launch System (SLS), a giant rocket that would carry Orion out to the moon and beyond. Bringing forward the first manned test would mean increasing spending in the near-term on things such as life support systems, but would be “very positive for the programme,” says Mike Hawes, who heads the development at Lockheed.———-Rocket options: SpaceX Falcon HeavyAn upgraded version of the Falcon 9 it already flies, SpaceX plans to use the Heavy to carry bigger payloads into orbit. The rocket — which will have extra boosters strapped to either side to add to its power — also plays a central role in Mr Musk’s goal of putting people into space. (photo: SpaceX)———-It would also give the establishment contractors a win at a time when a disruptive commercial space sector — led by Mr Musk and Mr Bezos — is snapping at their heels. SpaceX and Blue Origin are both working on rockets capable of carrying much larger payloads and reaching further out into space.The Nasa contractors claim there is still a gulf between the capabilities of their systems and those of the upstarts. Comparing the SpaceX rocket to the SLS is like comparing “a golf cart and a diesel pick-up truck”, says Jim Chilton, president of network and space systems at Boeing. Yet Mr Musk, has already earmarked a trip around the moon for his next rocket, matching it directly against SLS.Mr Hawes at Lockheed also questions whether, when it comes to carrying astronauts, disruptive space start-ups such as SpaceX will be able to increase the capabilities and reliability of their rockets and spacecraft without at the same time adding greatly to their costs, eroding the advantage they have over companies like his. He also vowed to cut 50 per cent from the cost of building Orion, by doing things such as streamlining suppliers, using 3D printing, and making more of the spacecraft reusable. “These systems may be in competition with me, but I’m going to keep beating them,” he adds.———-Rocket options: Blue Origin New Glenn 3-stageNamed after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, the New Glenn will be the first rocket from Mr Bezos’s Blue Origin capable of putting a payload into orbit. The new engine being developed to power the rocket — called the BE-4 — could one day become the workhorse of heavy orbital launches. (photo: Blue Origin)———-The real test for where collaboration ends in space and competition begins could come as sights move beyond the moon, to Mars. Boeing last week unveiled a plan for a space station in lunar orbit that would act as a “gateway” for a trip to Mars — a simplified version of an idea it first put forward last year.This reflects the model of international collaboration that was established with the International Space Station, says Mr Hawes. Suppliers from around the world would contribute different parts of the infrastructure being built to support a mission to Mars.However, Mr Musk’s company has a different view. Gwynne Shotwell, chief operating officer, last week brushed off a question about whether SpaceX would one day work alongside Nasa’s SLS. “We’re really focused on our programme,” she says. “We do plan to take initially large amounts of cargo and then crew to Mars.”There will still be plenty of reasons to collaborate. Acting as suppliers of cargo for future missions — even flying out ahead of Orion to drop off supplies for a protracted stay on Mars — would be a boon for commercial rocket companies. And Mr Musk’s own dream of deep-space transporters, each carrying 100 people at a time, might prove impractical.“If you look forward to deep space exploration, we all need to agree on an architecture where we don’t just take each other’s cheese,” says Mr Chilton of Boeing. It’s not yet clear if that co-operative way of working in space will define the next stage of exploration.Tory Bruno, head of United Launch Alliance, compares his company’s rockets to the railroads of the American West, opening up a new frontier for adventurers looking to make their fortune.He also sounds like a railroad baron as he enthuses about the resources waiting in space and on the moon for the first hardy entrepreneurs: “Water, energy, precious materials: right there they reside in such abundance that they defy the human imagination.” It will add up, he says, to a $3tn economy.Among the businesses lining up to grab at this promise is Made in Space, a Silicon Valley start-up that hopes to pioneer manufacturing in zero gravity. “We as humans go to frontiers because there’s wealth there,” says Andrew Rush, the company’s president.Made in Space has tested making a high-quality optical fibre on the International Space Station and plans to launch a more serious proof of concept later this year. But the long-term future of the space station, which costs about $3.5bn a year to run, is in doubt as Nasa shifts its sights to exploration further afield.Meanwhile, the first commercial explorers could soon be on the moon. One, Moon Express, hopes to take a robotic lander to the lunar surface by the end of this year, as a prelude to its main purpose: prospecting for valuable minerals. It is important not to venture too close to the frontier of space exploration, says Bob Richards, the company’s chief executive: “If you reach out so far that the market can’t follow you economically, it’s not sustainable.”Eric Stallmer, director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, sums up the mood: “Mars is in our hearts, but the moon is in our business plan.”
47;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-03-24T22:13:58Z;Charter’s US push earns Trump seal of approval;Jobs creation pledge originally announced before president took office;Charter Communications was the latest company to earn President Donald Trump’s seal of approval for a job creation pledge originally announced before the president took office.Tom Rutledge, chief executive of the US cable company, met Mr Trump on Friday in the Oval Office, where the president said Charter had committed to hire 20,000 workers, move all overseas call centres to the US, and invest $25bn in broadband infrastructure and technology, all over the next four years.The $25bn investment was new, as was the timeframe of four years for the job additions, a Charter spokesman said. However, Mr Rutledge first said the company would need to add 20,000 workers in 2015, as it was in the process of acquiring Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Charter also pledged to relocate TWC’s offshore call centres to the US as part of that deal.Mr Trump claimed credit for the move, adding it to the list of companies he has praised as job creators. “Charter’s announcement follows a number of American businesses from Exxon to Intel to Lockheed to Boeing to many others that have recently announced billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory,” he said.Charter said in a statement that it had decided to make the infrastructure and technology investment “with confidence in the deregulatory policies of the administration and the Federal Communications Commission”.In the Oval Office, Mr Rutledge said: “We’re also excited about the opportunity in the right regulatory climate and the right tax climate to make major infrastructure investments. We’re going to spend $25bn, we’re committed to spending that, predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country.”Telecoms industry executives have said they expect Mr Trump’s regulatory overhaul to be a boon to business, opening the door to capital spending and possible merger activity.Charter has explored a possible deal with Verizon that would create the world’s largest telecoms and cable company.This month, Mr Rutledge told an industry conference that “to de-risk future investment makes you feel better about investing . . . having a more stable regulatory environment can’t be anything but good”.
48;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-03-22T00:51:54Z;Lockheed praises Trump for making jets more ‘affordable’;Chief executive points to $100bn opportunity for sector from increased Nato spending;Lockheed Martin’s chief executive has credited Donald Trump with making its F-35 jets more “affordable” and creating a $100bn opportunity for its industry by pushing Nato allies to ramp up their defence spending, just months after the president accused the company of “tremendous” cost overruns.“President Trump has made clear that he and his administration will be focused on ensuring that the government is a ‘smart buyer’ getting the most for the taxpayer’s dollar,” Marillyn Hewson said on Tuesday, describing the company’s discussions with the president as “positive and constructive”.Ms Hewson said on Tuesday that the Maryland-based defence contractor is looking to save its F-35 customers more than $5bn over 20 years on a programme that came under fire late last year from Mr Trump over its high costs.The $5bn in savings are expected to come through the life of the programme in 2036 and are based off the cost savings per jet achieved in its tenth contract. Lockheed reached a deal with the Department of Defense last month that represented $728m in savings for the next 90 F-35 aircraft — a nearly 8 per cent reduction from the previous contract or a saving of about $1.8m per jet. At the time the company said that Mr Trump’s personal involvement had helped accelerate negotiations.Like other chief executives of leading American companies that have come under public criticism from Mr Trump, Ms Hewson has recently chosen an increasingly conciliatory public relations strategy. She has offered cost concessions, many of which were in the works before Mr Trump was elected, but presenting them as a victory for the president. Auto company executives have taken a similar approach, repackaging old decisions on jobs and investment in the US and presenting them as new concessions to the president, who has then used the announcements to bolster support in his core constituency which includes autoworkers.When the smoke clears in 10 years you will see the same budget numbers, it costs what it costs, the idea that you can arbitrarily find $5bn of savings in this programme is farcicalRichard Aboulafia, aircraft industry analyst at Teal Group, expressed doubts about the claimed savings. “When the smoke clears in 10 years you will see the same budget numbers, it costs what it costs, the idea that you can arbitrarily find $5bn of savings in this programme is farcical.”Lockheed, which is in negotiations with the DoD for the 11th lot of F-35 jets, first announced its Blueprint for Affordability alongside its industry partners in 2014. It has previously said it was targeting a price tag of $85m or less for its F-35 jets by 2019.But in her remarks on Lockheed’s media day, Ms Hewson also indicated that Nato could boost spending in response to Mr Trump. Borrowing a phrase from Damon Wilson of the Atlantic Council, she noted that there has been a “President Trump effect” that has seen Nato members consider shifts in US priorities — and that many were now seeing “the need to shoulder their own defence burdens”.Throughout his campaign, and in a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week, Mr Trump has criticised Nato members for failing to pay their fair share.If Nato members fulfilled their pledges to spend 2 per cent of their GDP on defence it could result in a $100bn boost in spending across Nato, Ms Hewson said. Lockheed derived 27 per cent of its total sales overseas last year — a figure it hopes to increase to 30 per cent in the next few years — and hopes to capitalise on any such increase in US allies’ spending.The remarks come after the Trump administration unveiled a “hard-power” budget plan last week that aims to increase US defence spending by $52.3bn.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Detroit
49;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-02-28T10:59:29Z;US defence spending: guns or butter;Despite the social media rhetoric, contractors should do well from Trump’s policy;“We have to start winning wars again,” explained President Donald Trump on Monday. His plan for victory is to outspend the enemy. It has worked before. Mr Trump’s budget is slated to include a $54bn boost — about a tenth — to the Pentagon spending in fiscal 2018 as well as supplemental spending this year of $30bn. The president views US military might as “depleted”, even though current outlay is equal to that of the next seven highest-spending nations combined.He may have a point. The 2011 austerity law known as sequestration capped defence spending growth just as it did social programmes. Hawks, including Trump critic senator John McCain, have been itching to buy more ships and tanks.For US defence contractors, the occasional presidential tweet accusing them of profligacy is simply an annoyance. They may sell a warplane more cheaply from time to time to humour him. But they will recoup the discount via higher volumes.Lockheed Martin has already withstood a Twitter bombardment over its F-35 jet. The programme is set to cost more than a whopping $400bn overall, double its initial estimate in 2001. The latest F-35 order completed earlier this month is, however, $728m cheaper than the last order, on a unit basis.Mr Trump’s jawboning deserves little credit for this. Incremental orders typically become less expensive. The programme overall is supposed to deliver more than 2,000 jets and there is the chance for the Pentagon to ask for even more. Twitter threats to shift procurement to a rival fighter produced by Boeing are hollow. Weapons systems are complex, as are the legal contracts that frame their procurement.And for all the volatility occasioned by social media activity, Lockheed shares are up nearly a quarter in the last year. Other defence heavyweights such as Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics have made similar moves.To pay for the ramp up, Mr Trump says he favours spending cuts elsewhere while ringfencing social security and Medicare. Guns and butter, however, usually go together. To separate them, either in fiscal expansion or contraction, usually begets its own kind of political war.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
50;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-02-03T19:33:32Z;Lockheed and Pentagon reach $8.2bn deal for 90 F-35;;Lockheed Martin and the US Department of Defense announced on Friday that they have reached an agreement on a $8.2bn contract for 90 F-35 fighter jets.The deal for the tenth batch of the fighter aircraft comes after president Donald Trump publicly chastised Lockheed over the cost of the programme.“The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” Mr Trump said on Twitter in December. “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.”In statement, Lockheed said Friday’s deal represents $728m in savings and a nearly 8 per cent reduction in price over its last contract.President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price. The agreement was reached in a matter of weeks and represents significant savings over previous contracts. This is a good deal for the American taxpayer, our country, our company and our suppliers.Analysts said the deal – which would bring the price per jet below $95m for the first time, compared to $102m in the previous batch, is in line with their expectations.Lockheed had previously said the cost of the F-35 jet will come down over time as they build up better economies of scale and production efficiency.

51;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2017-01-24T18:36:44Z;Lockheed warns on accounting at Sikorsky unit;Possible problems at helicopter maker accompany fall in profit outlook;"Lockheed Martin warned of possible “material weakness” in internal controls of financial reporting at Sikorsky, the military helicopter maker it acquired from United Technologies for $9bn in 2015.In reference to accounting at Sikorsky, chief financial officer Bruce Tanner said there was a reasonable possibility that a “material misstatement could have occurred and would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis”. However, he noted the company had not discovered any material errors in the earnings released on Tuesday.Lockheed said the issue would be disclosed in the annual 10-K report it will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission next month.The warning accompanied a weaker than expected profit outlook for the year that sent shares in the Maryland-based company 2 per cent lower to $251.87. Lockheed forecast fiscal 2017 profits in the range of $12.25 to $12.55 a share, shy of Wall Street’s expectations for $12.90.However, some analysts thought the concerns may be overdone. “Lockheed Martin reports a weakness in internal controls related to Sikorsky accounting,” Jim Corridore at CFRA Research, said. “However, Sikorsky is only 10 per cent of the business; we think the positives outweigh this.”Lockheed reported upbeat results in the fourth quarter with profits climbing to $988m or $3.35 a share in the three months ended in December, compared with $933m or $3.01 a share in the year-ago period. Sales increased by more than 19 per cent from a year ago to $13.8bn. Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.93 a share, on sales of $13bn.Sales in aeronautics, the company’s largest division, climbed 23 per cent to $5.4bn from the year ago quarter aided by higher net sales of its F-35 fighter jets that had come under attack from President Donald Trump over their high costs. But chief executive Marillyn Hewson said on the earnings call that the company had had a “very good dialogue” with Mr Trump.While sales and deliveries of the F-35 jets in the fourth quarter rose from a year ago, the company delivered just 46 of the jets in 2016, lower than its initial estimates of 53."

Sales increased by more than 19 per cent from a year ago to $13.8bn. Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.93 a share, on sales of $13bn.Sales in aeronautics, the company’s largest division, climbed 23 per cent to $5.4bn from the year ago quarter due to higher net sales of about $640m of its F-35 jets. That came as the company delivered 16 of the jets in the fourth quarter, up from 14 in the prior year quarter. However, the company delivered 46 of the jets last year, lower than its initial estimates of 53.President Trump, who has been critical of US defence contractors, leaned on Lockheed over the cost of its F-35 jet, tweeting that he had asked rival Boeing to price its F-18 Super Hornet as an alternative. Lockheed has since promised to create new jobs in the US and reassured Mr Trump that it will significantly lower the cost of the F-35 jet.However, shares in Lockheed slid 1.3 per cent to $253.44 in pre-market trading as it forecast fiscal 2017 profits in the range of $12.25 to $12.55 a share, shy of Wall Street’s expectations for $12.90.Lockheed also said that it expects to report material weakness in internal control over financial reporting at Sikorsky, the military helicopter maker it acquired from United Technologies in 2015, in its 10-K filing.Lockheed’s shares advanced 15 per cent in 2016 and are up 3 per cent so far this year.

For all the bluster, a Trump administration could turn out to be good for the industry.On Wednesday, Boeing and Lockheed Martin sent their chief executives to placate Mr Trump, who has attacked both companies publicly this month. He started by claiming that a project involving Boeing to develop a new version of Air Force One was too expensive. Then he complained on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 — the Pentagon’s next-generation stealth jet being developed by Lockheed Martin — were “out of control”.Then on Thursday, he set one against one the other, turning up the heat under Lockheed by tweeting that he had asked Boeing to price its F-18 Super Hornet combat aircraft as an alternative to the F-35. Boeing tweeted back “ready to work with @realDonaldTrump’s administration to affordably meet US military requirements”.The politics for the White House of taking on defence companies — which often have a broad constituency of support across the country — can be complicated. But if he decides to make an issue of waste, Mr Trump will have some important allies, including John McCain, the Republican who chairs the Senate armed services committee. Mr McCain is likely to oppose some aspects of Mr Trump’s foreign policy, most notably over Russia. However earlier this year he said the F-35 project has “has been both a scandal and a tragedy with respect to cost, schedule and performance”.But many defence industry analysts and insiders are sceptical that the new administration can cut costs as much as Mr Trump has promised. Its Democratic predecessor has already squeezed hard to eliminate waste.“There is nothing wrong in asking hard questions,” says Howard Rubel, defence industry analyst at Jefferies. But the new administration “needs to understand the nuances of the budget, to learn how it all works, like with the presidential aircraft, you learn there is a lot of work to do before you know whether it’s too expensive or not”.Loren Thompson, a consultant who has worked with Lockheed Martin and other defence contractors, argues that unnecessary regulation drives up costs. In the case of the F-35, almost 8,000 test flights are needed before approval. “Every single major weapons system developed by the Pentagon is enmeshed in a framework of regulation that drives up the cost by as much as 20 per cent,” he said.Mr Trump could focus his attention on other targets, too. “Realistically, any big programme is at risk because almost any big defence programme is over-cost or was underperforming at some point,” Jason Gursky, aerospace and defence analyst at Citigroup Investment Research, wrote in a recent note. Mr Gursky highlights risks to the share prices of General Dynamics or Lockheed if the Littoral Combat Ship programme, the subject of debate about cancellation, is targeted by a tweet. Northrop Grumman could sustain tweet damage too, he theorises, though “there is no evidence that any of NOC’s programmes are underperforming”.But Richard Aboulafia, aircraft industry analyst at Teal Group, doubts there is much political traction in going after lower-profile targets than F-35 or Air Force One. “F-35 is the biggest defence contract in history, Air Force One, but beyond that you lose the attention of the political base, which just wants red meat,” he said. “Go after that Blackhawk maintenance contract? Snore. You are serving them broccoli.” Several analysts believe a sustained Twitter campaign could have diminishing impact on stocks: “Paradoxically the more Trump tweets about weapons programmes, the less impact it will have. One tweet out of the blue is a shock, one tweet every week for a month and people start to lose their sensitivity,” says Mr Thompson.Mr Aboulafia points out that, for all the talk of slashing waste, Mr Trump also promises a big increase in overall defence spending, the central pillar of making America great again in the world. “The Trump administration promises great things for defence,” he said. “The only downside: having to suffer through the occasional Trump tweet, aimed at pandering to the base and convincing them that he’s not just going to throw tens of billions of dollars at defence contractors (which he will).”
55;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-12-23T00:14:42Z;Trump puts pressure on Lockheed Martin over cost of F-35;President-elect says he has consulted Boeing to price F-18 Super Hornet as alternative;Donald Trump turned up the heat under Lockheed Martin about the cost of its F-35 fighter jet, tweeting on Thursday that he had asked rival defence contractor Boeing to price its F-18 Super Hornet as an alternative. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday evening. It is the latest salvo in an ongoing war of words between the president-elect and US defence contractors, whom he has criticised for waste and excessive cost. The implicit threat to cancel Lockheed Martin’s F-35 contract and replace it with a cheaper contract with Boeing, came on the heels of a meeting on Wednesday between Mr Trump and chief executives of the two companies at his Florida resort. Dennis Muilenburg, the Boeing chief executive, emerged from that meeting with fulsome praise for Mr Trump, who had earlier set off a Twitter firestorm by criticising Boeing’s price for Air Force One as excessive. After the meeting, Mr Muilenburg promised the president-elect that he would build that plane for less than the $4bn price tag that Mr Trump has often ascribed to it — although no contract has yet been signed for the plane, which is still in the research and development phase, so no price has in fact yet been agreed. On Wednesday, Mr Muilenburg said he had had a “terrific conversation” with Mr Trump but it was not clear whether they had discussed substituting the F-18, an older generation fighter jet, for the F-35. Lockheed had no comment and Boeing said only: “We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability and affordability across all Boeing products and services to meet our national security needs.” The latest missive from Mr Trump sent Boeing shares up 0.7 per cent in after-hours trading, while Lockheed Martin shares were down 2 per cent. You could get any Cold War plane cheaper than a cutting edge 21st century plane but you are not going to like the results when you go to war“It sounds like Trump is really trying to put pressure on Lockheed Martin to cut costs. But most of the cost of the F-35 is beyond Lockheed Martin’s ability to affect because it relates to supplier costs and government regulation, and the second problem is that the F-35 was designed to be far more capable than that F-18 — and that does cost money,” said Loren Thompson, a defence industry analyst who consults for Lockheed and other contractors. “You could get any Cold War plane cheaper than a cutting edge 21st century plane, but you are not going to like the results when you go to war.” On Wednesday, the president-elect met chief executive Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed, after tweeting last week that “the F-35 program and cost is out of control”. Asked whether he had secured any concessions from Ms Hewson, Mr Trump told reporters: “We’re just beginning, it’s a dance . . . but we’re going to get the costs down and we’re going to get it done beautifully.” The latest tweet may be just part of that dance, defence analysts said.
56;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-12-22T22:45:49Z;Trump says he’s asked Boeing to price out rival to Lockheed F-35;;US President-elect Donald Trump is doing a little comparison shopping ahead of the holidays, according to his latest post on Twitter.“Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday evening.The latest missive from Mr Trump sent Boeing shares up a modest 0.7 per cent in after-hours trading, while Lockheed Martin shares went down 1.7 per cent.The latest announcement comes on the heels of a meeting between Mr Trump and Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg to discuss the president-elect’s sharp criticisms of the cost of the US company’s Air Force One contract and other big defence programmes. Mr Muilenburg described it as a “terrific conversation”.Mr Trump previously tweeted criticism about the costs of Lockheed’s $400bn F-35 fighter jet programme.Canada’s government recently inked a deal to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornets as it prepares to overhaul its aging fleet, and the country’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had campaigned on a promise to jettison plans to buy F-35 jets.Both Boeing and Lockheed said they had no comment on Mr Trump’s tweet, but the former said said in an emailed statement:We have committed to working with the president elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability and affordability across all Boeing products and services to meet our national security needs.
57;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-12-21T23:57:59Z;Boeing chief praises Trump after meeting over Air Force One costs;Defence executives discuss projects with president-elect after cost criticism;"Boeing’s chief executive lavished praise on Donald Trump on Wednesday after a meeting to discuss the president-elect’s sharp criticisms of the cost of the US group’s Air Force One contract and other big defence programmes.“It was a terrific conversation. Got a lot of respect for him. He’s a good man. And he’s doing the right thing,” Dennis Muilenburg said after the meeting, which was prompted when Mr Trump sent an angry tweet earlier this month threatening to cancel the Air Force One contract.Speaking at the president-elect’s Mar a Lago resort in Florida, Mr Muilenburg promised that his company would build the new Air Force One for less than $4bn, a figure Mr Trump cited which has been challenged by the White House.No order has yet been placed for the next generation of the presidential 747, and the research and development deal under which Boeing and the US Air Force are devising its requirements is valued at $170m.Since the election, Mr Trump has repeatedly tried to get his political goals met — from saving US jobs to cutting waste in US defence spending — by reaching out personally to the chairmen or chief executives of the companies concerned. He recently claimed victories at stopping Ford and United Technologies from moving jobs to Mexico, after he personally intervened with their leaders.Mr Muilenburg called the meeting “very productive” and said he was “very encouraged by the dialogue”. Of the $4bn cost estimate, he said: “We’re going to get it done for less than that . . . I was able to give the president-elect my personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” Mr Trump later told reporters that he thought progress had been made, adding: “I think we’re looking to cut a tremendous amount of money off the programme”.Mr Muilenburg had already spoken to the president-elect immediately after his tweet and told him that the cost of Air Force One was largely determined by government requirements for security, communications and other specifications. After Wednesday’s meeting, Mr Muilenburg said: “We’re all focused on the same thing here; we’re going to make sure that we give our warfighters the best capability in the world and that we do it in a way that is affordable for our taxpayers.”The plan is to replace two ageing aircraft that currently serve as Air Force One with two of a new-generation modified 747 plane.The president-elect also met another US defence contractor that has felt the sharp side of his Twitter feed recently, Lockheed Martin’s chief executive Marillyn Hewson.Mr Trump tweeted last week that “the F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after” his inauguration.Asked whether he had secured any concessions from Ms Hewson, Mr Trump told reporters: “We’re just beginning, it’s a dance . . . but we’re going to get the costs down and we’re going to get it done beautifully.” He also held a meeting with senior military leaders and praised them as “good negotiators”. The Pentagon this week pushed back against his criticism of the F-35, saying it has “basically been on schedule” and “on budget” since 2011.In a statement, Ms Hewson described the meeting as “productive”, saying: “I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 programme and the progress we’ve made in bringing the costs down. The F-35 is a critical programme to our national security, and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our US military and our allies.”"
58;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Trump takes aim at Lockheed Martin over F-35 costs;US defence group’s shares hit after president-elect tweets programme ‘out of control’;Lockheed Martin has become the latest US company to come under fire from president-elect Donald Trump on Twitter after he branded its F-35 fighter jet programme “out of control”.Shares in the Maryland-based defence contractor fell nearly 4 per cent in early trading on Monday after Mr Trump’s intervention. The $400bn F-35 programme is running late and has been beset by problems not least due to its highly ambitious aim to deliver three variants of the same aircraft for operations from land bases and aircraft carrier.“The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” Mr Trump said on Twitter. “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.”The Pentagon has brought increasing pressure to bear in recent years on Lockheed to bring the costs back under control.Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 programme leader, said on Monday: “We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the programme. It’s an amazing programme. Lockheed Martin and its industry partners understand the importance of affordability for the F-35 programme.”Mr Trump’s latest attack comes less than a week after he took aim at Boeing over the contract to replace the fleet of presidential aircraft known as Air Force One. However, unlike the attack on Boeing, Mr Trump did not suggest the F-35 contract should be cancelled if costs could not be brought down.The F-35, with its advanced avionics and stealth characteristics, will form the mainstay of US air power well into the second half of the century. It is beginning to enter service, with limited capabilities, with the US air force and Marines, and will enter service with the US navy later this decade.Another 11 US allies, including Australia, Israel, Italy, Japan and the UK, are also taking delivery of the aircraft.Mr Trump’s wider point about finding “billions” in savings is in line with his campaign promise to cut federal government waste.The comments hit other defence contractors with General Dynamics and Raytheon down almost 4 per cent. Northrop Grumman, which is a key partner with Lockheed on the F-35, saw its shares drop 5.6 per cent, and the UK-based BAE Systems, the other main F-35 partner, saw its shares fall just over 1 per cent.
59;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th,” Mr Trump tweeted.The comments come just a week after Mr Trump took aim at Boeing and issued a call to cancel the company’s Air Force One contract over what he claimed were “out of control” costs.Lockheed suppliers also saw their share prices hit.
61;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-11-09T08:21:22Z;US chief executives write open letter to Trump seeking reassurances;Businesses express concern about threats to trade, but see opportunities in tax cuts;"Chief executives from more than 1,100 US companies, including Boeing, Coca-Cola and Caterpillar, have written an open letter to Donald Trump, warning of “an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions” after the election.The letter comes as business executives on both sides of the Atlantic have expressed concern about uncertainty and threats to trade in the wake of Mr Trump’s victoryBut some US corporate chieftans see opportunities in possible tax cuts and deregulation.In the chief executives’ letter, prepared for whichever candidate won the presidential election, they say they are committed to reuniting the country “after this particularly difficult election, and warn that businesses and communities cannot prosper “in a country that is divided and distrustful”.Other signatories to the letter, organised by the National Association of Manufacturers, include the chief executives of Pfizer, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly and Cargill.In Europe, Emma Marcegaglia urged Mr Trump to reach out. “We hope to see signals of reconciliation and reassurance rapidly. The United States are and will remain the most important partner of the European Union in shaping a fair and rule-based globalisation to the benefit of all.“The 45th President of the US is an entrepreneur. We hope that his decisions will be driven by political and economic reason,” she added.US businesses and industry groups were generally not supporters of Mr Trump. Only 17 per cent of trade associations thought his presidency would be best for their members, compared with 39 per cent favouring Hillary Clinton, a recent survey by the Financial Times found.Not one chief executive of the 100 largest companies in the US had given money to Mr Trump’s campaign by August, according to the Wall Street Journal.Companies including United Technologies and Ford were attacked by Mr Trump during the campaign for relocating production out of the US to Mexico and other countries with lower labour costs, and every business with an international supply chain or market is nervous about potential disruption from new trade barriers.But businesses are also looking for opportunities to work with his administration to achieve their policy goals, including measures to stimulate economic growth.Jay Timmons, president of the NAM, said: “When you have an economy that’s not working as it should, with people being displaced out of jobs, frustrated with their economic progress and with their families’ standing, then you’re going to have this kind of negative response and reaction . . . But the solution is what the business community offers.”One clear gain for businesses in Mr Trump’s programme is his proposed cut in federal business taxes to 15 per cent, from the current 35 per cent.The big US banks are likely to see Mr Trump’s victory as a positive. He has sent mixed signals on financial regulation, but said he wants a policy that is “close to dismantling” Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform act. That law imposed a host of tough rules on the banks and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has held them to higher regulatory standards.Some analysts suggest that Mr Trump’s rhetoric may run ahead of reality.“Trump has said he’s going to tear up Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act; I don’t think he can do either,” said John Stadtler, head of the financial services practice at PwC in New York.“I don’t think he’ll be able to undo the CFPB either, but he will certainly drive change.”Still, Mr Trump has also suggested he wants tighter regulation of banks through a “21st century Glass-Steagall”: the 1933 law that kept commercial banks out of investment banking and insurance, which was repealed in 1999.The most positive news for the banks is the senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have been critical of the big banks, will be shut out of policymaking.Privately, many top bankers said they resented the way Ms Warren’s wing of the Democratic party appeared to have taken control of financial policy. In particular, they said they worried that potential candidates to serve as Treasury secretary — including Larry Fink, the chairman of BlackRock — seemed to have been blacklisted by Ms Warren, because of their experience on Wall Street.However, if a Trump presidency means that a December interest rate rise is less likely — and financial markets suggested it was, late on Tuesday — then banks will not be pleased. A steeper yield curve normally means higher income for banks, which earn big chunks of their profits from the difference between short-term and long-term rates.Trump has said he’s going to tear up Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act; I don’t think he can do eitherFor retailers and consumer goods companies tax reductions could help, but Mr Trump’s immigration and trade policies could have a bigger and more damaging impact, analysts said.Neil Saunders, an analyst at Conlumino, said: “Mr Trump’s policies could be quite far-reaching for retail, especially in terms of the labour market becoming more restricted [if immigration is curbed] and products becoming more expensive if import taxes are introduced. The latter is a major issue given how interconnected supply chains are.”Mr Trump has already singled out Mondelez International, which makes Oreos, for shifting some of its production to Mexico.However, Mr Saunders added that Congress could temper Mr Trump’s more radical proposals.Another industry that could benefit from Mr Trump’s presidency is oil and gas. He has proposed opening up new areas for oil and gas development, including federal lands and waters that are presently closed to exploration, and promised to “rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions”.Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry group, said there was “not a lot” of detail about Mr Trump’s plans, but his pledges could mean he would stem and reverse the “tsunami” of new federal regulations on oil and gas put forward by the Obama administration.Mr Gerard added that Mr Trump’s support for new pipeline projects could help unlock investment that had been held up by objections raised by the Obama administration.Some companies in other sectors may have less of a free hand. Mr Trump’s victory could be bad news for AT&T’s proposed $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner.The combination of America’s largest telecoms group by market value with the owner of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros was announced last month. The deal faces a year of regulatory scrutiny.But in a speech last month Mr Trump said he would block the transaction. “AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” he said."

Sales climbed 15 per cent to $11.6bn, just shy of estimates of $11.8bn.Lockheed also adjusted its full-year forecast to account for the sale of its slower-growth Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos, which completed in August.Adjusting for the sale of its IT business, the company now sees full-year earnings of $12.10 a share, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $11.66.The company retroactively updated its July outlook to between $11.15 and $11.45 a share, after adjusting for the sale. Its initial July projections were for earnings in the range of $12.15 to $12.45 a share.Meanwhile, shares in United Technologies clocked the second-largest gains on the S&P 500 industrials sector, rising 1.85 per cent to $101.36, after the maker of aerospace and building systems reported better than expected results in the third quarter and lifted the lower end of its full-year earnings outlook by 10 cents.The Connecticut-based company now expects to earn between $6.55 and $6.60 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates for $6.57.The rosier outlook accompanied an increase in profits to $1.45bn, or $1.74 a share, in the three months ended in September, compared with $1.36bn, or $1.61 a share, in the same period last year. Sales climbed 4 per cent to $14.4bn.United Technologies has been working on reviving growth at its Otis unit, which accounts for nearly 21 per cent of the company’s sales.Overall sales at Otis fell 1 per cent but new equipment orders rose 8 per cent excluding China, where its margins have remained under pressure.With about 400 elevator manufacturers in China, the Otis division saw prices fall between 7 and 9 per cent from a year ago as pricing pressure ratcheted up, said Akhil Johri, chief financial officer at United Technologies.However, he added that not all players in the market have the “wherewithal to sustain price pressure” and that United Technologies could be a “consolidator in the industry” as the company takes a long-term view on the region.Elsewhere, Nielsen Holdings, another industrial company, was the biggest decliner on the benchmark index with shares falling 16.89 per cent to $45.65.Caterpillar shares were down 1.76 per cent to $84.48 after it cut its guidance for the third time this year.3M lowered its forecast, sending shares in the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape down 2.94 per cent to $166.23.The mixed batch of results saw the S&P 500 industrials sector, which is up 6.2 per cent so far this year, down 0.4 per cent on Tuesday.By the close, the S&P 500 slid 0.38 per cent to 2,143.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.30 per cent to 18,169.27 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.50 per cent to 5,283.40.Twitter: @mamtabadkar

However, the company retroactively updated its July outlook adjusting for the IT sale, to be between $11.15 to $11.45 a share.Lockheed also said it now expects sales of $46.5bn, compared to its previous projections between $50bn to $51.5bn. It revised its July outlook adjusting for its IT divestiture to between $45bn to $46.2bn in today’s release.The company also said it expects net sales to rise seven per cent year-on-year in 2017 assuming the US government continues to support its key programmes.Lockheed shares, which have risen nearly 7 per cent so far this year, climbed one per cent in early trading.
64;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Poland agrees to buy Patriot missile system;;Poland has agreed to buy eight Patriot air missile defence systems from Raytheon, which beat off competition from Lockheed and Thales to seal the multi-billion dollar deal.Poland had already selected Raytheon last year but the country’s new government had ordered a review into the selection before officially agreeing to a deal, which was previously pegged at $5.6bn, writes Henry Foy.The tender, worth around one-sixth of Poland’s total defence modernisation spend over the next decade, is seen as critical for the global defence industry as companies roll out their next generation of missile defence systems.Warsaw has officially ordered the Patriot system, defence minister Antoni Macierewicz said on Tuesday without providing the total value of the deal.The first two Patriot batteries, which are designed to shoot down aircraft and missiles and are seen by Warsaw as integral to defence against Russia, will be delivered by 2019. Six more have been ordered.Washington had lobbied heavily for Poland to choose the Raytheon system. Neighbouring Germany is negotiating to buy the rival MEADS system developed by Lockheed and European defence companies
65;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed boosted by rising defense spending;;Raging conflicts across the world are proving to be lucrative business for US defense contractors, with Lockheed Martin the latest to benefit from this trend.Shares in the US aerospace and military-contractor were set to hit a new record high on Tuesday after the company delivered expectation smashing second quarter results and raised its earnings guidance for the year.The stock, which hit a fresh intraday high of $258.29 yesterday, is up another 1.8 per cent at $260.99 in pre-market trading.For the quarter to end of June, Lockheed, the world’s number one weapon supplier, reported $12.91bn in net sales, fueled by increased sales of its F-35 fighter jet and the acquisition of helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft.That’s a 11 per cent jump from the prior year period and ahead of market expectations of $12.58bn.Net income came in at $1.02bn, up nearly 10 per cent from the second quarter of last year and easily ahead of forecast of $895.5m.The strong results have prompted Lockheed to raise its full year profit guidance for the second time this year. It now expects to earn $12.15–$12.45 per share, up from its previous forecast of $11.50-$11.80, as governments across the globe ramp up defense spending in response to conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere.Shares in Lockheed have jumped by more than 27 per cent over the past year.
66;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-07-14T13:35:31Z;Missiles will be quicker to make as 3D printing blasts off;Future rockets may be created in the field;It is late on a Friday night at Raytheon’s design site in Tucson, Arizona, and the lights are still on. Engineers at the world’s biggest missile maker are in the lab experimenting with the defence company’s newest manufacturing tool — the 3D printer.The machines, bought on the commercial market and adapted by Raytheon researchers, are “oversubscribed”, says Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon Missile Systems. Design engineers are so keen to experiment with new ways of making missiles that the printers “are fully occupied on weekends and Friday nights”.In March, the US Navy tested a Lockheed Martin-manufactured Trident II D5 missile with a 3D printed component. Next year MBDA, the European missile maker, will use a printed part in its Sea Ceptor missile system.In a few years, 3D printers could be used on the front line to repair or replace missile parts, speeding up availability and eliminating supply risks, according to Mr Lawrence. Researchers are working on ways to print the electrical circuits used in guidance systems and microwave components for radar.“It will be a while before we print a whole missile, but we definitely see that on the horizon,” he says.Lockheed Martin says the component which flew on the D5 missile — a cover to protect cable connectors — was designed and manufactured in half the normal time.At Raytheon, Mr Lawrence agrees: “We can produce fundamentally new capability more quickly, which ultimately means lower cost.”Performance of weapons is of paramount importance. We have to be confident that the technology [can be used] without any riskJeff Morgans, head of operations at MBDA, estimates that 3D printing could cut the production time of missile components by as much as three quarters. Currently, it takes more than a year from the day the first component is received, he says, or longer including the design process. The company, jointly owned by BAE Systems, Airbus and Leonardo-Finmeccanica, last year doubled its investment in 3D printing.It will still be decades before forces begin printing their missiles in the field, Mr Morgans says: “Performance of weapons is of paramount importance. We have to be confident that the technology [can be used] without any risk.”Meanwhile, however, the resurgence in global tensions, from Asia to the Middle East and up to the borders of Europe, is fuelling demand for more missile systems. So too is the arrival of a new generation of fighter jets and warships, such as the F-35 stealth aircraft and Britain’s type 45 destroyer.Strategic Defence Intelligence, a consultancy, forecasts that the global market for missiles and missile defence systems will increase by nearly halfto $36bn between 2015 and 2025. Some 200,000 missiles will be manufactured in the next five years, according to the consultancy Forecast International.Along with rising demand, governments want longer range, greater power and precision, and more functions on a missile than ever before — without significantly higher prices. Missiles will have to be more intelligent, possibly even conducting surveillance.Additive layer manufacturing, as 3D printing is known, could make enhancements more feasible — for example reducing weight to make room for other systems or to deliver greater range.With 3D printing certain components can be hollow, which is difficult with traditional manufacturing methods that simply cut away material.The ability to print metals and combine alloys in different ways opens up new design possibilities. “Engineers can come up with brilliant ideas,” says Mr Lawrence, but “the production guys say there’s no way. The introduction of 3D printing is allowing us to do that.”

68;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-05-24T05:00:10Z;Lockheed seeks commercial innovation from Sikorsky;The oil price slide has hit the defence company’s plan to diversify into the civilian sector;The regular buzz of helicopters landing and taking off is one of the distinctive sounds of the airport on the outskirts of Aberdeen, the UK’s most important oil city. With 36,487 take-offs and landings by rotary-wing aircraft during 2015, the windswept facility is the world’s busiest heliport, handling hundreds of thousands of passenger journeys annually to and from North Sea oil platforms.But, for Dana Fiatarone, head of commercial systems and services at Sikorsky, one of the world’s biggest helicopter makers, that level of traffic is a concern. While Aberdeen’s heliport remains busy, 2015 movements were 8 per cent down on the previous year, thanks to a slide that has taken the price of a barrel of North Sea crude down from a peak of $112 in June 2014 to a low of just above $26 in February this year.The declining traffic poses acute questions about whether Lockheed Martin, which bought Sikorsky for $9bn late last year from United Technologies, will achieve one of its aims in the purchase — to diversify away from military business. While Sikorsky — maker of the US military’s Black Hawk helicopter — is the world’s biggest supplier of military helicopters by sales, Mr Fiatarone points out Sikorsky is Lockheed’s first sizeable acquisition of a company with substantial civilian business.Demand for Sikorsky’s two main civilian models — the S-76D, which can lift up to 5,386kg and the S-92, which can lift 12,018kg — has traditionally depended heavily on offshore oil and gas customers.“The oil and gas downturn is probably steeper than anyone really anticipated,” Mr Fiatarone says.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst for the Virginia-based Teal Group, says that United Technologies chose an “impossibly good time” to sell the business. “Lockheed Martin didn’t really choose an optimal time to buy,” he adds.Nevertheless, Mr Fiatarone insists that Sikorsky can be competitive in the commercial market, particularly if it pushes ahead on the introduction of new, innovative models. “We have a technology and innovation group inside Sikorsky that thinks about things like clean sheet designs,” Mr Fiatarone says.The existing products undoubtedly face tough conditions, however.The heavy-lift S-92 won a competition to provide the new Marine One helicopters, as the aircraft that carry the US president are known. The aircraft is also in use as a search-and-rescue helicopter for the UK and Irish coastguards, while a variant is being developed to offer search-and-rescue services around the coast of Canada.The aircraft still remains best suited to undertaking heavy lifts of people and equipment to and from oil platforms. Sikorsky has 263 orders for the aircraft over the next 10 years, according to Teal Group.The prospects of the medium-sized S-76D, however, looks more uncertain.AgustaWestland’s competing AW139 model has 684 orders over the next decade, according to Teal, while Sikorsky has only 154 for the S-76, despite the introduction of a revamped D variant of the aircraft in 2013.“That product has been around since the 1970s,” Mr Aboulafia says of the S-76. “The D appears to be getting a lukewarm reception after a whole bunch of teething problems and development delays.”Mr Fiatarone concedes that the process of gaining “acceptance in the marketplace” for the S-76D has been “a little slower” than he would have liked. But he adds: “As customers get to know the aircraft, they seem to like it.”One solution to the problems might be to develop new models to fill the sizeable gap in capabilities between the S-76 and the S-92. AgustaWestland’s AW189, Airbus’s EC175 and the 525 from Textron’s Bell Helicopter all fit into the so-called “super-medium” gap between Sikorsky’s two models.Mr Fiatarone concedes it is “at least interesting” that three separate competitors all concluded there was space for a helicopter in that category, even if it might not make “perfect sense” to enter the segment at this point. “It’s certainly something we’ll take a look at,” he says.There may also be scope for bringing to the civilian side of the business the revolutionary technology that Sikorsky has been developing with an eye to US military business. The company’s S-97 Raider helicopter is able to fly twice as fast as conventional helicopters — up to 276mph — because it has two main rotor blades spinning in opposite directions. This overcomes the problem facing traditional rotor designs — that, beyond a certain speed, each rotor catches up with the vacuum created by its predecessor and runs out of air to push.Mr Fiatarone says there are “possibilities” for the application of such superfast helicopter technology on a commercial front. “One is getting out to oil rigs that are 300 miles or more offshore — ultra-deep oil wells,” he says. “Another is emergency medical services and search-and-rescue.”Yet the central problem facing Sikorsky’s commercial business remains the depressed activity level at Aberdeen and other oil and gas-focused heliports. Mr Fiatarone expresses some hope that revival in the sector might be closer than it appears.Nevertheless, he accepts that there is a considerable period of pain to come, particularly since many “capital assets” — including helicopters — are currently lying idle.“As the oil price recovers, you’ll first see those idle assets being put back to use,” Mr Fiatarone says.“But it may be 18 months after that before you start to see significant increases in orders placed.”
69;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-05-12T17:53:05Z;Big US companies spearhead renewable energy drive;Groups ranging from Google to GM are striking deals with renewable energy generators;When General Motors buys electricity for the Texas plant that makes hundreds of its Chevrolet and Cadillac trucks each day, it normally does a deal with a local power utility lasting at most a couple of years.But five months ago the US carmaker did something very different, signing a 14-year agreement with a wind farm company, EDP Renewables North America, for enough electricity to make more than half the trucks it produces each year.The deal makes GM one of a fast-growing number of big US companies buying green power to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, and potentially make savings on their energy bills. In doing so, these groups are reshaping the way renewable energy is purchased, and helping green power generators build more projects than they otherwise might have done.However, some businesses still find it difficult to do deals to invest in renewable energy, and an initiative backed by 60 companies including Facebook and Microsoft was launched on Thursday to make it easier.Silicon Valley technology companies led by Google were the first in the US to plough into green energy in a significant way, but now the trend has spread to some of the country’s biggest manufacturers and retailers, including GM, Lockheed Martin, Amazon and Walmart.In total, 24 large US companies bought 3.6 gigawatts of power in 2015 and the first quarter of this year — more than three times the amount purchased by seven groups in 2014, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US non-profit organisation trying to accelerate these renewable energy agreements.“The growth was spectacular and took everybody by surprise, nobody expected that,” says Hervé Touati, a Rocky Mountain Institute managing director.The long-term power-purchasing agreements that big companies are signing with wind and solar farms are important for renewable-energy generators trying to build new projects.By guaranteeing future revenues, the purchasing deals help bolster the generators’ efforts to persuade lenders or investors to finance projects that might otherwise fail to get off the drawing board.Until now, wind and solar farm developers have typically sold most of their electricity to big state or privately owned utilities that in turn sell it on to their customers.But this is now changing. Along with universities and cities, big companies are making so many long-term power-purchasing deals with renewable-energy generators that in 2015 they for the first time outstripped utilities doing such agreements in the US.According to the American Wind Energy Association, the new class of buyers accounted for 52 per cent of wind generating capacity sold via power-purchasing agreements last year, up from 23 per cent in 2014 and 5 per cent in 2013.Companies that strike long-term purchasing deals with wind and solar farms do not typically use the power coming directly from these generators. This electricity is normally fed into the grid that supplies power to households and businesses, including those companies that have agreements with the renewable generators.For GM, two reasons were behind the Texas windpower deal, which followed a similar one in Mexico last year. It helped the company meet a public commitment to boost renewable-energy use, but it also offered considerable savings, according to Rob Threlkeld, global manager for renewable energy at GM.“The nice thing about wind, solar and renewables in general is they don’t have a [fossil] fuel component,” he says.That meant GM was able to fix a set price for its electricity, knowing it would not be affected by any future rises in the price of a fuel such as gas.“For the windpower purchasing agreements we’re looking at about $2m a year [in] savings, averaged over the term of the contract,” says Mr Threlkeld.Lockheed says its decision in February to sign a 17-year agreement to buy solar power from Duke Energy Renewables in the US was partly driven by a commitment to lower greenhouse gases. But the company saw a financial benefit from falling renewable-energy prices, says Scott Stallard, senior manager of environmental stewardship at Lockheed.“Historically, renewables generally weren’t that economically feasible but we saw that prices were coming down both on the wind and the solar side,” he adds.Whether companies will continue to do such deals at current rates is unclear.Numbers jumped in 2015 as lawmakers weighed whether or not to extend important US federal government tax credits for wind and solar investors.The tax credits were renewed in December but will be gradually phased down, putting pressure on renewable energy generators to keep lowering their power production costs.The Rocky Mountain Institute is hopeful this will happen.“The cost of electricity production dropped, respectively, by 61 per cent for wind and 82 per cent for solar over the past six years, and further improvements are in the works,” says Mr Touati.In addition, he adds, natural-gas prices in the US that have been at historic lows could rebound, making corporate wind and solar power purchasing agreements even more attractive in many markets.The official opening of a wind farm in the Scottish Highlands would not normally attract much attention.Scotland already has enough wind power to supply 97 per cent of its homes.But the Moy wind park that Dutch renewable-energy company Eneco opened this week south of Inverness is different because much of its electricity will be bought by Mars, the family-owned US food group.Mars has signed a 10-year agreement with Eneco to buy enough power to supply its 12 UK sites.Mars signed a similar long-term deal in 2014 with a subsidiary of Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation for power from a huge wind farm in west Texas equal to the amount of electricity consumed by its 70 sites in the US.Companies including BT, the British telecoms group, have done a number of long-term power-purchasing agreements with renewable energy generators in the UK.But few involve one wind farm as big as the 20-turbine Moy park. It is the first transaction of its kind Mars has done outside the US but not the last, says Barry Parkin, the company’s chief sustainability officer.“We sensed a number of years ago that we were reaching the point where renewable energy can be cost-effective versus fossil fuels,” he adds.The two windpower agreements Mars has done are part of a push to make its global operations carbon neutral by 2040.They should mean Mars’s electricity costs no more than it would if it were bought from conventional power utilities, says Mr Parkin.
70;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-04-26T14:59:17Z;Lockheed lifts profit outlook despite first-quarter dip;Results held back by $99m charge for workforce cuts;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, has unexpectedly lifted its full-year profit forecast — even though its first-quarter net income fell 6 per cent due to staff reduction costs.The company on Tuesday raised its projections for full-year earnings per share from a range of $11.45-$11.75 in January to $11.50-$11.80. Net earnings for the first quarter, however, fell to $794m — or $2.58 per share — from $878m in the first quarter of 2015.Lockheed’s results covered its first full quarter as owner of Sikorsky, and the helicopter maker — which it bought for $9bn from United Technologies last year — boosted turnover at the group’s Mission Systems and Training business by 51 per cent, to $3bn. Operating profit at the division rose 27 per cent to $229m.Overall, the additional Sikorsky’s sales helped push total group revenue up 16 per cent, to $11.7bn.But the headline results were held back by a $99m charge for workforce reductions in Information Systems and Global Solutions (IS&GS) and the core Aeronautics division, which together reduced net income by $64m.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the company had achieved “strong operational and financial results” in the quarter and taken actions to strengthen its competitive and strategic position in the market further.Shares in the group rose 1.7 per cent in early trading in New York, at $230.16.Lockheed’s fortunes remain closely tied to the fate of the F-35 joint-strike fighter, history’s biggest-ever military procurement project, for which it is the primary contractor.In the first quarter, higher sales of F-35s helped to increase turnover in the aeronautics division by 21 per cent to $3.8bn, and operating profits by 13 per cent to $420m.In Space Systems, meanwhile, sales declined 4 per cent to $2.13bn and operating profits fell 25 per cent to $244m — mainly as a result of declining US government satellite orders and lower earnings from the United Launch Alliance joint venture with Boeing.Like other big US military companies, Lockheed is seeking to manage a fall-off in some areas of US military spending following the wind-down of the US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has sought to build its international sales, and focus more closely on manufacturing via the Sikorsky purchase.In January, the company announced it intended to sell the IS&GS business— which has suffered badly in the downturn — to Leidos in a cash-and-shares transaction for $5bn. First-quarter sales in IS&GS fell 4 per cent to $1.33bn, and its operating profit fell 25 per cent to $109m.Rob Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that the results marked a “solid start to the year” from Lockheed Martin.
71;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-04-26T12:22:52Z;Lockheed lifts 2016 profit forecast;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, on Tuesday increased its forecasts for full-year profits, even though first-quarter net income fell 5.8 per cent thanks to one-off charges, including a workforce reduction.The change to the forecast lifted the company’s projections for full-year earnings per share from a range of $11.45 to $11.75 in January, to $11.50 to $11.80. Net earnings for the first quarter, however, fell to $794m or $2.58 per share, from $878m or $2.74 a share in the first quarter of 2015, writes Robert Wright in New York.The results marked the first full quarter for Lockheed as owners of Sikorsky, the helicopter maker previously owned by United Technologies. Sikorsky’s sales boosted turnover at the Mission Systems and Training business by 51 per cent to $3bn. The division’s operating profits rose 27 per cent to $229m but were held back by a $60m loss from Sikorsky as a result of the acquisition last quarter.The headline results were held back by a $99m charge for workforce reductions in Information Systems and Global Solutions and the core aeronautics division, which together reduced net income by $64m.However, the aeronautics division – which builds the F-35 joint-strike fighter, history’s biggest-ever military procurement project – enjoyed a 13 per cent increase in operating profits – to $420m – on sales up 21 per cent to $3.8bn. The division benefitted primarily from a $400m boost in sales for the F-35 as the programme continues to ramp up.
72;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-04-17T15:30:45Z;US Air Force commander warns on space launch ‘bubble’;Rush of new operators into commercial space launches;The US Air Force’s most senior space commander, General John Hyten, has voiced concerns about the rush of new operators in commercial space launches, warning there could be a “bubble” in the sector.Gen Hyten also expressed veiled concerns about the long-term future of United Launch Alliance, which has handled all the US’s spy satellite launches since 2006. ULA is widely expected to lose much of that “national security” business to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, whose operating costs are far lower. SpaceX won approval to launch spy satellites last May.The general, head of the US Air Force’s space command, was speaking at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, which was dominated by discussion of the space launch market. A series of start-up companies — including Blue Origin, the space-launch company founded by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder — described their efforts to make access to space cheaper by introducing new, sometimes reusable launch vehicles.There was also substantial discussion about ULA’s prospects for delivering its planned Vulcan rocket system, which is meant to end the company’s reliance on Russian rocket engines.The general pointed out there had been a similar surge of enthusiasm for new commercial launch services in the 1990s, encouraged by the potential of launching large numbers of satellites for telecommunications and internet services. But two of the biggest satellite operators — Iridium and Globalstar — were forced into bankruptcy and a third — Teledesic — suspended its service. Launch providers that had over-invested to cater to the market suffered.“My concern is: is there a similar bubble that’s going to hit on the commercial side now?” Gen Hyten said.In the military launch market, meanwhile, Gen Hyten said it was vital the military worked with rocket builders during the “bridge period” until roughly 2020, when United Launch Alliance will have completed work on its new Vulcan rocket, which will no longer rely on the Russian-built RD-180 engine.It was vital, the general said, that during the bridge period ULA be allowed to use the RD-180, which Congress briefly banned it from doing. The US military is committed to maintaining two separate systems for launching satellites. ULA’s Atlas family of rockets — powered by the RD-180 — and its more expensive Delta rockets currently provide the two options, although SpaceX should have a full competing family of rockets by the end of this decade.“I don’t like giving the Russians one dollar,” Gen Hyten said. “But we have to have assured access to space and be smart about how we use the taxpayer dollar.”He expressed concern, however, about how ULA would cope after 2020, when SpaceX is expected to undercut it in many bidding competitions.Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, told the Financial Times last week that the company would replace any spy satellite launches it lost to SpaceX with commercial work and work for Nasa, the US space agency.But Gen Hyten said it was unclear what ULA’s business plan would be.“It’s all based on the assumptions that you make about what you think the world is going to be after 2020,” he said.Gen Hyten acknowledged, nevertheless, that, for the moment, the options for the US military’s space launch looked better than for many years. Boeing and Lockheed Martin formed ULA as a joint venture in 2006 because, they argued, the shrinking number of US national security launches had made it impossible to maintain two separate, rival operations.The general pointed out that, alongside SpaceX and ULA, there was the prospect that Blue Origin would build an orbital vehicle capable of launching satellites.“Look at all the options that are out there on the table right now that, if we just encourage industry and continue to support industry, are likely to be available as we go into the next decade,” Gen Hyten said. “What we need to do is just encourage this industry to continue to blossom.”
73;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-04-12T19:31:10Z;Aerojet in space race with Bezos to win US rocket contract;Decision on engine provider for US national security space launches due this year;Aerojet Rocketdyne, the company that built the space shuttle’s main engines, on Tuesday stepped up its campaign to supplant Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin as provider of power for the next generation of US rocket systems.Julie Van Kleeck, Aerojet’s head of advanced space and launch, told reporters in Colorado Springs that the company’s new AR1 engine would allow the US to maintain “assured access to space” with the least disruption and for the least money.Aerojet’s push comes as United Launch Alliance, the company that until recently had a monopoly on US national security space launches, prepares to choose an engine for its new rocket systems. ULA — a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin — has been forced to develop a new system because its current main rocket, the Atlas V, depends on the Russian-built RD-180 engine. Russia has threatened to stop supplying for US national security launches.ULA named Blue Origin’s BE-4 engine its first choice for the new Vulcan rocket when it unveiled the design a year ago at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. The award was a huge fillip for the company, one of the new breed of space start-ups led by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.However, ULA also said it was working in parallel with Aerojet, a far longer-established fixture in the US space industry, on the AR1, to give it a back-up option.In February, Aerojet announced what it called a “public-private partnership” with the US Air Force under which $804m — two-thirds of it provided by the air force — would be invested in further development of the AR1.Ms Van Kleeck said the Air Force’s award underlined confidence in her company’s approach. Blue Origin — a private company funded by Mr Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has not needed to seek outside funding.“The AR1 allows our country to maintain assured access to space with least disruption,” Ms Van Kleeck said. “The AR1 is the most logical solution to this problem. It is the lowest risk and cost solution to the taxpayer and solves the problem on the shortest schedule.”ULA is due to decide between the two providers this year.The AR1 is the most logical solution to this problem. It is the lowest risk and cost solution to the taxpayer and solves the problem on the shortest scheduleAerojet’s pitch directly takes on Blue Origin’s biggest single advantage — that it started development work on its engine earlier. Aerojet said the AR1 would be ready to fly on Atlas V in 2020 and on Vulcan by 2021, only just behind the 2019 finish date that Blue Origin is targeting.However, ULA insisted that Blue Origin retained the lead.“Blue Origin remains 16 months ahead of Aerojet Rocketdyne in delivering a flight engine to ULA,” the rocket builder said.Much of Aerojet’s argument focuses on the fact that the AR1 will use kerosene, the same fuel that powers the RD-180, which it said would make it possible to fit to the existing Atlas V rocket. Blue Origin is developing a methane-powered engine, which requires a different vehicle design and fuelling technology.However, ULA said: “Selecting either the BE-4 or the AR-1 requires modifications to the booster.”Blue Origin said its engine would receive certification next year, two years ahead of Aerojet’s target date.“Blue Origin’s BE-4 is the only engine that can fly by 2019, meeting the congressionally mandated deadline to eliminate dependence on Russian-built engines,” Blue Origin said.

The “updated” contract sets out terms until 2025 and Serco said it will provide the MoD with greater flexibility to vary the terms, including pricing. There will be regular price reviews, with the first due to take place in 2019.Following the latest negotiations there will also be changes to the structure of the AWE Management joint venture company, which is contracted to manage the development, maintenance and manufacture of warheads for the UK’s nuclear deterrent. Lockheed Martin will become the majority shareholder in the JV and Serco and Jacobs have agreed to adjust their holdings from 33.3 per cent previously to 24.5 per cent.Mr Soames said:I am delighted that the UK Government has chosen to secure the operation and management of the Atomic Weapons Establishment through AWE ML, and that Serco will continue to play a central role in supporting a vital component of our national security and scientific expertise.
75;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-03-29T23:02:53Z;Branson’s balloonist signs airship deal;Buying Lockheed Martin craft for $480m is bet on future of cargo;"For decades airships have served little commercial purpose beyond that of a floating billboard, but a band of former Virgin Group executives is about to bet $480m that the modern descendants of the ill-fated Hindenburg will enjoy a bigger future: in energy-efficient air cargo.Mike Kendrick, who for 16 years ran Sir Richard Branson’s Airship and Balloon Company before the entrepreneur sold it on, has just signed a letter of intent to buy 12 new airships from Lockheed Martin’s Hybrid Enterprises.Today, as chief executive of the UK-based Straightline Aviation, Mr Kendrick believes the company — which he formed with two former Virgin Group colleagues — will be the first to own and operate floating freighters.“It is an aviation milestone,” he says, confidently predicting that the airship will “dramatically change the way cargo is moved around the world”.Airships’ attraction to businesses is their ability to transport heavy goods and equipment to remote locations, Mr Kendrick argues. Oil and mining groups operating in places where there are no roads or airstrips are seen as potential customers.Manufacturers say the latest airships can set down on any terrain — land, sea or ice — and use only one-third of the fuel of a conventional aircraft, allowing them to fly for weeks without refuelling.Straightline, which is backed by a group of private investors and debt financing, plans to take delivery of its first $40m cargo airship from Lockheed Martin next year, Mr Kendrick says.But the US defence group is not the only manufacturer bringing a new airship to the commercial aviation market. In a few weeks, Britain’s Hybrid Air Vehicles plans to fly its Airlander model for the first time in the UK.Lockheed’s Hybrid Enterprises and HAV have chosen to commercialise their aircraft in different ways, for different markets.Steve McGlennan, chief executive of HAV, claims the overall market for new airships could be worth as much as $50bn, given the safety and endurance advances made since the airships disasters of the 1930s.“They are not easy to pop,” he says. Unlike the Hindenburg, which burst into flames in 1937, they are filled with helium instead of inflammable hydrogen. In addition, the pressure varies so little between the inside of the frame and the outside that a modern airship can fly for days, if not weeks, with a hole in its structure — even a bullet hole. This is a key safety feature when flying over Texas, where locals have a habit of taking potshots at airships, according to Mr McGlennan and Mr Kendrick.Lockheed designed its airship for the cargo market, developing a hovercraft landing system that allows it to stick to the ground as cargo is driven straight into its holding bay.HAV, by contrast, designed its Airlander as a surveillance vehicle for the US Army — until the $300m programme fell victim to budget cuts in 2013.Both markets now face great cost pressures: the oil and mining industries have been hit by a collapse in commodity prices; and tight military budgets.But both manufacturers see cost pressures as a sales opportunity. “All the mining, oil and gas industries are looking at how to do things differently,” says Rob Binns, chief executive of Hybrid Enterprises, Lockheed’s marketing arm for the airships. “They invest a lot of capital before they begin [a project]. They can spend seven years fighting to build a road just to hear they cannot do it. The cost of an airship pales in comparison to their [existing] infrastructure costs.”HAV’s Mr McGlennan says his airship can be used to cut military transport costs. At $3,000 an hour to operate, he says, an airship is far cheaper and can fly farther than a heavy-load military helicopter, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars an hour to keep in the air.However, not all aerospace experts share the airship makers’ optimism. Some question the $50bn valuation put in the potential market. “We estimate the international air freight market to be worth $100bn a year,” says Robert Dahl, managing director of Seattle-based Air Cargo Management Group, aviation consultants. He sees a small role for airships in ferrying cargo to remote locations but says this would never be mainstream. “This is a niche,” he warns.Others note that the airships currently in development are on the small side for cargo transport. Lockheed’s 20 tonne aircraft falls far short of the 50 tonne “sweet spot” identified by Renaissance Strategic Advisers, the aerospace and defence consultancy. HAV’s Airlander, which is still focusing on military roles, has a carrying capacity of only 10 tonnes.Critics also question their slow speed and vulnerability: a top speed of 100 miles an hour is a potential drawback if airships are to be used for disaster relief.Nevertheless, Richard Aboulafia, partner at the Teal aerospace consultancy, refuses to write off new attempts to bring airships back. “If you have something that is faster than sea travel and it doesn’t have the cost of air freight then somewhere in that box there is a market,” he argues.But how many airships will be crossing the skies 10 years from now is open to debate, given the boom in aviation capacity. “There is a lot of romance in the idea of an airship and we would all like to live in that steampunk world,” he says. “But the idea has been here a long time and the technology has not changed that much. A lot of people have come and gone.”"
76;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-03-23T22:42:49Z;Chinese businessman pleads guilty to cyber spying;Su Bin admitted to targeting sensitive military aircraft data from Boeing, Lockheed and others;A Chinese businessman pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges of conspiring to steal sensitive military aircraft data from computers belonging to Boeing and other defence contractors, in the latest reminder of what the US has called a massive Chinese cyber espionage campaign.Su Bin, 50, admitted to collaborating with two unindicted Chinese co-conspirators over a near six-year period that ended shortly before his 2014 arrest. Among the aircraft they targeted were Boeing’s C-17 military transport aircraft and Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and F-22 fighter jets.“This plea sends a strong message that stealing from the United States and our companies has a significant cost,” said John Carlin, assistant attorney-general for national security. “We can and will find these criminals and bring them to justice.”Mr Su’s plea agreement, filed in the US District Court for the Central district of California, comes amid intensifying US efforts to curb what officials describe as rampant Chinese cyber-spying. In May 2014, a grand jury indicted five officers of China’s People’s Liberation Army on charges of hacking into networks belonging to companies including US Steel, Alcoa and Westinghouse Electric, to gather proprietary technical and negotiating data.In September, US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to refrain from cyber espionage for commercial purposes. Last month, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told Congress that “China continues to have success in cyber espionage against the US Government, our allies, and US companies”. But the spy chief said it was not yet clear whether the most recent efforts were backed by the Chinese government.Mr Su, a Chinese citizen, was arrested in Canada in July 2014. After waiving extradition, he was returned to the US in February. Also known as “Stephen Su” and “Steven Subin,” the businessman directed a pair of Chinese associates who obtained access to defence contractors’ computer networks. On at least one occasion, Mr Su sent his partners lists of US and European defence executives in an email with the subject line “Target.”Beginning around October 2008, the two unnamed allies began hacking into the corporate computers, according to the plea agreement. It added that once they had gained access, they emailed lists of files and folders to Mr Su asking which were important enough to steal. Mr Su responded with requested file names highlighted in yellow and the hackers would obtain the material and email it to him.Along with stealing information on how to produce C-17 components, Mr Su also made off with a presentation on aircraft training and a flight test plan. All of the information was prohibited from export outside the US.“Our adversaries’ capabilities are constantly evolving, and we will remain vigilant in combating the cyber threat,” said Jim Trainor, assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division, which investigated the case along with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.Mr Su is due to be sentenced on July 13. He faces a maximum five-year sentence and a fine of $250,000 or twice his financial gain from the spying, whichever is greater.

The company’s “scramjet-powered” SR-72 could come into service by the 2030s and has the potential to transform military and civilian aviation.The aircraft’s sleek design and seemingly impossible speeds would not seem out of place in an Arthur C Clarke novel or, at a cruder level, an episode of Thunderbirds. When we say that an innovation is “like something out of science fiction”, the implication is that SF is a fund of ideas whose time has not yet arrived. All it takes is for modern technology to catch up with the yearnings of SF creators past and present, and soon the world will be bejewelled with glorious devices which their books (and TV shows and movies) have somehow helped to spawn.The rather more prosaic truth is that SF authors like me, much in the manner of psychic mediums, take a scattershot approach to our predictions about the future. Put simply, there are so many of us writing so many books about so many imaginary tomorrows that by the law of averages alone, we are almost all, at some point, going to score a bullseye.Jules Verne, in From the Earth to the Moon (1865), foresaw lunar modules launched from Florida and returning as splashdown capsules, a principle Nasa used in its Apollo missions; while his Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870) anticipated modern electric submarines with its depiction of Captain Nemo’s vessel, the Nautilus.HG Wells, who alongside Verne must be considered SF’s other great Victorian forefather, was a mine of successful — if not always happy — prognostications. When the Sleeper Wakes (1899) envisions automatic motion-sensing doors; the short story “The Land Ironclads” (1903) advances the idea of the battlefield tank a good decade before such things saw use in the first world war, and The World Set Free (1914) warns of the horrors of nuclear weapons.The most famous novels by Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both prophesy futures which are now uncomfortably like our present day. In Brave New World (1932), mood-enhancing drugs and mindless entertainment keep the masses sedated. Nineteen Eighty-Four (1948) posits widespread, intrusive government surveillance. For evidence that the latter situation has come to pass, look no further than the FBI’s current campaign to force Apple to defeat its own iOS security protocols to make it easier for government to harvest data.There are so many of us writing so many books about so many imaginary tomorrows that by the law of averages alone, we are almost all, at some point, going to score a bullseyeRay Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 (1953) has likewise steered closer to fact than fiction in the more than half-century since it was first published. The novel is a marvel of technological farsightedness. As Bradbury expert Sam Weller writes in Listen to the Echoes, his 2010 collection of interviews with the author, it predicts “everything from flat-panel televisions to iPod earbuds and 24-hour banking machines”.The word ‘robot’ was coined in 1920 for a play in which humanity is wiped out by machines. As the robot age approaches, how concerned should we be? Continue readingJohn Brunner’s multi-faceted dystopia Stand on Zanzibar (1968) is arguably the most accurately visionary SF novel of all time. Among its many eerily prescient ideas are satellite TV, on-demand TV, laser printers, electric cars, the EU, and the collapse into decay of Detroit. William Gibson’s far better-known Neuromancer (1984) is credited with crystallising the notion of the internet, or cyber space, as a searchable repository for all possible information, a second virtual world existing alongside reality.The list of “hits” is long. The list of “misses” is far, far longer. Where are the flying cars, lunar bases, lightsabers, faster-than-light spaceships, androids, teleportation, and all the high-tech paraphernalia that science fiction makes us feel we should have by now?Perhaps one should look on them not as unfulfilled promises but as a bucket list, an inventory of to-do tasks for the human race over the decades to come.The writer is an author and the FT’s science fiction reviewer"
78;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-03-15T21:41:24Z;Lockheed hails progress on hypersonic military aircraft;US defence manufacturer claims aircraft will be able to fly up to six times the speed of sound;Lockheed Martin revealed on Tuesday it is on the brink of a technological breakthrough that could lead to the US developing military aircraft that can fly six times the speed of sound.Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed’s chief executive, outlined the proposed hypersonic aircraft as she also disclosed the company was working on a laser weapon that could be used on the battlefield.At the company’s annual media day, Ms Hewson expressed optimism about future US military budgets following years of cutbacks.She said that lawmakers seemed set to pass an increase in the budget for 2016-17.However, her most eye-catching remarks were about innovation. She said a series of technological advances were on the verge of making possible weapons systems that had been mooted for years but never come to fruition.A hypersonic aircraft would give US military planners a significant advantage in reaching targets before opponents had time to react.However, military engineers have struggled for decades with so-called scramjet engine technology to power such an aircraft.Fuel burns in a stream of air moving at supersonic speeds inside the engine, but there have been far reaching questions about the technology’s efficiency and stability.“We’re proving a hypersonic aircraft can be produced at an affordable price,” said Ms Hewson.Referring to Lockheed’s F22, the most sophisticated US fighter jet, Ms Hewson said: “We estimate it [the hypersonic aircraft] will cost less than $1bn to develop, build, and fly a demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22.”The aircraft would be capable of speeds up to six times the speed of sound, or Mach 6.Orlando Carvalho, head of Lockheed’s aeronautics division, said the company had been working on an engine involving scramjet technology for the hypersonic aircraft with Aerojet Rocketdyne, the rocket manufacturer.He added that given Aerojet Rocketdyne’s engine work and Lockheed’s efforts on materials for the aircraft, innovation was “much more rapid” at present than in the past.“That said, it’s going to require a significant amount of development work, investment and maturing of the technology,” said Mr Carvalho.Lockheed envisages working on the hypersonic project throughout the 2020s, with aircraft potentially entering service in the 2030s.A hypersonic aircraft can be produced at an affordable priceRichard Aboulafia, analyst at the Teal Group, said the idea of having hypersonic jets available was “extremely attractive” for military planners.But it was unclear the fundamental problems around scramjet technology had been resolved. Ms Hewson insisted the proposed hypersonic aircraft had produced a “controllable, low-drag, aerodynamic configuration capable of stable operation from take-off… to Mach 6”.Meanwhile, she showed a slide of an experiment involving a laser weapon, where a hole had been burnt in the bonnet of a pick-up truck, disabling its engine. The truck was similar to those used by insurgent groups.Ms Hewson said the challenge with the technology was both to increase the power of the laser and reduce its weight. She also said Lockheed was working on a missile capable of Mach 20.News of the innovation comes as Lockheed reshapes itself. Last year, the company agreed to buy Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer.
79;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Nasa fuels dream for supersonic airliner;$20m grant for Lockheed Martin to design plans for first ‘X-plane’;Nasa on Monday sought to breathe new life into the aerospace dream that refuses to die when it handed Lockheed Martin $20m to develop plans for the first supersonic commercial jet since Concorde’s retirement.The experimental aircraft is one of a series called “X-planes” that Nasa plans to develop.The research is concentrated on ensuring that the new aircraft’s supersonic boom — the noise generated when an aircraft crosses the sound barrier — is less intense than on previous high-speed aircraft. The intensity of Concorde’s sonic boom led to its being banned from flying faster than sound above the US, which substantially limited its potential destinations.Charles Bolden, Nasa’s administrator, pointed out at an event on Monday at Reagan National Airport near Washington that Chuck Yeager, the first pilot to cross the sound barrier, did so nearly 70 years ago in an aircraft funded by Nasa’s predecessor.“Now we’re continuing that supersonic X-plane legacy with this preliminary design award for a quieter supersonic jet with an aim towards passenger flight,” Mr Bolden said.Rob Weiss, general manager of Lockheed’s Skunk Works — which works on experimental projects — said the company had been working with Nasa for more than a decade on the technology needed for a new generation of commercial supersonic aircraft.British Airways and Air France retired Concorde in 2003 after nearly 30 years because of prohibitive operating costs. The aircraft flew at a maximum of twice the speed of sound, making a London to New York journey in about three and a half hours.Lockheed, like other manufacturers seeking to develop aircraft with less violent sonic booms, is working on aircraft structures that would spread out the shock generated when an aircraft catches up with the sound waves it has generated. Most such designs involve a long, needle-shaped structure on the aircraft’s nose.However, it may not yet be time for London residents to start booking meetings in New York for four hours after take-off from the UK. Richard Aboulafia, an analyst for Virginia-based Teal Group, pointed out that it was Concorde’s astronomical operating costs, rather than its sonic boom, that made it a consistent lossmaker.The aerodynamics of supersonic flight mean that an aircraft consumes far more fuel and that its body has to be very narrow, restricting passenger numbers.That means that supersonic flights can operate only on routes that can support aircraft full of passengers paying first-class fares, said Mr Aboulafia. “There are very few routes that can support an all first-class jetliner.”The idea of pursuing supersonic commercial flight was one “best relegated to the 1960s”, he said. However, he conceded that there might one day be a supersonic business jet, since that sector was less sensitive to operating costs.The X-plane aircraft are intended to be about half the size of production aircraft. Flight tests are due to start in 2020, depending on Nasa’s budget.
80;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-02-26T20:02:38Z;Boeing gives up on $80bn US stealth bomber;;Northrop Grumman is now certain to be the builder of the US’s new, $80bn stealth bomber after its only rivals for the work said they were giving up further appeals over the award.A consortium of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on February 16 lost an appeal to the US’s Government Audit Office but had been expected to continue action against the decision in court. The Pentagon announced last October that it was giving the work to Northrop Grumman, US industry correspondent Robert Wright reports.The consortium said they remained “firmly convinced” of the validity of the issues they had raised in the protest but had decided “not to pursue further challenges”. “This decision was taken, as always, with the best interests of our customer and the warfighter in mind,” the consortium said.The news clears the way for Northrop Grumman to continue with work on the top-secret aircraft, intended to be able to penetrate the sophisticated, long-range air defences of potential adversaries such as China.The work keeps Northrop in the top ranks of US military contractors and one of only two companies – alongside Lockheed Martin and Boeing – capable of the final assembly of a modern military aircraft.The decision raises questions, however, about whether Boeing will maintain that status. While the company continues to assemble existing fighter designs such as the EA-18G Growler, many of its future orders are likely to be for adapted versions of its commercial jets, such as the US military’s KC-46 tanker, adapted from the 767 airliner, rather than pure military aircraft.Northrop’s shares were down 0.2 per cent at $192.50, while Boeing’s rose 1.5 per cent to $118.55.
81;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-02-22T16:20:54Z;BAE Systems suffers cyber attacks twice a week;UK defence group accuses foreign governments as it seeks to grow security business;Foreign governments are suspected of launching cyber attacks on BAE Systems roughly twice a week, according to the UK defence company, which on Monday warned that internet crime was becoming increasingly sophisticated and professional.Kevin Taylor, managing director of BAE’s Applied Intelligence division, said the world’s third largest defence group by sales was fending off more than 100 “potential state attacks” a year on average.While BAE’s role as a key supplier of defence and security equipment to the US and UK governments make it an obvious target for agents of certain states, the group said there was evidence that hostile governments were also focusing on companies in other nationally critical sectors such as utilities and communications.BAE’s comments come as it accelerates a push into cyber security, using techniques deployed in its defence business to create products and services for private sector companies. Ian King, BAE’s chief executive, has ambitions to grow the Applied Intelligence division — which in 2015 recorded sales of £500m, up 18 per cent on an underlying basis compared to 2014 — into a business generating annual revenue of £1bn after about five years.Last year saw a number of high profile attacks by hackers accessing data held by big companies, from TalkTalk, the UK telecoms company, to Anthem, the US health insurer. Kaspersky, the well-known Moscow-based cyber security company, reported last February that it had uncovered a ring of cyber criminals attempting to steal $1bn from up to 100 banks and other financial institutions around the world.BAE’s research shows that cyber criminals are beginning to specialise and even become more professional, offering skills and services, such as money-back guarantees and “project management”, to other criminal organisations. Other types of criminal identified by BAE include the so-called “mule”, a casual criminal used to launder the proceeds of cyber crime, or the “getaway” — an adolescent keen to impress peers and who acts safe in the knowledge that he or she is too young to be jailed.Companies are waking up to this threat as more of their business is done via the internet. A study by McKinsey and the World Economic Forum found that annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise from $69bn in 2013 to $123bn a year by 2020.Defence companies such as BAE and Lockheed Martin and Raytheon of the US are targeting this increased spending to drive faster growth and to reduce their heavy reliance on government customers in the defence sector.However, not everyone is convinced that the skills are easily transferable. “They often have difficulty understanding private sector requirements and dynamics,” said analysts from Forrester Research in a recent report.“The term military grade is often used to portray a higher tier of product and service when sadly this isn’t often the case. The F-35 joint strike fighter [made by a consortium led by Lockheed] is one of the most expensive weapons systems in the world. It is also endlessly plagued with problems.”
82;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2016-02-08T04:56:29Z;French bid to make Australia submarines fades on US security fears;Pitch to build fleet loses ground amid US concerns over weapons ‘technology leakage’;Paris’s bid to build a $35bn submarine fleet for Australia has lost significant ground over fears the French state shipbuilder will not be able to protect highly sensitive US military secrets.The US military is concerned that submarine maker DCNS may be more prone to technology “leakage” than contractors in competing bids, according to several people close to the situation.“France is in Nato, the politics are delicate and it is true that US weapons have been integrated on to French vessels before,” said one person involved in Pentagon procurement issues. “But with technology this advanced there is real discomfort within the US military about putting it on a French boat.”The strength of US influence on Australia raises the likelihood that Japan’s 4,000-tonne diesel-electric Soryu vessel could emerge triumphant from a three-way tender process it is contesting fiercely with France and Germany. The Japanese bid is the first of its kind and follows a historic policy change in 2014 that lifted a longstanding ban on Japan exporting arms.However, Sean Costello, chief executive of DCNS Australia, dismissed the suggestion the French offer would be affected by security concerns. “DCNS is France’s sovereign provider of naval technology and has proven systems and procedures in place that protect the sensitive information already provided by Australia,” he said.Although all three bids have strengths and weaknesses, the offer from Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems is also thought to be lagging slightly behind the Japanese offer on technical grounds. The German proposal involves doubling the size of its Type 214 Class vessel, while the Japanese would be selling a model that already exists at the desired size and is in active service.The concerns over the French bid, according to people closely involved in the tender process, centre on the US-built weapon and sensor technology that will lie at the heart of the new submarines.Australia is preparing to choose between two weapons systems that will form the backbone of the submarine fleet. Only after that decision is made — probably by early April — can the submarine contractor be selected.Whichever weapons system is chosen — one is being offered by Lockheed Martin, the other by Raytheon — the technology will be American.Chuck Jones, chief executive of Lockheed Martin in Asia, played down the idea that a US combat system would limit Australia’s choices and said that a prerequisite of his company’s ability to bid on the weapons tender was that Lockheed would be prepared to work with any of the three submarine makers.But diplomats say that, on the sidelines of the tender process, Washington has made it increasingly clear over the course of the past six months that it favours the Japanese bid. A Japan-Australia partnership on a high profile military project, say military analysts, would underpin US plans to create a counterbalance to China’s rise in the Pacific.The bidding process has highlighted Japan’s inexperience in the global arms market, after a failure to submit a detailed budget plan for the project or identify a project leader to take overall responsibility, according to people close to the situation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has twice intervened to tell the bid team to sharpen up its efforts, according to political insiders in Tokyo.Meanwhile, the bid has exposed the fact that its largest contractors, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, have evolved their defence businesses around a single customer — the Japanese Ministry of Defence. Australia has, over the past two months, been laying increasing pressure on Japan to tighten the commercial terms of the bid, lay out a detailed budget and make it clear which company is leading the project.

Earnings per share rose 6.7 per cent to $3.01.The sale of the IS&GS business follows a strategic review announced by Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, last July. That came as the company revealed it had reached an agreement to purchase the Sikorsky helicopter business from United Technologies for $9bn.Lockheed launched the IS&GS review partly to reduce overall debt in the wake of the Sikorsky purchase.The company planned to undertake the transaction through a tax-efficient vehicle known as a Reverse Morris Trust, it said. It would use the $1.8bn cash proceeds to pay down debt, pay dividends or buy back shares.Military contractors’ IT and services businesses have fared particularly badly amid the slowdown in US government military spending. The big contractors’ flagship programmes — including Lockheed’s F-35 joint strike fighter — have largely been protected.Ms Hewson said the sale was an “important milestone” in the company’s “portfolio reshaping” strategy. She added: “The combination of our proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a new leader in the government IT sector with a diversified portfolio, greater scale and improved efficiency.”Roger Krone, Leidos’s chief executive, said the combined company would have the scale and access to markets that would enable it to grow further. “The new company will be better able to offer cost-effective solutions to our customers,” he said.Shares in Lockheed, the world’s biggest military contractor, fell 0.5 per cent to $209.93 by close of markets in New York.

Lockheed Martin, one of the companies behind the F-22 fighter jet, jumped 3.5 per cent to $220.68, while Raytheon, which develops the Tomahawk cruise missile, rose 4.1 per cent to $122.11.On the other side of the spectrum, some travel-related stocks were under pressure on the day.Delta Air Lines fell 2.2 per cent to $47.93, American Airlines dropped 1.4 per cent to $42.83 and United Continental slipped 1.2 per cent to $58.08.In the travel-booking space, Priceline stumbled 2.4 per cent to $1,266.87 and Expedia fell 2.1 per cent to $122.53.France led the world with 83.7m international tourist arrivals last year, according to data from the UN World Tourism Organization. The country ranked fourth in the world by international tourism receipts, which totalled $55bn over the same period.Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a research report there could also be “an adverse impact on tourism in some European countries where people think attacks are most likely to occur — not just in France”.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, noted that, historically, the “US stock market has rebounded rather quickly from geopolitical events that have occurred outside America, including acts of terrorism”.Elsewhere, shares of Hyatt Hotels were in the green after Marriott revealed plans to buy Starwood Hotels in a deal worth about $12.2bn. Hyatt had been in advanced discussions over a potential tie-up with Starwood. Hyatt’s shares advanced 3.4 per cent to $51.22.Urban Outfitters, a clothes retailer, said it had bought the Vetri Family Group, a chain of Italian restaurants, including Pizzeria Vetri. Urban Outfitters shares sold off by 7.4 per cent to $22.67, extending the year-to-date loss to 35.5 per cent.The S&P 500 energy sector climbed 3 per cent after sliding 6 per cent last week. The rise came as the benchmark US oil contract advanced 3.2 per cent to $42.04 a barrel amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty sparked by the terror attacks in France and continued threats from Isis.Among the leaders in the sector was Noble Energy, an oil and gas exploration company, which rose 5.1 per cent to $37.

86;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-11-16T17:08:29Z;Helicopters: need for speed overtaken by harsh economic lessons;Helicopter manufacturers have been dogged by events out of their control in a turbulent market;Helicopter manufacturers should be used to ups and downs. But they have had a number of events to contend with recently that have been completely outside their control.The previously high price of oil, making more remote fields economical to explore, bolstered sales — along with the growing wind energy industry, which also requires helicopters for inspection and maintenance.The plunge in the oil price, however, put a damper on more adventurous exploration plans — including some of the very ones that most required helicopter assistance.Crispin Maunder, executive chairman of Lease Corporation International, whose LCI Helicopters specialises in leasing aircraft to operators, says the market overall has fallen. “At the medium and heavy end it has had a significant impact,” he says.However, he says manufacturers are nimbler than commercial plane makers at “cutting back production to mirror what they see as forward demand”.The manufacturers are pressing ahead with a number of projects that have a common theme of increased efficiency and usability. They have also been testing the edges of the speed envelope — to push speed limits on conventional rotorcraft that are slower than for fixed-wing aircraft.Airbus Helicopters came up with one of the more elegant — and evolutionary — systems with the experimental X3 when the company was still called Eurocopter.That aircraft did away with the power-sapping anti-torque rotor at the end of the tail boom and instead used two forward-facing propellers on the ends of stubby wings, not only to do the same job of preventing the body of the helicopter rotating in the opposite direction to the main rotor but also to pull the whole aircraft forward through the air.This resulted in a record top speed of 255 knots (293mph) — somewhat above the theoretical top speed of a normal helicopter of about 225kt.Some of the lessons learned in the X3, now retired and on display at the Musée de l’Air et de l’Espace at Paris-Le Bourget, are promised for future Airbus models. In the meantime, the 12-passenger H160 uses a fenestron tail-rotor tilted from the vertical, claiming various benefits including sapping less power. The H160, scheduled for certification in 2018, has achieved 176kt and has as its target cruise speed a rapid — for helicopters — 160kt.The design of another model, the X6 heavy helicopter, will be finalised over the next two years and is intended to enter service in the 2020s.There has been some rationalisation of the range, though. Airbus Helicopters is dropping the AS355 light twin.The X3 is a much simpler solution to speed than the only combination rotorcraft currently in production — the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey military tilt-rotor.Its complicated and rather cumbersome solution is engines and large propellers on the end of wings. The engines point up for vertical operations and tilt forward for cruise — yielding a speed of about 275kt.The civil version of the tilt-rotor, the nine-passenger AW609 being developed solely by AgustaWestland after Bell all but stepped out of the project, remaining only as a contractor, had weathered a number of delays but was on track for certification in 2017.However, at the end of October, a prototype crashed near the factory in Italy, killing the test pilots. An accident investigation will determine whether there is likely to be a further delay.The crash is a reminder of the troubled gestation of the V-22, which consumed more time, money and aircraft than planned. But orders for the AW609 continue to be added, even since the crash.Sikorsky is the other helicopter manufacturer exploring high-speed rotorcraft — its self-funded X2, with twin, coaxial main rotors and a pusher propeller at the back, yielded a speed of 260kt. That has been developed into the military S-97 Raider rotorcraft, which had its maiden flight this year. This month the sale of Sikorsky by United Technologies Corporation to the Lockheed Martin aerospace company was confirmed — and Lockheed’s mainly defence focus is unlikely to mean there will be a push for a civil version.Away from the speed race, Bell Helicopter is pushing efficiency as the key attribute of its 525 Relentless, which has ticked up more than 50 orders and is set for certification in 2017.Bell, part of Textron, is also fighting back in the very light sector. “The R66 from Robinson became the market leader in the under-$1m market,” says Dominic Perry, news editor at Flight International, part of information provider RELX Group. “But Bell has come back with the 505 Jetranger X.” First deliveries are expected by mid-2016.Economy of operation is likely to be the main battleground for manufacturers in the near term. The ability to go faster is always desirable but, in the world of civil rotorcraft, cost-effectiveness is likely to win out, especially in a tight market.
87;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-11-10T05:02:46Z;Aerospace and automotive: high flyers and crash landings;The difference between success and failure is defined by whether products meet customers’ needs;"In a hangar belonging to business jet maker Gulfstream on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia, aircraft in varying states of assembly sit nose to tail, workers bustling around them. By the time the twin-engine G650s reach the front of the hangar they are nearly ready to be flown to their customers. The aircraft, which can fly 7,500 nautical miles non-stop as the extended-range (ER) version, cost up to $66.5m for the ER — and demand is buoyant. The company is due to manufacture 115 of the top-end jets this year, and orders are rolling in faster than Gulfstream’s workers can build them.In Wichita, Kansas, 1,200 miles to the west, the production line for Hawker, a manufacturer of smaller corporate jets, has been silent since shortly after its then parent, Hawker Beechcraft — an amalgam of two companies from the early days of powered flight — entered bankruptcy in 2012. Hawker proved incapable of operating sustainably in the same business conditions that have produced buoyant demand for Gulfstream.The two groups’ contrasting fortunes reflect many of the factors that determine whether companies in aerospace — and another capital-intensive manufacturing sector, the auto industry — survive or perish. Gulfstream has flourished because the G650 has features customers want — particularly its range — and can find on no other aircraft. Hawker Beechcraft failed to differentiate itself in a crowded field and invested heavily in developing aircraft with carbon composite fuselages, which commanded an insufficient premium for the costlier, lighter material.Development projects in the auto industry tend to be on a smaller scale than in aerospace, but similarly critical. It was because they devoted too little capital to product development that the US’s big three carmakers — General Motors, Ford and Chrysler — failed in the past decade to compete effectively with overseas rivals’ products in the US. On the other hand, many analysts attribute the failure of Germany’s Volkswagen to compete well in the US market in recent years to its failure to develop products in step with US consumers’ tastes.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a Virginia-based think-tank, explains the risks with reference to Boeing, one of the duopoly that dominates the world market for commercial jets. The company has broken more ground than most rivals, building a pioneering turboprop aircraft, the first modern jetliner and the 747 jumbo jet.Each time Boeing innovated with a new plane, it ended up betting the companyBut Thompson adds: “Each time Boeing innovated with a plane, a new product, it ended up betting the company. If the bet had gone wrong, Boeing would have gone the same way as the Glenn L Martin Company, one of the pioneers of jet aviation.” (Founded in 1912, Martin merged with a building products and chemicals company in 1961.)The risks are so complex, says Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group, an aerospace market research firm, that successful companies generally need a degree of luck. In the US automotive business in recent years, for example, recovering manufacturers have been buoyed by one of the longest, strongest sales recoveries on record.Among the makers of big business jets, Gulfstream had the good fortune to face a competitor that was distracted. For much of the past decade, Canada’s Bombardier — traditionally the market leader, ahead of Gulfstream and France’s Dassault — has been preoccupied by the costly and time-consuming process of trying to break into the narrow-body commercial jet market with its C Series aircraft. The process has delayed development of Bombardier’s Global 7000 and 8000 jets, planned competitors for the G650. The company has “shot itself in the foot with the C Series”, Thompson says.It was Hawker Beechcraft’s misfortune to have been operating in a more competitive field, which included the jet business of industry pioneer Cessna, Bombardier’s mid-size Learjet aircraft and Brazil’s Embraer. It was still more unfortunate that Embraer proved to be “aggressive and extremely good”, says Aboulafia. “It basically took [Hawker’s] market share.” Hawker Beechcraft’s fall from grace was complete in 2014 when was it bought by Textron, Cessna’s parent.Carmakers can mitigate risk by developing common platforms for vehicles with different bodies that can be introduced worldwide. The smaller volumes in aerospace, however, make the calculations different. Boeing, the biggest aerospace company in the US by sales, is still accumulating losses on its groundbreaking 787 carbon-composite long-haul jet, whose development took far longer and cost far more than intended. Rival Airbus has yet to recoup the development costs of its A380 super-jumbo, which has proved less attractive to airlines than expected.When other European aerospace companies were joining forces in the company now called Airbus, Fokker of the Netherlands — once one of the world’s most important aircraft manufacturers — stayed proudly aloof. But that position proved uncomfortable in an increasingly consolidated industry. Fokker tried co-operating with McDonnell Douglas (since taken over by Boeing) with little success. The company sought to develop two new aircraft — the Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 — but faced mounting costs that forced it to seek a government bailout in 1987. Fokker limped on, but when its strategic partner, Germany’s Dasa, cut off funding in 1996, it was almost immediately declared bankrupt and went out of the aircraft manufacturing business. Other parts of the company were bought and lived on, from 2010 as Fokker Technologies — which in October was acquired by GKN Aerospace.Tom Enders, Airbus’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in 2013 that both companies had got “carried away” in the past after trying to introduce new technologies that turned out not to be “as mature as they should be”.Hawker Beechcraft invested heavily in developing carbon-composite fuselages for its Premier I business aircraft and subsequently the Hawker 200. While the Gulfstream G650 features some composites, its fuselage and wings are predominantly traditional aluminium.Aboulafia sums it up: “Hawker Beechcraft said, ‘Composites are the future; people will pay for composites.’ Gulfstream said, ‘We just don’t see that at all; we’re not in the business of developing technology for technology’s sake.’”The calculations involved are similar to those in the auto industry over whether to abandon steel for some vehicle bodies in favour of aluminium. Ford last year took the audacious decision to launch an aluminium-bodied version of its F-150 pick-up truck — the F-Series accounts for the majority of its worldwide operating profits. Other carmakers are following its lead.The differing approaches of Gulfstream and Hawker Beechcraft meant they entered the economic downturn — when demand for Hawker’s midsize jets collapsed — in very different conditions. Hawker’s problems were exacerbated by the reluctance of its owners, a consortium of investment bank Goldman Sachs and Onex, a private equity firm, to provide more capital.There are similar lessons from the fate of Fokker, the Dutch commercial aircraft maker, whose costs for simultaneously developing two new models — the Fokker 100 and Fokker 50 — ran out of control. The company went bankrupt in 1996.Bombardier faces a markedly similar crisis after costs for developing its C Series ballooned from an initially projected $3.4bn to $5.4bn and introduction to service slipped from 2013 to a date currently set for early next year.When car sales collapsed in 2008, Chrysler faced an especially intense crisis because it was owned by Cerberus, a private equity firm with limited appetite to commit more capital. Alone among the big three US carmakers, Ford avoided going into bankruptcy protection largely because in 2006 it had expanded its borrowing capacity to $25bn to prepare for a potential slowdown.Historically, Chrysler’s position as third-largest of the US’s big three carmakers, after General Motors and Ford, has meant it has struggled to achieve scale and market reach. That prompted an ill-fated expansion into Europe in the 1960s. Then, in 1998, it merged with Germany’s Daimler, whose sale of Chrysler in 2007 to Cerberus, a private-equity firm, left the company vulnerable just as the US market neared one of its biggest-ever slumps. Chrysler had to seek bankruptcy protection in 2009 and was bought by Italy’s Fiat in 2011, but the debt-laden group is seeking yet another merger to secure its future.The lesson of these cases is to “have a home with deep pockets”, Aboulafia says — as Gulfstream, owned by General Dynamics, the military contractor, does.“When Hawker Beechcraft went under, it was owned by private equity, who were getting tired of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” he says. “For Gulfstream, if there are bad times now, it is owned by General Dynamics.”Yet the importance of the aerospace and the auto industries — the scale of the projects, the numbers of jobs they generate and the risks involved — means, according to Thompson, that a non-commercial relationship can also be critical. Company after company when facing tough financial times has turned to its government. The US and Canadian governments extended lending to Chrysler and invested heavily in GM to ensure they continued to operate.In aerospace, that relationship is most obviously vital for companies making military aircraft. Lockheed Martin of the US, for example, is the world’s biggest military contractor in part because the US government decided to supply its air force, navy and marines with variants of a single fighter aircraft, the F-35. Lockheed Martin won the contract to build the aircraft.Involvement goes beyond the military, however. Airbus owes its existence to European governments’ decisions in the late 1960s and early 1970s to bring together their national aerospace industries to work collectively. Boeing has regularly turned to the US military for orders at times when commercial orders have been weak.To survive, large companies occasionally have to turn to the government for helpMeanwhile, Bombardier could be about to write a new chapter in its story. Having failed to persuade Airbus to buy a majority stake in the C Series, the company looks to have few alternatives to seeking help from Quebec’s provincial government. Bombardier is reported to have approached the province’s Caisse de dépôt et placement investment fund about a potential cash injection.Such a move would be no surprise to Thompson. “It’s a myth that large industrial companies survive indefinitely without occasionally turning to the government for help,” he says. “They look wherever they must in order to survive hard times.”"
88;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-11-06T17:28:26Z;Boeing challenges award of $80bn contract by Department of Defence;Group seeks to overturn decision to give bomber work to Northrop Grumman;Boeing threw the future of the US long-range bomber programme into doubt on Friday when it announced an appeal against the “fundamentally flawed” decision to award the $80bn contract to a rival.The appeal to the Government Accountability Office marks the first time that Boeing has launched such an appeal over a military contract since it successfully challenged the award of the US air force’s air tanker programme to a competitor.The US Department of Defence announced on October 27 that it was awarding the contract to build 100 new stealth aircraft capable of evading enemy defences to Northrop Grumman, rather than a consortium involving Boeing and Lockheed Martin.The contract is much the biggest single block of work likely to be awarded by the US military this decade. The US air force regards the long-range bomber as strategically vital to counter new air and sea defences built by China and other countries.The award of the contract to Northrop raised questions about the future of Boeing’s military aircraft division. Without the long-range bomber work, the division looks set to rely mainly on building military versions of its commercial airliners.“Boeing and Lockheed Martin concluded the selection process for the Long Range Strike Bomber was fundamentally flawed,” said the companies in a joint statement.“That flawed evaluation led to the selection of Northrop Grumman over the industry-leading team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, whose proposal offers the government and the warfighter the best possible [long-range strike bomber.”Northrop mounted a strong campaign to secure the contract, arguing that its experience building the B-2 stealth bomber meant it was well qualified to build a new aircraft.Pentagon keeps mum on details of Northrop’s $80bn aircraft dealRead moreIn 2008, Boeing protested against the award of work on the US air force’s air tanker to a consortium of Europe’s EADS — now called Airbus — and Northrop Grumman. Boeing overturned the decision in 2011.Loren Thompson, analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Group who has done consulting work for Boeing and Lockheed, said the tanker decision suggested the two companies had a “good chance” of a successful appeal.“Boeing believes that the errors this time are similar to the errors the air force made in the tanker programme,” he said.The Government Accountability Office has 100 days to evaluate the appeal, however it is all but certain to seek an extension in such a complex case.The shares of all the companies involved were down in morning trading in New York — Northrop Grumman by 1.1 per cent to $184.39, Boeing by 1 per cent to $146.49 and Lockheed Martin by 1.1 per cent to $216.21.
89;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-10-28T18:44:29Z;Stealth bomber contract flies in the dark;Pentagon keeps mum on details of Northrop’s $80bn aircraft deal;After Deborah Lee James, the US air force secretary, said on Tuesday that Northrop Grumman had won the $80bn contract to build the US’s new strategic bomber, reporters started to ask questions.Who would build the engine for the long-range strike bomber? What name would the air force give the aircraft? With which other weapons systems was the bomber intended to co-ordinate? Yet nearly all received non-committal replies from Pentagon officials that reinforced the sense of mystery around the decision, the most important since the US awarded work on the F-35 joint strike fighter to Lockheed Martin in 2001.The project — to supply 100 bombers to replace ageing existing aircraft — promises to transform Northrop from a fading also-ran of the US’s military industries into a significant aircraft supplier. The award dents the ambitions of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which had formed a consortium to bid for the work and looked set to become the only two manufacturers capable of building whole aircraft for the US military.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, says some of the win’s implications are nevertheless obscure precisely because the project’s importance has prompted officials to shroud it in unusual secrecy. Among the aircraft the long-range strike bomber is to replace are 76 B-52s — an aircraft type designed for the early cold war that first flew in 1952. “What mattered was the design and the cost and risk associated with it,” he says. “That of course is, unlike the joint strike fighter, completely in the black, even after the award.”It is a certainty, however, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at Lexington Institute, that the award transforms the prospects of the companies involved.Northrop — which built the B-2 stealth bombers in the 1980s — in particular will move from manufacturing only a handful of crewed aircraft annually to being the supplier of arguably the US’s most strategically significant weapons system. The bomber is intended to counter improvements in the air and sea defences of China, Russia and other potentially hostile powers that could keep US aircraft carriers out of bombing range of their territory.“If the award is sustained, then Northrop Grumman will be building fixed-wing military aircraft for the foreseeable future,” Mr Thompson says. “Boeing on the other hand may see its military aircraft business reduced to making militarised versions of jetliners.”One potential response for Boeing could be to buy Northrop’s military aircraft arm to win back the work. But that option looks implausible to many observers because of the Pentagon’s increasingly vocal unhappiness about consolidation among suppliers.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official, said last month that the defence department planned to ask Congress to create new rules to hinder mergers between military contractors. The move appeared to be motivated by unhappiness over the swift approval given to United Technologies’ $9bn sale of its Sikorsky helicopter business to Lockheed.Boeing’s best chance of rescuing its position may be to challenge the award — a tactic that won it work on the US Air Force’s $35bn air tankerproject after it was awarded to a consortium of Europe’s EADS — now Airbus — and Northrop. The tanker — based on the 767 commercial jet — and Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft — based on the 737 — are among the militarised commercial jets that are now set to form the mainstay of Boeing’s military production.The Boeing-Lockheed consortium hinted at a possible challenge in its response to the decision on Tuesday. “We will have further discussions with our customer before determining our next steps,” the pair said.The challenge for Northrop will be to produce the bomber for the price — $564m for production of each of the 100 aircraft, not including development costs — that it has promised. Past experience on other military aircraft — particularly the significantly over-budget F-35 — suggests that could be as much of a challenge as winning the work.However, Mr Aboulafia insists the project, for now, looks better conceived than the complex F-35, which has had to be engineered to fit multiple roles for three military services and international customers.“Here is a system that’s really designed to do one thing and has no other customers and participants,” he says. “I’m cautiously optimistic.”Asked about the striker’s engine on Wednesday, Lt Gen Arnold Bunch said: “We won’t go into any details relative to specific components or subcontractors due to classification and enhanced security.”And he gave nothing away when questioned about how many aircraft would be involved in the engineering, manufacturing and development phase. “Due to where we’re at in the programme, we’re not going to release that number.”
90;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-10-27T21:48:26Z;Northrop Grumman wins $80bn US stealth bomber contract;Coup over Boeing and Lockheed for nation’s most important military project in a decade;Northrop Grumman secured its future as an independent military contractor as it pulled off a surprise win over a consortium of Boeing and Lockheed Martin for a $80bn contract to supply the bomber designed to ensure the US can win a future war with China or Russia.The 100 Long-Range Strike Bombers are intended to replace a series of ageing existing bombers, including the remaining 76 B-52s — a cold war aircraft that first flew in 1952.The most important military contract likely to be awarded this decade calls for the production of an aircraft that is intended to be able to evade enemy radar in order to destroy air defence systems at the start of war.The project has gained urgency because of America’s recognition of the growing sophistication of the air defences of potential opponents such as Iran, China and Russia, which are designed to keep hostile forces at least 800 nautical miles away from their borders.Deborah Lee James, the US Air Force Secretary, told reporters at the Pentagon the new aircraft would give the US the flexibility and capability to launch strikes from the continental United States to anywhere in the world.She went on: “The threat environment that we face has evolved as a result of development of advanced air defence systems and much more capable surface to air systems that effectively push our older bombers farther and farther away from the fight.”The news sent Northrop’s shares up 5.8 per cent in after-market trading, to $191. Lockheed shares fell 1.9 per cent to $219, while Boeing shares fell 2 per cent to $145.50.General Robin Rand, commander of the Air Force’s Global Strike Command, said the Northrop Grumman proposal had been the “best for both the warfighter and taxpayer”.Advocates of the bomber successfully argued that it would be a more effective and cheaper means of achieving air superiority in battle than launching cruise missiles, which cost around $1.5m each.Northrop promised to provide each aircraft for $511m in 2010 dollars — well below the $550m limit that the Pentagon had announced. That translates to $564m in current dollars.Officials said Northrop would also be awarded $21.4bn worth of development in 2010 dollars, or $23.6bn in current dollars, to make for a total budget of $80bn. The aircraft is expected to achieve Initial Operational Capability — the stage it can first be considered for deployment — in 2025.It is one of the great ironies of recent US landmark military campaigns — in Iraq in 1991, Serbia in 1999 and Afghanistan in 2001 — that, amid the increasing deployment of the latest advanced weapons, a crucial aircraft involved in deploying them was much older than most of the personnel involved. The US continues to rely heavily for strike power on the vast, eight-engine B52 bomber, which first flew in 1952. Some of the 76 remaining B52s are expected to remain in service until 2044.Read moreNorthrop had been expected to lose to its competitors ever since the Pentagon opened bidding in 2011. Northrop has not handled a significant weapons procurement programme since it built the 20 B-2 stealth bombers in the late 1980s and the project has attracted significant criticism because each aircraft cost $2bn after the programme was cut back from 100 to 20 aircraft after the end of the cold war.Lockheed is the world’s largest manufacturer of military hardware and is in charge of building the $392bn F-35 joint-strike fighter, intended to be the future fighter for the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Boeing, as well as being one of the duopoly that dominates the world commercial aircraft market, is building the US Air Force’s KC-46 air-to-air refuelling tanker.Northrop nevertheless fought a fierce campaign, arguing that its experience with the B-2 made it uniquely qualified to build a new bomber.Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, said the air force had made the “right decision” for the US’s security.“As the company that developed and delivered the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, we look forward to providing the Air Force with a highly capable and affordable next-generation Long-Range Strike Bomber,” he said.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, said Northrop’s win was a “game-changing contract”.“It means Northrop Grumman is now set to be the second biggest military aircraft contractor in the US, and Boeing faces some very hard choices,” he said.Boeing could either bid for Northrop’s aircraft arm or revert to being a mainly commercial aircraft company, Mr Aboulafia said.
91;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Joint strike fighter cushions Lockheed profits blow;US manufacturer depends on F-35 amid downturn in military spending;Rising profits from its F-35 joint strike fighter helped cushion the blow for Lockheed Martin caused by declining US military spending, the world’s biggest military manufacturer said.However, Lockheed’s shares fell after it projected 2016 sales at around the same level as 2015 and a decline in operating profit margins.Third-quarter net earnings declined 2.6 per cent to $865m, on sales up 3 per cent to $11.5bn, compared with the same period last year. The profit decline would have been sharper without the contribution of the F-35, which is being supplied to the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and a series of US allies. Operating profit for the core aeronautics division — which manufactures the fighter — rose 15.4 per cent to $418m, on sales up 10.7 per cent to $3.92bn.Profits on the F-35 rose by $85m on sales up $500m, while an improved performance manufacturing the C-5 transport aircraft helped boost profits by $25m.The improvements were offset by declines on other programmes, including a $30m decline in operating profits on the F-22 fighter.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the quarter had included “solid operational achievements” and financial results that had exceeded the company’s expectations.The performance over the year so far meant the company could increase projections for full-year earnings and sales towards the top of the previously announced range, Ms Hewson said.Lockheed said it expected full-year earnings per share of about $11.30, against a previously announced range of $11.00 to $11.30, on a sales forecast raised to about $45bn, from a previous range of $43.5bn to $45bn. Third-quarter earnings per share were $2.77, against $2.76 for the same period last year.The full-year projections included no adjustments either for the company’s review of its government IT and technical services businesses, or for the planned purchase of United Technologies’ Sikorsky helicopter business.Ms Hewson said the review of the services businesses — necessary to cope with an “increasingly competitive environment,” she said — should be completed this year. Among the possible options for the business are a spin-off or sale.The Sikorsky deal is also expected to complete this quarter, after regulatory reviews were completed more quickly than expected.The F-35 — which the US military is expected to spend a total of $400bn over the programme’s lifetime — has protected Lockheed from a slowdown or stagnation in other US military spending. Thanks to rising aeronautics earnings, total operating profits rose 1.7 per cent to $1.37bn.Ms Hewson said the F-35 already accounted for 20 per cent of annual revenues for the company.“This figure is expected to grow as production rates increase for deliveries to US and international customers,” she said.Operating profits in Information Systems and Global Solutions — which has suffered severely from the spending slowdown— declined 7 per cent to $163m, on sales down 4 per cent to $1.87bn.The company said it expected 2016 net sales to be “comparable” with those for 2015, with segment operating margins about 11 per cent, against the 12 per cent projected for this year.

Boeing is 50 per cent owner with Lockheed Martin of United Launch Alliance.Aerojet’s offer underlines the company’s desire to supply the engine for the new Vulcan rocket that ULA is developing to replace its Atlas V, which is powered by Russia-built engines that congress has said ULA must stop using. However, the rebuffing of the bid appears to make it more likely ULA will use the frontrunner for the new rocket, an engine being developed by Blue Origin, a start-up owned by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder.There had been speculation that Boeing and Lockheed would like to exit the launch business, which involves high risk and generates only modest profits.“Boeing is committed to ULA and its business, and to continued leadership in all aspects of space,” Mr Blecher said.Aerojet declined to comment. But one person involved suggested that the $2bn offer had been only preliminary and that the company might continue its effort.In May, SpaceX, the start-up founded by Elon Musk, was cleared for the first time to compete with ULA for national security launches, although it has yet to win any launch contracts. ULA, which has never lost a satellite in 99 launches since its founding in 2006, also faces the technological risks of designing and launching the new Vulcan rocket.ULA last week signed an agreement with Blue Origin to expand production of the BE-4 engine that ULA hopes to use to power Vulcan when it first flies in 2019. The agreement made it less likely that ULA would use an alternative engine from Aerojet that it has named as its second choice should the BE-4’s development fall behind schedule.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute who has worked as a consultant to both Boeing and Lockheed, said the rebuffing of the bid underlined both companies’ commitment to space.“The launch business is pivotal to their other space activities, so that suggests price is not the main issue here,” he said.The rebuffing of the bid made life harder for Aerojet, Mr Thompson added.“It needs to find a way on to the next launch vehicle that ULA uses, which as of today looks likely to be powered by a Blue Origin engine,” he said.Aerojet’s engine was now likely to be used only if problems arose with development of the BE-4, Mr Thompson said.Blue Origin on Tuesday announced plans to launch a new orbital launch vehicle it is developing from Florida.

That is how much Poland will spend on defence-equipment acquisitions over the next eight years, in an overhaul of the country’s military capabilities aimed at deterring potential threats from Russia and becoming a more robust member of Nato.For arms companies that have seen defence budgets frozen or fall in many western countries, it is a lucrative new market eager for their expertise.“The world is here . . . all the big players. It is a focus for all of us,” said Jonathan Hoyle, vice-president for Europe and the Americas at Lockheed Martin. “For Lockheed it is definitely a priority market within Europe and in our international business.”Ten years ago Poland’s Kielce defence show was a low-key affair, attended by a few international names but dominated by local players struggling to keep pace with global technology.Now Europe’s third-largest defence show in terms of attendees after Paris and Farnborough, last week’s event was packed with foreign executives hawking state-of-the-art helicopters, missiles and tanks, as military drones hovered overhead.While Poland has upgraded some of its Soviet-era military equipment over the past two decades, notably with American fighter jets and German tanks, much of its hardware is out of date and inadequate, particularly given the instability in the region resulting from the conflict in Ukraine.“The geopolitical situation here has focused the mind like nowhere else in Europe,” said Mr Hoyle.Number: 50

94;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-07-30T21:54:59Z;BAE Systems reports flat underlying earnings;UK defence group awaits news on orders for Typhoon jets and Australian ships;BAE Systems has left investors in suspense by maintaining the caveats on its target for modest earnings growth this year as it posted flat first-half profits.Even the improving environment for US defence spending — where BAE derives a third of its sales — could not sway Ian King, the Scottish-born chief executive, to a more bullish view of 2015.“The markets outlook in the US is starting to clear with encouraging signs of growth in budgets,” he said. However, BAE would wait to see how this trend panned out “before amending our plans”, he added.His comments came as the world’s third-largest defence group by revenue posted underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £800m for the six months to June 30, against £802m in 2014.BAE said in February that its forecast for modest earnings growth this year depended on winning a further order by the year end for the Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet, built in a consortium with Airbus and Finmeccanica, and on contracts to manufacture Australian naval vessels.The margin for earnings growth this year is so narrow that the costs of closing the group’s Melbourne shipyard — should the Australian government fail to place new orders — could tip BAE back to flat or lower profits, suggested Peter Lynas, finance director. Analysts have estimated the costs at £25m, though Mr Lynas refused to confirm this.The bigger issue for investors is the uncertainty that still hangs over the long-awaited additional order for Typhoon jets from Saudi Arabia, which bought 72 of these aircraft in 2007. Mr King refused to give details on the timing of any order.“BAE seems to have ducked any of the issues that will drive the full-year numbers,” said Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners.BAE is currently making 30 Typhoon jets each year and a decision would have to be taken in the fourth quarter on whether to scale back production and cut jobs if no order is forthcoming, Mr King said. This would result in extra but as-yet unquantified costs.However, Mr King said the acceleration in production of Lockheed Martin’s new F35 combat jet — on which BAE has roughly a 15 per cent share of the programme — could help to preserve some production capacity if orders for Typhoon took longer than expected to land.Elsewhere Mr King voiced confidence that the UK’s forthcoming review of strategic defence priorities would deliver no surprises, unlike 2010 when the government imposed big budget cuts.BAE’s underlying earnings per share fell from 17.7p to 17.1p, and the dividend was increased 2 per cent to 8.4p. The company’s shares closed up 0.75 per cent to 473.10p on Thursday.

Investors seem happy to give Mr Thiam the benefit of the doubt; the daily surge in shares was its best since he was appointed in March.● Related Lex note: Credit Suisse, more to doLockheed fills portfolio gap with $9bn Sikorsky dealLockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, cemented its pre-eminent position on Monday by announcing it had agreed to pay $9bn for United Technologies’ Sikorsky helicopter business, writes Robert Wright in New York.The deal fills one of the few gaps in Lockheed’s portfolio of military equipment, which ranges from the F35 Joint Strike Fighter — the biggest military procurement in history — to naval ships, satellites, rockets and transport aircraft.For United Technologies (UTC), the deal represents some of the efforts of Greg Hayes, who took over in November, to improve the company’s performance. Mr Hayes had said the division, which has suffered from declining US military spending, was unlikely to meet the growth or margin targets.The acquisition will be part of a wider reshaping of Lockheed Martin. The company will conduct a strategic review of its information technology and technical services businesses. A disposal of those businesses — which were rapidly hit by the downturn in US government military spending — would leave Lockheed more focused on its traditional expertise manufacturing and maintaining the platforms for US military weapons systems, such as aircraft and ships.Shareholders were cautious about the deal, sending shares in Lockheed Martin up just under 1 per cent on Thursday to $203.89.The story for UTC was rather different, however. A day after announcing the Sikorsky deal, the company was forced to downgrade its forecasts for the year, largely thanks to over-optimism about sales of Otis lifts and other building equipment in China and sales of aircraft parts. UTC’s stock fell more than 9 per cent between Monday and Thursday, closing on Thursday at $101.14.● Related Lex note: Lockheed’s vertical liftEli Lilly drug raises hopes of Alzheimer’s breakthroughHopes of a breakthrough against Alzheimer’s disease were raised by data suggesting that an experimental drug from Eli Lilly might slow the pace of the memory-wasting condition, writes Andrew Ward in London.New options also opened in the prevention of heart disease and strokes as Amgen and Sanofi won European approval for a major new class of drugs called PCSK9s, which aim to lower cholesterol in people who do not respond to statins.While the new cholesterol-busters promise more immediate benefit to patients and investors, the Alzheimer’s data raised the tantalising suggestion that drugmakers might be making progress against one of toughest challenges in medical science.Eli Lilly’s solanezumab is among the more than 120 Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed in clinical trials since 1998. But new analysis of previous data published this week reinforced signs that it might work for people with mild forms of the disease.Doug Brown, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, a charity, said confidence was growing that Eli Lilly and others were on the right track in trying to reduce build-up in the brain of sticky plaques, which have long been identified as a potential cause of the disease.But optimism was tempered by disappointing data from another Alzheimer’s drug, called aducanumab, being developed by Biogen and analysts said there was still much to prove in another big trial of solanezumab due to finish next year.“These reports are good news in the same way that a forecast of sunny weather at the weekend is good news,” said John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London. “It raises hopes for good weather, but it does not mean good weather is a certainty.”● Related Lex note: Eli Lilly’s expensive endeavour

96;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-07-20T22:08:29Z;Musk says SpaceX became ‘complacent’ before crash;Founder blames broken strut holding helium tank for explosion of Falcon 9 rocket;SpaceX, the company competing for some of the US’s most sensitive space launches, may have become “a little bit complacent” before a devastating rocket explosion on June 28, its founder said on Monday as he published preliminary findings on the crash.Elon Musk, who also founded PayPal and Tesla Motors, revealed that the crash appeared to have occurred after a stainless steel strut holding a helium tank broke as an uncrewed Falcon 9 rocket soared 44.9km above the Atlantic Ocean.The breaking of the strut in the rocket’s upper stage led the tank to shoot towards the top of the rocket, releasing helium. The rocket — which was carrying supplies to the International Space Station — then blew up because the helium release allowed excess pressure to build up in the rocket’s liquid oxygen tank.Mr Musk said the investigation had not shown up any other issues besides the one with the strut but that the company would look closely for any “minor misses”.“This is the first time we’ve had a failure in seven years, so to some degree the company as a whole became maybe a little bit complacent over the course of seven years,” he said.Mr Musk added that when SpaceX suffered its last failure — with a Falcon 1 rocket in August 2008 — the company had only 500 employees, against 4,000 at present.“The vast majority of the people at the company today have only ever seen successes,” Mr Musk said. “When you’ve only ever seen successes, you don’t fear failure quite as much.”Elon Musk and the flawed idea that setbacks are to be celebratedContinue readingSpaceX in May won approval for the first time from the US Air Force to compete against United Launch Alliance, the incumbent, to provide some launches for national security satellites. ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has held a monopoly on the work since its formation in 2006. The US government hopes competition from SpaceX will help to drive down ULA’s prices.Mr Musk said SpaceX had discussed its findings with Nasa, the civilian space agency for which it was operating the doomed mission, the US Air Force and its commercial customers.“Every one of our customers has been supportive and none of them has indicated diminished faith in SpaceX,” he said.The company would in future test each of the struts concerned individually, rather than accepting the manufacturer’s certification of their quality, Mr Musk said. The process would push up the cost of manufacturing the rocket but would not affect the cost to customers.When you’ve only ever seen successes, you don’t fear failure quite as muchMr Musk gave no clear timetable for a resumption of launches but said it would be “no sooner than September”. That appears to put in doubt the timetable for the 10 Falcon 9 launches scheduled for later this year, the first of which had been due on August 9.The company would also postpone the first flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket — three Falcon 9 rocket cores bolted together, to lift the heaviest satellites to space — until next year. The Falcon Heavy is one of two possible replacements for ULA’s expensive-to-operate Delta IV Heavy, currently the US’s only heavy-lift rocket.The revenue lost this year as a result of the delays would be in the “hundreds of millions” of dollars, Mr Musk said.
97;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-07-20T17:15:45Z;Lockheed: vertical lift;What powers Lockheed’s ascent?;"Announcing the $9bn cash sale of its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin, United Technologies said on Monday that the buyer “will ensure [Sikorsky] remains a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift”. The company was probably not referring to financial engineering and an ascendant share price, but may as well have been. Lockheed’s shares have returned 133 per cent over the past three years, leaving both the S&P 500 and its peers looking up from below. The stock rose more on the news of the deal, and of solid second-quarter results.Lockheed’s returns have been driven, in part, by a combination of vigorous deployment of dividends and buybacks, and a willingness to restructure its portfolio. On the first point, the company has, since the start of 2012, spent $4.5bn buying back its own shares and $5.6bn on dividends (against a market capitalisation of $64bn). That is $1bn more than it generated in free cash flow. Another $10.4bn has gone on acquisitions, including Sikorsky. And the company promises $5bn for shareholders this year and in each of the next two.Lockheed is also considering more portfolio changes: it said on Monday that it would consider its options for its government IT services business, which has $6bn a year in sales. The market has thrilled to all this financial rejigging. The shares traded at a big discount to the market a few years ago; now they are on par. The re-rating is not supported by growth, retrospective or prospective. Sales have been flat, and are expected to stay that way.Can Lockheed keep ascending? This depends, in part, on the direction of military budgets, and in particular the company’s F-35 fighter programme. But the more important factor may be whether a certain sort of company — big, cash generative, no-growth groups that add leverage, do deals, and buy back shares — remain popular with investors. If companies like this are simply bond substitutes, it is up to the Federal Reserve to keep lifting Lockheed.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
98;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed agrees to buy helicopter maker Sikorsky for $9bn;Deal cements US company’s position as world’s leading supplier of military hardware;Lockheed Martin on Monday cemented its position as the world’s leading supplier of military hardware when it agreed to pay $9bn to buy Sikorsky, maker of the Black Hawk helicopter, from United Technologies.If approved by regulators, the deal will turn Lockheed, already the US military’s main supplier of fighter and transport aircraft as well as an important naval shipbuilder, into the most important helicopter provider as well.For United Technologies, the successful completion of the deal reflects the determination of Greg Hayes, who took over as chief executive in November, to improve the company’s financial performance.He said when announcing plans to spin off or sell Sikorsky in March that the division’s performance and growth prospects were not of the standard he expected of a business in the group, which makes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Otis elevators.Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed’s chief executive, said that Sikorsky was a “natural fit” for the group and complemented its broad portfolio of aerospace and defence products and technologies.“Together, we’ll offer a strong portfolio of helicopter solutions to our global customers and accelerate the pace of innovation and new technology development,” she added.Mr Hayes said: “Exiting the helicopter business will allow UTC to better focus on providing high-technology systems and services to the aerospace and building industries and to deliver improved and sustained value to our customers and shareowners.”Alongside its announcement of the acquisition, Lockheed said it would conduct a “strategic review” of its information technology and technical services businesses. These have been hit by US government budget cuts because they lack the multiyear contracts that cushion big military hardware programmes from feeling the immediate impact of spending reductions.Lockheed also brought forward its second-quarter earnings announcement — scheduled for Tuesday — by a day. Net income rose 4.5 per cent against last year to $929m, on sales up 3 per cent to $11.6bn. The company raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share from a range of $10.85 to $11.15 to $11 to $11.30. The full-year figures are unlikely to be affected by the Sikorsky deal, which is expected to complete only late this year or early next.United Technologies’ shares dipped 0.23 per cent to $110.48 in New York. Lockheed’s shares rose almost 2 per cent to $205.13.The $9bn headline figure for the deal was substantially higher than the $7bn initial valuation anticipated for Sikorsky when Mr Hayes announced the review of its future. However, Lockheed said it would effectively pay only $7.1bn because of the deal’s tax benefits.What powers Lockheed’s ascent?Continue readingIt had previously been expected that United Technologies might face a significant tax bill for selling Sikorsky— which it bought in 1929, four years after its founding — and that this might force the group instead to spin off the helicopter maker as a standalone company. United Technologies said it would use proceeds from the transaction to boost its share repurchase programme.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal group, said that Lockheed was paying “a lot” but that Sikorsky was a “very good company”.
99;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-07-08T17:42:19Z;Science and engineering: A new kind of space race;SpaceX has shaken up the defence establishment, but an explosion has raised concerns about the reliability of rockets;At 11.05am on May 20, an orange flash ignited under a white, snub-nosed rocket towering 200ft (61m) above a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. A few seconds later, amid clouds of smoke and flames, the Atlas V rocket lifted slowly upwards. A mere 83 seconds later, it had passed the sound barrier. Trailing a tail of fire, it was speeding over the Atlantic Ocean towards orbit.It was the 96th successful launch in the history of United Launch Alliance, a little-known company that plays a critical role in the US’s national security. A joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the company has held a monopoly on the launch of sensitive space gear such as military satellites and the X-37B spaceplane that the May 20 mission was carrying.In an industry used to fiery launch pad explosions, the company has the industry’s best record of making space launch less like the final frontier and more like a routine commuter flight.Yet, six days after the Cape Canaveral launch, the US military announced the effective end of ULA’s monopoly on national security space launches. After nearly three years of bureaucratic battles, the US Air Force declared that a relative newcomer — SpaceX, the commercial space launch venture founded by Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of PayPal and Tesla Motors — would be allowed to compete with ULA for the work. Pentagon leaders hope the competition will help to push down ULA’s price for an average launch of $164m — SpaceX claims it is much higher, at $400m — to closer to the $60m that Mr Musk’s company charges some commercial satellite launch customers.The Pentagon’s decision marked the latest remarkable advance by Mr Musk’s company on to territory once occupied only by government agencies such as Nasa, the US civilian space agency, and a few favoured, long-established corporations. In 2012, SpaceX became the first private company to operate an uncrewed supply mission to the International Space Station. In 2014, SpaceX and Boeing were awarded contracts to carry astronauts for the first time on a privately operated vehicle to the space station for Nasa.Those advances have given SpaceX the strongest thrust of a new generation of space companies offering everything from brief, suborbital tourist flights — such as Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic— to innovative satellite-based imaging services, such as the US’s Planet Labs. The industry has acquired the go-go aura of Silicon Valley, often with a similar cast list. Google and Fidelity, the investment firm, jointly invested $1bn in SpaceX earlier this year. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, also founded Blue Origin, a start-up maker of rocket engines.Yet the critical concern has long been whether the business of launching US spy satellites — some costing more than $1bn and many critical to the US’s national security — should be subject to the same kind of disruptive competition as, say, Uber and traditional taxi operators. The worry is that the US could find itself relying on unproved technology for important missions.Those concerns were underlined on June 28 when an uncrewed SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying supplies to the International Space Station exploded and disintegrated nearly 45km above the Atlantic Ocean.ULA has problems of its own. The US Congress has banned the company from using the Russian-built RD180 engine that powers its Atlas V rockets, like the one that took off on May 20. The ban — which takes effect some time in 2019 — has forced ULA to start planning to use a new, US-built engine in the Vulcan. The frontrunner for the bid is an engine built by Mr Bezos’s Blue Origin, the BE-4.For the military, this means that it faces relying, for a while at least, on one operator whose only rocket recently blew up and another using an untried new engine.General John Hyten, head of the US Air Force’s space command, expressed concern about such a situation even before the June 28 SpaceX incident by recalling a series of incidents in the 1980s and 1990s, when Lockheed Martin’s Titan rocket system destroyed four separate satellites in explosions.No one had been able to tell him, Gen Hyten said, what would happen if either ULA or SpaceX suffered such a failure and had to ground its rocket while the fault was resolved. Falcon 9 has indeed been grounded while the explosion is being investigated. Mr Musk says he expected to reach “preliminary conclusions” regarding the crash’s cause by the end of this week.“I’m not going to stand up and put a $1bn satellite on top of a rocket I don’t know is going to work,” Gen Hyten said.SpaceX’s failure followed two others related to uncrewed space station supply missions. On October 28 last year, an Antares rocket operated by Orbital Sciences Corporation exploded just after launch in Virginia. Subsequently, on April 28, an apparent mishap during separation from a rocket left a Russian resupply spacecraft spinning uselessly in orbit before plunging back to earth.But Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s confident chief operating officer, sounded certain a few hours after the explosion of overcoming the setback. “We will get back to flight as soon as we safely and reliably can,” she said.Yet the Air Force Space Command officers clustered at bases around Colorado’s Cheyenne Mountain complex sound far more cautious. The Air Force manages the technical risks inherent in flying hardware to space atop highly explosive vehicles by paying ULA to use the expensive, less efficient Delta rockets for some launches. That ensures that an alternative to the Atlas V workhorse will always remain in production, ready to take over if needed. But Delta is due to be retired, leaving ULA’s new Vulcan and SpaceX’s Falcon as the rockets to provide similar insurance in future.But Gen Hyten says the competition will have to be managed so that both ULA and SpaceX receive enough work to keep their production lines rolling steadily. “We have to work with the providers to work out what the business arrangement is going to be to allow us to get through all these times of uncertainty,” Gen Hyten says.SpaceX would prefer far more unbridled competition, since it doubts that ULA will be able to match the level of less than $100m per launch that SpaceX says it will charge for national security launches. SpaceX, unlike ULA, has commercial satellite launch customers who help to cover its fixed costs.However, there is almost no commercial demand to loft heavy satellites to the very high orbits needed for some military applications. The military looks set to devise a less competitive means of awarding that work to ensure such rockets are still built. “Is commercial going to put satellites on that vehicle?” Gen Hyten asks of the expensive, enormously powerful rockets required.Yet its high costs mean that ULA has fewer defenders among the US defence department’s budget-focused civilian leaders than among the security- focused military chiefs.The department currently pays ULA a $1bn annual fee — even before the extra it is paid for each launch — to cover the expenses of maintaining both Atlas and Delta. ULA insists that Vulcan launches will cost only around the $100m per launch that SpaceX says it will charge for military launches.Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, rejects simple comparisons between his company’s prices and SpaceX’s, saying there is a “fundamental difference” in what they offer. “SpaceX comes to the market with one rocket that does a very limited mission,” he says. “We come to the market with 15 different products.”Nevertheless, Deborah Lee James, US Air Force secretary, has been a vocal supporter of SpaceX and its lower costs. She grew so impatient with the three-year process of approving it for national security launches that she demanded a report into the delay.“Anything that would bring us cost savings, all these are of great interest,” she said in April.Marco Caceres, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, says the recent SpaceX explosion bolsters the case of those in the US military who have expressed concern about the risks of handing national security launches to a company with a far shorter pedigree than ULA’s. While ULA draws on the decades of experience of its parent companies, the June 28 launch was only the 19th flight of the Falcon 9.“The question is: ‘is it enough of a convincing argument to reject SpaceX?’” Mr Caceres says.ULA has to grapple with the confused state of efforts to replace the Russian-made RD180, which first Lockheed Martin and then ULA have been buying ever since the end of the cold war.A congressional budget bill late last year banned any national security launch provider from buying engines under contracts signed after last year’s Russian annexation of Crimea. Officials have since interpreted the law as allowing ULA too few engines to complete its scheduled launches before the Vulcan becomes available in 2022 or 2023.That could leave the US solely reliant on SpaceX for national security launches for at least a period — with the attendant risks. “What we may be doing is trading one monopoly situation for another,” Ms James warns.Mr Bruno points to ULA’s “perfect reliability record” and the low insurance costs its customers pay to insure their satellites as evidence that the company can compete effectively with SpaceX. “All of that comes together in the value offering we bring to the marketplace,” he says.The blow of the failure for SpaceX is undoubtedly severe. Ms Shotwell used to boast not only about SpaceX’s costs but to claim that it actually had a better reliability record than ULA.Nevertheless, it would be rash to dismiss the company’s chances of overcoming the setback. At less than 15 years old, it is already a significant commercial force and a critical supplier to the world’s largest space agency. Its cost advantages could help it to win a substantial share of the business of the US Air Force, the world’s most demanding space launch customer.Mr Musk’s plans for a colony on Mars — he calls it “extinction insurance” — still seem a distant prospect. But the company’s stated ambition to become “the world’s dominant provider of space launch” may not be so far-fetched.“We’ll pour even more effort to look for any source of possible failure in the future,” Ms Shotwell said after the failure. “This doesn’t change our plans.”Until the explosion on June 28, the biggest drama surrounding SpaceX’s satellite launches had been less whether the rocket would make it to space than whether it would return. The doomed flight was to have marked SpaceX’s fourth attempt at the unprecedented feat of safely landing a rocket on a remote-controlled barge in the middle of the ocean.The idea is to reuse the rocket later. But first the rocket has to successfully descend on to the barge as a set of legs extends to hold it upright on landing.SpaceX’s first attempt in January landed too hard and exploded, the second missed the barge and the third tipped over on landing. “If one can figure out how to effectively reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred,” Elon Musk, SpaceX founder, said in June.His comment reflects the widespread belief among the new wave of space companies that the traditional rocket launch needs to be rethought — not least the problem of tens of millions of dollars’ worth of equipment being discarded after a single use.Many of United Launch Alliance’s hopes of bringing down the cost of each launch of its new Vulcan rocket rely on plans to send the first stage’s engines back to earth under parachutes that would slow their descent and allow helicopters to retrieve them in mid-air.But there is also cynicism about how truly reusable launch vehicles will be, thanks to the experience of the expensive Space Shuttle programme. Hopes that the spacecraft would be truly reuseable were dashed after it became clear that tiles on each vehicle’s protective heat shield needed to be replaced due to damage caused on re-entering the earth’s atmosphere.ULA’s more modest plans are based on the idea of only trying to recover the engines — the most expensive part of each rocket. Even that idea raises some observers’ eyebrows, however. Because rocket engines have rarely been reused, no one knows whether they would still be viable after a fiery re-entry.
100;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-06-29T02:14:04Z;US space assumptions explode along with cargo;SpaceX mishap will have significant implications for American policy;It was a puff of smoke 139 seconds into the Falcon 9 rocket’s voyage towards the International Space Station that indicated something had gone wrong. Moments later, with the rocket operated by SpaceX nearly 45km above the Atlantic Ocean, smoke began billowing and debris from the unmanned flight fanned out in the sky.Yet far more than the rocket and the Dragon spacecraft full of supplies it was carrying tumbled out of the sky above Florida on Sunday morning. The mishap also destroyed some of the assumptions underlying current US space policy.SpaceX, founded in 2002 by entrepreneur Elon Musk, has thus far insisted it is not only far cheaper than United Launch Alliance, its main rival, but just as reliable. The company’s record had prompted both Nasa, the civilian space agency, and the US Air Force to make SpaceX launch vehicles critical parts of their future plans.The explosion will have implications for both Nasa and the air force. Nasa is planning to use Falcon 9 rockets like the one that blew up on Sunday to carry astronauts to the space station, starting later this decade. The air force in May made SpaceX only the second company — after ULA — cleared to carry US spy and other national security satellites.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says Sunday’s failure will strengthen the hand of military and other officials who have questioned whether SpaceX’s record justified the confidence put in them. ULA, formed in 2006 as a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has not suffered a complete launch failure in 96 missions.“This is going to reinforce the misgivings of some people in the air force who wondered about turning to a non-traditional provider,” says Mr Thompson, who has consulted for both Boeing and Lockheed.Yet there was no immediate sign the latest incident had dented the confidence of Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer. Hours after the explosion, Ms Shotwell, who has said SpaceX aims to become the world’s dominant space-launch provider, said the explosion would not change its plans. SpaceX’s appeal to the government has largely been its promise to slash the cost of reaching space. The company offers commercial satellite launches for as little as $60m, compared with the $164m average cost of ULA’s government launches.“It’s certainly a time to pause and make sure we’re doing everything we need to do,” Ms Shotwell said. “But I don’t anticipate any significant changes.”The explosion will nevertheless give new weight to ULA supporters’ argument that the higher cost of its launches partly reflects superior reliability.Nasa has lost three spacecraft since October, all purchased under new contractual arrangements intended to cut costs, Mr Thompson says. The introduction of competition into the national security launch market is also intended to drive down costs.An Orbital Sciences Antares rocket heading to the space station exploded on a launch pad in Virginia on October 28. In April a Progress 59 supply ship ended up spinning uselessly in the wrong orbit after launching from Kazakhstan, before eventually crashing back to earth.John Hyten, head of the US Air Force space command, warned in April that he would be unwilling to launch satellites— some of which cost $1bn or more — on a rocket that he was not certain would work.The implication of Nasa’s recent setbacks is that you get what you pay for in the space business“The implication of Nasa’s recent setbacks is that you get what you pay for in the space business,” Mr Thompson says. “If you pay less then you will have less capability and potentially more risk.”The critical question will be whether SpaceX can quickly identify the fault that caused Sunday’s explosion, rectify it and return to a pattern of largely trouble-free launches.Initial indications on Sunday were that a fault had developed in the second stage of the rocket, which carries the spacecraft from the upper atmosphere into orbit, as it was preparing to separate from the first stage.Marco Caceres, an analyst for the Virginia-based Teal Group, accepts that the explosion strengthens ULA’s hand.But he adds: “Is it enough of a convincing argument to reject SpaceX? I think the air force has to look carefully again and say, ‘is this a one-time thing or is it going to be a pattern?’”Questions about reliability will be felt most acutely on the space station itself, where the six crew have lost the immediate prospect of, among other things, a new filter bed for the space station’s water purifying system.Nasa officials on Sunday said the astronauts had supplies to last many more months, and pointed out that a resupply mission was due to launch from Kazakhstan on July 3.Yet even if the disarray in Nasa’s supply programme has no wider effect on the fortunes of the various providers, ULA has won at least one victory. With its Antares rocket still unable to fly, Orbital ATK — Orbital Sciences’ new owner — has arranged for ULA to undertake its next launch of cargo to the ISS some time later this year.
101;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-06-24T17:00:44Z;New Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg eyes jet production challenge;Turning the 787 into a profitable programme, and cutting costs in defence, will be priorities;As each 787 Dreamliner left the production line at Boeing’s Everett factory near Seattle in the first quarter of this year, the aircraft maker booked an average $26m more in costs than it will immediately recoup.Reducing the cost of making Boeing’s groundbreaking long-range passenger jet, and turning it into a profitable aircraft programme, will be one of the most important priorities for Dennis Muilenburg, who is due to become chief executive of the US aerospace and defence group on July 1.The 51-year-old Mr Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran, is clear about the task he faces — not just in manufacturing the Dreamliner efficiently, but also the broad challenge of producing jets at a fast and demanding pace after the company accumulated a record order backlog for 5,700 commercial aircraft. He is also contending with much-reduced defence spending by western governments.“This [order backlog] represents the biggest single opportunity for the company,” said Mr Muilenburg, in an interview with the Financial Times at the Paris air show last week. “It allows us to make the right long-term decision on capital investment. We are also in a position to bring automation into the factories.”As Boeing’s chief operating officer over the past two years, Mr Muilenburg has been charged with finding ways to extract a better operating performance across the group.He cited the example of the 60,000 fasteners attached by hand on every one of Boeing’s 777 long-range aircraft. Robots, which will be used on a planned new version of the aircraft called the 777X to curb labour intensive tasks, are now to be deployed on the existing model. “We will further reduce the risks and take cost out,” he said.Boeing officials are keen to stress that Mr Muilenburg’s promotion represents continuity with Jim McNerney, the charismatic former GE chief who has led the group over the past decade. Mr Muilenburg said he had spent the past 18 months “learning how [Mr McNerney] does the job”.Looming strategic decisions are already apparent — not least on whether the group should launch a new jet aimed at plugging the gap between Boeing’s 737 short-range aircraft and the Dreamliner.Mr McNerney last year appeared to rule out another round of radical innovation when he said there would be no more “moon shots” — a reminder of the financial pain inflicted on Boeing by the Dreamliner, which entered service three years late in 2011, significantly over budget.But he and Mr Muilenburg appeared to be shifting the goalposts in Paris. “We are evaluating different options,” said Mr Muilenburg. Nothing is imminent, he added, but the mood music is changing, with even Mr McNerney admitting last week that there was demand for such an aircraft.Mr Muilenburg will have face down an increasingly confident Airbus and rivalry between the two companies has rarely been as intense.The Toulouse-based aircraft maker has established a lead in the short-range jet market in terms of orders for a planned new version of the A320, called the Neo, which will have more fuel-efficient engines compared with the existing model. Boeing has a lead in long-range, twin engine jets — having sold more Dreamliners than Airbus’s equivalent, the A350.Both companies are accelerating production to record highs on several of their aircraft programmes, and the winner will be whichever group delivers on time and to budget.Meanwhile, there will also be questions for Mr Muilenberg over the future of Boeing’s defence and space business, which has shrunk significantly over the past few years, from close to 60 per cent of group revenue to about 30 per cent now.With many western governments keeping a tight rein on military budgets, Mr Muilenburg did not apologise for being relaxed about Boeing’s shrinking defence business.But there has been “a big shift in the product mix in defence”, says Robert Stallard, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Mature programmes such as Boeing’s C-17 military transport aircraft are finishing, while the company will soon start delivering 179 new air-to-air refuelling tankers to the US air force, which could create margin and cash flow headwinds, he adds.Not surprisingly there is a fervent drive to cut costs. “If we look out over five to 10 years we see defence sales as flattish to slightly growing,” said Mr Muilenburg. “But where the top line is flattish, we will see bottom line growth.”Boeing, in a partnership with Lockheed Martin, is seeking to win a contract to supply the US air force with a new long-range strike bomber. It is competing against Northrop Grumman.“The most important near-term objective the company has is to secure the award for the air force’s long-range strike bomber, which ultimately could be worth $100bn over several decades,” says Loren Thompson, analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.Mr Muilenburg said he was confident on the bomber deal, but it is clear his biggest focus will be on the challenges in commercial aircraft. New entrants are coming — notably Comac of China is expected to eventually intensify competition in the short-range jet market.With Boeing’s commercial aircraft division accounting for 70 per cent of group sales, the company’s future in the short to medium term largely depends on smooth delivery of jets to airlines, and continued innovation.Fuelled by this division, Boeing’s sales hit $90.8bn last year — compared with $52.5bn in 2004, the year before Mr McNerney became chief executive.It is a measure of Mr McNerney’s achievement that the problems he bequeaths to Mr Muilenburg are mainly ones of growth and investment, rather than managing decline.“When McNerney came to Boeing, it was a fairly troubled organisation,” says Mr Thompson. “He has, step by step, turned it into a well-run company, with huge additional opportunities.”Profile: Dennis MuilenburgWhen Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s incoming chief executive, stood before investors at a conference in May, it was apparent to many present that a new chapter had already opened for the US aerospace and defence group.After a decade of routine briefings from Jim McNerney, the outgoing chief executive, Boeing’s then chief operating officer had the conference suddenly fizzing with energy. “Dennis danced around the stage, with no notes, totally on top of everything,” says Robert Stallard, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “He was very hands on, very enthusiastic and came across as quite a good operator.”Blonde and blue-eyed, with the clean-cut looks of a 1960s US astronaut, Mr Muilenburg also left some in the audience with a sense of déjà vu. He bears an uncanny resemblance to another aerospace executive — Tom Enders , his counterpart at arch rival Airbus.The similarities do not stop at looks and a direct manner — like Mr Enders, Mr Muilenburg has spent a considerable portion of his career in the defence business. He led Boeing’s defence and space business between 2009 and 2013.There may be some in Seattle — home of Boeing’s passenger jet business -who regard the appointment of a military man to the chief executive role as an affront to the commercial aircraft division that dominates group sales, analysts say.But Mr Muilenburg’s appointment could be the signal that Boeing intends finally to crack a longstanding problem — how to force the commercial aircraft and defence divisions to work closely together, and thereby become a more efficient group.In an interview last week, Mr Muilenburg shrugged off any suggestion that he did not have the right stuff to run a largely commercial business.He began his career as a summer intern in Boeing’s commercial aircraft division in 1985, he said, having earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University and a master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington. “I spent the first 15 years of my career in Seattle,” he said.But did he believe that Boeing can do things differently? “We can create opportunities to generate value by working across the entire breadth of Boeing,” he said.Breaking down the barriers between Boeing’s commercial aircraft and defence divisions will be a challenge, but it may also be the key to Mr Muilenburg’s legacy.This article has been amended to reflect the accounting treatment of Boeing’s Dreamliner costs.
102;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-06-23T22:30:51Z;Boeing chief McNerney to step down;Handover to COO comes amid cost challenges for Dreamliner;The chief executive of Boeing is to step down in favour of the company’s chief operating officer, amid severe cost challenges for its flagship 787 Dreamliner.Jim McNerney, 65, will hand over as president and chief executive on July 1 to 51-year-old Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing said on Tuesday. Mr McNerney will remain an employee until February next year to smooth the transition, and will retain the title of chairman. Boeing did not make it clear how long he would keep that title.The commercial jet manufacturer highlighted the remarkable turnround in its performance since Mr McNerney was appointed in 2005. It is also a significant military aircraft manufacturer and maker of spacecraft.During his tenure, the company has overtaken Europe’s Airbus to regain the position as the world’s biggest commercial jet maker by aircraft delivered.[Dennis Muilenburg] breaks the mould at Boeing in terms of his energy and his enthusiasmHowever, the handover also comes amid concerns over the challenge of bringing down the cost of manufacturing its 787 wide-body jet , of which it has a backlog of more than 800 orders from customers. The company currently loses around $30m for each of the 10 787s it delivers every month.Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group, blamed the continuing cost problems on Mr McNerney’s “abrasive” attitude to the labour unions at the company’s main production facilities in Renton, near Seattle.In late 2013, Mr McNerney started the process of taking away work on Boeing’s next big project — the new 777x version of its successful 777 long-range jet — from Renton because of disagreements with unions. The unions eventually approved a new contract and the work stayed.“It’s become a bit of an embarrassment,” Mr Aboulafia said of the 787 costs. “He’s spent an awful lot of time and effort butting up with the very people who were expected to bring those costs down.”Mr McNerney had been expected to remain until after next year’s company centenary, Mr Aboulafia added. It was “plausible” that the 787 issues had helped to hasten his departure.“Everyone knew it would be either this year or next year,” Mr Aboulafia said.Mr Muilenburg had been seen as a likely successor to Mr McNerney since he was appointed chief operating officer in 2013.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said Mr Muilenburg was “a very dynamic executive”.“He breaks the mould at Boeing in terms of his energy and his enthusiasm,” Mr Thompson said.As well as bringing down 787 costs, Mr Muilenburg will be under pressure to ensure Boeing’s joint bid with Lockheed Martin wins the contract to build the US’s new long-range strike bomber. Work on the 100 aircraft is likely to bring in around $55bn.Boeing’s shares fell 0.37 per cent in after-market trading to $143.89.
103;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-06-12T17:28:08Z;Defence groups in under-the-radar race to replace cold war relic;Lockheed and Boeing bid against Northrop for US Air Force contact to build successor to B52 bomber;It is one of the great ironies of recent US landmark military campaigns — in Iraq in 1991, Serbia in 1999 and Afghanistan in 2001 — that, amid the increasing deployment of the latest advanced weapons, a crucial aircraft involved in deploying them was much older than most of the personnel involved.The US continues to rely heavily for strike power on the vast, eight-engine B52 bomber, which first flew in 1952. Some of the 76 remaining B52s are expected to remain in service until 2044.The B52s’ extreme age and the growing sophistication of the enemy air defences that the vast, subsonic aircraft is likely to encounter have made progress on its replacement — a programme known as Long-Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) — the top outstanding procurement priority for the US Air Force.The military have been demanding a replacement that will, according to people familiar with the process, be less visible to enemy radar than any previous aircraft and hence more capable than ever of evading and then eliminating enemy air defences.Yet, for the companies involved in bidding, the issues involved are almost as pressing as those facing the military. A consortium of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, and Boeing is the frontrunner, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute think-tank. A win for the consortium would cement the two as the default suppliers of military aircraft to the US military.• How is the oil price collapse affecting civil aviation manufacturers and paying passengers?• How safe is air travel?

Does space exploration belong in the hands of government?• Combat drones are coming. How soon will they be waging war?Join us on June 15, at 15:00 BST using #FTaero to discussThe only challenger is Northrop Grumman, manufacturer of the B2 stealth bomber, the last bomber purchased by the US military. If it fails, Northrop looks likely to recede from the ranks of manufacturers that can handle the final assembly and integration of a large, complex military aircraft. The company currently assembles only a handful of aircraft each year, including its Global Hawk unmanned aircraft and turboprop airborne early warning aircraft.Mr Thompson, whose think-tank receives funding from Boeing and Lockheed, says Northrop’s modest production rates are a sign it has fallen far behind its competitors.Boeing and Lockheed Martin say they have teamed up to “deliver a flexible, credible, global precision strike capability to the air force” affordably.“We have the breadth and depth of proven technologies and talent, plus the infrastructure and scale that matches the importance of this mission,” they say. “We are the right team for the entire life of the programme.”Northrop nevertheless argues that it is well placed to win the work, because it built the US’s only long-range stealth bomber — the B2 — in the late 1980s. Having initially intended to buy 130 B2s, the US bought only 20 amid the changing strategic priorities of the end of the cold war, while Northrop fashioned a 21st by converting a prototype for active service. The Air Force currently has only 20 after one crashed on take-off in 2008.“With our breadth and depth of experience in long-range stealth platforms and the requisite electronics systems necessary, we feel that we are extremely well positioned for the US Air Force’s LRS-B programme,” the company says.The challenge for advocates of the bomber’s importance to the US military has been partly to explain why such an aircraft is still necessary. Aircraft such as the F-35 joint strike fighter— the biggest military procurement project in history, being built by Lockheed Martin — are well equipped to drop some munitions on opposing forces.The US also has a formidable arsenal of cruise missiles which, under some circumstances, have formidable powers to evade enemy radar and destroy hardened bunkers.However, advocates of a long-range bomber have successfully argued that only such an aircraft — expected to cost about $550m each — will be able to penetrate the air defences that Iran, China, Russia and other powers are constructing to keep US forces up to 800 nautical miles away from their borders. Only a large, long-range bomber, advocates argue, can hope to knock out enough of an opponent’s air defences to let other forces attack.Despite the high capital cost of each of the 100 planned aircraft, the option could prove far cheaper than firing multiple cruise missiles costing $1.5m each over the aircraft’s lifetime, one person involved says. “Only a bomber can impose our will on other countries,” the person says.For Northrop Grumman, meanwhile, the core challenge is to overcome what its backers say are misconceptions about the B2. Lobbyists for the rival bid have regularly quoted calculations that the aircraft requires 18 hours’ maintenance for every hour it flies — an argument that Northrop’s backers say is unfair, as long-range bombers fly rarely, but need to be kept constantly ready to do so.The aircraft is also often criticised for its high costs — which worked out at about $2bn per aircraft. Northrop’s backers attribute that to the US defence department’s having cancelled the programme far short of the 130 aircraft originally intended, meaning that each of the delivered aircraft’s share of the development costs was much higher that expected.Northrop’s backers say that the cost of the aircraft would fall sharply over its lifetime — and point out that the B2 has knocked out some of the most difficult targets in the US’s recent wars, including Serbia’s Danube bridges and reinforced concrete aircraft hangars in Libya.Yet one of the few certainties is that — as the long-range bomber is the only new US military aircraft likely to be procured this decade and the work building 100 aircraft will produce substantial revenue for the winner — competition will remain intense.There is a strong possibility that the losing bidder will mount a challenge after the decision is announced, probably in July.The decision will also have far more than commercial consequences. As the continued role of the B52 makes clear, the choice of long-range bomber could affect the US’s military capabilities for at least the remainder of this century.
104;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-06-09T14:07:55Z;Berlin opts for Lockheed Martin air defence missile;Meads system likely to cost Germany €4bn;"Germany plans to buy its new multibillion-euro missile defence system from Lockheed Martin, a procurement decision that is likely to influence other nations’ plans to protect their airspace.The defence ministry opted against updating its Patriot system, which is manufactured by Raytheon and which will be out of date by 2025.Exclusive contract negotiations will take place over the next 12 months between Berlin and the Lockheed-led consortium that is developing the medium extended air defence system — known as Meads. The price tag is about €4bn.Germany is the first customer for the new truck-mounted missile system, which has been developed with the European missile maker MBDA, which has employees in GermanyThe decision could see Meads batteries deployed in the country before the end of 2019, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.The two US defence companies have fought to secure the deal in Germany and a similar one in Poland, seeing the two neighbouring Nato member states as key trendsetters for other interested customers.Warsaw has said it would prefer to acquire the Raytheon system, but no deal has been signed yet.Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s defence minister, stressed that Berlin was seeking to collaborate with other Nato and EU states over the missile system.She said: “We are ready to take up our responsibility and we are not alone. We are procuring an open system, to which other nations — which are awaiting our decision — can affiliate themselves.”The minister said the decision to opt for Lockheed was conditional. The German government intends to lay out clear milestones for the company when it negotiates the contract, and will reserve the right to seek another solution if these targets are not reached, Ms von der Leyen said.However, Bernd Kubbig, an analyst at the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt, a defence think-tank, warned that Meads could prove costly for Germany after the US decided to withdraw.The Pentagon contributed to development costs but decided against buying the product at a time when the US was focused on the threat from insurgents who lacked air power.Mr Kubbig said: “A country cannot single-handedly bear the costs of Meads, and keep them at a reasonable level. It is therefore not suitable as a basis for German air and missile defence.”Demand for missile defence systems is growing following Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and Germany’s choice of Lockheed’s system may sway other states to follow suit. Lockheed estimates the global market for Meads could be worth as much as $100bn in the next 15 years.Thomas Homberg, managing director of MBDA Deutschland, welcomed the decision, saying Germany had opted for a “powerful, state-of-the-art” system.Berlin ultimately favoured the Lockheed system owing to its 360-degree radar functionality, which the current Patriot lacks, and promises that Germany would retain the ownership rights over the software used in the system, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations.Florian Hahn, a German legislator and defence expert for the Christian Social Union, part of Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc, said: “I welcome the decision to go for Meads. It is the more modern and better technology. It means the crucial technology will be German and European. And the costs will be lower; to provide 360-degree cover requires two to three Patriot systems but just one Meads [system].”Rainer Arnold, parliamentary defence spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrats, junior partners in the ruling coalition, said a further advantage of Meads was that its technology is designed to be usable in tandem with systems made by other manufacturers, improving the prospects for co-operation with Nato partners.Mr Arnold said: “Our international partners have all been waiting for this decision.”The decision was first reported by the Süddeutsche Zeitung."
105;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-05-08T13:40:14Z;Airship developers dare to return to the skies;Specialist cargo applications identified as area of commercial potential;In a hangar at Cardington airfield, on the outskirts of Bedford, a team of British engineers tests the engines of what they hope will be the first of a new generation of airships.Many attempts have been made to revive the airship after it fell from favour in a series of accidents in the 1930s including the Hindenburg disaster but most have failed. Some industry experts are sceptical they have a role in modern aerospace.But Hybrid Air Vehicles of the UK is one of several companies betting that airships have significant commercial uses, most notably in cargo transport— by harnessing new technology.HAV has designed the 300ft Airlander 10, which is part airship and part hovercraft, and is a far cry from the cigar-shaped vehicle pioneered by Ferdinand von Zeppelin and used in the first world war.The body of the Airlander 10 is designed to generate lift, and a mixture of non-flammable helium and air provides buoyancy. The airship, which is powered by four engines that swivel to help it manoeuvre, does not need a ground crew to tether it down. It can also be fitted with hover cushions that allow take-off and landing almost anywhere.“We believe the hybrid air vehicle will become a mainstream aerospace product,” says Stephen McGlennan, chief executive of HAV. “In the past no one really found a way to make airships a practical and economic product for people that buy aircraft.”Mr McGlennan admits airships are unlikely to rival conventional aircraft or trains for passenger services but insists there are applications elsewhere.The most obvious is moving cargo, particularly objects that are too bulky to go by air freighter but need to be delivered quicker than by sea. A capability to remain airborne for weeks at a time could also make them suitable for military surveillance operations.HAV, a privately owned company founded in 2007, expects to start test flights in the first quarter of next year and is about to finish a £2m crowdfunding campaign to add to the £12m it needs to finish the airship. About half of this amount has already been raised through UK government grants and European funding.The Airlander 10 needs to clock up 200 hours of flying to secure regulatory approval, and HAV will then switch to trials with potential customers, among them Ocean Sky, a Swedish-backed group, to move wind turbine blades.HAV plans to sell the Airlander 10 for about $40m — a price similar to a large private jet or helicopter. Mr McGlennan says a hybrid airship can carry heavier payloads for a longer period and at a lower fuel cost than conventional aircraft. While its first model would carry 10-tonne payloads, HAV’s technology could allow it to build bigger airships capable of carrying up to 1,000 tonnes, he adds.HAV is not the only company working on a hybrid airship. Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence group, has been developing a cargo airship for more than a decade and expects it could be operational by 2018.“We believe our hybrid airships will offer large-capacity transportation capability with significant fuel economy and reduced operating costs,” says Lockheed Martin.Gregory Gottlieb of the Airship Association says airships are a good option for the environment and do not need large airports.But with speeds of up to 100 miles per hour, he agrees they cannot compete with jet aircraft. “They will never replace planes because they just don’t go fast enough,” says Mr Gottlieb.Among companies that failed to get their airships off the ground as commercial ventures is Advanced Technologies Group, the predecessor to HAV. ATG ran out of money and went into administration in 2005 having produced only one airship, the SkyCat.HAV was formed after acquiring the assets of SkyCat Group in 2007, which had previously bought ATG’s operations.Some transport experts believe airships are likely to remain a very niche area. “You can come up with these lovely ideas, and then there’s a deafening hush from the marketplace,” says David Learmount, consulting editor at Flightglobal, an aviation magazine.Mr Learmount argues that drones would be more useful than airships for surveillance purposes. “They [airships] are slow and vulnerable to bad weather,” he says. “New technology has no answers to bad weather.”
106;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-04-21T13:38:02Z;Cuts in military spending hit Lockheed Martin;Net income falls 5.9% amid budget cuts and troop withdrawals in Afghanistan and Iraq;Waning US military spending hit Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, in the first quarter as declining maintenance work and lower aircraft deliveries helped drive net income down 5.9 per cent and net sales down 5 per cent.The declines were most marked in the core aeronautics business, where operating profit fell 6 per cent to $371m, on sales down 7 per cent to $3.13bn. The declines reflected both lower deliveries of the C130, C5 and F16 aircraft and lower “sustainment activities” — maintenance and repair-related work — which is higher when aircraft are on operational duty.However, net income — $878m or $2.74 per share, on $10.1bn sales — exceeded analysts’ expectations of $2.50 per share and the company marginally raised expectations for full-year earnings. The forecast went up from a range of $10.80 to $11.10 per share to a $10.85 to $11.15 range.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the company continued to deliver “solid performance” for its customers and “strong results” for its shareholders.“We remain focused on successfully competing in the global marketplace and delivering industry-leading affordable products and technologies to our customers,” she said.Like other big US military contractors, Lockheed Martin has faced a mixture of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration and the longer term decline in military spending as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have wound down. The cuts were quickest to hit relatively short lead-time items such as the companies’ services businesses.The effects have been far slower to feed through to longer term items such as Lockheed’s F35 fighter programme, the world’s biggest military procurement project. Net sales for F35 production — part of the aeronautics division — were $175m up on last year’s first quarter, thanks to increased production volumes, while operating profits from production of the aircraft rose $25m.$371mDeclines most marked in core aeronautics business, where operating profit fell 6% to $371mOperating profits at the Information Systems and Global Solutions division fell 22 per cent to $136m on sales down 2 per cent to $1.87bn. The company attributed the profit decline to the $70m cost of “performance matters on an international programme”.In Missile Systems and Fire Control, operating profit fell 18 per cent to $292m on sales down 15 per cent to $1.5bn. The declines reflected fewer deliveries of missiles, such as the company’s Hellfire missile system, and fire control systems.The only segment to enjoy an increase was Space Systems, where operating profits grew 13 per cent to $288m on sales up 5 per cent to $1.95bn. The company attributed the increases to $105m in higher sales for the Orion programme— the construction of a new space ship for future crewed missions to Mars and other distant objects.The company also gained a further $90m net sales from acquisitions in Space Systems, while there was a $75m decline in net sales for government satellite contracts. US government satellite business is expected to decline in the next few years as work to replace ageing satellites runs out.
107;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-04-16T21:45:46Z;US military risks new monopoly for rocket launches;Phasing out Russian engines will lead to reliance on Elon Musk’s SpaceX;The US military risks relying entirely on Elon Musk’s SpaceX for military launches, swapping “one monopoly situation for another” if there are no changes to a new law on the use of Russian rocket engines, the US air force secretary has warned.Deborah Lee James was speaking to reporters at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, which has been dominated by questions about the security of the US’s access to space because of upheavals in the space launch market.Among the many issues has been the interpretation of a budget law passed by Congress dictating how many Russian rocket engines United Launch Alliance, the current monopoly provider, can use before switching to a US-built engine. ULA uses Russian RD180 rocket engines in its workhorse Atlas V launcher but is trying to develop an alternative.The assumption when the law was passed was that it permitted ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to use 29 RD180s after its current five-year contract with the US government expires in 2018. However, defence department officials have interpreted the language as saying it can use only a further five beyond 2018.The new interpretation would force ULA to retire the Atlas V rocket some time in 2018 or 2019, well before it can certify its new Vulcan rocket for military launches in around 2023.Ms James said she would welcome a “clarification” of the law.“We want to have two or more providers compete for future space launches,” Ms James said. “This is a step back.”There would not be a fully-developed new rocket from ULA ready by 2019, Ms James said. That would leave SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket — which is due to gain certification for national security launches by June this year — as the sole option to take many satellites to space.We want to have two or more providers compete for future space launches. This is a step back“What we may be doing is trading one monopoly situation for another,” Ms James said. “So we do need clarification on what exactly is required.”The potential rocket engine issues are among a series of dilemmas that face the US military as it seeks to introduce competition into satellite launches. The military also wants open competition between SpaceX and ULA while ensuring that both parties win enough work to remain in the market.Gen John Hyten, head of the US air force’s space command, told the Financial Times after Ms James’ briefing that the military intended to move to a “pure competitive environment” for launches. However, in some areas — particularly the launching of very large satellites — there might not be enough work to keep two providers in business.In those cases, the military might have to specify a single provider for all launches to ensure the US enjoyed assured access to space.“We’re going to have to work closely with congress and business partners to make sure that exists,” Gen Hyten said.
108;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-04-15T06:13:46Z;SpaceX shoots down rival United Launch Alliance’s prospects;ULA dismissed as being far from a ‘real commercial provider’;SpaceX, Elon Musk’s fast-growing US space launch provider, has dismissed plans by its main rival to revamp to handle growing competition, saying United Launch Alliance remains far from being a “real commercial provider”.Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, was speaking after ULA on Monday revealed plans for a overhauled launch system known as Vulcan.ULA, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture that handles all US national security rocket launches, said the new system would enable it to cut launch costs. It also said it would achieve the groundbreaking capability to use successive launches of parts of a vast spacecraft then assemble the parts in orbit.However, Ms Shotwell dismissed her rival’s claims. “I don’t know why they think they have an edge,” she said of the capabilities the new craft would provide. “I think we’re already better.”Ms Shotwell was speaking to the Financial Times on the sidelines of the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, had earlier expressed concern at the symposium about the financial effects of a looming decline in US military satellite launches.SpaceX expects later this year to become the only ULA competitor certified to launch US military satellites, with the two poised to compete for all national security launches starting in 2019.However, Ms Shotwell said SpaceX could accommodate a dip in government business because it had “lots of room” in other sectors it served, while ULA depended almost entirely on government revenue.Mr Bruno said this week that the Vulcan’s average launch cost should be below $100m and that it would compete for commercial business. SpaceX offers some launches of its Falcon 9 rocket for as little as $60m.“They have lots of strategising to do on how they’re going to turn themselves into a real commercial provider,” Ms Shotwell said of ULA.SpaceX on Tuesday successfully launched its latest mission to the International Space Station for Nasa, the US space agency. However, it failed in an effort to recover one of the rocket’s boosters, which crashed on to an autonomous barge.ULA’s supporters argue that its excellent reliability justifies its higher costs. The company has undertaken 95 launches since being formed in 2006 and suffered only one partial failure, when a satellite was put into an excessively low orbit. The orbit was later successfully corrected.However, Ms Shotwell insisted that SpaceX’s record with the Falcon 9 — 17 successful launches, after Tuesday’s flight — was better than ULA’s. SpaceX lost a customer’s satellite in 2012 but completed that flight’s main mission, to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.“We have focused on reliability from the beginning,” Ms Shotwell said. “We think we have a very reliable vehicle architecture.”Ms Shotwell said SpaceX’s record and technology would enable it to become the most powerful operator in fields far beyond serving the US military.“We will become the dominant provider of space launch,” she said.
109;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
110;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-04-14T22:43:18Z;Space competition at risk if rocket crashes, general warns;Future system for launching US military satellites could founder;The future system for launching US military satellites could founder if a rocket belonging to one of the two likely providers blows up, the US Air Force’s most senior space commander said on Tuesday in a rare warning about competition’s pitfalls.General John Hyten was speaking as Elon Musk’s SpaceX, one of the two companies set to handle future military satellite launches, proved the inherent difficulty of space operations when it failed with its latest attempt to capture a rocket booster for reuse.The future US military market is likely to be split between SpaceX, with its Falcon rocket systems, and United Launch Alliance, which is developing a new rocket known as Vulcan. ULA — a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin — currently holds a monopoly on national security launches. But it is required to maintain two separate systems — Atlas and Delta — to ensure that, if one suffers a crash, the other can handle launches until the problem is resolved.Under current plans, SpaceX — which is likely to receive permission to carry military satellites later this year — and ULA will compete for all national security launches from 2019 onwards.However, Gen Hyten, commander of the US Air Force’s space command, said he had received no answers as to what might happen if one of the providers suffered a crash like the 1986 Challenger space shuttle disaster.“We stood down the rocket for a period of time — one year, two-and-a-half years, whatever it took to figure out the root cause of that,” Gen Hyten said of the aftermath of previous crashes.Many of the US’s military satellites gave the country critical capabilities and cost more than $1bn to build, Gen Hyten said.I’m not going to stand up and put a $1bn satellite on top of a rocket I don’t know is going to work“I’m not going to stand up and put a $1bn satellite on top of a rocket I don’t know is going to work,” he said.However, there were still no answers as to how one of the launch providers would survive if its single launch system was forced out of action.“If [an accident] happens to this company that’s on this very busy launch environment, how do they stay in business without launching?” the general asked.He made his remarks at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. The event has been dominated by issues surrounding the growing competition to provide national security launches and fallout from the decision to end the Atlas launch system’s reliance on the Russian-made RD180 rocket engine.SpaceX was trying on Tuesday for the second time to capture for reuse a booster returned to earth after flight. A previous attempt failed when a rocket hit a corner of the unmanned drone barge and broke up.Mr Musk wrote on Twitter that the rocket’s take-off had been successful and it was carrying its Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station.But he went on: “Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.”
111;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-04-14T08:52:20Z;Fighter jets deal signals Indian procurement shift;Direct purchase from France ‘breaks vortex’ of commercial talks with Dassault, says New Delhi;New Delhi’s decision to buy 36 “ready-to-fly” Rafale fighter jets from France has in effect ended commercial negotiations on the purchase of 126 aircraft direct from Dassault Aviation, India’s defence minister has said.Any future orders are also likely to come via the inter-governmental route after talks on the larger deal, potentially worth $20bn, became deadlocked over issues of technology transfer and price, said Manohar Parrikar.“This had to be done to break the vortex,” Mr Parrikar said of the government-to-government deal. “Instead of going through the request-for-bidding process, where there is a lot of confusion and chaos, it is now the situation that 36 will be procured, ready to fly.”Mr Parrikar did not declare an explicit end to the negotiations for the bigger deal but said any more orders would be placed direct with Paris rather than through talks with Dassault.“What is to be done with the rest will have to be discussed,” he said.New Delhi stunned the global aerospace industry on Friday when it announced it had asked France to provide the 36 jets in an inter-governmental deal thought to be worth about $4bn.The decision was a twist in the decade-long process to procure a new fleet of fighter jets through competitive bidding. The process specified that the selected foreign partner transfer technology to India’s state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which would produce many of the aircraft in India.In 2012 Dassault emerged as the low-cost bidder in the procurement contest, in which BAE Systems and its Eurofighter Typhoon consortium, Boeing and Lockheed Martin participated.However, negotiations stalled over Dassault’s reluctance to guarantee that aircraft made by HAL, a notoriously inefficient state enterprise that a former US ambassador once described as an “untested and suspect” potential partner for an advanced weapons system.New Delhi’s decision to buy just two squadrons made entirely in France — advocated by an increasingly impatient Indian air force — has been vociferously criticised by defence experts.Ajai Shukla, a strategic analyst, wrote in the Business Standard on Tuesday that the decision was a “knockout victory for Dassault” that would weaken India’s position in subsequent talks with defence suppliers.Analysts say the deal appears to undermine fatally the ambition of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, to develop an indigenous aerospace manufacturing capacity.Bharat Karnad, a strategist with New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said the a decision to order two squadrons direct from France was a “regression” that appeared to take New Delhi “back to the ad hoc procurement policies that ended up making India the largest arms importer in the world”.However, the new order is not yet complete. Mr Modi said officials would begin negotiations on the final details soon.
112;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-03-17T23:00:37Z;SpaceX mocks rival in tetchy congressional hearing;Space group estimates it can provide launches far cheaper than rival United Launch Alliance;A senior executive of SpaceX, the space launch provider, has mocked the company in charge of the US’s most sensitive satellite launches, in a tetchy congressional hearing dominated by fears about US access to space.Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, was appearing before a subcommittee of the US House’s armed services select committee alongside Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance.The two made a number of pointed comments about each other before Ms Shotwell responded sarcastically when asked why SpaceX thought it could provide launches to the US government for an average $100m. SpaceX claims ULA’s launches cost US taxpayers an average of $400m each.Ms Shotwell was asked why the company claimed to be able to offer its services for 25 per cent of the ULA price.“It’s hard for me to say,” Ms Shotwell replied. “I don’t know how to build a $400m rocket. The more difficult question would be to say that I don’t understand how ULA are as expensive as they are.”Ms Shotwell’s comments were the latest of several incidents of public sniping between SpaceX and ULA over their respective roles in the US’s national security launch programme. SpaceX has regularly insinuated that the air force’s closeness to ULA — which handles all sensitive military satellite launches — has made officials drag their feet over certifying SpaceX to handle some of the launches.The two companies are now critical, however, to the US’s ability to fulfil the legal requirement that it have two separate launch systems suited to all its needs.ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, intends to keep operating its Atlas V rocket, capable of lifting all but the heaviest payloads, while SpaceX expects to receive certification by June that its Falcon 9 rocket is safe enough to carry military satellites to space. It also expects later this year to fly for the first time the Falcon Heavy rocket capable of carrying the very heaviest payloads to space.ULA had previously maintained a separate, expensive-to-operate launch system — known as Delta — to ensure the US could reach space even if a fault emerged with Atlas V. It now intends to stop operating that rocket.The situation is further complicated by another legal requirement, that ULA does not buy any more of the Russian RD180 motors that power the Atlas V and instead develop a purely US-built alternative.Ms Shotwell said that launches of the Falcon 9 would cost the air force between $80m and $90m, while launches of the Falcon Heavy would cost between $150m and $160m.Mr Bruno, who was appointed last year partly to bring down ULA’s costs, angrily denied that its launches cost as much as $400m, saying each averaged $164m and he was seeking to bring many down to $100m.The hearing heard that, even with a series of new developments under way, there was likely to be a “multiyear” gap when the US lacked two independent systems for launching satellites.
113;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-03-03T17:15:40Z;Lockheed and Raytheon face off over European missile deals;Defence groups compete for high-stakes German and Polish contracts;"Two of the world’s biggest defence companies are battling over bids to protect the skies of Germany and Poland, in high-stakes competitions seen as the gateway to a $100bn global market.Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are hoping to win almost €8bn of contracts to supply aircraft and missile defence systems to Germany and Poland, as Berlin and Warsaw prepare to make decisions that will have profound implications for Europe’s security and both US companies’ products.Demand for missile defence systems is growing because of concerns over the threats posed by North Korea, Iran and Russia, as well as by insurgent groups. The system choices made by Germany and Poland — Berlin’s order could be placed as soon as this month — have taken on greater significance following Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine last year and growing incursions by Russian military aircraft into airspace controlled by Nato member countries.Germany is evaluating whether to buy Lockheed’s new medium extended air defence system — dubbed Meads — or to opt for a planned update to Raytheon’s Patriot product. Its decision likely to influence thinking in Poland, a neighbour, close defence partner and key Nato ally.Patriot is Raytheon’s best known product; it was deployed with mixed success to guard Israel and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf war.Loren Thomson, analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute says: ““Patriot is Raytheon’s premier calling card in the global arms market and if Lockheed now cuts into that franchise, it would significantly reshape the competitive landscape.”When Germany makes a decision, it launches the global franchise. It kicks off the much needed modernisation of global air and missile defenceLockheed is hoping Germany and Poland will be the first customers for Meads, in what the company estimates could be a market worth as much as $100bn over the next 15 years. More more than 30 countries are seen as likely to invest in new or upgraded missile defence systems over this period.“When Germany makes a decision, it launches the global franchise,” says Marty Coyne, director of business development at Lockheed’s missile defence business. “It kicks off the much needed modernisation of global air and missile defence.”These contracts in Germany and Poland are also important to Lockheed and Raytheon because they represent significant opportunities for international expansion that will reduce their dependence on declining US military spending. The companies’ missile-related divisions are large — Raytheon’s generated 27 per cent of group revenue last year, while Lockheed’s contributed 17 per cent.Lockheed’s Meads system is designed to be able to counter airborne attacks coming from any part of the sky — while the current Patriot system has a much more limited field of coverage.However, Patriot, designed in the 1970s, is the global benchmark in medium range air defence, and Mr Thompson says the appeal of an upgraded system is that many of the refinements included on Meads may be available from Raytheon at a lower cost.Moreover, even though the US military paid 58 per cent of the $3.4bn cost of developing Lockheed’s system, it decided not to press ahead with buying the product. This reflected how, at the time, the US was preoccupied with fighting insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan who lacked any kind of air power.Raytheon says the US decision not to purchase the Lockheed system means any potential customers would be taking the risk of buying a product that is not yet operational.I think once Germany decides on [Meads], there will be partners who will favour it. I have the impression that once Germany decides, there is a chance that Poland will rethinkLockheed cautions that the planned modernisation of the Patriot system would probably need the best part of a decade to develop and then a few additional years after that to deploy, while Meads could be on the ground four years after selection.Germany’s pending decision to buy an air and missile defence system is the most expensive item in the in-tray of German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, with a price tag of about €3.5bn.Germany contributed 25 per cent of the development funding for Lockheed’s system, but Berlin officials insist this will not be the most important factor in whether to purchase Meads or Patriot.Instead, the officials say the decision will be made chiefly on the operational merits of the two systems, with Berlin also taking account of its allies’ needs. Securing German jobs will be another factor — the Lockheed product has been co-developed with the German business of MBDA, the European missile company.Rainer Arnold, parliamentary defence spokesman for Germany’s Social Democrat party, the junior partner in the country’s ruling coalition government, says that while neither missile system is “without risk”, he favours the Lockheed product.Berlin has discussed its missile plans with Warsaw in “broad terms”, and is following Poland’s shifting stance on Lockheed’s system, according to people close to the situation.Last April, Poland held discussions with four defence companies offering systems for its €4bn missile defence tender, including Lockheed and Raytheon.In June, Warsaw unexpectedly announced it was tweaking its requirements to include the need for its chosen system to be already used by a Nato member state — thus excluding Meads — and said the country would choose between Patriot and Eurosam, an alternative part-developed by France’s Thales.Analysts say Raytheon’s product is perceived frontrunner in Poland’s competition, but Lockheed argues that if Germany were to choose its system, it could then be deemed to meet Warsaw’s new requirement.Mr Arnold says: “I think once Germany decides on [Meads], there will be partners who will favour it. I have the impression that once Germany decides, there is a chance that Poland will rethink.”Gulf demand stays robust as security threats growDemand for military hardware remains strong in the high-spending Gulf states despite an oil price plunge that has slashed governments’ revenues, according to Raytheon, writes Simeon Kerr in Abu Dhabi.Gulf states led by regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia are under pressure to reduce spending after an almost 50 per cent fall in crude prices since last summer.But John Harris, head of Raytheon’s international business, said: “We haven’t seen any slowdown of business.” About 30 per cent of Raytheon’s revenue comes from non-US customers, and Mr Harris said this segment was growing.Gulf states — led by Saudi Arabia but also including Kuwait and Oman — are facing rising security threats from insurgent groups in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya.The Sunni Arab Gulf states are at loggerheads with Iran over Tehran’s influence over Shia groups across the Middle East.Mr Harris was speaking at last month’s Abu Dhabi’s arms fair, which takes place every two years, where the United Arab Emirates placed Dh18.3bn of military orders, 29 per cent more than in 2013.The UAE is increasingly assertive in its overseas military interventions, including launching air strikes in Libya and Syria, as Abu Dhabi pursues Islamist extremist groups across the Middle East.Against this backdrop, the UAE is developing a domestic arms industry to diversify its oil-based economy and reduce reliance on overseas defence companies for its increasingly sophisticated military.Raytheon last month agreed to work with UAE manufacturers to fit laser-guided rockets to military vehicles produced in Abu Dhabi. Mr Harris said these joint venture arrangements are increasingly important for companies such as Raytheon."
114;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-02-27T00:24:56Z;US group criticises race to built new rocket engine;Senate hearing sparks caution from CEO over rushed schedule for alternative to Russian engine;The head of the company that handles the US’s most sensitive satellite launches has warned of the risks surrounding senators’ “aggressive schedule” to develop a new, US-built rocket engine, amid concerns the US may lose reliable access to space.Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, took to Twitter on Thursday after a Senate hearing on Wednesday concerning the US air force’s latest budget bill. The hearing had debated the timetable for developing a new, US-built alternative to the Russian RD180 rocket engine, which powers the Atlas V rocket that handles many launches of US spy and other military satellites.The Senate last year passed — over protests from ULA and the US military — a law preventing the US military from either renewing or signing a new contract for satellite launches with any company using Russian-designed or manufactured rocket engines.The law would prevent ULA from further buying RD180 engines beyond the 29 it already has in store or on order. ULA subsequently signed an agreement with Blue Origin — a Seattle-based engine maker founded by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon entrepreneur — to design a new, methane-powered engine.However, Mr Bruno warned that the limited number of Russian engines it could use and the challenges of developing a new engine posed significant risks. Even once it first flies, any new engine will need years of testing before it achieves certification to carry sensitive national security payloads into orbit. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.“Developing an American engine by 2019, cert[ification] in 2022-23, is an aggressive schedule,” Mr Bruno wrote. “The existing law leaves us no flexibility.”In response to questions about whether the programme could be sped up, Mr Bruno wrote: “No, we cannot realistically accelerate certification to 2019. 2022-23 already has risk.”ULA is the only company cleared to handle the launches of the most sensitive satellites, although Elon Musk’s SpaceX is seeking certification. If a new engine fails to achieve certification before the Russian engines run out, the US could face significant problems launching the biggest satellites.As well as signing the agreement in September with Blue Origin to develop its BE4 engine, ULA is paying Aerojet Rocketdyne, the US’s leading rocket engine specialist, to develop a second, back-up engine, the AR1. Mr Bruno wrote that the engine was likely to take a year or two longer, although Aerojet Rocketdyne insisted it could have its product ready by 2019.“Our AR1 engine development programme remains on track to meet the 2019 delivery date prescribed by Congress last year,” the company said.Mr Bruno wrote that the company would need at least the 29 engines it holds to cover launches up until BE4’s scheduled certification. It would need more if it had to fall back on the AR1.There has been intense concern in the US about its reliance on the RD180 since last May, when Russia said it would withhold future supplies of the engine unless the US could certify they would not be used for military purposes.
115;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2015-02-24T08:51:17Z;India’s $250bn arms shopping list tempts wary investors;PM Modi’s ‘Make in India’ strategy fires up country’s defence groups;Veteran Indian industrialist Baba Kalyani is not given to flights of investment fancy — he calls his Bharat Forge group a “hardcore manufacturing company” — but even he does not hide his enthusiasm for the opportunities in the country’s defence sector under the Narendra Modi government and its “Make in India” strategy.“We have decided to set up this year four manufacturing plants to make defence equipment,” Mr Kalyani said at the Aero India defence and aerospace show in Bangalore last week. “We are now beginning to see huge traction in terms of business.”Bharat Forge — an automotive group whose four new plants will make anti-tank missiles in a joint venture with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems of Israel, as well as artillery, armoured vehicles and aerospace components — is only one of the big Indian conglomerates and international defence companies seeking a share of the country’s $250bn of expected arms orders over the next decade.Mr Modi says he plans a “new era for the defence industry in India”, and has put private arms manufacturers at the heart of his project to make India into an industrial power.His ambitious aim of raising domestic arms procurement from 40 to 70 per cent of the total within five years and creating more than 100,000 skilled jobs in the sector has galvanised Indian groups with existing defence interests such as Bharat Forge, Tata, Larsen & Toubro and Mahindra — and attracted new entrants such as Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group and possibly the Hinduja Group of the UK.The domestic arms industry has long been dominated by inefficient state companies, including Hindustan Aeronautics, and India has become the world’s largest arms importer by buying or assembling weapons from international groups such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and Russia’s state weapons manufacturers.At the same time, procurement of equipment from fighter aircraft to helicopters and howitzers has been delayed for years — sometimes decades — to the frustration of India’s military chiefs and foreign suppliers. France’s Dassault is still awaiting a decision on its tentative $20bn deal to provide 126 Rafale jets for the Indian Air Force.Mr Ambani told an audience at the Bangalore air show that his company was moving into defence “in a big way”, and quoted Mr Modi as having complained to him that India did not even make its own tear gas for the security forces.Reliance executives say the group can provide infrastructure, project management and capital to joint ventures and is aiming to bid in conjunction with foreign equipment makers for contracts to supply hundreds of naval, army and air force helicopters as well as submarines.“India is one of the few countries in the world where defence spending is increasing year-on-year,” says Rajesh Dhingra, the former Lockheed India chief who is heading Reliance’s fledgling defence operations.For high-tech foreign suppliers, however, the Modi makeover of the Indian defence market could be a mixed blessing.On the one hand, arms acquisitions are likely to be accelerated and procurement policies changed in favour of the private sector, whether foreign or Indian. Mr Modi has criticised Indian state companies, and has raised the foreign direct investment limit in defence projects from 26 to 49 per cent — or even 100 per cent if advanced technology is transferred to India.Will a foreign defence company be willing to partner with an Indian company and transfer technology when they are not really in majority control? . . . We have to see how the foreign defence companies respondOn the other hand, international weapons manufacturers remain wary of further delays and of risking their intellectual property if they make high-technology products in India, in spite of reassurances from the government in New Delhi.“It’s obviously something that holds promise,” says Neelkanth Mishra, India equity strategist for Credit Suisse. “But will a foreign defence company be willing to partner with an Indian company and transfer technology when they are not really in majority control? . . . We have to see how the foreign defence companies respond.”While Indian companies are eager to capitalise on Mr Modi’s desire to make more defence equipment at home, only a few have the necessary technical expertise.“India has been the top arms buyer for the past three years, and Indian companies are looking for foreign partners,” said a European official at the Aero India show. “[But] 49 per cent is not seen as enough to protect intellectual property rights.”
116;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed aims to slash cost of F35 jets;30% cut could save US and its allies billions of dollars in procurement budgets;Lockheed Martin is on track to slash 30 per cent from the cost of each F-35 joint strike fighter, bringing the price of the controversial aircraft below that of previous, less capable generations of fighters, Marillyn Hewson, the company’s chief executive, said on Wednesday.The reduction would bring the cost of each F-35A — the version for the US air force — down to less than $80m from between $110m and $115m each. Such a saving could save billions of dollars in procurement costs for the programme, currently estimated at $396bn for more than 3,000 aircraft for the US and key allies.A sharp fall in the programme’s costs would vindicate the US defence department’s highly controversial decision to procure a single aircraft for the strike fighter needs of the US air force, marine corps and navy. The programme — by far the biggest single military procurement project in history — came close to cancellation in 2011 amid severe cost and time overruns and questions about whether the aircraft would ever be able to fulfil its multiple different roles.The Pentagon last year signed a “blueprint for affordability” agreement with Lockheed, under which both the government and Lockheed committed to invest in new cost savings for the programme.“The goal is to reduce the cost of an F-35A fifth-generation fighter to the equivalent of today’s fourth-generation fighter,” Ms Hewson said of the affordability programme at a media day in Arlington, Virginia. “We’re confident we’ll get there by the end of the decade.”Ms Hewson said that 80 per cent of the cost reductions would come from economies of scale as the factory making the aircraft in Fort Worth, Texas, moves into full production. The company manufactured only 36 aircraft last year but is due to be producing more than 100 annually — around half of them for international buyers — by the end of this decade.The goal is to reduce the cost of an F-35A fifth-generation fighter to the equivalent of today’s fourth-generation fighterHowever, it is also seeking cost savings through introducing new manufacturing methods for critical parts such as the transparent cockpit canopy and the leading wing edges. It has achieved significant savings through reducing the amount of aluminium it buys for some parts.The US government realises savings by negotiating prices for individual packages of aircraft with Lockheed.“We have an ongoing dialogue with our customer through every negotiation and we have a good exchange of information,” Ms Hewson said.Government auditors and other observers have regularly raised doubts that the aircraft might not meet the goals set for it. The aircraft is intended to be far more stealthy than previous generations of fighters, meaning it should be able to attack enemy aircraft before they have even detected its presence. The auditor’s reports have questioned whether the stealth characteristics would work as intended.Lockheed had to call off a planned inaugural trip to Europe for last year’s Farnborough air show after an engine fire led to a temporary grounding of the whole fleet.Ms Hewson said the company was “focused on performance” and meeting the targets set for the aircraft.The most recent auditors’ reports on the aircraft showed that there were “no new issues” with the programme, Ms Hewson insisted.“There are no showstoppers,” she said.
117;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-11-03T16:41:55Z;Rotorcraft industry plans for an easier ride;Upcoming projects aim at maximising existing technologies rather than radically new concepts;“Eggbeaters” is one of the harsher terms used for helicopters by some pilots of fixed-wing aircraft. And a surprisingly common phrase used for what happens when a helicopter crashes is that it “beats itself to death”.The path to making rotorcraft vibrate less – therefore giving both occupants and components an easier time – has many different routes.Airbus Helicopters has decided to adopt a route to future, faster rotorcraft that is interesting partly because of the technological routes it has decided not to follow.In my last column, I described the larger successor to the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that is being developed by Bell Helicopter along with Lockheed Martin and a clutch of other specialist companies. The V-280 Valor is in contention for a US military programme, designed to fly twice as fast as the helicopters it could replace. But the technology would easily transfer to the civil market, especially with the volumes that the intended military application would entail.Airbus Helicopters first flew its X3 model in 2010 to gain proof that speeds similar to the Osprey’s 275 knots could be achieved without the complexity of having to tilt engines or rotors. It is now retired, resting in the Musée de l’Air in Paris after setting a speed record of 255 knots. Based closely on an existing helicopter, the AS365 Dauphin, it had a main rotor plus two forward-facing propellers on the end of stubby wings to pull it through the air as well as provide the anti-torque thrust of a tail rotor on a conventional helicopter – which an aircraft with a powered main rotor needs if its body is not to end up spinning in the opposite direction to the rotor.This compound rotorcraft’s technological cudgels have been taken up at Airbus by the awkwardly named LifeRCraft, which stands for low-impact fast and efficient rotorcraft.Launched in the summer, the project is to build a large-scale compound rotorcraft that will have fixed wings for lift generated by forward motion, open propellers to push it along, and a powered main rotor for vertical take-off and landing capability.While the final design is still up in the air, the aircraft will be bigger than the X3’s 5.2 tonnes, at something like 7-8 tonnes take-off weight.Tomasz Krysinski, Airbus Helicopters’ vice-president for research and innovation, is confident about the numbers that the concept demonstrator will bring in. “We will fly 50 per cent quicker than a conventional helicopter with a reduction of 12-15 per cent in fuel consumption per kilometre and kilogramme transported. That also gives an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions.”To obtain this, there will be a focus on mass reduction, with an “extensive use of composites”, so more of that take-off weight will be available for payload.The main rotor will not only have blades optimised for noise but also the ability to rotate slower when it is not required to generate all the lift or when noise reduction requirements are important – such as approaching to land or in cruise flight.At speed, the wings will provide “40-50 per cent of lift”, which unloads the main rotor. “When we unload the rotor the drag goes drastically down,” he points out. That means there is more power available to go towards pushing the aircraft forwards.And a slowed, unloaded main rotor means there are no problems with supersonic blade tip speeds or retreating blade stall – two apparently esoteric but highly important factors that limit the speed of conventional helicopters. That also means less frenetic vibration.The target speed is realistic, says Mr Krysinski. “On a cost-efficiency formula, we consider that 220 knots is the optimum – more than that uses much more fuel,” he says.That reflects the overall goals of “simplicity and cost-efficiency for the customer”, which is also reflected in how simple it is to operate. “During X3 demonstrations there were many pilots flying the aircraft and after, say, 15 minutes of training with our pilots they were very, very comfortable. It’s a formula that’s very easy to handle,” says Mr Krysinski.This is not the Airbus group’s only interest in speed. It recently announced an engineering link-up with Aerion, the Nevada-based company that has been working on a design for a supersonic business jet for 12 years, that should help propel Aerion’s $100m-plus, 12-passenger AS2 aircraft towards production and delivery in 2021.The LifeRCraft is also interesting for what has not been pursued. One example is electric drive to propellers or main rotor – an idea pursued in the past by Eurocopter. Mr Krysinski points out that the power requirements are too big for the current state of technology.Airbus Helicopters is looking at a first flight of the LifeRCraft as early as 2019. And a number of industry experts and analysts point out the use of existing rather than radically new technology, along with the claimed efficiency and economy gains over conventional helicopters, would make it a very compelling proposition for uses such as supplying oil and gas rigs, emergency medical airlift and city shuttles – not to mention possible military uses.And if the aircraft can provide just a bit more smoothness at speed, perhaps the term “eggbeater” will be banished to the history books completely.
118;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed Martin given $127m boost by pension changes;Net sales in 2015 expected to decline at a ‘low single-digit rate’;A $127m boost from a change in pensions accounting masked the continued impact on Lockheed Martin of falling US military spending, helping third-quarter net income up 5.5 per cent to $888m.The US defence group also updated its outlook for 2014, putting expected full-year earnings per share at about $11.15 – the top of a previous range of $10.85 to $11.15.However, operating profit from its flagship F35 joint strike fighter programme was unchanged in the third quarter from the same time last year after a temporary grounding held up some deliveries.Lockheed also forecast for 2015 its net sales would decline at a “low single-digit rate”, and that total business segment operating margin would be in the 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent range, against the 12.6 per cent achieved so far this year.The company’s shares fell 2 per cent to $172.80 in New York.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, pointed out on a call with reporters that military spending was currently governed by a temporary “continuing resolution”, which has reduced the impact of sharp “sequestration” cuts imposed last year.The question would be whether spending under the 2015-16 fiscal year budget reverted to lower levels envisaged under sequestration, or rose to reflect new threats such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.“We’re hopeful that the budgets going forward are allowed to address the threats,” Mr Tanner said.The pensions boost in the third quarter resulted from a change in accounting rules affecting the company’s final salary and defined contribution retirement schemes.This change increased Lockheed’s net income by $52m in the three months to September 30. In the same period last year, the company’s net income was reduced by $75m by its pensions obligations.Sales for the third quarter were 2 per cent down on the same period last year, at $11.1bn. Earnings per diluted share were up 7 per cent at $2.57.Operating profit declined at all the company’s five divisions.In the core aeronautics division – which is building the F35 joint-strike fighter, the world’s biggest military procurement programme – operating profit declined 12 per cent to $362m in the third quarter, on sales down 2.5 per cent to $3.54bn. The fall stemmed mainly from lower sales of the C130 transport aircraft, while profit from the F35 programme was “comparable”.Mr Tanner acknowledged that F35 deliveries had been delayed by an engine fire that led to a temporary ban on flights in June and July.However, he said at least 12 of the 14 aircraft the company needed to deliver to meet its target for this year were in advanced flight testing or awaiting final acceptance by the US government.
119;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed Martin seeks to clean up space junk;;It is a problem that is alarming scientists, satellite operators and the US Air Force: what to do with the millions of pieces of space junk hurtling around the earth at speeds several times faster than a bullet?On Tuesday the US defence giant Lockheed Martin and an Australian technology company took a step towards solving the conundrum with plans to set up a joint tracking station using optical systems and lasers to monitor the most dangerous objects in orbit.“Even a tiny piece of space debris can seriously damage satellites worth hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Craig Smith, chief executive of EOS Space Systems.“Our technology enables us to track the most dangerous pieces of space junk and provide accurate data to satellite operators, which should enable them to avoid collisions.”EOS is a subsidiary of Electro Optic Systems Holdings, which has agreed a deal with Lockheed to set up a new tracking facility in Western Australia, share expertise and begin selling its tracking services to the space industry.This follows the award in June of a US$915m contract by the US Air Force to Lockheed to build a “space fence” project – a powerful radar system to track and catalogue space debris. This radar will monitor 200,000 of the largest pieces of junk in orbit.Awareness of the dangers posed by man-made space debris has grown since the first hypervelocity collision between satellites in 2009, which took place 800km above Siberia. Iridium 33, which was part of a network of satellites providing phone services, was destroyed when it collided with a deactivated Russia satellite Cosmos-2251. US space agency Nasa estimates the collision produced 1,000 pieces of space debris about the size of an apple as well as smaller pieces of junk.The 2013 Hollywood movie Gravity, which starred Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, focused public attention on the space junk problem, which Nasa has been grappling with for years.Nasa and the US Department of Defence are currently tracking about 20,000 pieces of junk, larger than the size of a grapefruit. In total there are an estimated 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble of larger. They travel at speeds of up to 17,500mph.Almost as impressive is the speed at which shares in Electro Optic Systems Holdings have risen: up by 49 per cent over the past seven days, closing Tuesday at 67 cents.“There is a commercial opportunity when you consider investment in space is worth about US$900m,” says Ba-Ngu Vo, professor at Curtin University.“And eventually it will become necessary to develop technology to take down some of this junk, perhaps within the next 10-20 years,” he said.
120;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-07-22T11:28:18Z;Lockheed earnings climb despite US cuts;;Declining US military spending reduced second-quarter revenues for Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, by 1 per cent – but the company still recorded net earnings up 3 per cent and increased its forecasts.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the company was increasing its forecast for 2014 profits based on the company’s “solid programme execution and operational performance” in the first half of the year.The company increased its forecast for full-year earnings per share from a range of $10.50 to $10.80 to a range of $10.85 to $11.15. It also insisted that problems that have grounded the F35 joint strike fighter – which accounted for 18 per cent of the quarter’s revenue – were temporary and would be overcome.Second-quarter net earnings were up 3 per cent to $889m compared with last year’s second quarter, while earnings per share rose 4.5 per cent to $2.76, despite the sales decline, to $11.3bn.The increase in net income resulted from a swing in the effect of the company’s pension scheme, which cost the company $120m in last year’s second quarter, but produced $85m income this time.As well as the F35, Lockheed builds the F22 fighter and the C130 transport aircraft, while Lockheed also owns half of United Launch Alliance, which handles all the US’s military space launches.“Our sound strategy, diverse portfolio and focus on affordability are yielding results and delivering value to our customers and shareholders,” Ms Hewson said.Operating profits at the core aeronautics division – which builds the F35, C130 and other aircraft – increased 11 per cent to $453m, on sales up 13 per cent to $3.85bn. The higher operating profit came mainly from the F22 and C130 programmes, while increasing F35 production volumes boosted sales.In June, the US military banned the F35 from flying after a fire in the engine of an aircraft at Eglin Airport Base in Florida. The ban prevented the aircraft from making its first trip outside the US to last week’s Farnborough Airshow in England.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said that, although the aircraft was now allowed to fly, outstanding restrictions meant it was impossible to carry out further flight testing.Mr Tanner said the company was nevertheless “cautiously optimistic” that the problem – reported to relate to an engine blade that rubbed against the engine cowling – would “get resolved” soon. Testing of the aircraft’s capabilities could then resume.At information systems and global solutions – one of the areas worst hit by declining US military spending– operating profits fell 10 per cent to $175m, on sales down 8 per cent to $1.94bn.The shares were up 2.1 per cent in mid-morning trading in New York, at $166.39.
121;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-07-17T17:02:05Z;US warned over satellite launch bill;;The White House and US defence department should have “grave concerns” about provisions of proposed legislation that could imperil the US’s ability to launch sensitive satellites, the company that undertakes the launches has warned.The United Launch Alliance said the little-noticed provision, in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Bill, was intended to subvert its existing contracts to launch military satellites. The provision would bar the Pentagon from agreeing new contracts or extending contracts with any supplier that relied significantly on components from Russia.ULA’s Atlas V rocket – used for many of the US’s most sensitive military launches– relies on a Russian-supplied RD180 engine. While the legislation allows the defence secretary to override the provision for national security reasons, it allows him to do so only if there is no viable, US-built alternative.SpaceX, the space launch company started by Elon Musk, the entrepreneur, could argue that its wholly US-built technology fits the legislation’s description and insist on being allowed to take over the work.ULA, a joint venture between Boeing, the military and commercial aerospace company, and Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor, said: “The White House and Department of Defense should have grave concerns about this congressional language and its clear intent to subvert current DoD contracts that have been meticulously negotiated.”The current arrangements provided the underpinnings of the US’s “assured access to space for national defence”, ULA added.ULA’s warning comes after William Shelton, commander of the US air force’s space command, warned the Senate armed services committee about the potential effect of an interruption in the production or supply of RD180 engines. Loss of access to the engines would have “significant impact” on the US’s ability to make planned launches of national security satellites reliably and on schedule, Gen Shelton told the committee on Wednesday.While there were possible alternatives – including switching to other launch vehicles or rescheduling some missions – no option was risk-free or cost-free, the general warned.The RD180 has become a source of significant controversy this year after Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, threatened in May to prevent further US purchases of RD180s for national security purposes. The threat – which has not yet been turned into an official embargo – has led to a debate over whether the US should pay to develop its own alternative engine.Gen Shelton told the committee that the air force was exploring both “near- and far-term strategies” for alternatives to the RD180. But he warned that a new, domestically-based engine would be a “multi-year” programme and would require significant congressional funding.ULA said the legislation, if passed, would “severely impact US national security capabilities” and cost billions of dollars.SpaceX is working to prove to the Pentagon that it can launch satellites with sufficient reliability to be allowed to take on some of the national security work, on which ULA has a monopoly.Congress and the Pentagon have both sought to increase competition to try to drive down the high cost of launches.However, ULA argued that the new legislation could eliminate competition by handing all the launch work to SpaceX. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“In addition to impacting national security capabilities, it ironically eliminates the competition in the launch market that congress has vehemently supported,” ULA said.
122;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-07-16T17:35:51Z;The price of innovation is too high in aerospace;The Wright Brothers were not motivated by a desire to save fuel when they took to the skies;The longest line at the Farnborough International Airshow this week was for a model aircraft. In the absence of the F-35 Lightning, the colossally expensive and accident-prone stealth fighter that was scheduled to be the show’s highlight before an engine failed on a test aircraft, Lockheed Martin brought a replica.I joined the queue waiting to climb the steps and play with the controls of the imitation $113m jet, which is intended to replace nine aircraft in the air forces and navies of the US and other countries, including the UK and Canada. There was a nice view of a runway from the cockpit, with its pretend electronic display, but Top Gun, it was not.Meanwhile, the biggest commercial announcement of the Farnborough show was not a new aircraft but some new Rolls-Royce engines and tweaked wings for an existing one – the Airbus A330 – to burn less fuel. “This is game-changing, 14 per cent,” enthused John Leahy, the European company’s chief salesman, about the amount of fuel per passenger seat the A330 Neo will save.Not to be outdone in businesslike pragmatism, Boeing touted the financial advantages of its 787, the A330’s direct rival. “Operating economics, flexibility, fuel economy. That’s what our entire product line is about,” said Scott Fancher, Boeing’s head of commercial aircraft development. “That is why airlines are so excited about this aircraft. In essence, it’s a fuel hedge.”Here is the age of diminished expectations in aerospace. When I last visited Farnborough a decade ago, the talk was of risk-taking on grand projects to outmanoeuvre the opposition – Airbus’s A380, Boeing’s 787 and the F-35. The bill would be high but the benefits of new technology and groundbreaking innovation incalculable.As it turned out, the significant miscalculation was the cost and complexity of making these visions real. The F-35 has yet to be brought into service and the A380 and 787 arrived late and over budget after setbacks including, in Boeing’s case, batteries catching fire.The industry is chastened. James McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, promised investors in May that there would be no more “moonshots” in the form of entirely new aircraft and the company would instead “spiral in technology” by upgrading existing models. Boeing does not intend to replace its single-aisle 737 for 15 years, and is developing the fuel-saving 737 Max.It is the safe strategic choice for Boeing and Airbus, which despite efforts by Bombardier and Embraer to compete at the smaller end of the market, are a duopoly. Each would displease investors and airlines if it refused to change, and knows its rival faces similar pressure.But fuel-saving is not why the Wright Brothers got into the flying game, and risk-avoidance, while financially rational if the entire industry adopts the same course, makes you a target. Declaring that you will forswear moonshots for a decade or more is an invitation for someone else to have a go.The moonshot man of the moment is Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, the rocket company, and Tesla Motors, which makes electric cars. He has written only speculatively about a supersonic passenger jet but the mention of his name is sufficient to rile executives. “This is a long-term play for us, not a short-term, flashy play,” says one sharply.Military aerospace differs from civil aerospace – the customers do not choose their jet fighters based on fuel consumption, for example – but there are similarities between their problems. The F-35’s costs have risen far in excess of the original estimates – although it was pitched as being relatively affordable – and the aircraft has proved maddeningly difficult to develop.The 787’s technical challenge, apart from its lithium ion batteries, was Boeing’s extensive use of composite materials. The biggest difficulty with the F-35 is that it is really three aircraft in one – a jet fighter for air forces, one that can land on naval carriers such as the UK’s new HMS Queen Elizabeth, and a vertical take-off variant for marines.The Pentagon wanted the F-35 to be as flexible as possible to spread development costs. “Quantity is the key to affordability,” says Steve O’Bryan, Lockheed Martin’s head of international strategy. Not only will the F-35 be used by three US armed services, but it is being sold widely to allied armies and navies.In practice, the F-35 has cast a pall over the notion of joint procurement projects. A Rand Corporation study last year estimated that it would have been cheaper for the Pentagon to have commissioned three separate aircraft for its various services than to try to combine them in a joint strike fighter. It advised the US government to avoid similar joint programmes in future.The Pentagon has fought for years to get the F-35’s costs under control, and it last week pushed Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems into investing $170m in cost-reduction initiatives. “It is a great pleasure to be here,” Frank Kendall, the US defence undersecretary for acquisition, told a Farnborough media briefing drily. “It would be even more of a pleasure if the F-35 were here with me.”Its absence knocked a hole in the schedule, which was not really filled by familiar aircraft, including the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787, flying around the Farnborough skies. Lighter fuselages, new wings and efficient engines are financially valuable but unspectacular.They are all we will see for quite some time, if the aerospace incumbents, scarred by their product launches over the past decade, stick to their new discipline. It is up to someone else to excite us.john.gapper@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this column:Rewards too low in mass transit airline industry / From Mr Matt Andersson
123;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-07-15T21:29:46Z;F35 Farnborough trip halted after engine fire;;The world’s largest military procurement project, Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, suffered a severe embarrassment on Tuesday when the US defence department ruled out its attending this week’s Farnborough air show as scheduled.The trip to Farnborough, the biggest international air show this year, would have been the first trip to Europe for the aircraft, due to become the mainstay of the air power of the US and 11 countries worldwide.The US military will pay about $400bn for 2,457 F35s in three variants for use by the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the UK are partners in the programme, while Israel, Japan and South Korea plan to buy the aircraft.Cancellation of the visit further bolsters the case of critics who have long argued that the programme is far too complex and the aircraft is meant to fulfil too many incompatible roles.The Farnborough visit has been in doubt ever since an F35 suffered a serious engine fire at Eglin Air Force base in Florida on June 23. Nearly all flights by the aircraft were subsequently halted while the fire’s cause was investigated.As late as Tuesday morning, when safety regulators cleared the aircraft for a limited return to flight, there had been hopes that the aircraft might be able to visit the air show by the last of its trade days on Thursday.However, on Tuesday afternoon, the US defence department announced it had decided not to allow the aircraft to go. The Pentagon said that, when it considered whether to deploy aircraft, it looked at “many factors,” including the flight’s riskiness, weather and the time the aircraft would have on the ground.There have been concerns about the fighter’s safety when on the ground during thunderstorms and its ability to stop promptly on wet runways.“All these factors were weighted appropriately in making this difficult decision,” the defence department said. “While we are disappointed, we remain fully committed to the programme and look forward to future opportunities to showcase its capabilities to allies and partners.”Lockheed said it understood and supported the decision not to send the aircraft.Supporters of the F35 insist the project is in no worse shape than other big fighter aircraft projects at the same stage and that the aircraft’s superior sensors would make it a vital weapon for its buyers.However, Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus military reform project at the Washington-based Project on Government Oversight, said the individual problems were symptoms of the aircraft’s “excessive complexity”.“This is an inevitable result of that,” he said of the transatlantic flight’s cancellation.
124;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US still ‘hopeful’ on F-35 after fire;;"The US defence department is “still hopeful” that Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be ready to make its first international flight at the high-
profile Farnborough air show this week after an engine fire.The absence of the next generation fighter jet – after the fire in the Pratt & Whitney engine led to a fleetwide grounding last month – was an embarrassment, but officials said that they were “not giving up yet”.The failure has stirred the long-running controversy about the suitability of the long-delayed aircraft – expected to cost a total $400bn for the US military to purchase – as countries around the world consider purchasing the next generation fighter.Frank Kendall, the US undersecretary for defence, said he was “still hopeful” that the plane would be cleared to fly, adding that while the fire was “unfortunate for the programme”, the “US is firmly committed” to the project.He added that the problem, caused by “excessive rubbing” of engine fan blades, was probably not a design flaw affecting the entire fleet. “There is a growing body of evidence that this is not a systemic design problem,” he said.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon’s F-35 program chief, said: “It would have been a wonderful thing to have the aeroplane here. But we are not giving up yet. We still have a few more days left to try to get the aeroplane over here.”Lockheed Martin won the competition to build the jet in 2001, when it was envisaged that the first aircraft would enter service within 10 years. It has been beset by delays and technical problems.The US defence department this year listed a series of concerns, including the tendency of the stealth coating to come off after repeated use of the afterburners. The report criticised its unpredictable handling and troublesome software.Mr Kendall on Monday said no similar engine problems to the ones that caused the fire had been found on any of the other 98 engines in service. He added hat the program was still in the development stage, and that technical problems were normal.Pat Dewar, head of Lockheed Martin’s international division, told the FT that the fire would not impede his ability to sell the plane to oversee customers: “This is still a development programme,” he said, adding that the plane “might still fly this week”.Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey are partners in the programme, alongside the UK. Israel, Japan and South Korea also plan to buy the aircraft.The cost of the F35, which has BAE Systems of the UK as its main international partner, has prompted some of its cash-strapped customers to reduce their orders or reconsider buying the jet altogether."
125;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-07-13T09:02:53Z;The 21st century promises era of radical change, but no rocket belts;It is easy to feel that the pace of development in aviation has slowed;It is the 21st century. We should all be going to work by rocket belt, have a flying car in the garage for family outings, and be able to go halfway around the world on a hypersonic airliner in two or three hours.One hundred years on from the first commercial airline flight, which was a short hop in Florida with just one paying customer, it is easy to feel the pace of development in aviation has slowed. That 23-minute journey came just a decade after the Wright brothers’ pioneering flight in a powered, heavier-than-air machine.Much of the progress that followed ran ahead of the infrastructure – flying boats could operate without runways so were used to link continents in the 1930s by the likes of Pan American World Airways and Imperial Airways. But the airfields that mushroomed in the 1940s meant land planes led another era of rapid expansion as jet engines fuelled the growth of commercial aviation.Since then, however, with the exception of the supersonic and now extinct Concorde, airliner cruise speed has been stuck at about Mach 0.85, while airport infrastructure is once again a brake on growth. Many existing airports lack capacity, while noise and environmental concerns are pushing planned airports further away from the cities that are passengers’ final destinations.Technological change is still happening, though. Turbofan engines have become, on average, 1 per cent more efficient every year for the past two decades. The Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan, or PurePower engine, that has been chosen for the Bombardier CSeries airliner promises to be 10-15 per cent more efficient than current aero engines.Yet the pace still needs to step up. The aviation industry has set itself a target of a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 compared with the levels of 2005. And while packing more passengers on to each aircraft can yield greater efficiency, we have probably already seen in the Airbus A380 superjumbo a limit to the size of aircraft that existing airports can handle,Encouragingly, aircraft powered by electric motors are rapidly moving from being pie in the sky to a real possibility. Airbus Group Innovations is putting into production two- and then four-seat electric light planes, based on the E-Fan prototype that it will have on display at the Farnborough show.The all-electric E-Fan 2.0, with a flight time per single charge of about an hour, is slated for the end of 2017, and the four-seater that follows will be a hybrid, using an engine to charge the batteries – meaning that range is only as much of an issue as for conventional aircraft.Battery technology is moving forward rapidly, propelled by the consumer electronics and automotive markets, and there is huge potential for aircraft as that technology improves. As Sébastian Remy, head of innovation at Airbus, tells me, the goal is clearly hybrid airliners.As far as the speed of air travel is concerned, supersonic will return. Lockheed Martin’s successor to its SR-71 spyplane of the 1960s is planned for about 2030, and should be capable of Mach 6, or 4,500mph. The technology is there to be repackaged into passenger-carrying planes. And engineers, at Nasa among other places, are working on ways to quiet the sonic boom. Put those two together, add the potential that US company Aerion sees for the latest version of its planned supersonic business jet, and speedy airline travel seems likely.Aircraft powered by electric motors are moving from being pie in the sky to a real possibilityIn the longer term, the trajectory of transcontinental travel could be steep. Spacecraft of the type developed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX are reusable and can land vertically. That is a boon for his Mars plans, but could revolutionise travel around the globe too. A flight from London to Sydney, say, could describe a parabolic arc to the edge of space or beyond, cutting the journey to four hours or less.Meanwhile hybrid power for helicopters could serve to minimise the most oft-quoted irritant when they fly into city centres – noise. Switching to electric-only mode for approaches and departures could open up new city-centre sites for heliports and thus revolutionise travel.One can discount any return of radical ideas such as the 1931 plan for a rooftop set of runways at King’s Cross in London. Safety fears over what would happen if an aircraft fell off the edge are just one reason for this proposal’s demise. But a heliport needs only a small footprint and neighbours who are not outraged by a noise nuisance.And the timescale for all of this? One hundred years ago flying was all about wood and canvas aircraft, and frequent crashes. Aviation today is almost unrecognisably changed: another century from now, the picture will certainly look as different again, though rocket belts are still, regrettably, not likely to be an everyday item. One can only hope that airport security screening makes as much progress.
126;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-07-13T09:02:53Z;Engine fire fuels debate over F35’s capability;Lockheed Martin focuses on further development;"It is ironic that, ahead of this month’s Farnborough air show, the key question about the F35 fighter, due to make its first European appearance at the event, has been whether it would actually turn up.The fighter-bomber – conceived more than two decades ago – was set to make its first transatlantic flight for the show. This was scheduled to be the first chance for the UK, the biggest single export customer for the aircraft, to see the F35 in home skies.Although the US Marine Corps was saying at the time of publication that it still planned to get the aircraft to Farnborough, a fire on June 23 in the engine of an F35 at Eglin Air Force base, Florida, raised concerns about whether it would be cleared to fly to the UK. Most F35 flights in the US were halted pending an investigation.This has stirred long-running controversies about the suitability of the aircraft – expected to cost a total $400bn for the US military to purchase – for its many planned roles.Interested parties such as executives at Lockheed Martin, the aircraft’s manufacturer, insist that the F35 is suffering teething problems and will, eventually, enter into service.Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s chief executive, says the company is focused on further developing the aircraft, of which US armed forces are eventually meant to buy 2,457.Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey are partners in the programme, alongside the UK. Israel, Japan and South Korea also plan to buy the aircraft.“As you look at other fighter programmes that have been at this stage of their development, I think we’re working pretty well,” Ms Hewson says.For the aircraft’s critics, the engine fire only confirms that the project is vastly overcomplicated and doomed to fail.Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus military reform project at the Washington-based Project on Government Oversight, calls the fire “just another episode in the history of this airplane’s complexity”.Despite recent cost reductions, the F35’s cheapest variant is costing $150m each, he says. “For that, we get an aircraft that in many respects is a step backward from aircraft it’s replacing,” Mr Wheeler says. “It’s a monstrosity of complexity, which is the source of its unaffordable cost and its tremendously disappointing performance.”Many F35 problems stem from its genesis as an at least theoretically sensible idea, namely that the US military’s different air forces should ditch the wasteful habit of ordering and expensively developing entirely separate aircraft. The F35 is being manufactured in three variants: an air force version that operates from conventional runways; a Marine Corps craft capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings (Stovl); and a navy version for aircraft carriers.The critics argue that its range of different roles makes the F35 poor at nearly all of them. Mr Wheeler says the requirement that the aircraft be Stovl-capable dictates it having a relatively short, stubby shape and a single engine, which works against the requirement for it to reach supersonic speeds. On top of that, the aircraft has to have the stealth capabilities that will hide it from enemy radar and meet the needs of three different services.“That’s four levels of complexity,” he says. “That’s why we have an aircraft that’s so expensive.”The US defence department’s director of operational test and evaluation this year listed a series of concerns, including the tendency of the stealth coating to come off after repeated use of the afterburners. The report criticised the F35’s unpredictable handling and troublesome software.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed Martin’s chief financial officer, says the aircraft’s critics are judging it by the standards of the last generation of fighters. Only Lockheed Martin’s F22 fighter, introduced in 2005, offers comparable electronic capabilities. “They’re ignoring the incredible sensor station that there is on those aircraft that no other aircraft in the world, with the exception of the F22, can bring to the fight,” he says. “It’s a different fight.”Pilots will have unprecedented amounts of information and be able to co-ordinate with other aircraft, using their weapons to launch long-range attacks, which should ensure they never face traditional close-range combat. “If an F35 gets into a dogfight, [the pilot] has done something wrong,” Mr Tanner says.Mr Wheeler accepts that there is no political will to scrap the project.Mr Tanner, meanwhile, insists that the aircraft is on the way to transforming aerial combat forever.——————————————-Fighter jet: Latest setback points to possible further delays in programmeThe June engine fire, which occurred just before take-off, is the latest in a series of setbacks to the F35 Joint Strike Fighter programme. Like so many complex defence projects it is late and over budget, reports Mark Odell.When Lockheed Martin won the competition to build the JSF in 2001 it was envisaged that the first aircraft would enter service within 10 years. The programme is at least five years behind schedule, with the US Marines aiming to declare the aircraft operational with limited capabilities next year.The technical problems (including making millions of lines of software code work) encountered during the initial production run of 100 or so aircraft, have raised concerns that this target too could be missed.Steve O’Bryan, one of the US defence contractor’s senior executives on the F35, says the programme was always designed for the testing and development phase to coincide with the early production run, a technique known as concurrent engineering.”The theory of concurrency is it saves money because you don’t want to build 20 test aeroplanes and then shut down the assembly line and suppliers as you do the flight tests,” he says.This was an idea seen as central to lowering the cost of procuring expensive combat aircraft, but critics point to cost escalation that is only now being addressed.The F35 was originally expected to cost about half the target price of $75m-$85m each, if volumes grow as hoped, depending on the variant.Mr O’Bryan, a former US Navy fighter pilot, rejects criticism that the aircraft will never live up to its billing. He says claims that it will become vulnerable to detection much sooner than anticipated are ill-founded despite advances being pursued by China and Russia in radar technology that will defeat the F35’s vaunted stealth capabilities.“The key is you can’t stand still,” he says.“So the idea behind the F35 is to build a weapons system that is made to be upgraded.”"
127;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-06-29T15:22:26Z;F-35 stake promises big returns for BAE;;When Queen Elizabeth II arrives at Rosyth dockyard just outside Edinburgh at the end of this week to name the first of two aircraft carriers being built by a BAE Systems-led consortium, the Royal Navy’s new flagship and the British head of state are sure to hog the limelight.However, for the UK-based defence contractor, the “money shot” will come in the form of a fly-past to mark the occasion if, as expected, it includes the first public appearance outside of the US of the new F-35 joint strike fighter that will eventually fly off the deck of the carrier.Given the scale of the carriers with their combined price tag of £6.2bn, it might seem that the largest warships ever built for the British navy would represent the bigger return for BAE in financial terms. But it is the 15 per cent stake the UK defence contractor holds in the F-35 project, which is led by Lockheed Martin of the US, that is the prize.Anticipated sales of the new stealth jet are expected to exceed 3,000 aircraft, given the commitments from the US and 11 of its allies. Those projections make it the world’s biggest ever defence procurement programme, with the US alone slated to spend $400bn on buying almost 2,500 jets.“The scale, scope and complexity of the F-35 programme is beyond that of any other programme on the planet,” says Stuart Forsyth, BAE’s F-35 development director.The F-35 was designed as an international project involving defence contractors and suppliers from nine countries. The UK is the second-biggest industrial partner to the US in part because it agreed to pay $2bn towards the development costs.This allowed BAE to secure much more than just a stake in the relatively small number of jets the UK is planning to buy.The UK-based defence contractor is making the aft fuselage and tail for every F-35 at its Samlesbury factory in northwest England. The parts are then shipped to the main final assembly line in Fort Worth, Texas. BAE is also supplying other key components of the aircraft through its US division.Although BAE does not break out the exact value of individual programmes, analysts expect the contractor’s small stake in the F-35 to deliver both revenues and profits that should exceed those of its biggest defence contract to date: the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, in which it is one of the lead industrial partners.“People might think that the Typhoon would be a larger programme because it is the only [complete] combat aircraft that BAE builds,” says Nick Cunningham, an aerospace and defence analyst at Agency Partners in London. “But it is the sheer volume of F-35 that makes the difference. So even if BAE only has a small part of each aircraft, the aggregate value [of the contract] will be bigger.”Mr Cunningham estimates that by 2017 the F-35 will be worth about £2bn in annual revenues, equivalent to 10 per cent of group sales. He forecasts the company should make margins of 11 per cent margin on the work, accounting for just under 10 per cent of the estimated £2.2bn of group operating profits in the same year.F-35 production is due to ramp up towards its peak of 200 aircraft per year over the next six years. That rate is likely to be sustained until the mid-2020s but even after that about 100 jets a year are expected to roll off the line until late into the 2030s.As production rises the unit cost of each F-35 is set to fall, with the average price coming down to about $75m from $100m for the cheapest variant. This will cut into BAE’s revenues but at the same time all contractors involved in the programme will be taking out costs.There are two big questions hanging over the programme from a financial perspective for BAE. First, whether the myriad problems the aircraft has faced in its development and concerns about its capabilities will lead to potential buyers cutting back on their planned orders (see box).The second is how much of the high-margin after-market BAE can capture for the aircraft, which are expected to remain in service for 70 years.“The through-life value of the programme is expected to be around $1.5tn over 70 years and BAE Systems has a 15 per cent share of that,” Mr Forsyth says.But analysts are unsure whether BAE will be able to capture its “full” share of the support work on the F-35, given that Lockheed is the prime contractor.Edward Stacey, aerospace and defence analyst at Espirito Santo, thinks the company is “unlikely to be able to capture as much as the service revenues as it will with Typhoon.”But he says investors should not underestimate the importance of the F-35 for BAE. He estimates the projected rise in production would boost BAE’s top line by 3 per cent a year but without it the top line would remain flat. “It could make the difference over the next four years or so as F-35 ramp-up provides all of BAE’s organic revenue growth.”Programme late and over budgetLike so many complex defence programmes, the F-35 is running late and way over budget, writes Mark Odell.It is already at least five years behind schedule, with the US Marines due to declare the aircraft operational with limited capabilities next year.But a myriad of technical problems encountered during the initial production run of the first 100 or so aircraft, including big challenges in getting the millions of lines of software code to work, has raised concerns the target could be missed.The problems have also been seized on by critics, who argue that the aircraft is just not up to the job.But Lockheed Martin rejects those arguments. Steve O’Bryan, one of the US defence contractor’s senior executives in charge of the F-35, says the programme was always designed to run the testing and development phase during the early production run, a technique known as concurrent engineering.“It has always been conceived as a concurrent engineering programme. The theory of concurrency is it saves money because you don’t want to build 20 test aeroplanes and then shut down the assembly line and suppliers as you do the flight tests,” he says.Mr O’Bryan, a former US Navy fighter pilot, also rejects criticism that the aircraft will be vulnerable to detection much sooner than anticipated as China and Russia are pursuing advances in radar that will defeat the stealth technology.“The key is you can’t stand still. So the idea behind the F-35 is you build a weapons system that is made to be upgraded,” he says.The F-35 programme is three different aircraft built around a similar design to ensure as much commonality as possible in a bid to cut unit cost. It was conceived by the Pentagon in the 1990s to replace eight types of combat aircraft for the US air force, marines and navy, as well as many of its western allies.Taking all together, that is close to a market of 10,000 combat aircraft, although Mr O’Bryan says there is no expectation the F-35 would be a “one-for-one” replacement.But some analysts believe the F-35 is set to become a big seller. “The risk is actually that build rate goes higher and they end up selling a lot more than 3,000 aeroplanes in the fullness of time,” says Nick Cunningham of Agency Partners.
128;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Sikorsky wins vital work with USAF rescue helicopter contract;;United Technologies’ Sikorsky helicopters took a key step towards securing long-term military orders when the US Air Force awarded work on a new rescue helicopter to a bid it developed jointly with Lockheed Martin.Sikorsky said the $1.28bn engineering and manufacturing development contract could eventually lead to $7.9bn of work, producing a new fleet of 112 helicopters to rescue air crew downed in combat.The new aircraft are due to replace the air force’s fleet of about 100 Sikorsky Pave Hawk rescue helicopters, most of which are roughly 30 years old and have had significant use during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.However, Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said Deborah James, the Air Force secretary, had indicated that serial production of the new aircraft might not happen until 2020 or later.“The air force has consistently indicated that the pacing of the programme is contingent on availability of funding,” Mr Thompson said.Under the contract awarded on Friday, Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin will develop a variant on the US military’s Black Hawk helicopter suitable for search and rescue. They will deliver four initial combat rescue helicopters and seven systems for training air crew and maintenance workers. They expect a contract to deliver a further five helicopters and training for more personnel by 2020.Mick Maurer, Sikorsky’s president, said the company was “honoured” to have been selected. Sikorsky helicopters had been rescuing downed US air crew since 1943, he added.“I’m tremendously pleased that we will continue to do so for years to come,” he said.The Sikorsky-Lockheed bid was the only offer the air force received for the development contract. It was reported last year that Italy’s Finmeccanica would not submit a bid for its well-regarded AgustaWestland EH101 helicopter because of the tight cost targets.“This is an important programme for Sikorsky because it needs to cover a softening in demand for helicopters used in southwest Asia with other programmes and new foreign sales,” Mr Thompson said.The combat rescue helicopter contract has been closely watched as an indicator of the US military’s willingness to award significant new contracts amid tight budgets. Funding has fallen both because of the wind-down of US military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan and because of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration.
129;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-06-10T11:54:14Z;Lockheed Martin launches fight over US satellite standards;;The head of Lockheed Martin’s space systems division has called for the US government to hold new competitors to the same exacting standards as existing military rocket launchers, in an apparent sideswipe at Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Rick Ambrose was speaking as the space launch sector prepares for a likely shake-up when Russia cuts off the supply of RD180 rocket motors for US military launches. The motors currently power the Atlas V rockets built by the United Launch Alliance joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing, but Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, has said Russia will cut off the supply.The US looks set to fund development of its own, domestic motor to replace the RD180. But SpaceX has insisted that it could handle some of the work with variants of its entirely US-built Falcon rocket and sharply cut the current high launch costs.ULA – which uses both the Atlas V and Boeing’s more expensive Delta IV rocket – is currently the only launch provider allowed to send the US’s most sensitive military satellites to space.Mr Ambrose said there had so far been no official indication that the supply of RD180s would be ended. However, if a new motor were developed for the Atlas V, costs of the programme would be managed.“We would definitely need to design it to minimise any other changes to the Atlas rocket,” Mr Ambrose said. “It would have to meet the cost profile because you have to compete.”ULA wanted to be competitive, Mr Ambrose said, in a reference to the US government’s preparations to open up military launches to other providers.But he went on: “We will want all competitors to meet the mission assurance standards of the US government.”SpaceX has said that ULA’s launches cost more than $400m each, while ULA says they cost only around $225m. The costs are high, according to ULA, because of the stringent requirements of the US military, which demands near-certainty that it will lose none of the sensitive military satellites that it launches. None of the 83 satellite launches ULA has undertaken since it formed in 2006 has failed – a remarkable record in an accident-prone industry.The government has a certification process that I think everybody ought to adhere toULA has alleged that SpaceX – which the US military has suggested could receive clearance for national security satellite launches as early as later this year – is seeking a relaxation of the rules to hurry up approval.However, John Taylor, SpaceX’s communications director, said the company fully supported the approval process for new launch providers and looked forward to “full and open competition” for national security launches.Asked if his criticisms referred specifically to SpaceX, Mr Ambrose said: “I’m saying the government has a certification process that I think everybody ought to adhere to.” The spat between ULA and SpaceX illustrates how the once-distinct worlds of commercial and military space launches are coming closer together. Governments are increasingly prepared to trust some of their launches to specialists in commercial satellites, in the hope of reducing costs.Meanwhile, specialist military launch providers such as ULA need to appeal more to commercial satellite operators as their once-secure military work becomes more competitive.Among the frontrunners to develop a new, homegrown replacement for the RD180 would be United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney division or Aerojet Rocketdyne.
130;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-05-27T11:19:16Z;US finds strife on the final frontier;;In a corner of the exhibition hall at last week’s 30th annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, the Lynx suborbital spaceplane drew disproportionate attention. Visitor after visitor climbed inside the two-seater craft, which has a satisfying hint of 1950s comic book about it, to pose for pictures.The presence of the spaceplane – built in California by Xcor Aerospace – was a reminder of how the end of cold war rivalry and of US restrictions on private space flight have transformed the space industry in the past two decades. A far wider range of countries and companies are launching satellites or, as in Xcor’s case, preparing to carry space tourists.Yet the event was also full of reminders that the era of international co-operation might be ending.All Chinese delegations had their permission to attend withdrawn in the wake of the scandal over Chinese spying on the US. Meanwhile, Russian threats to withhold a key rocket motor from the US in response to US sanctions over the Ukraine crisis prompted soul-searching about whether the US could produce an alternative motor.The question is whether the final frontier risks becoming as troublesome and dangerous as the US’s earlier frontiers were – or if harmony will again return.John Elbon, general manager of Boeing Space Exploration, the company’s human space flight arm, reflects the optimism of many in the US space programme.“My hope is that this is a bit of a flare-up that we will work our way through and that we’ll return to normal operations,” he says.However, many speakers feared that outer space projects had become increasingly vulnerable to terrestrial tensions. That could make the past 20 years seem the exception rather than the norm.Lt Gen Ellen Pawlikowski, commander of the US air force’s space and missile systems centre, recalled at a symposium session how, in a speech in 2011, she had predicted space would become “congested, competitive and contested”. The prediction was coming true, she said.When a US National Reconnaisance Office satellite lifted off into the sky above Cape Canaveral on April 10, the rocket’s ultimate destination in space and the satellite’s purpose were all kept top secret, writes Robert Wright. But there is a strong possibility that the intelligence satellite will be used to monitor the behaviour of the Russian military, which when the launch took place was massed on Ukraine’s eastern border . . .Continue readingSome of the concerns stem from the fact that the frontier’s de facto sheriff – the US’s military space programme – is looking increasingly underequipped.Gen William Shelton, head of the US Air Force’s space command, told a symposium session how dependent the US was on a handful of large, sophisticated military satellites. The threat of a military attack and the increasing amount of space debris in the most useful geosynchronous orbit both raised the risk of a devastating loss.Lt Gen Pawlikowski, meanwhile, told the symposium her centre’s annual budget had been slashed from $8bn for 2012 to $5.6bn for 2014. The centre has avoided cutting satellite launches only by putting heavy pressure on suppliers to reduce costs and collaborating more with Israel, Australia and other allies.One of the mechanisms for reducing costs may be increased competition in the military launch market. The space symposium was the scene of an ugly row between United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that handles all US military launches, and SpaceX, which could win certification for such work as early as this year.Michael Gass, ULA’s chief executive, accused SpaceX of trying to “change the rules midstream” to hasten its certification for national security work. SpaceX accused ULA of publishing misleading figures on the cost of its launches, which ULA said cost only about $225m each. SpaceX said the US Air Force’s 2015 budget request suggested launches cost more than $400m each.“Consolidating to the point of monopoly has never served the consumer,” Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, pointedly told Mr Gass at one symposium session.The US nevertheless looks likely to take one costly step, by ending its reliance on Russian technology in its military space programmes. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, said last week that the country would no longer allow exports of RD-180 engines destined for military launches – their main use. The RD-180 powers ULA’s Atlas V rocket, used for the most sensitive US satellite launches. The US looks all but certain to develop its own alternative.Such a move would fit with the country’s increasing wariness about its exposure to interference in space by Russia, China and other potentially hostile countries. There were 197 satellites launched last year, according to the Space Foundation, the symposium’s organisers, up from 124 in 2012. India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the US, China and Europe all launched satellites.Gen Shelton told the symposium he was “very concerned” about the US’s ability to produce rocket engines.ULA’s Mr Gass told the symposium: “We need to be able to reach space without reliance on any other nation.”In civilian space, however, the gangs from different ends of town might yet lower their guards and co-operate. US payments for the transport of US astronauts to the International Space Station – to which Mr Rogozin threatened to block US access after 2020 – account for a significant slice of the Russian space agency’s budget.Michael Lopez-Alegria, a US former commander of the space station, points out the station has withstood many crises.“The only way that this [crisis] would be any different would be if this really blows up,” he says.A resumption of good relations would delight many in the US space programme, including Mr Elbon. He believes that joint space exploration has significantly improved the US-Russia relationship.“I’ve been working on the space station for 25 years,” Mr Elbon says. “At least initially, it was an incredibly effective tool for pulling our two countries together.”
131;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-05-26T10:03:06Z;Guest post: Musk vs Russia – back to the Cold War;;By Susmita Mohanty of Earth2OrbitElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, is suing the US Air Force for awarding a no-bid military contract to United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 venture of Boeing and Lockheed. The contract, for 36 rockets to launch defence payloads such as satellites, went to ULA on a sole-source basis last December. By 2030, the Pentagon expects to spend almost $70bn on the program. While the two old aerospace monopolies sulked, many in the industry quietly cheered Musk, a California-based new generation immigrant entrepreneur, for challenging the lucrative contract awarded without open competitive bidding.But Musk’s actions may have grave and unintended consequences.Musk apparently had two objections. One, his company SpaceX wasn’t allowed to bid. It said in a statement:The contract was negotiated and executed outside of public view and has never been made public.Two, Musk pointed fingers at the Russian made RD-180 rocket engines used by ULA in some of its rockets, which he said was possibly a violation of US sanctions and unseemly given the Russian invasion of Ukraine.One result of the suit is that a US Court has issued an injunction prohibiting ULA from proceeding with plans to buy the Russian-made rocket engines. Russia retaliated by banning the sale of RD-180 engines for military use by the US.Musk further alleged that the Russian engine deal would benefit Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister who heads the Russian defence industry and is named by the US government in the sanctions. In reaction to the sanctions, Rogozin tweeted: “After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest the US delivers its astronauts to the ISS (International Space Station) with a trampoline.”This latest row between the US and Russia is not looking pretty and could worsen. One consequence would be to put the ISS programme in serious jeopardy. Russia helps carry US astronauts to the orbiting station on its Soyuz spacecraft because, after its Space Shuttle fleet was retired in 2011, the US does not have its own space ferry. Although SpaceX is getting close to launching a crew-rated version of its Dragon capsule for NASA, Russia brings a lot to the table when it comes to the ISS. If Russia pulls out, the programme could be virtually over.Musk probably thinks he played a master stroke but he may have created a maelstrom that could get out of control. While fair competition is necessary, international cooperation in space endeavours is no less important and happens to be a two-way street and at times, even, a rope walk.Musk has got too focused on his company’s bottom line and forgotten everyone else in the equation. He has provided further proof that the Cold War isn’t really dead, after all.Susmita Mohanty is an aerospace entrepreneur. She is co-founder and CEO of Earth2Orbit, her third venture and India’s first private space start-up.Back to beyondbrics
132;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-05-20T17:56:29Z;General warns of US space vulnerability;;The head of the US Air Force’s space command says he is “very concerned” about the state of the country’s rocket industry in a sign of American anxiety over its dependence on Russia launch technology.General William Shelton was speaking to the Space Symposium in Colorado after Russia’s deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, vowed to stop letting the US use Russia’s RD180 rocket motors for military satellite launches. The motors are used in the Atlas V rocket that the United Launch Alliance uses to lift the US’s most sensitive spy satellites into space.While there are new, domestic space companies such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and some US-built rockets that use only US technology, the Atlas V can lift heavier satellites and has a long record of reliability. ULA is a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin and has a monopoly on the US national security launch business.Mr Rogozin also vowed to stop letting the US use the International Space Station after 2020.It could take four to five years for US contractors to develop a new motor with the same capabilities as the RD180. ULA has stockpiled enough motors to continue launches for two years if Russia makes good on its threat.“I remain very concerned about the state of our rocket propulsion industrial base,” General Shelton said towards the end of his address.With the help of the US Congress, the military was examining the possibility of developing a domestically produced rocket engine, he added.But he went on: “As many of you know, a strong domestic industrial base is key to assured access to space.”Gen Shelton had previously painted a picture of space operations that had been transformed since the cold war by the number of countries operating in space and by the potential for attacks on satellites.When a US National Reconnaisance Office satellite lifted off into the sky above Cape Canaveral on April 10, the rocket’s ultimate destination in space and the satellite’s purpose were all kept top secret. But there is a strong possibility that the intelligence satellite will be used to monitor the behaviour of the Russian military, which when the launch took place was massed on Ukraine’s eastern border.The US was vulnerable, he said, because it relied for critical capabilities on a small number of large, complex satellites that if lost or destroyed by enemy action would severely harm the country’s intelligence-gathering. The military was planning to move to using larger networks of smaller satellites.“This distributed approach we believe will minimise the impact of losing a single asset,” he said.The US military might also buy space on commercial satellite launchers for some launches and there were new approaches to reaching space, including the Virgin Galactic system for space tourism.Gen Shelton was “intrigued” by the possibility of competition for national security launches, he said. SpaceX’s entirely US-built Falcon rocket is working towards being certified for use to launch US national security satellites, as are the vehicles of Orbital Sciences Corporation, another company working in the field.The general, nevertheless, stressed the importance of being fully competitive in space technology.“The mainstay of space operations is assured access,” he said.US vulnerability over the RD180 reflects the country’s decision on both cost and strategic grounds to rein in spending on rocket engine development after the end of the cold war and to embrace Russia’s space industry.Russia continued to spend on the area and developed engines that required less fuel per pound of thrust than their US equivalents. Any new engine could come from plans that the National Aeronautic and Space Administration is already pursuing for new, manned space craft that will be able to carry astronauts ultimately to Mars.
133;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-05-16T16:21:14Z;Satellite pinpoints US’s Russian space dependence;;When a US National Reconnaisance Office satellite lifted off into the sky above Cape Canaveral on April 10, the rocket’s ultimate destination in space and the satellite’s purpose were all kept top secret. But there is a strong possibility that the intelligence satellite will be used to monitor the behaviour of the Russian military, which when the launch took place was massed on Ukraine’s eastern border.That was not the mission’s only connection to Russia, however. The RD180 engines that powered the Atlas V rocket off the launch pad were built not by one of the US’s domestic aerospace companies but by Russia’s NPO Energomash, currently maker of some of the world’s most advanced rocket motors.The tensions inherent in the US’s reliance on one of its main geostrategic rivals to lift into space its spy and other military satellites were exposed to humiliating public scrutiny this week. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, announced his government would no longer allow export of RD180s to the United Launch Alliance, which handles the US’s most sensitive military launches, if the satellites it would launch were military. Since launches by ULA – a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing – are nearly all military, this effectively bans exports.Russia is one of the biggest players in commercial satellite launches and markets its services internationally through two companies with strong ties to the US. Lockheed Martin and Boeing have all but sold out in recent years with the Russian state taking control of the venturesSee belowThe move looks likely to be of far greater long-term significance than Mr Rogozin’s other threat to bar the US after 2020 from using the International Space Station. It looks all but certain to relight main engine ignition under the US domestic rocket industry.“For me, there’s no question that the US industry is going to step in and come up with a back-up plan,” says Eric Bernardini, global aerospace and defence leader for AlixPartners, the consultancy. “It may push people to take steps to get free from those Russian engines.”US companies will need to bridge a considerable technological gap with their Russian rivals if the US does decide on a new, domestic programme of rocket development. Costs will also need to come down.However, Mark DeYoung, chief executive of ATK, one of the US’s leading producers of solid-fuel rocket boosters, is confident that the industry will respond.“We’re somewhat optimistic that this will encourage the US to look closer at its own domestic launch capability,” Mr DeYoung told investors on Thursday. “[That] could . . . lead to new missions and new solutions that we could help provide for the country.”The company that started the countdown towards this week’s developments may not ultimately benefit from the changes, however. SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, the serial entrepreneur, first drew widespread attention to the US’s space dependence on Russia last month when it won a subsequently overturned injunction barring ULA or the US Air Force from buying further RD180 engines. SpaceX claimed purchase of the engines was a breach of the US’s sanctions against Mr Rogozin, head of Russia’s space programme.The decision by Russia to target parts of the US space programme is being closely watched in Europe, where more than the supply of one type of rocket engine is at stakeSee belowSpaceX has won some US government business launching civilian satellites but could face challenges proving its vehicles are reliable enough for the military. ULA has an excellent record in an accident-prone industry, having suffered only one serious mishap – when it placed a satellite in the wrong orbit – since it was founded in 2006.“SpaceX clearly believes that it can leverage US dependence on Russian engines to get into the business of launching Pentagon satellites,” says Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.But he goes on: “There’s no way that the Pentagon is going to let SpaceX do those launches without very extensive certification testing.”It is more likely that some of the established participants in the industry will adapt systems used in existing or past US government-linked space programmes to produce new entirely-US rockets.ATK, Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne – part of United Technologies – are all involved in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Space Launch System project. That project – which will use motors originally developed for the Space Shuttle – is intended for the demanding business of sending humans into space – to the moon or, eventually, Mars.Any new engine will have to match the RD180, which needs less fuel for each pound of thrust than existing US equivalents. But developers would have a few years to come up with a solution. ULA has stockpiled two years’ worth of RD180s for launches – and could switch more launches from the Atlas V to its more old-fashioned but wholly US-sourced Delta rockets.We’re somewhat optimistic that this will encourage the US to look closer at its own domestic launch capabilityThe challenge will be to integrate any such novel design into a successfully functioning whole system, according to Mr Bernardini. “The key challenge in a space launcher is system integration,” he says.A successful new launch system could also provide something unusual in the US military budget. The mechanical simplicity of some parts of new engines and their greater fuel efficiency provide simultaneously better and cheaper performance. ULA launches to the geosynchronous orbits that many satellites use cost more than $140m each, according to industry estimates, compared with only around $70m for launches on more modern Chinese rockets.“There’s no trade-off between buying new technology and buying affordable technology because the newest technology would be intrinsically more efficient,” says Mr Thompson.However, even if it proves expensive to provide a new, entirely US-based means of putting sensitive satellites into orbit, few observers believe that will prove a significant deterrent. Mr Rogozin, most believe, has proved that the US can no longer safely continue its post cold-war reliance on Russia’s space industry.“If the US wants to guarantee access to space, it needs its own solution,” Mr Bernardini says. “If that costs additional money, nobody at the end of the day is going to challenge that.”Ventures with strong ties to US face testRussia is one of the biggest players in commercial satellite launches and markets its services internationally through two companies with strong ties to the US, writes Mark Odell in London.International Launch Services is US-based, while Sea Launch has its operations centre in Long Beach, California, although its head office is in Switzerland. Both companies started as Russian-US joint ventures in the commercial satellite market with Lockheed Martin and Boeing respectively.The two big US defence contractors have all but sold out in recent years with the Russian state taking control of the ventures. Boeing still has a small stake in Sea Launch, a Swiss-based company.ILS, based in Reston, Virginia, uses the Proton launch vehicle, which is made by its parent Khrunichev, a Russian state-owned rocket maker. It dominates the heavy-lift market, putting communications satellites into orbit for 30 customers and has conducted about half of all launches in recent years, putting it neck and neck with French rival Arianspace.ILS uses the Baikonur Cosmodrome, leased by the Russian government from Kazakhstan under a long-term arrangement that runs until 2050. It declined to comment on the decision by Moscow to target the US with sanctions.It suffered a blow on Thursday night when the Russian authorities ordered the grounding of the Proton following the failure of a government launch using the rocket, which led to the destruction of a telecommunications satellite.ILS said it would conduct its own investigation into the cause, along with the official probe, before deciding on the timing of future missions it has on its order books. The Proton rocket has now suffered five failures in the past four years.The setback could give a timely boost to Sea Launch, which is 95 per cent owned by Energia, Russia’s biggest space contractor and the leader in manned space exploration.Sea Launch has had a more troubled history. After emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2010 it suffered a launch failure in early 2013 just as it was re-establishing itself in the commercial market.Sea Launch, which uses a specially designed floating platform to blast payloads into orbit from the equator in the Pacific Ocean, uses the Zenit rocket, a joint Ukrainian-Russian vehicle with key components supplied by Boeing.Its big test will come at the end of the month when it due to resume launches with a mission to put a communications satellite, owned by Eutelsat, into orbit.Sergey Gugkaev, Sea Launch’s chief executive, said he was “confident that we have learnt all the lessons from the failure last year”. He added that he believed “cool heads would prevail” after Moscow’s decision to target the US space programme and said he did not expect the spat to affect his company.The Russian government earlier this year suggested it may nationalise Sea Launch but Mr Gugkaev said he had heard no more about the plan although he was “open” to discussions to understand how his company might fit in with ILS.Europe fears breakdown in aerospace co-operationThe decision by Russia to target parts of the US space programme is being closely watched in Europe, where more than the supply of one type of rocket engine is at stake, writes Mark Odell.The European Space Agency is a key partner on the International Space Station but its collaboration with Russia extends into close co-operation in satellite launch vehicles and exploration.“We work with the Russians in several different areas,” says an ESA official, who admitted to being “very concerned by the move to target the US space programme”.But he says there is no indication from Moscow that it had any plans to alter its relationship with Europe, adding that co-operation with Russia was covered by formal agreements between Moscow and ESA member states.Collaboration with the Russian Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos, is crucial for ESA, not least in the area of launch vehicles.ESA, in partnership with Arianespace, the French commercial space launch provider, relies on three types of rockets to put satellites of different weights into orbit from its spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana. The one used to launch medium payloads is the Russian-built Soyuz, which has flown both ESA and Russian missions from a specially built launch pad in Kourou since 2011.The latest version of the Soyuz is based on the same technology that triggered the space race, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into orbit more than 50 years ago. Its evolutionary design makes it highly reliable, a key requirement for a rocket carrying multimillion dollar payloads.ESA has also developed a smaller launch vehicle, dubbed Vega, which uses a final-stage engine to put satellites into orbit that is built in Ukraine and includes Russian technology.Russia is also a key partner in the next European Mars programme, which involves two missions in 2016 and 2018, after Nasa pulled out. Roscosmos is due to supply the lander, or descent module, which would put a rover on to the surface of Mars, pictured, as part of the 2018 mission.Both missions are scheduled to be launched from Russia’s spaceport at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Russian-built Proton rockets.Professor Mark Sims of the University of Leicester, who has been involved in nine space missions including as mission manager of the unsuccessful Beagle 2 Mars lander, says: “Space has not been an area where international politics has really played a role since the end of the cold war and it is an obvious area where Russian expertise and technological knowhow is very important.”He says the decision by Moscow to target the supply of rocket engines to the US “could potentially hit all space programmes quite seriously” if it were allowed to escalate.Back to top
134;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
135;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-05-14T17:57:06Z;Russian space threat may boost US rockets;;Russia’s threat to block exports of critical rocket technology to the US looks set to spur development of new US homegrown rocket systems for the first time since the 1980s, according to industry figures.Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said the Russian threat on Tuesday made it “nearly inevitable” that the US would push ahead with development of its own, new rocket technology.Sergey Gugkaev, chief executive of Sea Launch, a Russian-controlled, US-based satellite launch contractor, acknowledged the likelihood of a new US push but warned it would take years for a new engine to emerge.Professor Mark Sims, a space expert at the University of Leicester in the UK, said Moscow’s decision “could potentially hit all space programmes quite seriously”.Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, announced on Tuesday that Russia would bar further exports of Russian RD-180 engines to the US if they were to be used for military satellite launches. The engines power the rockets used by the United Launch Alliance, the joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that handles the US’s most sensitive military satellite launches.Mr Rogozin also said Russia would bar US access to the International Space Station after 2020. All astronauts travelling to and from the space station currently travel on Russian rockets to and from Kazakhstan’s Baikonur cosmodrome.The Russian move has heightened concern among US policy makers about the US’s reliance on Russian engines for ULA’s Atlas V rocket, which handles military launches for the US Air Force.The US stopped developing new rocket engines after the end of the cold war and has become reliant on Russian breakthroughs that have produced new, more efficient engines. Mr Gugkaev said it was “not a secret” that Russian propulsion systems were “the best in the market”.“This will remain the case for several years at least,” Mr Gugkaev said. “Replacing in particular the Atlas V RD180 with a US domestic engine will take, I would say, five to eight years.”The Russian move had “changed the conversation”, Mr Thompson said: “It makes development of a new American launch vehicle nearly inevitable.”There is already work under way in the US on a new space launch system for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which handles civilian space launches for the US government.Nasa intends to have the new US-made vehicle ready for a test flight in 2017 and to fly crews into deep space by 2021. However, that vehicle will build on existing technology used in the Space Shuttle and other past space programmes and is not intended for travel to the space station.Any new programme would be a “clean sheet” that would build on recent Russian advances, Mr Thompson said.Russia’s decision to target parts of the US space programme has also rung alarm bells in Europe. The European Space Agency is another partner on the International Space Station but its collaboration with Russia extends far beyond that, from launch vehicles to exploration.“The political element that we have seen previously in space has returned so we are watching developments closely but we have had no notification of any actions by Russia,” one ESA official said. He added the co-operation with Russia was covered by formal agreements between Moscow and the ESA member states.
136;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-05-13T21:01:47Z;Russia moves to oust US from International Space Station;;Russia is to deny the US use of the International Space Station beyond 2020 and will bar export of critical rocket engines to the US, in a move that has highlighted American dependence on Russian space technology.Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s deputy prime minister, announced the measures in response to US sanctions against a series of Russian companies and officials over the Ukraine crisis.The twin moves against the space and satellite programmes represent one high-tech niche in which Moscow believes it has leverage over the US.Mr Rogozin pointed out that, following the US’s retirement of its space shuttle fleet amid National Aeronautics and Space Administration cuts in 2011, the US was no longer able to send astronauts to the station on its own.“The Russian segment of the ISS can exist independently from the US one, but the US segment cannot exist independently from the Russian one,” Mr Rogozin said.The effective ban on exports of MK-33 and RD-180 rocket motors could be of greater significance to the US. The RD-180 powers the Atlas rocket used by the United Launch Alliance joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin which puts the US’s most sensitive military satellites into orbit.Mr Rogozin said the exports could continue if the US gave guarantees that the motors would not be used to launch military satellites. But, given ULA’s critical role in the US’s military satellite programme, such guarantees look unlikely.“At the moment, US national security launches are heavily dependent on access to the Russian engine,” Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said.As Moscow’s stand-off with Ukraine escalated in recent months into the worst falling-out with the west since the Cold War, both US and Russian diplomats had noted that the two powers continued to “do business” pragmatically in areas of global significance. “Space is obviously no longer part of that,” said one western diplomat.Washington last month decided to revoke export licences for technology goods that can be used militarily by Russia and to refuse to extend new ones. Washington is also considering new restrictions on the export of high-tech equipment to develop Russia’s energy resources.Moscow’s move against the ISS came in the form of a rejection of a US request to use the station beyond 2020. The ISS, jointly maintained by several countries, has been continuously manned by rotating missions for more than 13 years and is used for research, some of which is considered vital for further space exploration.The move over the rocket motors comes after SpaceX, the space venture of Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors, asked a federal court to bar the ULA from buying RD-180 motors. SpaceX said the purchases breached US sanctions against Mr Rogozin, who is also head of Russia’s space programme. SpaceX, which already carries out some launches of less sensitive satellites for the US government, does not use Russian engines and would like to break into launching the most sensitive satellites.ULA said neither it nor NPO Energomash, its Russian supplier, had been made aware of any restrictions. But, if reports of the move were accurate, they affirmed that SpaceX’s “irresponsible actions” had created “unnecessary distractions, threatened US military satellite operations, and undermined [the US’s] future relationship with the International Space Station”.“We are hopeful that our two nations will engage in productive conversations over the coming months that will resolve the matter quickly,” ULA said.ULA added that it could switch to a second vehicle – Boeing’s Delta rocket – which used US-built motors and could meet all its customers’ needs. It also had a two-year supply of RD-180 motors “to enable a smooth transition to our other rocket”.Mr Thompson said the US military strongly favoured using ULA for its most sensitive launches because of its flawless record of putting satellites safely into orbit. Most other rocket systems continue to suffer regular launch failures that destroy vehicle payloads.“The Ukraine crisis has made policy makers reflect on the wisdom of relying on Russia for any type of lift requirements, either manned or unmanned,” Mr Thompson said.Three astronauts – one American, one Russian and one Japanese – were due to leave the ISS in the early evening on Tuesday US eastern time to return to earth. They were due to land near Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan. A further three astronauts – one American, one Russian and one German – are due to blast off for the space station from Kazakhstan on May 28.The Russian segment of the ISS can exist independently from the US one, but the US segment cannot exist independently from the Russian oneAssuming Russia does not reconsider, its decision on the ISS could strengthen China, which aims to have its own space station by 2020 and is currently excluded from the ISS – chiefly because of opposition from the US.Mr Rogozin said Moscow would not impose sanctions of its own, and would not obstruct the work of US astronauts. However, he called the US an “unreliable” technology partner and said the government was therefore seeking to intensify work with other countries.Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, is due to present new plans for space exploration to parliament. Mr Rogozin said it was looking to redirect funds from manned space flight to other, more promising areas and had been advised to seek co-operation with Asian countries.Russia also threatened to switch off 11 GPS ground stations on its territory unless the US agrees to its request to establish a similar station for its own satellite position system Glonass in the US. The GPS ground stations would be suspended from June 1 and switched off on September 1 if a bilateral working group failed to reach consensus on the Glonass issue, Mr Rogozin said.GPS, on which services such as navigation and mapping apps rely, would still work as its satellites continue to operate. But it would lose accuracy because the ground stations help correct the satellite data.
137;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-04-22T11:26:23Z;Lockheed shrugs off decline in US defence spending;;Lockheed Martin defied a sharp fall in its income from the US military to increase its projected full-year earnings after significantly better than expected first-quarter results.The figures reflect how some of the US’s biggest military contractors, which are building some of the country’s most sensitive new weapons, are managing to boost international sales and increase margins despite across-the-board spending cuts.The world’s biggest military contractor by sales raised its forecast for 2014 earnings per share from a $10.25-$10.55 range to $10.50-$10.80, despite an unchanged net sales forecast of $44bn to $45.5bn. First-quarter net income increased 23 per cent against last year to $933m, on net sales down 3.8 per cent to $10.7bn.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said the company expected its income from the US defence department to fall 6 per cent this year, on top of a 4 per cent drop last year. But the company expects international sales to make up 20 per cent of turnover, from 17 per cent last year. Other aspects of the performance reflected the company’s strong performance against the benchmarks in its Pentagon contracts.“I think we’re off to a good start in 2014, building upon a strong performance in 2013,” Mr Tanner said.Lockheed Martin is the main contractor for some of the US military’s most important projects, including the F-35 joint strike fighter, which is the world’s biggest military project and which Mr Tanner said would account for up to 25 per cent of Lockheed’s revenue at its peak in 2018.Some analysts have suggested that such strategically important, big programmes are likely to survive across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts better than smaller ones.Mr Tanner said Lockheed had spent “quite a bit of time” positioning its businesses so that they were closely aligned with their customers’ “strategic needs”.“I think that has helped us to weather some of the sequestration storm – although we are down 10 per cent over the last two years,” he said.The core aeronautics division reported operating profits up 4 per cent to $393m, on sales up 6 per cent to $3.93bn. The company attributed the increases mainly to reduced risk in its C-130 transport aircraft programme and faster construction of F-35s.Operating profits in the information systems and global solutions unit, which has suffered more than other segments from spending cuts, fell 8 per cent to $174m, on sales down 9 per cent to $1.91bn.Operating profits in all the other three divisions – missiles and fire control, mission systems and training and space systems – were higher on lower sales. Missiles’ operating profits rose 4 per cent to $358m, on sales down 6 per cent to $1.87bn, while mission systems’ profits increased 24 per cent to $250m, on sales down 11 per cent to $1.63bn. Space systems’ profits increased 10 per cent to $254m, on sales down 5 per cent to $1.86bn.Some $101m of the $172m increase in net income stemmed from changes in pension and other one-off charges, which depressed last year’s first-quarter net income by $48m, while boosting this year’s figure by $53m.First-quarter earnings per share, which rose 23 per cent to $2.87, were depressed by an increase in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of the ending of research and development tax credits. The credit boosted first quarter 2013 EPS by 14 cents a share to $2.33. Lockheed said it would record R&D credits for the first quarter of 2014 if legislation re-enacting the credit was passed.Lockheed’s shares were down 0.9 per cent in late morning trading in New York at $160.07.
138;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;US hears conflicting accounts on Lockheed’s $400bn F-35 fighter;;It is either comfortably on track to forming the cornerstone of the western world’s militaries or a flop so unairworthy that lightning could down it. The US public has this week been presented with sharply contrasting takes on the world’s biggest-ever military procurement project.Which account of the development of the F-35 joint strike fighter gains the ascendancy will be critical to the future defence of not only the US but also at least 13 other countries that intend to use the super-advanced aircraft.It will also be critical to Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, the main recipient of the US government’s expected $12.6bn average annual spending over the next 23 years for the 2,443 US aircraft on order.However, there remains strikingly little common-ground between proponents of the opposing views of the aircraft, which the US alone is projected to spend at least $400bn to buy.Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says the F-35 is set to be as “stealthy” – invisible to enemy radar, a key attribute for the aircraft – as it was designed to be.“It’s the most stealthy aircraft that the United States or its European allies are likely to field in the next few decades,” Mr Thompson says. “It can do all its missions.”Winslow Wheeler, director of the military reform project at Project on Government Oversight, a think-tank, says a government report leaked this week on the programme is only the latest evidence suggesting it should be scrapped.“The fundamental design of the aircraft itself and the acquisition programme – fatally flawed doesn’t do it justice,” Mr Wheeler says.The controversy over the F-35, which was first conceived more than 20 years ago, reignited this week after the premature release online of a section on the F-35 of the annual report of the US defence department’s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT & E).The report lists scores of problems facing the programme, including the peeling-off of parts of the aircraft’s stealth coating after extended use of its engines’ afterburners, unpredictable airborne handling and troublesome software.

Israel, Japan and Korea have also said they will buy the aircraft.Lockheed last year completed 35 of the aircraft, which have been coming off its production line in Fort Worth, Texas, since 2006.Mr Thompson says that, regardless of whether it was right to embark on such a vast programme for so many different military roles, it is currently the best option available.“There is no better alternative in terms of superior performance at a better price,” he says.Mr Wheeler, however, insists the DOT & E report shows a programme running into ever deeper problems and ever less likely to meet the demands put upon it.That, he says, is a result of two decades during which successive US administrations have “ignored” warnings about the programme’s shortcomings.“The chickens are coming home to roost and they continue to pay no attention,” he says.
139;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-01-24T20:59:18Z;UK poised to place order for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets;;Britain is about to commit to the world’s most advanced and expensive fighter jet, after years of controversy and indecision, placing its first order for the US Joint Strike Fighter.The UK is expected to order up to 14 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, made by US defence company Lockheed Martin and valued at more than £1bn, people close to the decision said.After years of delays in the US programme, where the UK is the biggest international partner, U British prime minister David Cameron made one of the coalition’s most embarrassing and costly U-turns two years ago, reverting to the aircraft carrier version of the F-35.Analysts and Ministry of Defence officials estimate that the switch cost at least £300m in technical changes.Britain’s decision to order the first batch of the aircraft comes as the F-35 was attacked last week by the Pentagon’s chief tester, who raised concerns in a report to Congress that the jet may not be ready in time for a US Marines’ deadline next year.The report noted the “unacceptable” performance of the fighter jet’s software and warned that testing could be delayed for more than a year.The F-35 is the US’s next generation jet fighter, meant to take on the capabilities of several jet fighters in one and be almost undetectable.But myriad technical challenges have caused years of delays and increased costs 70 per cent, making it the most expensive weapons programme ever at a lifetime cost of $1.5tn.Washington has pushed its closest allies to help defray the cost and buy the F-35, with Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey becoming development partners and Israel and Japan recently agreeing to buy the jet.South Korea is also widely expected to choose the jet, a relief for the programme, many of whose initial partners have slashed order numbers because of the economic crisis.Francis Tusa, an independent defence analyst, said Britain had little choice but to order F-35s this year if it wanted its aircraft carriers to be operational by 2019, as planned.He acknowledged that some would say the UK aircraft carrier, which alone costs £6.2bn, was an act of national posturing. But Mr Tusa noted that, by the end of the decade, Britain would again have “one of those capabilities that is at the pinnacle of power projection and that very few other countries have.“Bearing in mind some of the doubts and uncertainties that have surrounded the F-35 as a programme in past years, any substantive order by the UK is a major boost.”The cost to the UK taxpayer is still unknown because the MoD has not yet made a final decision about how many aircraft it will buy and the cost of each fighter depends on the date it is ordered.Initial pledges were for 138 aeroplanes but as the UK budget crisis hit and the cost of each fighter grew, that number began to shrink. The latest estimates are for a total order of 48.Britain’s first batch of up to 14 jets will be able to take off and land vertically and are expected to be delivered in late 2017, go into service in 2018 and be ready to deploy on the UK’s new aircraft carriers in 2019.In the US, British pilots are already testing three of the four test aircraft that the UK has ordered.About 15 per cent of the F-35 is made by BAE Systems. Britain’s biggest defence company makes the fighter’s rear fuselage at its site in Samlesbury, Lancashire and the avionics that control its weapons in the US.Lockheed Martin, BAE and the MoD declined to comment on the British order.
140;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-01-23T18:42:37Z;Lockheed Martin squeezed by US defence cuts;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest military contractor, on Thursday revealed the impact of the US’s military spending slowdown when it announced that fourth-quarter net income was below expectations and forecast declining revenue for 2014.Net earnings for the quarter fell 14 per cent year on year to $488m, on net sales down 4.7 per cent to $11.5bn. Diluted earnings per share – at $1.50 – were well below the $2.00 analysts had expected.However, Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said she was “proud” of the “great work” by the company’s staff during the year and that she hoped 2013 would mark a “bottoming out” for the industry.The company’s shares were down 3.93 per cent in New York, closing at $150.49.Fourth-quarter profits fell short of expectations not only because of declining US military spending but because of a series of one-off charges. They included a $195m non-cash charge for goodwill impairment at part of Lockheed’s missile systems and fire control division, $171m of charges for workforce reductions and a separate $25m in special charges for job cuts in the aeronautics division. Lockheed announced 4,000 job cuts in November.Military contractors have been exposed to a mixture of across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts and the impact of the US’s military drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan.Ms Hewson said a new congressional budget deal agreed in December and passed last week pointed to a “level” budget for the defence department for the next two years.Lockheed forecast that 2014 sales would decline further from the $45.4bn for 2013, to a range of between $44bn and $45.5bn. It forecast a profits recovery for the current year to a range of $10.25 to $10.55 per share, however.Nov 2013: Nato defence budgets have been cut drastically in the past three years, yet global military spending has not changed because of big purchases in the Gulf and Asia.Ms Hewson promised a continued focus on cost-cutting in the austere budgetary environment and stressed Lockheed’s efforts to boost its non-US sales.The biggest sales decline was in the missiles and fire control division, where fourth-quarter sales fell 9 per cent to $1.72bn. Operating profit, however, increased 29 per cent to $350m as older systems became more profitable to supply.In the core aeronautics division, which builds the F35, the world’s biggest military project, sales for the quarter declined 5.9 per cent to $3.9bn and operating profits fell 7 per cent to $414m. The division suffered from reduced volumes of C130 transport aircraft, F22 fighters, lower volumes in the F35 project and fewer deliveries of F16 fighters.Ms Hewson said there was “strong congressional support” for the F35 programme and the company planned to increase production levels this year, bringing down the cost per aircraft.
141;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-01-23T17:35:49Z;US airlines drop despite profit growth;;US airlines United Continental Holdings and Southwest stumbled on Thursday as earnings season continued its brisk pace and equity markets declined.Shares in United fell as much as 4 per cent to $47.00 before recovering to close at $48.33, after the company said passenger revenue per available seat mile would be flat to 2 per cent in the current quarter.The guidance, from the parent company of United Air Lines, was coupled with the airline’s quarterly results, which showed the carrier swung to a profit of $140m, or 37 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss of $620m a year earlier. Sales increased 7 per cent from a year earlier to $9.3bn in the fourth quarter.Shares in Southwest ended 2.39 per cent lower at $21.25 even after the group reported a 172 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit. Net income increased to $212m, or 30 cents per diluted share, on sales of $4.4bn.The declines on Thursday follow a strong start for the airline sector in 2014, with carriers making up five of the top six performing stocks in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.Nutrition company Herbalife declined on Thursday after Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts sent letters to US regulators calling for an investigation into the company’s business practices.The senator’s questions follow investor Bill Ackman’s contention that Herbalife operates a pyramid scheme, which the company has vigorously denied.“I have seen reports from Massachusetts residents that suggest Herbalife is a pyramid scheme,” Senator Markey wrote in a letter dated Wednesday.Shares tumbled 10.38 per cent to $65.90 following the announcement.US defence company Lockheed Martin fell 3.93 per cent in New York, ending at $150.50 following its quarterly results, which showed the sixth quarter of sales declines.Profits dropped to $488m, or $1.50 a share, for the quarter from $569m, or $1.73, a year earlier. Overall revenues fell to $11.5bn from $12.09bn.The company, which has been trimming costs and jobs as the pockets of its largest customer, the US government, shrink, said it was hit by fewer deliveries of its military jets in the period.Netflix led the S&P 500 on Thursday, after the company reported a sixfold increase in profits in the fourth quarter and a 2.3m increase in domestic subscribers after market close on Wednesday.The streaming movie and television provider said profits rose to $48.4m, or 79 cents per diluted share. Sales increased 24 per cent to $1.2bn in the three months ending December.The domestic subscription gains were at the high end of the company’s earlier guidance and the company said it was seeing improvements in its international operations, which now count more than 10m members. Shares rose 16.48 per cent to $388.72.Union Pacific advanced 3.36 per cent to $174.17 after posting its first rise in volumes for six quarters, helped by more shipments of agriculture, cars and industrial goods. The railroad said it saw signs the US economy was “slowly strengthening”.Chief executive Jack Koraleski said the railroad had been able to pass along higher prices to customers and had growth across most of the goods it moves.Profits at the largest US railroad rose 13 per cent from a year earlier to $1.2bn, or $2.55 a share, topping Wall Street forecasts. Sales increased 7 per cent from a year ago to $5.6bn.Overall, US markets declined sharply on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 more than 1 per cent lower since the year began. A report from the labour department showed initial jobless claims rose 1,000 from a week earlier to 326,000, while existing home sales climbed by a better than expected 1 per cent in December.“Both series indicate an economy that is doing quite well, almost at normal levels,” Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey said. “The only concern is the sudden loss of emergency unemployment benefits.”The S&P 500 fell 0.89 per cent to 1,828.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.07 per cent to 16,197.35, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.57 per cent to 4,218.87.
142;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2014-01-07T20:11:51Z;McAfee no more;;John McAfee has his name back. The controversial anti-virus software entrepreneur had been sharing it with Intel since 2011. But after his bizarre exploits in Belize became prime tabloid fodder more than a year ago, it seemed only a matter of time before the association went the way of history.It wasn’t as though Mr McAfee didn’t see it coming. This was what he had to say last month, after an Intel executive hinted that the chipmaker would be dropping the McAfee name from the security software business it bought for nearly $8bn:It seems that the big honchos at McAfee Corp have decided to set me free once and for all from the negative impact that our shared name has brought to my brand and image.Intel duly obliged, with an announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show this week that it would rebrand its anti-virus division as the far less exciting Intel Security.Mr McAfee has waited a long time to get back the exclusive rights to the name he was born with. After all, it is two decades since he cut his ties with the anti-virus company he had founded as a side-project while working as a developer at Lockheed.There’s no word from Intel on why is has acted now. But when Mr McAfee fled Belize after authorities there named him a suspect in a November 2012 murder, it was just the latest in a long string of personal incidents that threatened to shine an unwelcome name on Intel’s new security software brand. He claimed that he feared for his safety. No charges were brought.Until recently, the corporate heirs to the McAfee name seemed to ascribe considerable value to it. In its final annual report as an independent company, McAfee listed “brand name recognition and reputation” as one of its key assets.Intel subsequently put a value of $821m on the trade names it assumed with the acquisition, though didn’t say how much of that was for the privilege of using Mr McAfee’s personal moniker.But it seems more than happy to hand it back now for nothing.
143;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-12-19T21:48:45Z;Gripen outmanoeuvres bigger rivals in Brazilian dogfight;;"When Europe’s Typhoon lost the battle against Sweden’s smaller, cheaper Gripen to be Switzerland’s new fighter jet last year, one Italian defence company executive could not hide his surprise and disdain.“They test-drove a Ferrari and a Fiat Punto and chose the Punto,” he said.This week, Saab proved that victory was no fluke when the Gripen again defeated bigger competitors – the Rafale from Dassault of France, and the F/A-18 Super Hornet made by Boeing, the US’s largest defence and aerospace company – to win an order for 36 jets worth $4.5bn from Brazil.Gripen’s growing popularity is a serious concern for the big aerospace companies – such as EADS, Finmeccanica, BAE, and Dassault of Europe, and Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US – because they are relying on export orders to make up for the increasingly straitened defence orders in their home markets.For years Saab’s executives have had to fight the image that their cheaper jet fighter was also far less capable than bigger competitors, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, which is made by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica, three of Europe’s biggest defence companies with combined sales of nearly €100bn and about 300,000 employees. Saab has sales of €2.87bn, generated by 14,000 people.“There are views in this industry [that] if it’s not expensive it’s not good. In which type of other industry do you have that?” Håkan Buskhe, Saab’s chief executive, said in an interview in September. He added: “Even if you buy an extremely good car today, they talk about fuel efficiency and things like that.”The Gripen is indeed like the Punto in one way – not everyone is in the market for a big, expensive racing car when a more nimble, compact city automobile will do. The Gripen is smaller and cheaper and has lower maintenance bills than its competitors.“If you are not a country that wants to bomb areas with really strong air defences on day one of a war, you have to take the Gripen very seriously,” says Sash Tusa, an independent defence analyst. “If you want to defend your nation against most things, show that you have sovereignty over your air and sea, then your best bet is Gripen.”As well as price, Saab has been successful in offering sweeteners, or offsets, to win deals. Countries such as Brazil put strong emphasis on how much of the fighters’ technology the bidder is able and willing to share and how much of it will be built within its borders, both factors that helped Saab clinch this week’s deal.Analysts reckon Gripen’s next potential wins could be in eastern Europe and the Baltic states. Latin America and Asia are also on its radar.The big aerospace companies have relied on the political backing of military powers, such as the US, France and UK, that fund their development. Their most sophisticated jets have bigger and more fine-tuned radars; bigger weapons loads; a better ability to hide from the enemy; and more range before needing to refuel.They compete in important military nations, such as the UK, the US, and those at imminent risk of war, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia. But until now they also thought they had the upper hand in a much wider range of markets.Markets such as Brazil have become increasingly important as big powers have cut back military spending and the US heavily promotes Lockheed Martin’s F-35, its newest and costliest, super-stealthy fighter, to the countries that can afford it.Gripen’s win in Brazil will have the biggest repercussions for Dassault, the French defence company that makes the Rafale. It also lost to Gripen in Switzerland.France, gripped by the fiscal downturn, this summer slashed its Rafale order by half. Officials have even threatened to shut its production line if Dassault is unable to drum up more sales. Successive French presidents have tirelessly travelled worldwide to help sell their national fighter, most recently to Brazil last week.Dassault was widely expected to win Brazil, which would have offered it a new lifeline.However, its chances of a win in the UAE leapt yesterday, when BAE announced Rafale’s main rival Typhoon had not been picked.But India that will prove most critical for Dassault. Last year, Rafale edged out Typhoon to become New Delhi’s first choice, but contract negotiations have been strained and could still lead to a reversal of fortune, analysts and defence executives say.A sign of how much Gripen’s unexpected win in Brazil has rattled the industry, and especially Dassault, came only hours after the decision.Dassault sent out an angry statement, listing what it saw as Gripen’s shortcomings and noted that the performance of the Swedish aircraft did not match that of Rafale.Gripen “does not belong to the same category as the Rafale,” the statement said.Gripen supporters might agree, to a degree. But with the second important export win and a 30 per cent surge in its share-price, Saab is laughing all the way to the production line, which now has an order backlog of more than a decade.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Saab best for UK aircraft carriers / From Mr Edward Longinotti"
144;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-11-22T06:50:27Z;South Korea agrees Lockheed stealth fighter jets deal;;South Korea has agreed to buy 40 F-35A fighter aircraft from Lockheed Martin, putting its air force on the same level as China and Japan in next-generation stealth jet technology.Seoul surprised many observers in September by reopening its tender for 60 fighter jets , confounding predictions that it was poised to select Boeing's F-15 aircraft. Boeing’s bid had been the only one that met the stated $8bn cost limit.On Friday, the defence ministry said the F-15 and Eurofighter’s Typhoon did not meet its revised technical requirements, leaving only the F-35, which has stealth capabilities that allow it to escape detection by modern radar systems.The 40 F-35 jets would be delivered beginning in 2018, the country’s joint chiefs of staff said, adding that Seoul will continue to ponder the procurement of the remaining 20 aircraft that it requires. They did not reveal the value of the deal.“We have changed our [requirements] because the next-generation fighter jets should be able to attack targets after infiltrating into the enemy's territory secretly and to cope with North Korea's realised nuclear and missile threats,” they said in a statement.However, they said they had also taken account of “neighbouring countries’ stealth capabilities” – a reference to Japan, which ordered 42 F-35 jets in 2011, and China, which is developing a plane with similar specifications, the Chengdu J-20.“We don’t want to call it an arms race but . . . there is an understanding that the strategic balance in northeast Asia needs to be maintained with China and Japan – especially the latter,” said Jon Grevatt, an analyst at the defence consultancy IHS.Recent political debate in Tokyo over revising the country’s pacifist constitution has sparked alarm in Seoul amid a bitter dispute over Japan’s imperial history and this “must have been a factor” in South Korea’s decision to procure the most advanced fighter jet on the market, Mr Grevatt added.The decision to buy only 40 jets was in line with previous speculation that South Korea would reduce the volume of its order to secure the F-35 without exceeding its stated budget.The defence ministry said it still planned to purchase a further 20 fighter jets, to be introduced from 2023, and would “reconsider the requirements” as it moves on to this second stage of the tender. This leaves open the possibility of an order – albeit much smaller than it had hoped – for Boeing, which responded to the announcement by saying it remained confident that the F-15 was “what Korea needs to meet its defence needs”.But the likelihood of an order for F-15s was slim, said Yang Uk, a researcher at the Korea Defense and Security Forum. “Once they’ve decided to go for the F-35, they are unlikely to buy other types of fighter jets, given the economies of scale. The more they buy, the more they can negotiate down the prices.”The price for the 40 F-35s was likely to have been about Won7tn ($6.6bn), he estimated.To win the deal . . . Lockheed Martin promised to help South Korea build its own . . . fighterFor Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, the sale will be a relief. Though it is so far weathering well the worst defence downturn in 20 years – it’s share price is close to all time highs – analysts predict the streak will not last much longer as US defence cuts begin to accelerate in the coming two years.Its F35 programme, whose engines are made by Pratt & Whitney of the US and which has BAE Systems of the UK as its main international partner, has been especially troubled by years of delays caused by technical setbacks and cost overruns. This has prompted some of its cash-strapped customers, including the governments of the UK and Canada, to reduce their orders or reconsider buying the jet altogether.To win the deal for it’s super stealthy fighter, Lockheed Martin promised to help South Korea build its own radar-evading fighter.
145;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-11-14T18:48:23Z;Jobs go at Lockheed as cuts bite;;"Lockheed Martin has announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs and close four factories, in the clearest sign yet of how across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts are feeding through into redundancies.The decision by Lockheed, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, follows a number of other, less high-profile moves, including the decision last month by the UK’s BAE to close a tank factory in Sealy, Texas, next year with the loss of 325 jobs. Other manufacturers are expected to announce similar closures as the cuts start to feed through into reductions in work.Lockheed said it would close plants in Newtown, Pennsylvania; Akron, Ohio; Goodyear, Arizona, and Horizon City, Texas. It would close four buildings at its site in Sunnyvale, California. The Newtown and Sunnyvale facilities both build satellites, while Akron, Goodyear and Horizon City all work on aspects of weapons systems. The job cuts represent almost 4 per cent of the company’s US workforce.The closures are the biggest single announcement of job cuts by a military contractor since across-the-board sequestration spending cuts came into force on March 1. Under sequestration, which was passed as part of the compromise that ended the 2011 stand-off over the US’s debt ceiling, nearly all the US defence department’s budgets have been cut by 10 per cent.The cuts’ effects have been slow to emerge because so much defence procurement spending is paid for from money put aside from previous years’ budgets. For the largest, most complex items such as naval vessels money is set aside up to seven years before being spent.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said the closures showed that Lockheed did not expect the defence spending downturn to end any time soon.“These closures will not be the last,” Mr Thompson said. “I expect that Lockheed’s competitors will be making similar moves in the months ahead.”The closures are the biggest single announcement of job cuts by a military contractor since across-the-board sequestration spending cuts came into force on March 1Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed’s chief executive, said plant closures and redundancies were among the toughest decisions the company had to make. But she went on: “In the face of government budget cuts and an increasingly complex global security landscape, these actions are necessary for the future of our business.”Contractors’ services businesses, which are paid for from current-year budgets, have suffered particularly severely, as have areas such as ground combat vehicles.However, there are signs that even the biggest, longest-term projects are starting to feel the effects. The defence department announced in September that it was delaying awarding a contract to build the next of its Ford class aircraft carriers because of the cuts.Lockheed’s shares rose 0.44 per cent to $137.86."
146;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Military aspirations for speed pave the way for civilian flight;Passenger transport has been stuck below the speed of sound since the demise of Concorde;That Lockheed Martin is working on a hypersonic aircraft capable of six times the speed of sound is confirmation that speed is still a prime motivator in plane design.The US aircraft maker’s successor to its SR-71 Blackbird high-flying surveillance plane, which flew between from the 1960s to the 1990s, is intended to be a similar military vehicle – but almost twice as fast, with a capability of more than 4,500mph.Huge velocities are of military value because the faster you fly, the harder you are to shoot down. But as tracking and targeting technologies improve, invulnerability is considered transient at best, if not illusory. Gary Powers experienced as much in 1960 when his U-2 spy plane, a predecessor of the Blackbird, was shot down by a Soviet missile.But speed is important to all of us because while we can streamline the way we do things and save seconds, minutes or hours, time itself remains stubbornly resistant to being extended or compressed. Particularly since the microprocessor arrived, we can invent, manufacture, clean, wash, mend quicker. We can process information much quicker, and in that way almost think quicker. But the time taken to travel has not changed, essentially, in decades.India provides an illustration of this. As I touched on in a recent column, traffic on the road spans centuries of change – from camel carts to luxury saloons that are governed down to 155mph. But the speed limits as well as the velocities that people drive at are still low, considering the wide variety of transport methods sharing ever busier roads.We can process information much quicker, and in that way almost think quicker. But the time taken to travel has not changed, essentially, in decadesIn the air, passenger transport has been stuck below the speed of sound since the demise of Concorde. The aircraft was always doomed because political wranglings prevented its effective use across the US. The American rulemaking that fatally limited the Anglo-French supersonic aircraft is still in place, banning the breaking of the sound barrier over land.That has also kept most designers of passenger aircraft stuck at speeds that were achieved in what now seem like the early days of aviation – when most passenger planes still had propellers. A typical cruising airliner cruising speed is about Mach 0.85.Despite that, some efforts to work around that cap on speed persist. The Aerionsupersonic business jet is one recent example – that project is still stranded in the nearly-sphere as it has no builder. But it would have to stay near the velocities of conventional aircraft over most countries to keep within the speed limits anyway. Gulfstream, though, has also been working on ways to lessen the supersonic boom.Lockheed’s Mach 6 plans almost put to shame the attempts of US plane makers Cessna and Gulfstream and their vying to have the accolade of fastest business jet – the laurels were worn proudly for many years by Kansas-based Cessna for its Citation X. Cessna has won back the crown with the reworked version of the same aircraft, which has a high-speed cruise of Mach 0.935, but the margin over the Mach 0.925 of Gulfstream’s ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G650 is paltry.Moving people around the planet faster is bound to come. Even if many of those journeys are not necessary, as green campaigners are fond of saying. That genie is out of the bottle. Traffic on the roads will not go much more rapidly until drivers are taken out of the equation. The growth of high-speed rail networks is a better option, but the progress of such schemes is painfully slow. High-speed vacuum tubes are a delightful prospect, but substantial technological barriers have to be broken through.In the longer term, air transport can use technologies such as the UK’s Sabre air-breathing rocket and the reusable rockets of Elon Musk’s SpaceX for ultrarapid ballistic journeys. But they too are at present pie in the sky. Hypersonic aircraft, even if Lockheed can keep to a target of 2030 for entry into service of the SR-72, are also a long way away.But supersonic air transport is current, even old, technology. The SR-71 could cross the US in about an hour, or the Atlantic in two. And it did that four decades ago.Supersonic aircraft can use the existing infrastructure, too. All that is needed is regulatory change. That would then give passengers what, in real effect, will be time travel.
147;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed Martin is confident of winning $8bn F-35 fighter order;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, is confident of its chances of selling South Korea its F-35 fighter, despite its initial failure to qualify in a competitive tender.It would mark a victory for the US aerospace company and the F-35 programme if it won South Korea’s tender, likely to be worth $8bn, as it seeks new international orders to offset development costs.Stephen O’Bryan, vice-president of F-35 programme integration for Lockheed, said costs per aircraft were falling as production of the fifth-generation fighter increased, making it more affordable for countries such as Korea.South Korean procurement officials initially said that only Boeing’s fourth-generation F15 fighter came within its cost parameters and handed the decision on whether to purchase the aircraft to the country’s cabinet.The cabinet instead opted to reopen the tender, a move that was widely seen as reflecting convictions within the country’s military that it needed the F-35 in case of future wars.Both Russia and China – key backers of North Korea, the neighbour with which South Korea is still formally in a state of war – are developing “fifth-generation” fighters – distinguished by their lack of visibility to radar and their superior communications and threat detection systems – to compete with the F-35.The F-35 is the only fifth-generation fighter under development in countries allied to the US. A series of US allies – Australia, Canada, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Turkey and the United Kingdom – have already agreed to buy some.“We look forward to their decision,” Mr O’Bryan said of South Korea. “We believe the F-35 meets the requirements of Korea. This is a stealthy, fifth-generation supersonic aircraft that’s not only going to be relevant today but relevant for the next 40-plus years.”Charges for the F-35 programme – which could cost the US government as much as $1.5tn over the aircraft’s lifetime – have escalated as problems with integrating electronic and hardware systems have mounted.While he said Lockheed was not “declaring victory” in the battle against excessive costs, Mr O’Bryan insisted costs for the aircraft were falling compared with 2007, when production started.“From the first year of production to the seventh year, we’ve reduced the price of the aircraft by more than 55 per cent,” Mr O’Bryan said.The US government estimated that by 2018 each aircraft would cost $85m, adjusted for inflation. “That’s on a par with any fourth-generation and earlier aircraft,” Mr O’Bryan said.A test-flight programme – which has suffered some hold-ups from US sequestration spending cuts – is under way for the first aircraft. However, Mr O’Bryan said that the cuts would not delay the aircraft’s projected entry into service in 2015.

A classic example of the difficulties and challenges is the F-35 joint-strike fighter, a 50-year, $1.5tn programme that has flown into turbulence caused by excessive complexity and rising costs.Originally presented as a cost-effective means of replacing diverse fleets with a single type, it now threatens to reduce customer fighter forces to numerically ineffective levels.Built by Lockheed Martin of the US with the UK’s BAE Systems as a prime contractor, the F-35 was created to fulfil every task – attacking well-defended targets, supporting ground troops and matching opposing jets in air to air combat.But the aircraft has become a victim of its own broad remit. Its radical stealth characteristics play well with politicians and the public who relish the idea of an “invisible” jet. However, stealth comes at a price way beyond the expense it adds to design and construction.A stealthy fighter is slower and less manoeuvrable than conventional rivals, and needs to conceal weapons in an internal bay to maintain a sleek, radar-evading profile. Contrary to popular opinion, a stealth aircraft is not invisible, but is much harder to detect on existing radars, thus giving the pilot more time to attack a well-defended target.Energetic radar development in both Russia and China may see this advantage watered down by the 2020s, as ever more sophisticated radars enter the export market.The internal weapons carriage of the F-35 is limited, meaning that for many of the missions flown by Nato jets over Libya or Afghanistan the aircraft would need to carry bombs and missiles on external pylons. Because these weapons and their pylons protrude under the wing they eliminate the vastly expensive stealth aspect of the airframe, while the manoeuvrability penalties of stealth design remain to hamper the jet’s combat agility.As stealth means deleting any radar-reflecting outlines, the F-35 cockpit canopy is set low, almost flush with the fuselage. Pilots on test squadrons in the US have noted how this eliminates the fine view from raised cockpits on established fighter designs such as the F-16. Despite high-tech sensors in the F-35, clear vision is still highly valued by military air crew and is yet another sacrifice made to stealth.The F-35 emerged from plans to kit out the US Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps with a single basic type, adapted for each service’s needs. Their widely varying requirements would be catered for by building three versions, with a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) model to replace the Harrier jets flown by the Marines.The genius of the British-designed Harrier lies in its Rolls-Royce engine, which directs jet thrust through four nozzles that can be rotated for take-off, level flight and landing. The same engine parts that allow the Harrier to hover are also used in conventional flight, so no weight penalty is incurred by the STOVL capability.By contrast the STOVL F-35 dispenses with this innovation in favour of a separate lift fan embedded behind the pilot’s cockpit. This takes thrust from the main engine and directs it downwards for slow and vertical landings on aircraft carriers. The lift fan has no other purpose than for edging into a small landing zone, but adds considerably to the aircraft’s weight and fuel burn in flight.To make matters worse, the lift fan also eats into fuselage space, reducing the size of the internal weapons bay. So the STOVL version, on order for the UK’s RAF and Royal Navy as well as the Marines, will be able to sport only a pair of bombs and two self-defence missiles unless it resorts to stealth-busting underwing weapon pylons. The fighter will be deployed on the UK’s two new aircraft carriers, the cost for which was revealed in early November to have risen to £6.2bn.Squeezing stealth and other leading-edge digital capabilities into one airframe has pushed the F-35’s costs up and killed off the notion of an affordable jet for all-comers. The US still has a nominal 2,443 F-35s on order. Whether this number will survive US budget restraints is doubtful. Economic pressures elsewhere have seen orders trimmed back amid mounting criticism.A Dutch order for 85 F-35s has been slashed to just 37 aircraft costing €4.5bn. How these are supposed to replace an existing force of 68 F-16s plus 20 spares is anybody’s guess. This relentless downward curve in the size of Nato fighter fleets is worrying planners tasked with deploying jets to crisis zones.Canada has put a planned purchase on hold, while it considers more cost-effective alternatives. And with each reduction in orders, the economics of the entire programme come under question. A huge order book is essential to keep the unit cost down. Some Washington critics have spoken of a “death spiral”, whereby each cut in orders adds to the unit price and ultimately brings the whole programme crashing to earth.Lockheed Martin says that technical problems, a protracted development schedule and soaring costs are all now under control. And F-35 design and assembly is spread across US industry, creating a significant political momentum. Douglas Barrie, senior analyst at The International Institute for Strategic Studies, thinks the death spiral outcome is unlikely, but admits that significant US cutbacks could change the entire picture.The US Navy is not as committed to the F-35 as it might be, with existing conventional jets still in production and an advanced, unmanned bomber under testing. A promised work share of more than 10 per cent for the UK, with BAE Systems building rear fuselages, means that British participation is guaranteed whatever the jet’s handicaps.“Retrospectively, you’d not try to design one aircraft to do so many different jobs,” says Mr Barrie. The programme will probably survive because of economic rather than military logic. But it is clear that we will not see an attempt to shoehorn such radically different requirements into one pricey airframe again.
149;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-11-05T00:15:00Z;Worst may still be to come for defence sector;The big names have made deep cuts but budget reductions could be deeper still;As US lawmakers squabbled over how to reduce the national deficit, increasing the risk they would trigger deep, indiscriminate cuts to the world’s largest defence budget, the chief executive of the world’s biggest defence company, warned the effect on the industry would be devastating.In March, despite all the shrill cries of doom from military and industry leaders, those cuts – a further 10 per cent across the board reduction – became a reality. But so far Robert Stevens, Lockheed Martin’s executive chairman, has been proven wrong.Lockheed Martin and many of its peers are still increasing sales and profit and offering shareholders a solid return on their investment.In fact, the shares of the top US defence companies by revenue have all gained since March, outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.Defence companies have helped themselves by being ahead of the game. Over the past three or so years, they have cut costs, reduced staff numbers, taken out entire layers of management and shut manufacturing sites as they prepared for the end of a boom decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.All this, together with share buybacks and strong commitments to dividend payments, has kept investors happy, even while the companies they own have had to deal with the uncertainty over the defence budget cuts and the delays in getting procurement projects signed off.But some executives – including those from European defence companies, many of which have built sizeable US divisions in the past decade – worry the industry is running out of rope just as deep cuts are working their way through the Pentagon’s procurement process.Robert Murphy, chief executive of Cobham, which provides the air refuelling probe for the F-35 jet fighter, last month warned investors he expected the US to do what it did after the cold war: cut its defence procurement budget in half.His concern is well founded. So far, US President Barack Obama has done little to shrink other areas of military expenditure by closing bases or curtailing soldiers’ benefits – two measures that would risk significant political backlash. Instead, he has ended the production of the F-22, the world’s most vaunted jet fighter, and cut funding for Army combat vehicles and Navy missile cruisers.Robert Stallard, analyst for Royal Bank of Canada, says the worst is yet to come. “Similar to a famous announcement by President George W Bush in 2003, we think it’s too early to call a successful end to the budget downturn, with the next couple of years looking to be far worse for defence earnings than the past two,” he wrote in a recent note.But even though executives warn that sequestration is finally about to bite, there has been little consolidation of the defence industry on either side of the Atlantic so far.Unlike in the downturn of the 1990s, the Pentagon believes its pool of leading suppliers is small enough, while European governments – afraid to lose jobs, skills and military edge – have been unwilling so far to allow the consolidation most observers feel Europe badly needs.In 2012, for example, Germany vetoed the €36bn tie-up of EADS, Europe’s biggest aerospace company, and the UK’s BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence company.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Thales, the French defence and civil electronic systems company, says that sent the message that politicians fearing job losses will find it difficult to shake up the industry at present. “The question is raised at a time when jobs are scarce and there is not a lot of growth. Is that the right time to make decisions?,” he asks.Instead, governments are aggressively backing their companies in the drive to sell more equipment abroad, nowhere more so than in the Middle East and Asia.According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the think-tank, US spending fell to $669bn last year from $711bn the year before, but in the Middle East spending rose from $123bn to $134bn.The UK government last year signed an agreement to explore a partnership around the Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighter with the UAE, clinched a 12 aircraft deal with Oman and helped BAE sell two patrol boats to Brazil. Paris lobbied successfully for India to chose Dassault’s Rafale jet fighters over Typhoon, in a $11bn contract.The US government meanwhile is brokering more than $10bn worth of equipment sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Israel.But international deals come with strings attached for the companies. To clinch them, they must promise big investments in the local economies of the buying nation. More and more, these side agreements demanded by the customer countries have become a deciding factor in who wins government tenders for big military kit.Many of these so-called offsets involve partnerships with local companies, the transfer of technological knowhow, help financing big deals and the creation of whole industries from defence to high technology.As defence companies increasingly compete outside the US and EU – where offsets are frowned upon – the global value of these investment promises is expected to balloon.As one analyst put it: “When a company says its new goal is to get 30 per cent of its revenue from outside the US, how much of that will come from international sales growing rather than simply US sales shrinking?”For investors who have grown complacent about strong company earnings, it could come as quite a shock if it is more of the latter than the former.

The news sent Netflix shares up 10 per cent in after-market trading, with the company opening the morning well into positive territory.However, shares sank quickly in the first 90 minutes of trading and closed 9.2 per cent lower to $339.10, after Bank of America issued a note that said the elevated stock price was “difficult to justify”.The streaming television provider is up just less than 400 per cent in the past 12 months and has a price-to-earnings ratio of 186. By contrast, the S&P 500 has a p/e ratio of 16.8.The day’s broad rally helped the Nasdaq Composite index to shake off the decline by Netflix to add 0.2 per cent to 3,929.57.The S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent to a record close of 1,754.67 and touched a fresh intraday record high of 1,759.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 15,467.66.A busy day of earnings also helped drive some companies higher as investors look to balance sheets for justification of higher share prices.Whirlpool shares rose after it reported earnings per share of $2.72 that soundly beat estimates and revenue that grew 4.2 per cent.Investors drove Whirlpool shares 11.6 per cent higher to $146.14.Lockheed Martin showed its ability to shake off US budget cuts, as it announced that it had raised its full-year 2013 earnings per share projections to $9.20-$9.50 and that third-quarter net earnings were up 20 per cent.Lockheed shares moved 3.8 per cent higher to $130.05.Cloud software company VMware reported on Monday after the market close that third-quarter earnings per share beat estimates, and a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $1.29bn that met expectations.VMware shares were up 2.8 per cent to $85.00.Delta Air Lines gained 3.2 per cent to $25.49 after it reported earnings that also beat earnings per share predictions and a revenue increase in line with estimates.Coach benefited from a quarterly earnings report that was little improved from the previous year, but did beat estimates with earnings per share of $0.77. However, investors were unimpressed, sending shares down 8.2 per cent to $49.75.Apple shares, which have rallied 9.1 per cent in October back above the $500 level, took a step back on Tuesday. The iPhone maker was off 0.3 per cent to $519.87 despite the company’s event that included the announcement a the new iPad Air model.The broader market moves followed the delayed release of September’s non-farm payrolls data, which showed the US had added a less-than-expected 148,000 jobs. The downbeat news helped reinforce investor belief that the Federal Reserve would not begin to taper its quantitative easing programme in the near future.The jobs report sent 10-year Treasury yields to a three-month low, which helped utilities stocks, with the sector up 1.3 per cent. Utilities, which tend to have stable share prices and high dividends, perform particularly well when interest rates remain low.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said the rally was a continuation from September, when the market began the month with 11 positive days in 12 sessions.“This is a market that has picked up from September and kind of veered off during the shutdown and debt ceiling debate. It’s picking up from where it left off when Ben Bernanke said no taper,” she said. “It’s one of the most accommodative periods in the calendar for equity markets. In addition to that, you’ve got the credit markets helping to set the stage for the market moving higher.”While continued faith in the Fed’s liquidity programme was driving the market higher, Ms Krosby noted that investors were taking profits in some of the year’s biggest gainers and piling into businesses that demonstrated revenue growth.“You have a number of companies, important companies, coming out with better earnings and some actually coming out with better top-line revenue growth. Mind you, not all of them. We’d like to see more, but it’s been enough to give the market this push higher.”
151;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-10-22T11:47:56Z;Lockheed shows resilience in face of US budget cuts;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor, provided the latest evidence of the sector’s resilience in the face of US budget cuts, with third-quarter net earnings up 20 per cent to $873m despite a 4 per cent fall in sales.Lockheed, lead contractor on the F-35 joint-strike fighter, by far the biggest military procurement programme in the world, also lifted its projections for full-year 2013 earnings per share, from a range of $9.20-$9.50 to a range of $9.40-$9.70. However, it forecast that sales would decrease slightly in 2014 compared with this year.Sales for the quarter were $11.3bn, against $11.9bn last timeMarillyn Hewson, Lockheed’s chief executive, said the company had increased its backlog of orders in the quarter and returned money to shareholders, as well as increasing net earnings.“Despite the uncertainty surrounding our industry, our employees remain focused on performing with excellence and delivering affordable and effective solutions for our customers,” Ms Hewson said.US military contractors have been facing across-the-board spending cuts of about 10 per cent, known as sequestration, in all defence department budget lines since March 1. The cuts have so far shown up mainly in short-term items such as services and information technology, while longer-term items – including the F-35 – are mostly paid out of money allocated up to seven years beforehand.Ms Hewson said the company had so far suffered only about $450m revenue shortfall from sequestration, against the $825m it had projected for the full year.Some contractors, including Lockheed Martin, also suffered additional disruption this month when an impasse in Congress over the federal government budget led to a 16-day shutdown of the federal government, starting on October 1. Military contractors suffered both from closures of government facilities, where some staff worked, and from the absence of defence department inspectors to audit aspects of their work.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, said the shutdown had cost the company about $15m to $20m a week in revenue. “Not, from a scale perspective, all that significant an impact,” he said.Operating profits in the key aeronautics division, which makes fighter and military transport aircraft, dipped 0.7 per cent to $412m, on sales down 2 per cent to $3.63bn. Lower sales of F-16 and F-22 fighters more than outweighed increased sales of the F-35 and C-5 and C-130 transport aircraft.Operating profits in information systems and global solutions – the division suffering most from sequestration – declined 11 per cent to $187m, on sales down 10 per cent to $2.06bn. However, operating profits in missiles and fire control, which benefited from strong sales of air defence and anti-missile systems, increased 19 per cent to $356m, on sales up 3 per cent to $2bn.Earnings per share increased 20 per cent to $2.66.The shares closed up 3.79 per cent at $130.05.
152;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-10-09T20:18:59Z;Offset side deals spark calls for transparency;;"For the past few years, BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, has reaped some of its biggest dividends from an investment that has nothing to do with military equipment.Eager to sell radars to Kazakhstan, BAE in 2001 improved its offer by agreeing to help President Nursultan Nazarbayev start a domestic airline. In the end, Moscow intervened and BAE never sold the equipment to Kazakhstan. But, unusually for these sorts of side deals, its 49 per cent stake in Kazakhstan’s Air Astana became one of the company’s highest-yielding investments.Even when successful, defence executives and government officials only reluctantly talk about such deals. But keeping these sweeteners shrouded in secrecy may prove increasingly difficult as they become the main weapon for defence companies battling to overcome the sharp downturn in western military expenditure.In the past three years, Nato countries have cut $120bn from their combined defence budgets and executives expect tough times to continue for another decade. This has led to companies aggressively expanding overseas, courting countries that demand the kind of side deal – or offset – that BAE made in Kazakhstan.Over the next decade, the global value of the offset market is expected to reach $500bn, according to Avascent, the management consultant. And countries are becoming far more sophisticated in their demands, threatening sizeable fines for non-compliance.Christian Scherer, chief salesman for the defence side of EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence company, says that offering countries flexible offsets deals was part of his company’s DNA.“Clearly the high growth countries today that we are all courting are setting pretty high hurdles for contractors in terms of offsets,” he says.Few companies reveal the extent of this business to their investors. Most do not include it in their annual reports’ list of risks even though they are on the hook for millions of dollars in potential fines if they fail to keep their promises.Explore the offsets that accompany big weapons sales and the laws that have developed around themBut the Financial Times, using data provided by analysts at IHS Jane’s, has for the first time calculated the relative size of the obligations to which top western defence companies have agreed. Even with a very conservative methodology, their total obligations are more than $75bn, with Lockheed Martin of the US leading the pack at $27bn and EADS topping the European rankings with a $7.6bn obligation.Grant Rogan, founder of Blenheim Capital, which advises both companies and governments, says the industry is at a turning point. “Because of the sheer size and magnitude of the growth right now, there’s going to have to be a greater deal of transparency on the part of both sides: the buyer and the seller. And it is going to happen through self regulation or it will come down to imposed regulation,” he says.That could prove tough for some companies. Jon Barney, partner at Avascent, compared the task of measuring offset obligations to pouring sand from a dump truck into an hour glass.“I don’t think anyone expected offsets to become as big as they are today. The mechanics to track, manage and report offsets have not kept up with their growth,” he says.The contest between western defence groups looking to offer a country the best offset deal is fierce; competing with powerful state-owned defence companies in Russia and China is even more difficult.Guy Anderson, analyst at IHS Jane’s, says it is difficult for western companies to match their state-owned competitors’ freedom of manoeuvre.“To win the Algerian orders, Russia forgave billions of dollars of sovereign debt and opted for energy exploitation rights in lieu of straight cash returns,” he says. “To put a deal like that together, it helps when your major banks; energy companies and defence giants are all under state control.”Offsets come in two forms, direct and indirect. BAE’s Kazak investment is an example of an indirect offset because it had no direct link to the radar it was trying to sell.I don’t think anyone expected offsets to become as big as they are today. The mechanics to track, manage and report offsets have not kept up with their growth.Other indirect offsets include Raytheon, the missile maker, setting up a shrimp farm in Saudi Arabia; a group of defence companies helping the UAE buy 10,000 European petrol stations and five refineries; and EADS’s offer to help South Korea kick start its civil aerospace industry if the country buys the European company’s Typhoon jet fighter.While indirect offsets can be costly in the short term, direct offsets, which force defence companies to shift much of the economic benefits of producing their equipment to the buying country, have a more pernicious long-term effect.The end goal for many countries demanding direct offsets is the creation of their own defence industry. Turkey, Brazil and India insist defence companies manufacture part of their equipment domestically to build up the nations’ supply chains and labour pool, while handing over valuable technical knowhow and intellectual property.Fabrizio Giulianini, chief executive of Selex ES, the defence electronics arm of Italy’s Finmeccanica, says industrial participation is unavoidable. “We have to do it. We would be very happy to ship it [from Italy] but unfortunately we can’t,” he says, adding that the secret to survival is to come up with new technologies faster than they give away the old ones.Even in the shorter term, building complex defence equipment in foreign countries adds costs and creates quality control challenges – as France’s Dassault Aviation is finding amid protracted negotiations with India over where and how to build a $10bn fleet of Rafale fighter jets.The most efficiently addressed local demands add costs of 3-5 per cent to a contract, but bad management can quickly make them spiral beyond the 7-10 per cent profit margin on big deals, defence executives say.Reputational costs of direct and indirect offsets can be even greater, analysts say. Critics argue that offsets prompt governments to spend money they do not have on weapons they do not need and that the secrecy surrounding them creates havens for corruption and bribery. Offset deals have sparked corruption investigations into politicians and defence companies in such countries as Portugal, India, South Africa and Austria.“Without a doubt offsets pose a material risk to investors,” says Mark Pyman, director at Transparency International. “It would be well in the interest of shareholders, the overall integrity of the defence industry and ordinary citizens if offset transactions were disclosed.”The US Department of Commerce is worried enough about how offsets demanded outside the US accelerate the shift of jobs, technology and tax revenue from west to east, that it closely monitors and measures the trend.Europe is behind the curve, says Christian Sylvain, who heads Ecco, the closest thing Europe has to an offsets trade group. “Each time a country requires localisation of production or a transfer of technical knowhow, we are losing a part of our GDP, 75 per cent of which is based on knowhow,” Mr Sylvain says."
153;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-10-07T18:18:01Z;US defence contractors recall staff;;Many of the tens of thousands of staff at military contractors who faced being sent home this week are to stay at work because of a change of policy by the US defence department over the government shutdown.Chuck Hagel, defence secretary, announced over the weekend that “most” of the 400,000 civilian defence department workers who had been put on unpaid leave would be recalled to work.The order – made under a reinterpretation of the Pay Our Military Act, passed immediately before the start last week of the partial shutdown of the federal government – covers staff from the Defense Contract Management Agency whose absence threatened production of a range of military equipment. The DCMA inspectors play a critical role in auditing work at military contractors’ plants and clearing products as fit for use.The DCMA workers’ absence had been the main factor in warnings from several contractors– including Lockheed Martin, the largest, United Technologies and BAE Systems – late last week that many workers would be sent home this week. The Aerospace Industry Association, the trade organisation, had said tens of thousands of workers would be affected.As a result of the change of tack, United Technologies – which had planned to send home 2,000 workers from its Sikorsky Helicopters division on Monday – said it was cancelling all planned unpaid leave for staff. UTC had earlier warned that it would have 4,000 staff on leave by the end of the week, and another 1,000 off work if the shutdown continued into next month.However, the situation for other contractors with large numbers of staff working at US government sites was more complicated.Lockheed Martin, which had warned that it would have to send 3,000 staff home on Monday and more as the budget stand-off continued, said the number had been reduced – but only to 2,400.The remaining enforced leave was either among workers whose workplaces were closed in the shutdown, or among those facing “stop work” orders on projects hit by the dispute.Linda Hudson, chief executive in the US of BAE Systems, the Pentagon’s sixth-biggest supplier by sales, said in a memo to staff that it was “good news” the DCMA inspectors were returning to work. However, she added that “the funding situation remains murky for government contractors and other federal agencies outside of the Pentagon”.BAE announced last week that it already had 1,000 staff “excused from work” because of the shutdown, mainly because their workplaces at government sites were closed.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said the return of civilians should “ease most of the pressure” on military production.“Weapons can progress to the next stage as they’re approved by returning inspectors,” Mr Thompson said.
154;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-10-04T22:53:30Z;Lockheed shares hit by shutdown;;Investors’ caution on US companies that depend on revenue from the government sent the S&P 500 lower for the week, as the shutdown in Washington and forthcoming debt-ceiling debate weighed on equity markets.Defence contractors were among the hardest hit, with Lockheed Martin off 5.2 per cent to $122.50 on the week. The company said on Thursday that thousands of its workers would be sent home if the government shutdown persists.The decline came amid an otherwise strong year for the aerospace company that counts the $1.5tn F-35 fighter jet programme among its wares. Lockheed is up 30.5 per cent in 2013.Lockheed’s fall contributed to a broad decline in the industrials sector, which was one of the worst major areas of the S&P 500 on the week, down 0.9 per cent.Other companies exposed to the shutdown’s effects also tumbled, with Raytheon down 5.7 per cent to $74.25 in the past five days, followed by United Technologies 4.7 per cent lower to $104.27, and Northrop Grumman 3 per cent softer to $93.32.The retreat by industrials helped send the S&P 500 0.1 per cent lower on the week, with Friday’s rise of 0.7 per cent to 1,690.50 erasing much of the early losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ticked up on Friday, 0.5 per cent higher to 15,072.58. Despite the day’s gains the blue-chip index was off 1.2 per cent on the week.However, not every US equity index finished the week lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index had added 0.7 per cent in the past five days, including a 0.9 per cent gain on Friday to 3,807.75.The Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies was also higher on the week, up 0.4 per cent to 1,078.26.JC Penney was the worst performer on the S&P 500 on the week, down 13.2 per cent to $7.86. The subject of a failed turnround effort earlier this year from activist investor Bill Ackman, the retailer was hit this week by a credit downgrade from Fitch Ratings, which cut the company’s credit rating to junk status.The company’s shares are down 60 per cent so far in 2013.Fitch also had a hand in the S&P’s highest riser, as hospital operator Tenet Healthcare gained 14.3 per cent to $46.10 after the rating agency said that its merger with Vanguard Health Systems was “strategically sound”.Tenet’s rise helped the healthcare sector to lead the S&P 500 for the week, up 0.9 per cent.Facebook was 3.8 per cent higher to $51.04 on Friday after the company announced that it would begin including advertisements in Instagram, the photo-centric social network that it bought for $1bn.Adobe Systems shares rose 1.4 per cent to $51.57 despite news that the company had been the victim of a cyberattack that exposed 2.9m customer accounts. Part of the source code of its software products had also been taken, the company said, which could result in a new wave of attacks.Adobe shares are up more than 36 per cent in 2013.Restaurant chain Potbelly, known for its sandwiches, more than doubled on its trading debut on the Nasdaq, with shares trading at $30.77. The company raised $105m from a 7.5m share offering at $14 a piece.While Friday’s gains helped to ease the week’s decline, there are signs that the near-term outlook for US equity markets remains troubling. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – the CBOE Volatility Index of the S&P 500 – added 9.1 per cent on the week to 16.86.Standing out among the big movers for the day were shares in Tweeter, an electronics retailer made bankrupt in 2007 and whose assets were subsequently sold. Tweeter stock hit a high of 15c before closing at 5c each – or almost seven-times its opening price, before trading was halted during the afternoonIt appeared that traders may have been confused by the company’s ticker of “TWTRQ” – very similar to the ticker announced on Thursday for Twitter’s IPO of “TWTR”.
155;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-10-04T19:40:25Z;Lockheed to send 3,000 workers home;;"Lockheed Martin will send 3,000 workers home from work on Monday, in the latest evidence of the growing impact on military contractors of the US government’s partial shutdown.The world’s biggest military contractor announced its plans on Friday as the Aerospace Industries Association, the contractors’ trade body, warned that tens of thousands of workers were set to be laid off because of the effects of the shutdown on suppliers if the budget stand-off continued.Lockheed is the biggest name so far to announce large lay-offs because of the impasse. On Wednesday, United Technologies (UTC) said it would lay off 2,000 workers at its Sikorsky helicopter division on Monday because of the lack of government inspectors to supervise the work. Another 2,000 staff in other divisions would be sent home over the course of next week if there was no resolution to the crisis, while a further 1,000 would go if the stand-off continued into next month.“We continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,” said Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed’s chief executive.The company warned that a growing number of workers would be affected each week as the stand-off continued. Lockheed was encouraging affected workers to use any available annual leave for the time they were laid off, so that they would continue to be paid and receive benefits.Ms Hewson blamed the lay-offs on a mixture of the closure of government facilities where its staff worked, the absence of government inspectors required to supervise some work and the company’s having received stop-work orders.UTC blamed its lay-offs on the absence of inspectors from the Pentagon’s Defence Contract Management Agency, who audit and supervise construction of military equipment.DCMA staff normally audit equipment production for Pentagon contracts, monitoring the workflow through each plant.BAE Systems, which looks set to send home more workers if the stand-off continues, said 1,000 of the staff of its intelligence and security sector were off work because the government buildings where they worked were closed.The AIA said a number of its members had warned it that they would be forced to lay off tens of thousands of staff unless the stand-off were resolved.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said the shutdown’s impact on companies was proving “quite uneven”.“Some companies seem to have felt very little impact; some are suffering,” Mr Thompson said.Most other big contractors would say only that they were talking to the Pentagon about how to proceed, although nearly all look likely to have to send some workers home soon.Boeing, which appears to have been little affected, said it was “watching developments closely”.“The company has begun implementing contingency plans to deal with interruptions to normal operations,” it said.The shutdown was the latest of a series of crises to hit military contractors, Mr Thompson said. They were already coping with a slowdown in work after the withdrawal from Iraq, last year’s crisis over the federal budget and “sequestration” spending cuts, which are reducing 10 per cent from all Pentagon budgets.“This has become the most uncertain sector in the economy in terms of pace of demand,” he said."
156;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Turkey to buy $4bn air defence system from China;;Turkey has announced plans to buy a $4bn air defence system from China, a decision that has surprised and dismayed some of Ankara’s Nato partners.A government committee chaired by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, decided this week to proceed with buying the long-range anti-aircraft and ballistic missile system from the state-owned China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation, rejecting rivals bids from western groups. This was despite concerns that the new technology might not work with other Nato systems.Furthermore, the US Treasury has imposed sanctions on CPMIEC a number of times, including this year, because of charges that it has been involved in the sharing of missile technology with countries such as North Korea.Turkish officials said the decision was made on technical and price grounds, an argument echoed by several analysts who say Ankara is keen to get hold of new technology that the US is reluctant to share. Nevertheless, the move comes amid increasing strains with some of Turkey’s allies.“I doubt that Ankara wants to make grand political statements with tenders of this kind,” said Semih Idiz, a Turkish foreign affairs commentator. “If anything, it needs Nato at the moment.”But he also noted that Washington and Ankara had recently been at cross purposes. Mr Erdogan is a leading supporter of a sustained military campaign against Syria, for example, a course the Obama administration has chosen not to take.Western diplomats said they were surprised and disappointed by Ankara’s preference of the Chinese group over rival systems that included Raytheon and Lockheed Martin’s Pac-3 Patriot missile system, and emphasised their worries that the system would not be interoperable with Nato’s defence architecture.Turkey hosts a radar station at the heart of Nato’s missile defence system. It also temporarily hosts six Patriot missile batteries from the US, Germany and the Netherlands, which have been deployed to the southeast of the country against possible threats from Syria.The other disappointed bidders were Eurosam, a French-Italian consortium, and Rosobornoexport of Russia.Ismet Yilmaz, Turkey’s defence minister, said Ankara would seek to draw up a final agreement with CPMIEC and emphasised that the system would be jointly produced in Turkey itself, a concession other bidders balked at.Aaron Stein, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, the defence and security think-tank, said the tender showed that Turkey was focused less on rapidly acquiring battlefield-tested technology and more on bolstering its own domestic defence industry.The country is also seeking to develop its own jet fighters, a satellite launch vehicle and early warning satellites, a long-range missile and a small aircraft carrier.“This type of arrangement, which requires the transfer of design information, is not feasible for American military firms,” Mr Stein added. “The Patriot Pac-3, for example, is a top-of-the-line item and it would be difficult because of US export controls and intellectual property rules for Raytheon and Lockheed to just simply hand over critical design information to Turkey.”
157;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-09-24T11:13:23Z;South Korea reopens tender for $8bn fighter jet programme;;South Korea will restart an $8bn tender for a new fleet of fighter jets after a three-way race between Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the Eurofighter consortium failed to produce a winner.The defence ministry’s announcement on Tuesday followed weeks of domestic controversy. The government, under pressure to meet ambitious social spending pledges, had looked set to choose Boeing’s F-15 jet as a cheaper alternative to Lockheed Martin’s more advanced F-35.Instead Seoul has reopened one of the year’s most lucrative bidding wars in the defence industry, as it seeks to upgrade its ageing air force with 60 new jets. New bids will be invited and a final decision made within the next year, with a possibility of procuring planes from more than one bidder, said the defence ministry.The decision is a blow to Boeing, which became the favourite to win the contest’s initial round after the Lockheed and Eurofighter bids were ruled out because they exceeded the government’s Won8.3tn ($7.7bn) budget.“I’m very surprised – everyone, from Boeing down, was looking forward to a selection today,” said James Hardy, editor of IHS Jane’s Defence Weekly. “The fact they’ve decided to reopen it is a big statement: basically, it means the F-35 is the only aircraft they want.”Other analysts have continuously cautioned that South Korea’s comments regarding Boeing’s favoured position were not to be taken seriously and were simply a negotiating tool to push the Washington to drop its price of the F-35.The US is acting as Lockheed Martin’s broker and is keen to sell its most advanced fighter to help reduce its own $1.5tn bill for the aircraft by gaining economies of scale, or having the option of redirecting aircraft earmarked for the US to others. Despite many delays and cost overruns, the F-35 is the Pentagon’s main fighter of the future and it wants a common fleet among its closest allies.Fighter jet contests are as much about military and political ties as about hardware, and US allies carefully weigh both elements when making their decisions.In South Korea, Boeing’s emergence as frontrunner prompted a flurry of domestic complaints that its F-15 jet, while cheaper than Lockheed’s F-35, lagged far behind the latter’s cutting-edge stealth capabilities. Fifteen former air force chiefs reportedly petitioned the government this month to urge it not to opt for the Boeing bid.“One candidate within budget was considered today but the committee members rejected it, considering the country’s security situation and changing strategic factors,” said the defence ministry.Yang Uk, an analyst at the Korea Defence and Security Forum, said the F-15 was “good enough” to form part of South Korea’s deterrent force against North Korea.But he noted that choosing Boeing’s bid would put South Korea at a competitive disadvantage against two larger neighbours. Japan has agreed to procure 42 F-35 jets, while China is developing a stealth fighter of its own, the Chengdu J-20.“There’s a lot of budget issues in this government,” Mr Yang added, suggesting that the previous government had showed a more flexible attitude towards expenditure on the jet programme.President Park Geun-hye came to office in February promising to spend an additional Won135tn on welfare over the next five years, but has been struggling to find ways to meet those promises in the face of stuttering tax revenues. The government backtracked on a new tax plan last month in the face of furious opposition, and there is speculation that it will abandon some spending pledges in a pre-budget briefing this week.Daniel Pinkston, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the new fleet of fighter jets assumed a particular importance amid uncertainty over the future of the US military presence in South Korea. However, he added that South Korea’s air force was already technologically far ahead of that of North Korea, its principal threat, which has an air fleet consisting mostly of outdated Chinese and Soviet planes.“There’s an increasing gap,” he said. “North Korea has a huge military but can only provide training, resources and weapons systems for a narrow part of that military.”Additional reporting by Carola Hoyos in London

But it seems legions of latter-day gun-toting Stetson wearers have made Starbucks their saloon of choice, prompting the US chain to ask them to seek milky beverages elsewhere.BP objected to that budget, but it could not persuade the court to block it. It is trying again, seeking to cut the fourth-quarter budget, which Mr Juneau originally set at about $130m but cut to $111m.Mr Juneau has suggested BP may be trying to “slow walk” claims: cutting his staff so that compensation payments will be processed more slowly. BP says it is trying to control costs and make the administration more efficient.The steering committee of lawyers representing businesses and individuals seeking compensation for the spill supports Mr Juneau and accuses BP of arguing in “bad faith”.BP has made repeated attempts in court to suspend payments under the settlement because of allegations of fraud, and to overturn the generous interpretation of business losses allowed by Mr Juneau, without success.Originally predicted by BP to cost $7.8bn, the settlement is on course to be worth at least twice that.Danske ousts chief to seek out ‘stronger qualifications’
Firings do not come much more brutal than that of Danske Bank’s chief executive this week when the Danish lender’s board said it wanted somebody with “stronger qualifications within banking”, writes Richard Milne in Oslo.Eivind Kolding’s dozen years on Danske’s board before becoming chief executive – six as vice-chairman and a year as chairman – mattered little to the board. Mr Kolding is a former chief executive of Maersk Line, the world’s largest container shipping group, which is Danske’s biggest shareholder.Instead, Danske’s board plumped for Thomas Borgen, head of its corporate business and a former boss of its Norwegian subsidiary.Ole Andersen, Danske’s chairman, is well known in Denmark for shedding chief executives due to his positions on boards at companies such as Bang & Olufsen and ISS.He said being a member of a bank board for “10 or 15 years does not qualify you to run a bank”, adding that, while Mr Kolding was the best candidate when he took over last year, views of the skills needed of a bank chief had evolved.Mr Kolding’s missteps as chief executive included the disastrous launch of an edgy advertising campaign featuring lesbians kissing.Charges imposed on many customers for having a current account soured the mood further in Denmark, and some analysts were alarmed when Danske’s management entered into a public dispute with its regulator over how much capital it should hold.Fighter contracts remain mired in controversyTwo US military contractors took key steps towards exporting fighter jets this week – but both the Netherlands’ announcement that it intends to buy Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter and South Korea’s shortlisting of Boeing’s F15 remain mired in controversy, writes Robert Wright in New York.South Korea announced that, of three tenders it had received to replace its air force’s ageing fighter jet fleet, only one – for Boeing’s F15 silent eagle – had come within the Won8.3tn ($7.7bn) price ceiling for the tender. That should make the finalising of an order for the aircraft a formality when the country’s cabinet considers the order next week.However, many in South Korea remain opposed to the country not choosing the F35 fighter that Japan, a key ally, and the US will be operating. The F15 is a significantly less advanced fighter than the F35. There has been speculation that the cabinet will decide to postpone the decision while holding further talks on how to proceed.An order that Lockheed won in Europe could be unravelling, meanwhile. Members of the Netherlands’ Labour party – part of the governing coalition – have expressed concern about how the government came to opt to spend €4.5bn on 37 F35s. That could force the government to back away from the order, announced on Tuesday.The US defence department and contractors are eager to expand US military exports to counteract the effects of the US’s “sequestration” spending cuts.Lloyds passes milestone with £3.2bn stock saleThe long-awaited reprivatisation of Lloyds Banking Group began this week as the government sold £3.2bn of shares, largely to UK and US institutional investors, overnight on Monday, writes Sharlene Goff.Bankers close to the deal claimed it was a success for all involved: the Treasury made a £61m profit on the sale; investors bought the shares at a 3 per cent discount to the market price; Lloyds welcomed the reduction in the government’s stake from 39 to 33 per cent.The strong demand for the shares – the book was almost three times subscribed within hours of launch – was also taken as a sign of investors’ increasing faith in the UK’s economic recovery.Retail investors could be next in line for a slice of Lloyds as George Osborne, chancellor, said he would consider involving them in future share sales of Lloyds.Lloyds shares ended the week slightly above the 75p sale price, at 75.5p.The sale came as rival UK lender Barclays issued its prospectus for a £5.8bn rights issue, making some unwelcome disclosures about a previous cash call.Barclays said it was contesting a regulator’s £50m fine for acting “recklessly” by failing to disclose £322m in fees paid to Qatari investors during its emergency capital raising five years ago.According to Barclays, the FCA said two agreements to pay a total of £322m over five years had been struck primarily for Qatar’s participation in the cash calls and not to obtain advisory services, as had been argued by the bank."
160;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

163;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-08-08T22:00:09Z;Norway’s oil fund urged to boost ethical credentials;;"Behind the times, not open enough and weak on some human rights violations – these are tough claims for any investor to hear.But they make for a particularly uncomfortable message to digest for Norway’s $760bn oil fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth investor that makes a big point of its ethical stance.Norway’s decisions to stop investing in companies such as Walmart, Boeing or Lockheed Martin and ban producers of nuclear weapons and cluster bombs from the oil fund’s portfolio have been much praised and imitated. Equally, the oil fund itself is proud of its special focus on six specific topics, among them children’s rights and water management.But as the fund grows ever greater in size – owning on average 1.25 per cent of every listed company in the world – critics of its approach to ownership are growing just as scores of other investors adopt more advanced criteria for ethical investing.“I don’t think the fund has kept up to speed. You have a responsibility to be a responsible investor. Therefore, human rights need to have a bigger focus,” Philip Jennings, the combative general secretary of the UNI Global Union, told oil fund executives and Norwegian officials at a recent conference on responsible investment.Andrew Preston, director of the Forum for Environment and Development, an Oslo-based network of pressure groups, says: “We still know very little about how active ownership works. This means that we outside are unable to hold the fund to account.”Recognising the pressure, the Norwegian government has asked the fund’s strategy council – headed by a British professor – to consider changes that could deeply alter how it interacts with the companies it deals with. “The fund belongs to the people of Norway and it’s important we manage the fund in a way that ensures broad support,” says Hilde Singsaas, state secretary in the finance ministry.The fund inspires deep emotions in Norway about what it invests in, which is little wonder because it is already larger than the country’s annual gross domestic product. Decisions, for instance, to ban tobacco companies but not alcohol producers are heavily scrutinised.Some even suggest that the fund should stop investing in any company producing fossil fuels, because of its and Norway’s dependence on oil. “To have that double risk is not only ridiculous from an environmental point of view but also an economic one,” says Frederic Hauge of Bellona, an environmental activist group.Perhaps most embarrassing for the fund in recent times was a decision by the Norwegian national contact point for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to chastise it in unusually harsh terms. The oil fund lacks a strategy for identifying and dealing with possible human rights violations at the companies it invests in, the OECD body decided in a case about its stake in South Korean steelmaker Posco.Analysis of the new generation of oil superpowers, focusing on the countries that will dominate crude supply in the decades to come“It is especially regrettable that the governmental manager of the [oil fund], and one of the biggest investors in the world, does not respect the guidelines which Norway has signed,” says Hans Petter Graver, head of the OECD national contact point. Mr Preston adds: “The OECD case is a big deal, it looks bad for the fund and the government.”The oil fund argues that the OECD guidelines should not apply to it as a minority shareholder. But Mr Jennings believes the incident shows how the fund has too narrow a focus. “The human rights focus almost exclusively on children’s rights isn’t going to help you [and] being a minority shareholder is no longer an excuse,” he says.His call to broaden the ownership issues the fund focuses on is echoed by Christine Meisingset, head of sustainable investment at one of Norway’s biggest fund managers, Storebrand. She recently made the headlines in Norway by excluding 19 companies from Storebrand’s portfolios because of their exposure to fossil fuels. She urges the oil fund to change how it looks at companies: “It’s important to shift from responsible to sustainable investment, from avoiding the worst performers to focusing on quality.”Elroy Dimson, a professor at London Business School and chairman of the strategy council, is the person with the task of altering the fund’s approach and is due to deliver his report by October when a new government could be in place following elections the previous month.He argues that critics should not be too quick to condemn the oil fund. “There is a history of which Norway should be proud . . . It is a well-managed organisation that clearly faces some challenges.”Focus on children’s rights too narrow, say observersNorway’s oil fund has six focus areas for its ownership activities, corresponding to what investors often call environmental, social and governance matters.They are: equal treatment of shareholders; shareholder influence and board accountability; well-functioning, legitimate and efficient markets; children’s rights; climate change risk management; and water management. It publishes annual reports on the three latter focus areas.Still, many critics say it should be looking at more. For instance, the union leader Philip Jennings argues it should pay more attention to labour rights, not just children’s rights. But he says that when he suggested that to Yngve Slyngstad, the fund’s chief executive, he was told he should concentrate on other investors as the oil fund was busy enough focusing on children’s rights.The oil fund, which declined to comment on the conversation, insists it is interested in other issues, no matter what its critics say.“That does not mean that our work is limited to these areas . . . We also encourage companies to take responsibility for improving social and environmental practices that may negatively impact their development, [and] this includes human rights and labour rights.”"
164;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-29T15:39:45Z;Senior chief supports ‘fantastic’ Dreamliner;;The chief executive of Senior, the UK-listed engineering group, has expressed confidence in the future of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, in the wake of the passenger jet’s recent run of safety concerns.The FTSE 250 company – a specialist in aerospace and automotive components – provides structural aluminium for the body of the Dreamliner and parts for the aircraft’s Trent engines, in contracts worth $800,000 per jet.Mark Rollins, Senior’s chief executive, on Monday lent his backing to the Boeing aircraft and said that safety concerns following this month’s fire in a Dreamliner at London’s Heathrow airport would not adversely affect the jet’s prospects.“The Dreamliner is a fantastic aircraft that does what it was designed to do – fly more economically. The customers love it, and the passengers love it,” he said.Mr Rollins said that London-based Senior was preparing to ramp up its manufacture of components for the 787, as production of the Dreamliner increases from seven to 10 aircraft per month by the end of the year.UK investigators said there was no evidence that the July 12 fire on an Ethiopian Airlines jet was caused by the Dreamliner’s lithium-ion batteries, which overheated on two 787s in January, prompting regulators to temporarily ground the aircraft.On Monday, Senior reported a 6 per cent year-on-year rise in its interim revenues to £399.3m, bolstered by last year’s acquisitions of US component maker Damar and Weston EU, a producer of turbine blades for aero-engines.Senior’s aerospace arm, which manufactures aircraft parts such as wing components, air conditioning ducts and fluid pipes, earns two-thirds of the company’s total revenues, benefiting from the boom in civil aviation.This has offset a 6.1 per cent year-on-year decline in first-half revenues from makers of military aircraft, with cuts to government armed forces budgets leading to lower demand for Black Hawk helicopters and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules military transport, both of which contain Senior’s components.Senior shares – up almost one-third over the past 12 months – fell back 4 per cent to 261.5p, valuing the company’s equity at £1.1bn.Pre-tax profit for the half year to June 30 fell back 14 per cent, weighed down by a £12.9m one-off writedown in goodwill stemming from its 2008 acquisition of Capo Industries, a maker of parts for business aircraft.On an underlying basis, adjusted pre-tax profit rose 5 per cent to £53.3m.At Senior’s other unit, Flexonics, a maker of high-tech parts for passenger car and truck engines, revenues rose 18 per cent to £145.6m, buoyed by its November acquisition of GAMFG Precision, a US-based manufacturer of machined components for diesel engines.Diluted earnings per share edged up from 7.89p to 7.93p, and an interim dividend of 1.52p was 10 per cent higher than the 1.38p from a year ago.Mark Wembridge
165;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US military contractors: what sequestration?;The effect of austerity on weapons makers has been mild;Austerity is, in principle, a bad thing for the big weapons makers that serve the US military. So far, though, austerity has mostly stayed at the level of principle.Lockheed Martin reported financial results on Tuesday that might make one forget that sequestration – the indiscriminate spending cuts meant to trim a tenth from every line in the Pentagon’s budget – went into effect in March. Revenue in the last quarter fell a bit but margins expanded and earnings per share rose 11 per cent. Profit targets for the year were bumped up. On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported flat revenue and earnings – a better result than Wall Street had projected – and gave its earnings targets an upward nudge. Also on Wednesday, Northrop Grumman reported flat sales and earnings up 9 per cent. It inched targets up, too.Budget strains did show up here and there. Products with shorter delivery cycles, such as information technology and consulting, are being hit. Lockheed’s and Northrup’s information systems segments both saw sales drop. The wind-down of the war in Afghanistan may be having an effect too. General Dynamics’s combat systems division, which makes tanks and vehicles, saw revenue fall by a quarter. But most products with long cycles – aircraft, ships – are doing fine.Over the past six months or so the three companies’ shares have risen in lockstep and their valuations have reached roughly 12 times forward earnings – post-crisis highs. It is an open question, however, how much of that has to do with the fact that austerity turns out, in the military’s case, to be a slow process and how much of it has to do with the shrinking risk premiums for equities in general. It is at the very least possible that the fate of investors in military contractors depends less on the Department of Defence than on the Federal Reserve.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
166;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-24T15:42:46Z;Biggest military contractors lift forecasts;Northrop and GD confirm defence industry strength;Northrop Grumman confirmed the robust health of the US’s biggest military contractors with better-than-expected net profits for the second quarter and a 10 per cent increase in its full-year earnings forecast.The lift in Northrop Grumman’s earnings guidance – from an earnings per share range of $6.85 to $7.15 to a $7.60 to $7.80 range – follows a smaller increase in full-year forecast reported on Tuesday by Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues.General Dynamics, the US’s fourth-biggest military supplier by revenues, reinforced the strong industry trend as it reported on Wednesday that second quarter net earnings were 1 per cent higher at $640m.The military suppliers are benefiting from the lag effect as the biggest, most complex military programmes continue to spend money allocated up to eight years ago, long before across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts started to take effect. Some may also be benefiting from the Pentagon’s apparent determination to safeguard some of the biggest, most strategically important military items from the cuts’ effects.Under the sequestration legislation – which was passed to end the 2011 stand-off over the US’s debt ceiling and came into force from March 1 this year – spending on nearly every US defence budget item is meant to be cut by 10 per cent.Northrop Grumman benefited particularly from strong demand for some unmanned systems – one of its specialities – and demand for Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, to which Northrop Grumman is a significant contributor. The two factors combined to push up the aerospace division’s operating income by 15 per cent to $336m, on sales which were up 8.7 per cent to $2.61bn.Net income at the electronic systems division rose 17 per cent to $322m on sales up 1.5 per cent to $1.77bn. The company attributed the growth to higher international sales and sales of sensing equipment and for space programmes.Northrop suffered the effects of sequestration in its information systems and technical services divisions. Such short-term businesses, which are funded from current year budgets, have been faster to experience sequestration’s effects than longer-term programmes. Information systems’ operating income fell 30 per cent to $141m, while technical services’ operating income fell 6.8 per cent to $69m.Wes Bush, chief executive, said Northrop would remain focused on maintaining its programmes’ performance and effective cash deployment.General Dynamics’ net income improved because of a 51 per cent increase to $389m in earnings in its aerospace division, which makes Gulfstream corporate jets. However, net income in its combat systems division, which mostly makes ground combat vehicles, fell 32 per cent to $218m.Northrop’s shares were up 3.8 per cent at lunchtime in New York, at $92.14, while GD’s were up 2.89 per cent at $86.46.
167;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-23T21:33:37Z;United Technologies gains on raised earnings guidance;;The S&P 500 rally paused on Tuesday as the summer earnings season drove investors to companies with positive outlooks, including United Technologies, which raised its future earnings guidance.UT shares rose 3 per cent to $105.12 despite missing revenue expectations. Optimism about the aerospace industry, however, cheered investors, as the company raised the low end of its 2013 earnings per share forecast.The company is up 28.2 per cent on the year to date.Lockheed Martin shares also rose after the company lifted its guidance and reported earnings per share that beat estimates.The defence contractor gained 2 per cent to $117.92 and is up 27.8 per cent in 2013. The company’s success has come in the face of concerns over US government cuts, which have generally avoided the major defence projects.The S&P 500 ticked down 0.2 per cent to 1,692.39, led lower by the information technology sector, off 0.5 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was fractionally higher at 15,567.89, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.6 per cent to 3,579.27.Apple, the heaviest-weighted stock on the Nasdaq, fell 1.7 per cent to $418.99 in trading before the company released earnings after the bell.However, shares jumped 3 per cent shortly after the market closed after the company said iPhone sales beat expectations last quarter. But the company lowered revenue guidance in the next three months.The decline by the S&P 500 and was only its third day of losses in 16 July trading sessions. It is up 4.5 per cent in that time and now 18.7 per cent higher on the year to date.With the benchmark index nearing the 1,700 level, some concern has emerged over whether individual companies can justify elevated stock prices.Shares have been particularly sensitive to guidance in the summer earnings season as investors look to see how companies are positioned in a slowly growing US economy.“There’s not really anything to tell you that there’s cracks. Everything looks solid. To me, it’s just a matter of how high we can push in the short term,” said Michael Gibbs, co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James. “I would say 85 to 90 per cent of the trading is impacted by earnings.”An improved earnings outlook also helped Texas Instruments, which rose 4 per cent to $38.93. The world’s fourth-largest chipmaker by revenues also beat earnings per share estimates.It was not all positive guidance and price increases for stocks on Monday.Netflix fell 4.5 per cent to $250.26 after the company reported subscriber growth that disappointed investors, despite also logging more than $1bn in revenue.The company is still the best performing stock on the S&P 500 in 2013, up 170.3 per cent.Insurance provider Travelers fell 3.7 per cent to $82.21 after revenue fell and missed expectations.Wendy’s posted profits that beat expectations and said that it will sell more of its restaurants to franchisees, which will in turn boost its long-term earnings expectations. Shares in the hamburger chain rose 8.2 per cent to $7.23.Parcel delivery group UPS said its second-quarter performance was “disappointing” after reporting a decline of 4 per cent in net income. Shares in the company, known for its brown trucks, were only off 0.1 per cent to $87.51.Marlboro-maker Altria, previously known as Philip Morris, raised its full-year guidance but missed revenue expectations. Shares were off 2.4 per cent, also hampered by news that US regulators were considering limits on the sale of menthol cigarettes.
168;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-23T13:00:59Z;Defence contractors hopeful that big US programmes are safe;;"Contractors involved in some of the US military’s most sensitive and high-profile procurement projects are growing increasingly optimistic that some programmes could escape largely unscathed from sequestration spending cuts.The spared programmes would include those so complex, long-term or strategically important that it could prove nearly impossible to impose the spending cuts, introduced on March 1, meant to cut nearly every US defence budget item by around 10 per cent.Among the items that look likely to survive relatively unscathed are programmes to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News Shipbuilding yard in Virginia, Boeing’s KC46A air tanker refuelling aircraft and Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter.However, because many of the most complex items are paid for out of funds committed years in advance, it may take years for Defence Department policy in the area to become clear.Some further clarity may emerge this week when five big military contractors – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon – all report second-quarter figures.Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, said sequestration’s near-term impact on his business was “fairly neutral” – but he accepted programmes might later be delayed slightly.“The intermediate impact is scheduling of future programmes could start to be impacted,” he said. “I think aircraft carriers, submarines and destroyers are the priorities. Everything else is in the mix of, ‘What can we do for the money we have left?’”Mr Petters’ view echoes that expressed by Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics’ chief executive, at a Deutsche Bank conference in June.She said that in a “budget-constrained environment” mature, established “programmes of record” – those already fully established and properly funded – tended to do better than “high-risk, developmental programmes”.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“So, to the extent that the department has some discretion in how they apply their reductions, you’re likely to see the programmes of record doing better and booking rates should be unaffected,” she said.Another figure in the sector pointed out that Pentagon officials had recently made supportive statements about the F35.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst for the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said it was “quite possibly true” that Huntington Ingalls’ key aircraft carrier and nuclear attack submarine programmes would largely escape cuts.Mr Thompson also predicted the F35, the DDG-51 destroyer, the air tanker and Boeing’s MV-22 Osprey rotorcraft would largely escape cuts, thanks to their strategic importance and the costs of modifying the programmes.Several defence contractors have already warned they expect sequestration to hit this year’s revenues at their services arms. Unlike long-term procurement programmes, for which funds are allocated years in advance, services tend to be paid for out of present-year budgets.Light armoured vehicles of the kind used heavily in Afghanistan are expected to become a far lower priority, following the US military drawdown there.F-35: Lockheed MartinThree branches of the US military – the marines, air force and navy – plan to buy some of the 2,443 F35s on order from Lockheed Martin, in a programme whose total cost is now expected to reach $1.5tn. The aircraft’s centrality to the US’s future defence plans, and the challenges in further adjusting it, are expected to leave it largely intact.KC-46A Tanker: BoeingThe tanker aircraft, being built by Boeing and based on its 767-200 commercial aircraft, is critical to replace the air force’s existing tanker fleet and preserve the reach of the air force’s other aircraft.Gerald Ford class aircraft carriers: Huntington IngallsIt takes around 11 years to build each $5bn aircraft carrier, from first steel-cutting to entry into service. US legislation also requires the navy have 11 operational at any one time, although only 10 are currently available. The carriers’ vital role in securing the US’s strategic position – and the complexity of altering the order – makes it likely the programme will survive with only some slowing.Virginia-class attack submarines: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe nuclear-powered attack submarines have a vital strategic role.DDG51 Destroyers: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe destroyers are expected to play a vital role in missile defence and other key strategic initiatives.MV22 Osprey rotorcraft: BoeingThe MV22 is considered vital to the marines’ ability to airlift troops over long distances. Equipped with two large rotors and wings, it operates like a helicopter when taking off or landing but swivels its rotors and converts itself into a faster, more fuel-efficient fixed-wing aircraft when travelling long distances.Programmes expected to sufferAbrams Tank: General DynamicsThe US Army, which is currently parking some tanks currently not needed, wants to stop production of the tank but has so far been ordered by Congress to keep building the vehicles.Bradley Fighting Vehicle: BAE SystemsThe programme is also threatened because of the number of vehicles already in service.Joint Light Tactical Vehicle: manufacturer not yet selectedThere has been speculation that the JLTV – intended to replace the Humvee as a battlefield vehicle – could be cancelled because of sequestration and the need to focus on other priorities."
169;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-23T12:36:53Z;Long-term work shields Newport News shipyard from US defence cuts;;"It is hard, when visiting the Newport News shipyard, in the Virginia town of the same name, to square the scene with the gloom widely predicted for military contractors following the start of deep, indiscriminate defence spending cuts earlier this year.The streets in the shipyard – so big it has its own railway, fire brigade and road names – teem with vehicles and workers going to and from the scores of buildings. The site, owned by Huntington Ingalls, remains Virginia’s biggest industrial employer, with 22,000 workers, well above its post cold war lows.But, from the office of Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, overlooking the yard, it becomes clear why the company and a handful of other key US military contractors are relatively unconcerned about the effects of sequestration, which mandates that nearly all US defence budget items must be cut by about 10 per cent.At one end of the yard, employees are still working on an aircraft carrier – the USS Gerald R Ford – on which work started in 2005. Further down, work is under way to “inactivate” the 52-year-old USS Enterprise, the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which needs its nuclear reactor and other sensitive equipment removed. Next to it, work is under way to overhaul and refuel the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier built in 1986.The long planning horizons for such work mean that Huntington Ingalls and a few other key companies on big, sophisticated, long-term projects are still working with money set aside by the US Congress as much as eight years ago.“It’s not a this year effect,” Mr Petters says of sequestration. “It’s not even a this year or next couple of years effect. It’s more of a medium to long-term effect.”However, the question that looms over Huntington Ingalls as surely as the vast crane over the Gerald Ford is whether the tougher budget environment will eventually catch up with its work. It remains unclear whether military services will seek to make cuts solely in less high-profile programmes and spare aircraft carriers and other key programmes – or cut 10 per cent from all procurement programmes across the board.“The question is, ‘How does the navy buy 90 per cent of a ship?’” Mr Petters says.Even before sequestration, spending was falling following the US’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, which many analysts expect to hit sales of some types of ground-fighting vehicles – a speciality of BAE Systems and General Dynamics. Some programmes might, however, be boosted by the US’s shift in strategic focus towards being able to fight a war in the Pacific, which is expected to ensure continued demand for the warships that Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works and others manufacture.All the decisions, meanwhile, are being taken against the background of continued political disagreements over budgets in Washington. Arrival at Newport News of the Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier due to undergo $2.6bn of refit and refuelling work, was delayed because of Congress’s initial failure to agree a federal budget for 2013, which meant the money for the project was at first unavailable.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“We did find ourselves in a predicament,” says Mr Petters, who adds that the stand-off was eventually resolved – and the vessel delivered – in time for the issue not to affect the shipyard’s revenue for the year.The key to understanding the future impact of the myriad budget changes under way is that sequestration – introduced in legislation that ended the crisis over the US’s debt ceiling – was intended to be so irrational that all involved would find an alternative means of putting the US’s public finances back into order.The Pentagon is consequently faced with trying to make rational procurement choices based on a law intended to be irrational.“There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty around US defence spending and the impacts of sequestration,” says Northrop Grumman, another significant contractor, which declines to speculate on how its programmes might be affected.Huntington Ingalls executives expect the Pentagon to protect the key programmes and relegate other equipment to what it calls “the scrum” of less strategically important equipment. Huntington Ingalls could suffer from cuts to programmes to build amphibious assault ships, which it makes at the second of its two shipyards in Mississippi. But continued protection for the most strategically sensitive ships would leave it in an unusually strong position compared with rivals.It is “quite possibly true” that the company will continue to evade serious cuts in its biggest programmes, says Loren Thompson, defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.“Huntington Ingalls is the only major defence contractor that’s currently talking about margin expansion,” he says.However, Mr Thompson predicts there will, if sequestration continues, eventually be slowdowns even to the highest-profile programmes. Mr Petters agrees there could be slippage.“Sequestration might cause a programme to move from 2014 to 2015 or 2015 to 2016,” Mr Petters says.For the moment, however, the flow of work for the yard looks likely to remain strong.Next to the Gerald Ford’s dry dock, cut steel and other early components for the USS John F Kennedy, its sister ship, lie waiting. Work on that vessel started, with congressional funding, in 2011, even though no formal contract has yet been signed. Once the contract is signed, Newport News workers are expected to be busy with that vessel until at least 2021."
170;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Lockheed Martin raises guidance despite US defence spending cuts;;Lockheed Martin underlined the continued robust health of many large US defence contractors when it announced a 10 per cent increase in second-quarter net earnings and increased its guidance for the full year despite sequestration spending cuts.Lockheed, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, announced that net earnings for the three months to June 30 rose to $859m from $781m in the second quarter last year, despite a 4 per cent decline in net sales to $11.4bn.The company also increased its forecast for full-year earnings per share, to a range of $9.20-$9.50 from $8.80-$9.10 when the company reported first-quarter figures in April.The figures showed how the biggest contractors working on the largest contracts continue to be largely shielded from the effects of the sequestration spending cuts that came into force on March 1. The legislation demands that the US defence department slash all budgets by about 10 per cent each – but the biggest, most complex projects continue to run from funding allocated as long as eight years ago, meaning the effects so far have been muted.Lockheed Martin is the main contractor building the F35, the fighter due to become the mainstay of the US air force, navy and marines, which is expected eventually to cost $1.5tn.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the company’s strong operational performance and programme execution across all its business areas in the quarter had enabled it to increase its financial guidance.“Even in an uncertain budget environment, our portfolio of products and capabilities, robust cash generation, and outstanding performance by our 116,000 employees, continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders,” she said.Lockheed said in April when it announced first-quarter figures that it expected sequestration to reduce its sales for the year by $825m – but it left its profit forecasts unchanged.Operating profits in the key aeronautics division – which builds the F35 and other military aircraft – fell 10 per cent to $407m, on barely changed sales of $3.41bn. The division benefited from increasing sales of the F35 but suffered from lower sales of older, better established aircraft, particularly the F22.Operating profits in information systems and global solutions also fell by 6.7 per cent to $194m, on sales down 7 per cent to $2.1bn. Services businesses such as those the division operates – which are funded out of short-term budgets – have tended to suffer most heavily from sequestration.In missiles systems and fire control, operating profit jumped 22 per cent to $381m, on sales up 11 per cent to $2.04bn, boosted by increased demand for its Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defence missile defence products.Earnings per diluted share increased 11 per cent to $2.64.
171;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-10T08:03:29Z;India: backtracking on local electronics;;"India has succumbed to pressure from governments, multinationals and industry bodies abroad to review its policy of boosting locally-made electronics.It’s good news for international business. But what are the consequences for the Indian economy if demand for electronic products is increasingly served by imports?Last year, the Indian Cabinet passed the controversial Preferential Market Access (PMA) policy, which helps electronic goods manufactured within the country. The PMA forces producers of electronic goods to set up shop in India to get full access to the market. It also skirted around India’s international rules against protectionism by saying the measures are necessary for security reasons.On Tuesday, the prime minister’s office said:Concerns have been raised in many quarters on different aspects of the PMA Policy, particularly policy relating to procurement by the private sector for electronic products with security implications.So the policy is now going to be reviewed – with particular attention to standards for security-related products – and submitted to the Cabinet.The Indian government announced the possible U-turn on the policy just as finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, is visiting the US where he is meeting with various companies – including Microsoft and Lockheed Martin – hoping to encourage foreign investment into India.There has been a lot of pressure from Washington to relax limits on trade and foreign investment in Asia’s third largest economy. As the FT reported last month ahead of John Kerry’s visit to India:US companies have expressed growing frustration at what they are calling New Delhi’s recent “discriminatory” trade practices, and their grievances threaten to vitiate progress in bilateral relations over the last decade, with US legislators, both Republicans and Democrats, expressing growing concern about the issue.Industry bodies welcomed Tuesday’s decision, with John Neuffer of the Informational Technology Industry Council, which includes Google, IBM and Microsoft within its members, commenting in a blog post:Given India’s international influence, the broader ramifications of such forced localization include a contagion effect, inducing other countries to take similar actions. And that leaves us in a race to the bottom.But for India, changes to the policy could have less positive consequences. Policy makers widely agree that the country’s unsustainable current account deficit is currently the biggest concern for the economy. And the preference for domestically produced electronic products has helped to curb imports in the sector.India’s Policy on Electronics 2012 went so far as saying that imports of electronic items will exceed oil imports by 2020 if the government doesn’t foster the domestic industry. It warned:At the current rate of growth, domestic production can cater to a demand of USD 100 billion in 2020 as against a demand of USD 400 billion and the rest would have to be met by imports.Related reading:

172;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-07-01T16:35:48Z;Lockheed launches overseas division;Cuts in US military spending force defence contractor to look abroad;Lockheed Martin of the US has launched an international division as cuts in US military spending and the increasingly onerous demands of developing nations force the world’s biggest defence contractor to focus more of its resources and attention overseas.Lockheed’s decision was all about capturing international growth, said Pat Dewar, the 28-year company veteran who will head the new division and report directly to its chief executive. The company wants to increase the share of its international revenue from $8bn, or about 17 per cent of total revenue today, to around 20 per cent of total revenue within the coming few years.Lockheed sells everything from naval vessels to secure cyber systems and fighter jets to missile defence systems, and its biggest international operations are in the UK, Australia and Canada. However, Lockheed trails behind its smaller competitors, including Boeing, Raytheon and BAE Systems, which each derive at least a quarter of their total revenue from international sales.Amid the fiscal austerity in the west, Lockheed is increasingly targeting oil-rich and faster developing nations, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia for future sales growth. Many of these countries demand added commitments called offsets. Illegal under WTO rules in any industry other than defence, offsets are becoming an increasingly big part of defence contractors’ work outside the US and Europe.The US Department of Commerce defines offsets as “Industrial compensation practices required as a condition of purchase in either government-to-government or commercial sales of defense articles and/or defense services”.In practice offsets mean anything from a defence contractor committing to marketing a country’s wine or furniture, counting fish, opening a university or constructing a local factory it would not otherwise have built.But increasingly, countries are becoming more sophisticated and are demanding direct offsets as they seek to move up the value chain by participating in the construction of the piece of defence equipment being purchased and receiving the often-proprietary technical knowhow involved.Strict Itar regulations in the US hinder companies such as Lockheed Martin from giving away their most sophisticated technology secrets, but Mr Dewar says the company has plenty more to offer.In an interview with the FT, he said: “In most cases they are really just interested in building their technological base. If they can’t build a heat-seeking missile because of Itar, that’s OK.”In the UAE for example, Lockheed Martin is satisfying its offset requirement through its civil technologies, such as those in energy, he noted.Despite the big financial commitments involved, not all defence companies make public the size of their offset commitments. Lockheed Martin is one of the few that does. Its offset commitment last year was $9.3bn, while international sales were $8bn and total sales $47bn.Alluding to the importance of offsets in winning international work, Marillyn Hewson introduced her decision to create Lockheed Martin International, as it is to be called, saying: “We are at our best internationally when we are helping governments to protect their citizens and to provide essential services. We are also at our best when we are helping them to cultivate technical expertise, economic development for their countries, and job growth.”LMI will have dual headquarters, one in London and the other at the company’s head office just outside Washington.Additional reporting by Daniella Tsar in London
173;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-06-16T21:15:21Z;F-35: JSF hopes rise at Lockheed as costs level off;Programme’s success relies on US orders, writes Carola Hoyos;For years Lockheed Martin’s programme to deliver the world’s most modern jet fighter has struggled to keep its deadlines and its price promises. The total cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme over its 50-year life is now estimated at $1.5tn, making it the most expensive military procurement programme in US history.But the JSF is at a “tipping point”, says Steve O’Brien, Lockheed Martin’s vice-president of business development for the F-35. Ever the optimist, Mr O’Brien may be right this time.On May 31 the Pentagon promised Congress that by the end of 2015, F-35s would for the first time be ready to go to war. It is an important milestone that will first be met by the marines, when they take delivery of their aircraft, followed a year later by the air force and in 2019 the navy.The path towards those dates has been far from smooth. Often the Pentagon did not see eye to eye with Lockheed Martin, criticising its development setbacks, disagreeing on price and clashing over which side should carry the cost increases. The Pentagon even put one of the three variants of the aircraft on probation when it failed to hit its technical targets.After years of a difficult relationship, the rhetoric between the two is beginning to converge.Christopher Bogdan, a lieutenant general in the air force and head of the F-35 programme for the Pentagon, recently noted that management changes at Lockheed Martin, which include the promotion of Marillyn Hewson to chief executive, had resulted in “a different culture” at the company he had previously accused of putting short-term profit before the long-term future of the F-35 programme.More importantly, the Pentagon last month was able to give Congress some good news on a programme so maligned that John McCain, Republican senator for Arizona, in 2011 had called it “a scandal and a tragedy”.In its annual report, the Pentagon for the first time showed a year-on-year drop in the forecast cost of F-35’s development, which is expected to come in at $391bn, down from the $395bn expectation last year. The total cost of the 50-year programme was pegged at $1.5tn, down from $1.51tn, though it remains dependent on fuel costs.With the drop, the F-35 managed to buck the general trend across the US’s 78 main arms programmes whose costs rose $40bn, or 2.4 per cent, over the year.But the cost of JSF not only hinges on Lockheed. Because the programme works on economies of scale, JSF’s price depends on how many aircraft the US and other customers purchase and how quickly.The US is by far the most important variable. To meet so-called initial operating capacity the marines and navy need only 10 aircraft and the air force 12 “with enough trained and equipped personnel to support the various missions prescribed by each service”, according to the Pentagon. But the success of the programme hinges on far greater numbers of aircraft being bought.In total, the US has said it plans to buy 2,443 F-35 jets. Keeping that pledge is of crucial importance to both Lockheed Martin and its other customers: the UK, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Israel, and potential purchasers, such as Canada, South Korea and Singapore.“There is nothing in the technical realm that keeps anyone up at night,” Mr O’Brien says. But he and his colleagues are still having to work hard to keep politicians on board. Several countries are reconsidering the size and timing of their purchase, not least because the downturn in western economies has prompted a major retrenchment in the amount of money governments will spend on their militaries.One of the most notable setbacks was Canada’s decision this year to reconsider its purchase of 65 F-35s, announcing it was going back to the drawing board and demoting the JSF from primary choice to just one of several being considered.Though Australia has confirmed its commitment to the programme, Dutch politicians are wobbling, Italy, the UK and other countries are likely to buy far fewer aircraft and later than they had initially indicated. While such reconsiderations may be bad for the programme’s image, they are far outweighed by the importance of the US decision. So far, the JSF programme in the US has escaped any large cuts in numbers or costly delays in purchasing. This is despite the US defence budget having come under considerable pressure as lawmakers have attempted to reduce the gaping US deficit.The effect of the most recent 10 per cent cut in the defence budget has not yet been felt and Lockheed has warned the Pentagon that costs of the F-35 could rise as a result.The more the US cuts its purchase, the more Mr O’Brien and Lockheed will have to try to get other countries on board.He has a strong selling point: one of the big attractions of the F-35 – beyond its radar-evading capabilities – is that it allows countries to join a powerful team captained by the mighty US. With the crucial date on which JSF will become useful in sight, and as long as the programme does not slip back into its troubled past, Mr O’Brien may be right that it has reached a tipping point and finally find that his positive outlook is rewarded by countries such as Singapore and South Korea signing up to the programme.
174;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-06-16T21:15:21Z;Commentary: Weapons makers focus on returns;If demand remains weak, they will begin exploring new combinations to strengthen financial results, says Loren Thompson;Washington’s budget debates are so complicated that even members of Congress have trouble keeping up with the state of play. But the fundamental reality for the defence industry is simply this: spending on military hardware and services is likely to continue falling, forcing some companies to leave the business or merge with competitors.The last time the defence sector faced such a swoon in demand – after the collapse of the Soviet Union – the purchasing power of the Pentagon’s procurement account fell by 60 per cent, while spending on personnel and operations declined much less. Despite all the talk of “across the board” cuts in defence spending, a similar pattern is likely this time.Look at the evidence. Only months after it took office in 2009, the Obama administration moved to kill a dozen large weapons programmes, including the air force’s F-22 fighter, the army’s planned family of networked combat vehicles and a missile defence cruiser for the navy. As the end of its first term neared, the administration conceded that most of the defence savings it had booked came from weapons accounts. No bases had been closed, no military benefits had been repealed.Contrary to popular myth, when peace looms at the Pentagon it is the weapons accounts that get cut first and furthest, because they have the least political protection.When Robert Gates, former defence secretary, proposed modest increases in the co-payments made by recipients of military healthcare, the whole political system was up in arms. When the centrepiece of army modernisation was killed, Congress barely noticed.Thus, sequestration – across the board cuts – may be a better outcome for the industry than what the political system would do in the absence of legislative mandates. With no urgent threats to focus the collective mind on consequences, and support for the two parties evenly divided in the electorate, the political impulse is to slash weapons spending while protecting people (namely, voters).The defence industry figured this out before Barack Obama took office, and has spent the better part of a decade preparing for hard times. That has had the paradoxical effect of bolstering company results in the near term, because costs were pared even as contracts signed in better times continued to generate cash. So the shares of many companies are trading at multiyear highs despite the softening in Pentagon demand.Big players such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems can probably sustain strong results for several more years by keeping programmes that remain on track and managing their finances. A favoured tactic is to buy back shares, which if done at a faster rate than revenues decline can raise earnings per share even in a weak-demand environment. Fifth-ranked Pentagon supplier Northrop Grumman plans to buy back a quarter of its shares over the next three years.Eventually, erosion at the top line will affect the bottom line, too, especially as the Pentagon is tightening up on terms and conditions for new contracts. Unless demand revives in response to a new threat, the defence industry will go through a consolidation wave, as seen in previous downturns.Consolidation has begun in the technical services segment, because contracts are renewed more often there. Therefore, the impact of softening demand is being felt sooner. Michael Lewis, analyst at the Virginia-based Silverline Group consultancy, believes big service players will first disassemble themselves, selectively spinning off properties, before consolidating in a handful of more resilient entities.On the hardware side, the biggest players are under little immediate pressure to make strategic moves, given their recent financial performance and share price appreciation. If demand remains weak, though, they will begin exploring new combinations to strengthen financial results.Warship and tank producer General Dynamics could prove to be an innovator in sector consolidation because the company has a history of making bold strategic moves. But in the near-term, the main weapons makers will focus on maintaining returns to shareholders. Lockheed Martin and Boeing believe there is plenty of untapped potential for overseas sales of their military aircraft, especially the fifth-generation F-35 fighter.——————————————-Loren Thompson is chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute think-tank and chief executive of the Source Associates consultancy.

175;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed says budget cuts will raise F35 costs;;Across-the-board US government spending cuts are likely to inflate the overall cost of the F35 jet fighter, according to Lockheed Martin, the country’s biggest military supplier and the programme’s main contractor.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive of the military contractor, said the cuts could delay cost improvements in the programme and push up future aircraft price tags of the $382bn project.Ms Hewson, speaking to the Financial Times about the effects of sequestration, stressed that the company had so far received no formal notification from the defence department about its plans.The spending cuts, which came into effect from March 1, mandate the indiscriminate cutback of about 10 per cent in each item of the US defence department’s budget.But the full impact of the cuts and their effects on the Pentagon’s suppliers are difficult to assess because the department allocates spending for most large-scale programmes some years in advance, meaning the largest procurement programmes have yet to be touched.“We know they do recognise that the reduction in the number of aircraft [under construction at any time] can drive up unit costs,” said Ms Hewson. “They’re working in whatever way they can to minimise that impact.”A slowdown in the progress of aircraft production – a likely outcome of sequestration – would cost Lockheed Martin additional time and money before it could achieve the hoped-for economies of scale from high-volume production.“It’s very hard to offset a volume decline in terms of cost per unit in any programme,” Ms Hewson said.The best prospect for the mitigation of the effects of sequestration would be the sale of more of the F35 aircraft to countries not so far on the customer list, such as Singapore and South Korea.The F35 joint strike fighter is the world’s largest military procurement programme, involving an order for 2,443 aircraft for the US military, as well as aircraft for other countries including the UK.Lockheed, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, has been gradually increasing the number of aircraft under construction at its Fort Worth plant in Texas, a process that would normally produce cost savings for both the contractor and the Pentagon. Lockheed and the Pentagon negotiate prices for each batch of aircraft in the low initial rate of production, based on achieved costs, and are targets for future cost saving.Lockheed estimated on April 23 that sequestration cuts would slash its revenue for this year by $825m, but that its profitability would not be affected. A third of the shortfall would come in the short-cycle Information Systems and Global Solutions business, another third in the Missiles and Fire Control division and the rest across the company.“What we do expect is that, as the customers come out with how they will adapt to sequestration, the larger impact will be in 2014 and beyond,” Ms Hewson said.
176;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;US budget cuts to hit Lockheed sales;;Lockheed Martin said US government spending cuts would reduce its sales for the year by $825m, as it became one of the first big military contractors to put a figure on the impact of the across-the-board reductions.Lockheed, the world’s biggest military contractor by revenues, said on Tuesday the revenue cut would leave sales for the year at the lower end of its previous $44.5bn to $46bn estimate. It left its other projections for consolidated operating profit of $4.35bn to $4.5bn and earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.10 unchanged.Lockheed, like nearly all other big US-based military contractors, published full-year projections in January on the basis that sequestration – an across-the-board, indiscriminate programme of spending cuts– would not come into force. The cuts nevertheless began on March 1.The company announced the new projections as it published first-quarter net earnings up 14 per cent to $761m on net sales down 2 per cent to $11.1bn.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said the full-year profit projections had held steady despite the projected sales forecast because first-quarter profits had been better than expected.“We’re off to a better start than we had expected,” he said.Sequestration was likely to have a greater impact in the second and third quarters, during the run-up to the end of the US government’s fiscal year on September 30, he said.The net earnings improvement largely reflected a $102m fall in unallocated expenses, which include items such as pension accounting adjustments, to $194m, although a $30m charge for workforce reductions at the information systems and global solutions division partially offset that improvement.That unit’s operating profit rose $1m from last year’s first quarter to $189m, while sales rose 1 per cent to $2.11bn.Marillyn Hewson, chief executive, said the company continued to “work closely” with its customers to understand the future impact sequestration might have on its programmes.Sequestration cuts about 9 per cent from every military spending programme not directly involved in supporting current military operations. But its impact is likely to remain muted at first for many manufacturers because the largest programmes are built over many years, with money allocated in previous years’ budgets.Contractors will probably feel the impact first at divisions offering information technology and other short-term services to the military, since those tend to be funded from current-year budgets.Net sales at the core aeronautics division, which makes the F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighters as well as the C-130 transport aircraft, fell 14 per cent to $3.19bn on far lower deliveries of F-35s and some other aircraft types.Operating profits at missiles and fire control fell 7 per cent to $344m, on net sales up 13 per cent to $1.99bn, while operating profit at mission systems and training rose 28 per cent to $201m, on flat net sales of $1.83bn. Space systems’ operating profits fell 4 per cent to $230m, on net sales up 4 per cent to $1.96bn.Diluted earnings per share improved 15 per cent to $2.33.Lockheed’s shares rose 1.45 per cent to $97.24.
177;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed plots survival strategy;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by sales, aims to survive US defence spending cuts through increased overseas sales and diversifying into healthcare information systems and energy technology, a senior executive has said.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, was speaking at a conference organised by JPMorgan, the investment bank, days after the start of swingeing sequestration cuts in US government spending, which fall especially heavily on defence.Mr Tanner said Lockheed would feel the cuts quickest in its information systems and global solutions business, whose US government work is generally paid for from budget funds allocated the same year. The automatic federal budget cuts started taking hold on March 1.It would be 2014 and 2015 before the company started to feel the cuts’ full effects in other businesses, such as aeronautics, where money is typically allocated three years before it is spent.However, Mr Tanner said growth in US military expenditure would not run at the rate of the past decade and the company needed to make “strategic decisions” about entering other fields.“We have an internal quote: ‘We do difficult’,” Mr Tanner said. “Wherever we see those sorts of problems, we think we have a play.”The company saw opportunities to deploy its skills in cyber security and to provide information systems for healthcare, if the US federal government took over more responsibility for that, Mr Tanner said.The company’s various technologies could also help to improve the efficiency of US electricity grids, reducing the need to bring in new generating capacity, Mr Tanner said. “We do a lot of materials work. We think we have a lot of very interesting technology with regard to efficiency for the current grid system.”Mr Tanner also outlined plans to increase the proportion of Lockheed’s sales to international customers, which accounted for 17 per cent of 2012’s $47.2bn of sales.“The good news about international sales is they have never heard of the word sequester and they’re not subject to it,” Mr Tanner said.Among the products that Lockheed planned to try to sell more widely internationally were missile defence systems, the C130 transport aircraft and, ultimately, the high-technology F35 combat aircraft, which it is currently producing.Using the C130 as an example of the role international sales could play, he said the company planned to “feather” new international orders into C130 production schedules. Such an approach would mean it could maintain its 24-a-year production schedule.Lockheed’s annual 10K results filing last week said the defence industry could suffer contract terminations, factory closures and thousands of job losses because of sequestration.
178;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-03-04T21:39:17Z;US equities rebound in late session;;Defence company shares were hit as the Pentagon was expected to face the heaviest of the budget cuts due to sequestration, even as markets mostly shrugged off fears over $85bn in federal spending cuts in 2013.The S&P 500 aerospace and defence sub-sector closed down 0.7 per centCompanies such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman had already seen their shares suffer since the beginning of the year and warned that they would face contract terminations, factory closures and thousands of job losses once cuts became effective.Shares in Lockheed Martin fell 1.4 per cent to $86.98 and have lost 5.6 per cent year to date.Northrop Grumman lost 1.7 per cent to $64.43.Analysts at Citi Research, however, told clients that the defence sector had been oversold.“Assuming this base case of flat budgets pans out, the market is too negative on defence, pricing in a perpetual reduction in free cash flow anywhere from 1-7 per cent. Even if we adjust for sequester, we still consider the market to be overly negative,” the note said.The rest of the US equity markets recovered from early losses and moved closer to multiyear highs on the first day of trading after fiscal sequestration came into effect on Friday night. Investors last week brushed off the potential impact, with indices trading near cyclical peaks.Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote that equity markets have “depoliticised”, at a time when political rancour has hit a crescendo, and returned to fundamentals.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher on Monday at 1,525.20 with investors favouring defensive sectors stocks such as utilities and telecoms, while shunning energy, industrials and materials.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 14,127.82, less than 40 points away from an all-time high last reached in October 2007.Still, shares in miners and metal producers were hit after a report by Deutsche Bank said iron ore prices may slump 24 per cent by the end of this year as supply expands.In a research note, they wrote that low steel demand from China and an abundance of scrap metal were key threats to prices.Shares in Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore producer, fell 5.8 per cent to $23.78, making it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index. Shares in Allegheny Technologies dropped 1.6 per cent to $29.82, while United States Steel lost 1.3 per cent to $20.05.Hess shares climbed after the oil and gas company said it would quit its retail, energy marketing and energy trading businesses and increase dividends. The company was responding to pressure from its third-largest shareholder, Elliott Management, which has long been lobbying for spinning off some of its assets. The shares rose 3.5 per cent to $68.84.JC Penney shares fell 5.6 per cent to $15.75 in extended-hours trading following a 5.4 per cent drop during the day, after CNBC reported that Deutsche Bank is offering 10m block of shares for sale.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 3,182.03.Shares in Apple, the largest component of the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq, fell 2.5 per cent to $419.57. The iPhone maker has lost more than 40 per cent of its market value since peaking last September.Netflix dropped 4.3 per cent to $181.21. The shares had gained more than 95 per cent since the start of the year.Yahoo shares rallied 3.5 per cent to $22.70 after analysts at Barclays upgraded the stock to “overweight”, saying minority stakes in businesses such as Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan have not been fully priced in.“The value of the company’s underlying Asian assets, namely Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan, have appreciated and the full value of these assets is not being ascribed to Yahoo shares,” the note said
179;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-03-03T17:59:20Z;Lockheed warns on defence cuts;;Contract terminations, factory closures and thousands of job losses could result from across-the-board spending cuts that several US defence suppliers had predicted would be averted, Lockheed Martin, the country’s biggest military supplier by sales, has warned.Lockheed, which manufactures the F35 joint strike fighter and F22 stealth fighter, gave its assessment of the likely effect of cuts – known as sequestration – in its annual 10K results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, published late last week.Lockheed and some other military contractors, including Raytheon, the missile and warship maker, predicted when announcing full-year results in January that sequestration cuts would be avoided.The cuts were mandated under the law that resolved the 2011 crisis over the US’s debt ceiling. They were intended to be so unpalatable that Congress and the federal government would agree alternative public finance reforms – but they came into force at midnight US eastern time on Friday.Nearly all spending on complex weapons systems such as aircraft and naval vessels is appropriated years ahead of time. As a result, it will take as long as five years for naval shipbuilders to feel the cuts’ full effects. However, suppliers of services to the military will feel the impact nearly immediately.Lockheed estimates that over 10 years, sequestration will cut the US defence budget by about the same amount as the $487bn, 10-year programme of spending cuts that started with the fiscal year to September 30 last year. Lockheed says in the 10K filing that it does not know sequestration’s “specific effects” but that there would be “significant consequences” for Lockheed Martin and the defence sector.“There would be disruption of ongoing programmes, impacts to our supply chain, contractual actions . . . potential facilities closures, and thousands of personnel reductions across the industry,” the form says. As a result, sequestration would have a “material effect” on the company. Lockheed urged the government on Friday to reverse sequestration and establish a “more rational” fiscal strategy. It would decide, based on guidance from its customers, whether it needed to warn employees their jobs could be lost.Raytheon said it was working with its customers to “attain guidance” on when cuts might be made.The ratings agency Moody’s said sequestration posed only a “modest near-term credit risk” for most defence contractors. But a deal to rebalance US government spending could cut military spending sharply.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst for the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said many big military procurement programmes had already been cut severely. The defence contractor most exposed to the services market – General Dynamics – took $2.3bn in impairment charges in the fourth quarter, mostly for writing down by $1.99bn the value of its information systems and technology group.
180;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-03-01T20:51:21Z;US sequestration: drama, comedy, horror;A collective case of shock fatigue suggests we have reached mid-series malaise;Think of recent US fiscal policy as a film franchise – part drama, part comedy, part horror. The opening instalment was the summer 2011 blockbuster, Debt Ceiling. The downgrade of US debt after the default brinkmanship made our jaws drop, but was followed by a clever plot twist: Treasuries rallied to all-time lows. And the brilliant producers, President Barack Obama and Speaker John Boehner, planted the seeds for a string of sequels. The winter showdown, Fiscal Cliff, ended with a feel-good (if temporary) holiday compromise.But with Friday’s release of Sequestration, featuring $85bn in automatic spending cuts slated for 2013 (the first of $1.2tn over a decade), we have reached mid-series malaise. The collective yawn from all involved indicate that this edition is one big plot hole. Mr Obama has hit the talk show circuit to vainly stoke up fervour among ordinary Americans. However his golf vacation, along with meaningless negotiations with Republicans, betray that Washington is resting up for its next project.What movie is the market watching instead? The reliable if dry Earnings Season is playing alongside the remake of Merger Mania (not as thrilling as the 2007 version) and with this double feature, the Dow is closing in on its all-time high of 14,164.That said, the defence names are indeed hitting the theatres for Sequestration. Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin are down as much as 5 per cent this year. The smaller defence companies that are more geared towards services could be harder hit. The government and military consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton is down nearly a tenth.The next contribution, Government Shutdown (an homage to the 1996 classic starring Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich) is only weeks away as Uncle Sam needs to fund its future operations. And Debt Ceiling III: Dirty Barry is slated for this summer, though these next two could mercifully be wrapped into one grand (bargain) finale.Movies are, ultimately, an escape. The reality remains weak gross domestic product growth and 8 per cent unemployment. And it may be a fantasy to think Washington could star in a movie about fixing that.
181;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Lockheed Martin goes on defence;Military supplier will need mission to prove its own belt tightening;Sequestration, shmequestration. Lockheed Martin on Thursday gave its forecasts for 2013. The biggest single supplier to the US defence department gave projections on the assumption that across-the-board cuts in federal spending will not happen. As part of the early 2013 deal to avert the fiscal cliff, lawmakers delayed this so-called sequestration. But unless the warring factions of Congress compromise on a budget, the automatic belt-tightening will hit in early March.Should Lockheed have laid out the disaster scenario, as well? That could have just spooked investors when neither they, nor Lockheed, nor indeed Congress itself is in a good position to estimate the probability of a deal – or to know precisely where cuts would come within the military budget.More importantly, cuts at the Pentagon are likely to show through in their suppliers’ accounts only gradually. A fighter jet is not built in a day, and some appropriations are done years in advance. The exception is information technology – computing, biometrics and cyber security – which has a shorter cycle.Military contractor General Dynamics, for example, on Wednesday announced a big writedown on acquisitions in the company’s IT group, based on lower defence spending. At Lockheed, the information systems segment accounts for about a fifth of sales, and revenues in the segment fell in 2012, while sales in every other segment rose or held steady.Whether Congress makes peace or not, defence spending, like all spending, is going to be under pressure. Even without the sequestration, Lockheed predicted that revenue would drop as much as 6 per cent in 2013, following a 1.5 per cent increase in 2012. If Lockheed is to grow its profits, it will have to prove its own belt tightening will proceed at a faster pace than the government’s.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

183;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-01-24T18:23:08Z;Break a wall of silence on cyber attacks;Many companies are terrified of talking publicly about the issue;"It was at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos six years ago that I first became seriously worried about the credit bubble. It was clear then, in January 2007, that problems were developing in complex credit. But it was also clear that the public and private sector were in widespread denial.That partly stemmed from an “agency dilemma”, as economists say: although there was plenty of unease about complex credit, no single company or government official wanted to blow the whistle, in case they suffered stigma or created panic. Thus it was frustratingly hard to pin down tangible names or numbers to articulate my fears; all I heard were whispers in Davos corridors.This week I have experienced an echo of this pattern at the 2013 WEF meeting. But this time my unease does not revolve around any financial threats, but another issue – cyber security. Most notably, after chatting to corporate executives at Davos this year, it is clear many are suffering a deluge of cyber attacks. Some of these emanate from teenage hackers, or opportunists trying to steal money or secrets; but many seem more malign, security experts say, with the potential to disable corporate systems or critical infrastructure.However, as in 2007, an “agency dilemma” is at work. In recent months, some companies (such as HSBC, Wells Fargo or Lockheed) have been forced to admit to suffering cyber attacks, after the penetration has become visible. But this is just the tip of a vast iceberg, and the overwhelming majority of companies today are terrified of talking too publicly about the issue, for fear of suffering stigma or sparking panic.That means it is tough for any outsider to get precise information about the overall scale of attacks. It is even tougher for shareholders to work out the degree to which individual companies are being targeted.Indeed, such is the reluctance to speak in public that while this year’s Davos meeting has conducted panel debates on the issue, there were almost no CEO participants at all; and it is hard to find an annual corporate report that delves into this issue in detail.Nevertheless, the whispers in the Davos corridors are sobering. The head of one big consultancy group, for example, says some global clients are experiencing around “15,000 attacks a day”. The chief executive of a large global bank says his institution is experiencing “10 times that” level of attack.Utilities (such as electricity networks) are suffering on a similar scale. Even hospitals are being attacked. “We found out a couple of weeks ago that we have been penetrated 180 times recently – it was a complete surprise,” the head of one big American hospital group told me. Or as a top executive of a US tech group observes: “The attacks are increasing exponentially. The question is not if, but when, something really bad occurs.”Is there any solution? In some countries, such as Australia, the government has become so worried about this “agency dilemma” that it has stepped in to force collective corporate action: Australian companies are being required to invest resources in cyber defences and share data about such attacks. Britain is moving in the same direction.However, replicating that in the US is harder because there is more controversy about the state taking a leadership role. In recent months, Leon Panetta, the former defence secretary, has tried to force action: a couple of months ago he declared that a cyber attack could be worse than 9/11 and warned that “although awareness is growing, the reality is that too few companies have invested in even basic cybersecurity”.However, many American CEOs dislike the idea of taking orders from the defence departments. Some insist they have already invested heavily in their cyber defences, and do not need government hectoring. “Yes, we are experiencing huge volumes of attacks, but the point is we have fended them off,” says one American bank CEO.Perhaps so. But the crucial point is this: even if some companies are on top of the issue, others are not, and without more public debate, it will be tough to get corporate boards to act. Without more disclosure it will also be difficult for investors to start pricing in these risks.So, at the very least, it is high time shareholders began demanding more information from individual companies about the issue – not just about the scale of the cyber attacks, but also the moves being taken to fend them off.And if companies refuse to answer those questions, then shareholders – or the government – should ask them why. After all, if there is one thing we learnt from 2007, it is that maintaining an embarrassed silence about risks does not usually make them go away; least of all when there is potential damage to consumers (and investors) as well as the companies under attack."
184;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed plays down budget talks impact;;Two of the biggest suppliers to the US defence department – Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – on Thursday issued forecasts for the coming year that assume no drastic, across-the-board spending cuts, in a sign of some contractors’ continuing optimism.Lockheed, the main contractor for the F-35 joint strike fighter and C-130 transport aircraft, estimated that diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations would be between $8.80 and $9.10. The figure was sharply up from the $8.36 per share that the company reported on Thursday for 2012 and the $7.81 it achieved for 2011.Raytheon, which specialises in missile and space systems, said it expected adjusted EPS – a measure that excludes some pension effects and debt retirement – down to a range of $5.65 to $5.80, compared with $6.21 for 2012. The company announced fourth quarter net income down 14 per cent to $469m, on revenue up 1 per cent to $1.89bn.Both companies’ optimism reflects the conviction of many of the largest US-based defence contractors that they will feel relatively little of the effect of the US budget crisis, even though current legislation calls for sweeping automatic cuts in budgets. Both based their forecasts on the assumption that mandated, across-the-board cuts in all US defence budgets – known as sequestration – would not occur.They announced their forecasts a day after General Dynamics, the US’s fourth-biggest military contractor by revenues, announced $2.3bn in impairment charges for the fourth quarter, mostly related to slowing US defence spending.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed Martin’s chief financial officer, said it was unclear how sequestration cuts would be implemented if the measure were not averted. Current legislation calls for across-the-board cuts of about 10 per cent to all programmes equally – but politicians could agree to target the cuts on the most easily cancelled programmes.The choices that Congress will face and the arguments for and against cutting different areas of the defence budget“Under a sequestration where it is more targeted, we would fare better because the products we make are more closely aligned with the national security of this country,” Mr Tanner said.Lockheed Martin’s net income for the fourth quarter fell 17 per cent to $569m, on net sales down 1 per cent to $12.1bn. Net income for the year rose 3.4 per cent to $2.74bn, on sales up 1.5 per cent to $47.2bn.Lockheed nevertheless sounded gloomy about the prospects for its information systems and global solutions business, which it said suffered a 14 per cent fall in net sales, to $2.2bn, and a 20 per cent fall in operating profits to $203m. The division operates in similar segments to General Dynamics’ Information Systems and Technology Group, whose acquired goodwill General Dynamics wrote down by $1.99bn in value on Wednesday.Lockheed’s shares fell nearly 3 per cent to close at $93.25, while Raytheon’s fell 2.85 per cent to $56.54.
185;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
186;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;US cuts put ceiling on defence projects;;US defence budget cuts are likely to favour existing suppliers over would-be competitors, as the Pentagon switches spending from big new programmes towards maintenance and upgrades, according to analysts and executives.Over the new year, Congress agreed to postpone across-the-board cuts to the defence budget mandated under the 2011 Act that raised the US’s debt ceiling.While legislation passed on January 1 could impose similarly swingeing 10 per cent across-the-board cuts from March 1, most observers expect a deal that will force the Pentagon to cut budgets but in a more targeted way.A potential model for future cuts was shown by a competition that closed last week to build a new rescue helicopter for the US Air Force. Only one manufacturer – United Technologies’ Sikorsky division – bid to build the helicopter after the Pentagon scaled back its requirements and imposed a $7bn ceiling for the programme’s cost.Sikorsky had built the new helicopter’s predecessor and enjoyed considerable advantages over potential competitors, which withdrew.“It’s clear that all of the offerors but one believed that the air force should have bought a more capable aircraft,” said Jim McAleese, a defence analyst in Virginia. “The air force’s ultimate position was, ‘No, I’m not going to buy a more expensive aircraft’.”Such strict cost ceilings for projects are likely to become more common in the future for programmes that are not the military’s top priorities, Mr McAleese said. In the past, the Pentagon would often choose suppliers not only on price, but on “best value”. It would choose a product that had better capabilities, even though it cost more.William Lynn, a former deputy secretary of defence who is now chief executive of the US arm of Italy’s Finmeccanica, said there would also be a greater tendency to upgrade existing equipment over buying new.Many observers expect pending contracts for equipment such as new ground combat vehicles to be particularly vulnerable to cuts.For some upgrades – in areas such as electronic controls – a new supplier might have a chance of winning the work, Mr Lynn said. But he echoed the consensus view in the industry that original suppliers would be in a strong position to win many upgrade contracts.“Some of the upgrades would be to the vehicle itself, so the original manufacturer would be in a [strong] position to do that,” he said.Large defence contractors acknowledge they have been preparing for such a scenario. The naval ship repair business that BAE Systems, the Pentagon’s sixth-biggest supplier by revenues, bought in 2010 is expected to be one beneficiary of the drift towards more maintenance work.Boeing, the second-biggest supplier after Lockheed Martin, said it had been seeking to cut its costs to compete in a more cost-conscious environment.
187;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2013-01-03T17:30:16Z;The women piloting an industry;Several US defence companies have appointed female leaders;"For a few days now, three of the US’s six biggest defence companies have had women at the helm. Both Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin, the country’s biggest defence contractor by revenue, and Phebe Novakovic at General Dynamics, its fourth largest defence supplier, took on the chief executive role at their respective companies on January 1. In doing so, they are following in the footsteps of Linda Hudson, who was the US defence sector’s first female chief in 2009 when she became head of BAE Inc, US subsidiary of the UK defence group.But that is not all. In an industry where senior management teams have traditionally been led by men, women are also filling many positions just below the rank of CEO. When Boeing Defence late last year reshuffled its executive ranks and created seven new leadership roles, five were filled by women; six of the 14 members of Northrop Grumman’s senior management team are women. Back at Lockheed Martin, three of seven of the top leadership roles are held by women.Some observers believe the impact could be significant: “If there’s only 10 per cent of women in your executive ranks they tend to echo the opinion of the majority. Once that gets up to 30 per cent or more they are very much able to voice a wider set of goals and ambitions in the workplace,” says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of think-tank the Cen­ter for Talent Innovation.Loren Thompson, defence analyst and chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, another think-tank, says the US defence industry is in the middle of “a revolutionary demogra­phic shift that may soon make women the dominant gender among senior executives”. But Mr Thompson does not expect it to initiate any significant change: “To be successful in the defence industry, women must conform with the same numbers-driven performance criteria that men face.”The appointments come at a time when defence companies are being forced to change how they operate as deep budget cuts and stringent new contract terms take effect.Ms Hewson attributes her success to a willingness to take risks and remain open to new ideas. Mr Thompson notes in particular that her humility will serve her well in mending Lockheed’s relationship with its biggest customer, the Pentagon – which analysts who cover the company say is a top priority. Relations became strained after delays and cost overruns at Lockheed’s Joint Strike Fighter programme, the most expensive military procurement proj­ect ever.Her appointment late last year was a surprise – even to her. It came after the heir-apparent resigned because of an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate.The National Science Foundation, an independent US government agency responsible for promoting science and engineering through res­earch programmes and education projects, notes that the momentum in recruiting more women has stalled and some of the gains even reversed.One reason may be that a growing number of potential leaders are balking at the sacrifice their predecessors made, as Anne-Marie Slaughter noted in an article for The Atlantic magazine entitled: “Why Women Still Can’t Have it All.” She explained her decision to give up a high-powered position in the US State Department to spend more time with her children. Ms Hewson has moved her family eight times during her career.A second threat to whether the emergence of more female leaders in defence will be judged a success in years to come may arise precisely from the challenges that made their elevation possible. Michelle Ryan and Alex Has­lam, professors at Exeter University, studied the UK’s biggest 100 listed companies in 2004, and concluded that women are more like­ly to be appointed to leadership positions that are associated with an inc­reased risk of criticism and failure.The situation could hardly be more precarious for the women newly in leadership positions in defence companies. Congress this week managed to avoid the feared $500bn automatic defence and security spending cuts that would have gone into effect at midnight on January 1 – Ms Hewson and Ms Novakovic’s first day as CEOs – had they failed to agree a last-minute fiscal budget deal. But many defence experts and executives believe the pain has merely been delayed and that deep cuts remain on the horizon given the US’s high debt and the large proportion of defence spending within the US’s discretionary budget. Some predict total US spending on defence procurement and research and development – the sections of the budget most pertinent to the big military contractors – to fall by as much as 40-50 per cent from their peak during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.As Robert Stevens, Lockheed’s former chief, and his peers ease into retirement, the new leaner reality presents the single biggest challenge to those who are getting their first chance to lead."
188;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Defence cuts likely to hurt service providers;;The effect of defence spending reductions under the fiscal cliff package of cuts would fall more quickly on providers of services to the Pentagon than on weapons makers, analysts have said.Any cuts for big weapons makers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman would probably be only about 2-3 per cent next year, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defence analyst.However, companies that offer day-to-day services to the Pentagon such as data processing would be more likely to see more immediate cuts, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute.The men spoke as the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbyist for military contractors, called for defence spending to be split from negotiations over the fiscal cliff mixture of tax increases and spending cuts that are set to come in on January 1.The Pentagon’s budget accounts for about half of the government’s discretionary expenditure – spending that is not mandated under fixed government programmes. As a result, defence budgets are set to fall 9.1 per cent next year, across all programmes, if the automatic spending cuts come into force.The complexities of the Pentagon’s $550bn annual budget mean that different programmes would be affected differently. The main division is between companies whose earnings come from Pentagon procurement budgets and those paid from short-term operational budgets. Procurement budgets set up for individual programmes tend to be set up to disburse funds over three years as weapons are ordered and manufactured.As a result, programmes such as Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter are likely to feel the effect of the sequestration cuts only after three years, according to Mr McAleese.For naval shipbuilding, each procurement budget can be spent over as long as five years. That had “major application” for General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, two of the biggest operators of naval shipyards, Mr McAleese said.“It will be 2015 before they actually begin to feel the effects of a sequester,” Mr McAleese said.However, companies paid from “short-cycle budgets” – such as CACI, the information technology provider based in Virginia – would feel the cuts far more quickly. “Companies providing services such as data processing, logistics and accounting will feel a significant impact in the first year,” he said.The only operational budgets exempt from the sequestration cuts would be those that pay for continuing deployments such as in Afghanistan.Despite the exemption, Marion Blakey, chief executive of the AIA, attacked plans to implement the sequestering of defence spending.“Risking American lives and livelihoods for political leverage is wrong,” she said.She demanded that defence spending be decoupled from the other tax and spending issues under negotiation between the two political sides.“The victims of this political gamesmanship will be the warfighters who risk their lives to protect our country and the American workers who will start losing their jobs when this game implodes on January 2, 2013,” Ms Blakey said.
189;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-12-13T17:22:07Z;Canada puts JSF on ice;Setback for the other eight nation partners;Canada has stopped funding the purchase of 65 Joint Strike Fighters, in a serious blow to the US’s most costly military programme, led by Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenue.The decision means JSF is no longer Canada’s chosen jetfighter to replace its aging Boeing F-18s. Instead the F-35 will now have to compete with others such Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet and perhaps even Eurofighter Typhoon, built by BAE, EADS and Finmeccanica.It is a setback for the other eight nation partners whose own JSF purchases are likely to become even more expensive, and for BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, which is helping Lockheed to build the aircraft.Rona Ambrose, Canada’s public works minister said: “We have hit the reset button and are taking the time to do a complete assessment of all available aircraft.”Canada’s decision follows a report by KPMG, the auditor, that showed that Canada’s purchase would cost C$45bn over 42 years.Canada’s conservative government initially sold the F-35 as a C$9bn purchase and had come under increasing pressure to reconsider following last spring’s damning report by the auditor general who concluded that the F-35 had been selected without properly weighing price and availability.The overall programme now carries a price tag of more than US$1 trillion over 50 years following years of price escalation and delays caused by technical and design problems.Canada’s pledge to buy 65 planes is small compared to the 2,443 aircraft the US has said it will buy and the 3,173 total programme size. Nevertheless, any decision by Ottawa to pull out of the programme altogether would strengthen the hand of the growing opposition to JSF among other partners, many of whose governments are already fiercely debating whether the costs are worth it, especially when government coffers are bare.The programme relies on economies of scale to bring down the cost of the aircraft, which many see as the world’s most modern manned fighter jet, in particular because of its ability to evade enemy detection. Canada was due to purchase its aircraft relatively early in the programme, so any decision to forgo the purchase altogether would push up the price for other nations whose purchases come later in the production line.Canada is not the only country to get cold feet. Italy reduced its purchase to 90 F-35s instead of the 131, while the US has delayed some of its purchases and may still trim the programme given its difficult fiscal discussions, while the UK is widely expected to buy about half the 138 that it first suggested it would.But Jason Gursky, an analyst at Citi, wrote on Wednesday that a recent 20-jet order by Israel and a 42-jet order by Japan could soak up nearly all the 65 cancellations if Canada were to cancel its F-35 order.“Canada’s 65 jets are 2 per cent of the overall programme and will thus have a limited impact on Lockheed’s fighter jet profits going forward,” he wrote.Additional reporting by Robert Wright in New York
190;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-11-29T16:57:29Z;Tips on the simple life don’t quite add up;Andrew Hill on ‘The Laws of Subtraction’ by Matthew E. May;"The Laws of Subtraction: 6 Simple Rules for Winning in the Age of Excess Everything
By Matthew E. May, McGraw Hill, $24/£16.99Matthew May has hit upon an attractive theme. Who does not yearn for a guide to simplifying, synthesising and subtracting some of the clutter, overload and demands of the “Age of Excess Everything”, as his subtitle has it? He has also cleverly subtracted from his own workload by inviting others, mostly authors and consultants like him, to contribute about a third of the material for his six laws for doing more with less in the form of summaries of their views.Mind you, it took fellow author Daniel Pink to point out the ap­peal of the subject. “Subtraction is your meme. It’s out there; it’s growing,” he told May just before he took the stage at a corporate conference, urging him to “own” it. “Best. Advice. Ever,” writes May.This exchange is itself a little guide to what the book is like. Not only is it full of people talking in a slightly artificial, visionary way about commonsense ob­jectives, it is also filled with contradictions. “Subtraction is growing” is only the first.The book does contain good examples of the less-is-more theme, some well-known, some less so. May’s opener (illustrating Law Number One: “What isn’t there can often trump what is”) is the FedEx logo, featuring an arrow created by the blank space between the E and X. Lindon Leader, its designer, explains how he “didn’t overplay it, didn’t mention it” when pitching the idea. (He makes up for that here.)May also provides a potted history of how Lockheed Martin located a team of design engineers in a circus tent next to a foul-smelling plastics factory to design a jet fighter: the secret Skunk Works became a byword for how to foster innovation (Law Five: “Break is the important part of breakthrough”). He cites J.K. Rowling, who was inspired for the idea for Harry Potter on a long, boring train journey, in support of Law Six (“Doing something isn’t always better than doing nothing”).My favourite came from contributor Bob Harrison, a retired police chief, who introd­uced an “unplan” to withdraw of­fic­ers directing traffic after a July 4 fireworks display and discovered everyone got home more quickly (Law Two: “The simplest rules create the most effective experience”).But I find every subtractive success story has an additive counterweight, some of which are explicit in May’s examples. It is true that “creativity thrives under intelligent constraints” (Law Four), but Michelangelo – order­ed to work on a fresco for the Sistine Chapel, not a sculpture, his preferred medium – then “expanded the job’s scope”, covering the walls as well as the ceiling. Steve Jobs was a great simplifier, who “handed control to us”, as users of Apple devices. But he was also a control freak when it came to des­igning the same artefacts, supervising fine detail, adding features and forcing his team to work all hours, rather than giving them time for “purposeful daydreaming”, as May ad­vocates elsewhere in his book. The Artist, the silent, black-and-white film that provides May with the book’s “coda”, was a worthy Oscar-winner, but so was 2008’s Slumdog Millionaire, with its cast of thousands and Bollywood-style excess.May does not avoid these contradictions, but he does not really address them, either. He prefers to list examples of his six laws than explore how em­ployers or their staff could reconcile the daily conflict between constraints and freedom, perspiration and inspiration. In the interests of “owning” his Zen-inspired meme, May subtracts these complexities. Instead he offers tips, such as his invitation to take “long, languid showers” – number eight on a list of ways to relax the mind. This point “needs no explanation”, May writes, “which is good, because I could find no research on the subject”.For most people at most companies, where the pressure to add customers, add revenues and add value is intense, it is as difficult to “subtract” as it is for most grown-ups to follow the advice of one of the book’s contributors and live out of a suitcase in a near-empty apartment. It is a pity, given the need to simplify many business processes, that May adds so little to the sum of knowledge about how to do it.Andrew Hill@ft.comThe writer is the FT’s management editor"
191;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-11-22T17:31:13Z;The pharmaceutical path to superworkers;Performance-enhancing drugs may soon be an HR issue;"Whatever your unique selling point, in the eyes of your employer it can probably be sharpened. And soon, that could be done through a performance-boosting drug or robotic enhancement.According to Human Enhancement and the Future of Work, a joint report by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the British Academy, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society published this month, we could see an invasion of titanium-limbed, laser-eyed, serotonin-pumped cyborgs into the 21st-century global workplace, with potential to unleash ethical and social chaos.The report summons up the futuristic vision of shift workers downing anti-boredom medicines, long-distance drivers popping wakefulness pills as an insurance requirement, assembly-line workers wearing “exoskeleton” suits that allow them to handle heavy loads all day without tiring, and office workers donning brain helmets for a spot of transcranial stimulation to top up their skills.“We are not talking science-fiction here,” stresses Genevra Richardson, professor of law at King’s College London, who chaired the report. “There are a range of technologies in development and in some cases already in use that have the potential to transform our workplaces – for better or for worse.”The use of performance-enhancing drugs is already happening. According to Barbara Sahakian, professor of clinical neuropsychology at Cambridge university, about 16 per cent of US university students use mind-boosting drugs, mostly ordered online without a prescription, to get them through exams.Their pharmaceutical of choice tends to be modafinil (originally developed to treat sleep disorders) to stay awake, or methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin and designed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to help them concentrate. Given that the cognitive boost is thought sufficient to lift degree class by one notch, there have been calls for universities to instigate drug testing on campus.Modafinil is also a popular pick-me-up among sleep-deprived doctors and globe-trotting academics, and the drug has an unexpected side-effect that makes it a potential elixir for employers: it numbs boredom. “People find tasks more enjoyable when they’re taking modafinil,” says Prof Sahakian. “What if you could increase the global economic output of a country with these drugs? What would the government decide to do?”Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is making the Human Universal Load Carrier, a battery-powered manoeuvrable titanium suit for soldiers that allows the carrying of heavy loads. Honda has developed strap-on robotic legs for the elderly that could also be used by manual workers.The question of coercion crops up repeatedly in the study, whether it is the disabled being pushed into taking drugs so they can work again, or people feeling compelled to have enhancements in order to land jobs. Prof Richardson is urging employers’ organisations and trade unions to get engaged. “We hope this report will initiate and inform a very necessary debate.”Public safety might be improved if certain groups, such as HGV drivers, took enhancements. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents estimates that up to a quarter of fatal and serious road accidents are caused by driver fatigue; modafinil is known to lower accident rates among shift workers.“If your child was being driven home from Europe overnight, would you want the coach driver to take a pill to keep him awake?” asks Prof Sahakian.But forcing pills on people would be hard to swallow, says Ian Brinkley, director of the Work Foundation think-tank. “The idea of using enhancements to help older people and the disabled back into work is uncontroversial,” he says. “But employers insisting on them would be a bridge too far.”"
192;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-11-19T17:05:06Z;Gulf states plan fresh arms spending;;Gulf states are planning a fresh round of big arms buys from US and European manufacturers, as they replace old equipment and respond to the perceived threat of Iran and other regional security concerns.A recent flurry of requests to Washington for new or updated missile systems suggest Arabian peninsula countries are seeking to build a tougher military shield against Iran in case of an attack by Israel or the US, analysts say.Demand from the Gulf has triggered high-level commercial lobbying as western countries compete to win multi-billion dollar contracts for their companies amid an uncertain regional security backdrop.“The US major defence industries, IT firms, integration systems – they all have an enormous opportunity,” says William Cohen, a former Republican senator who served as secretary of defence under Democratic president Bill Clinton and now advises US businesses.“There is a very legitimate concern about Iran being a revolutionary country. Beyond Iran, you have terrorism, cyber attack threats…you see the implications of the Arab spring. Every country wants to make sure it’s protected against that.”Since November 2, the US Congress has been notified of four separate requests for arms buys – some of them years in the preparation – by Gulf countries, totalling $24.2bn. The deals include transport aircraft for Saudi Arabia, a $9.9bn Patriot missile system for Qatar and high altitude area defence missiles for the United Arab Emirates.Lockheed Martin and Raytheon of the US are the main beneficiaries of the proposed contracts, which are pitched to Congress as support for important Washington-allied states in the region.Willy Moore, Lockheed Martin’s regional president for the Middle East, says the Middle East and Africa region is the company’s fastest-growing in terms of sales, with deal-making driven by tensions between the Gulf states and Tehran.“There’s no question that countries out here are looking to the threat coming from Iran,” he says, adding that he doesn’t think the Arab spring is a big driver behind the latest plans.European companies are also seeking big contracts in the region. David Cameron, British prime minister, used a Gulf visit this month to push for sales of more than 100 warplanes to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman. Paris has lobbied hard for deals, competing with London by proposing to provide the UAE with more than 60 Rafale fighter jets.The latest round of proposed deals comes after heavy Gulf state activity in the international arms markets last year, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service for US lawmakers. The value of US agreements to supply weapons to emerging nations more than doubled from $32.7bn in 2010 to $71.5bn in 2011, with Saudi Arabia’s $33.7bn of agreements leading the way, the research said.Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor of Jane’s Defence Weekly magazine, said the size of the latest proposed US-Gulf deals and the focus on missile systems – including a $4.2bn deal with Kuwait earlier this year – was “obviously aimed at countering the ballistic missile threat emanating from Iran.”“Ultimately the idea is that all this stuff will plug into each other to form a regional missile shield,” he added, although he noted it was still unclear to what extent the Gulf countries were co-operating with each other, or how their enhanced capabilities would fit in with the US alliance with Israel.Analysts say that with the Gulf countries bunched so close together, a broader regional anti-missile system, backed by the US, would allow whoever had the best shot to take it first.The fate of the proposed Gulf arms buys may cast broader light on the evolving geopolitics of the region, where the petrostates are building closer relationships with big Asian oil and gas consumers but still look to the US for security guarantees.While the US military is still the world’s dominant military power, Washington has been keen to reduce or share security responsibilities where it can – such as during the Nato action in Libya last year.James Hackett, an analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies think-tank, said the latest Gulf arms deal Congressional notifications were in line with a longstanding US policy of so-called multi-bilateralism – that is, using bilateral deals to make a multilateral impact on regional security.“The US sees this notably in areas like shared early warning, air and missile defence,” said Mr Hackett, noting that both the Qatari and UAE announcements relating the proposed acquisition of so-called THAAD anti-missile systems had said the deals would “reduce dependence on US forces”.The planned Gulf purchases are likely add to concerns by anti-conflict campaigners about the militarisation of the Middle East, as war deepens in Syria, where Russia sold $1bn of weapons last year to the regime and Qatari and Saudi Arabia arms are being channelled to the rebels.Five Arab countries are now among the world’s top 10 most militarised nations in terms of spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, according to a report published this month by the Bonn International Centre for Conversion, a German research institute. Jan Grebe, project leader at the centre, said the results signalled “the development of a regional arms race”.
193;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-11-09T23:12:20Z;Lockheed hit as new chief resigns;;Succession plans at Lockheed Martin were thrown into disarray on Friday when the the US’s biggest military contractor by sales announced the resignation of its incoming chief executive over a “close personal relationship” with a subordinate.Christopher Kubasik, Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer, had been due to take over on January 1 from Bob Stevens, who is retiring as chief executive.The company said a board meeting on Friday had instead appointed Marillyn Hewson, vice-president of electronic systems, to be the next chief executive. She was immediately promoted to be chief operating officer.The change of plan comes as Lockheed and other large military contractors face acute uncertainty over future military spending levels. The Department of Defense is to absorb 50 per cent of the spending cuts set to come into force in early January under the deal reached last year to avert a crisis over the raising of the US’s debt ceiling.Spending on most military programmes would be automatically cut by about 10 per cent if the swingeing cuts– which both political sides want to avoid – come into force.Mr Stevens said he was “disappointed and saddened” by Mr Kubasik’s behaviour, which he said was “inconsistent with our values and standards”. However, his departure would have no effect on the company’s operations, Mr Stevens said.“We believe that strategically, operationally and financially we will not miss a beat,” Mr Stevens said.Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said the switch might ultimately prove beneficial to Lockheed by highlighting high standards of corporate governance.“The lesson is the rules apply equally to everybody at Lockheed Martin,” he said.Ms Hewson was “a very capable executive,” he added. “She’s probably more capable than Kubasik.”The company had brought in outside investigators to investigate after an employee came to the company with concerns over the relationship in late October, Mr Stevens said.“That investigation concluded with today’s board meeting,” he said.Mr Stevens declined to answer questions about how long the relationship had gone on, whether the company should have discovered the relationship earlier or whether vetting of senior executives had missed the it. Those were all private matters, he said. The subordinate with whom Mr Kubasik had had the relationship had also left the company, Mr Stevens said.“We have acted clearly and decisively with regard to the action that we have taken,” he said.The company had always sought to ensure it had as many “ready-now” replacement executives as possible, according to Mr Stevens. Ms Hewson was a product of the company’s policy of rotating executives regularly between challenging assignments to ensure they were ready for promotion, he said.Ms Hewson said she intended to continue following the transition plan the company originally set out in April. She will work closely with Mr Stevens, who will become executive chairman and remain in post throughout 2013 to ensure a smooth transition.The change was announced after the market closed. Lockheed shares rose 0.07 per cent in after-market trading to $90.04.

196;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-10-25T13:38:04Z;Raytheon raises guidance amid uncertainty;;Raytheon, the manufacturer of missiles and other military systems, became the third big US defence contractor in two days to raise earnings guidance for the full year despite looming budget uncertainty as it announced its third-quarter results.Raytheon increased its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings per share – earnings from continuing operations excluding certain pension factors – to a range of $5.85 to $5.95, from $5.70 to $5.85 previously. It trimmed its net sales forecast from $24.5bn to $25bn previously to $24.3bn to $24.7bn.Raytheon nevertheless warned that scheduled swingeing military spending cuts– known as sequestration – in the new year could have a “significant impact” on the US defence industry as a whole. It remains uncertain if sequestration will take place, however.Sequestration is one of the terms of last year’s Budget Control Act, introduced to head off a crisis over the US debt ceiling, and would involve automatic cuts of about 10 per cent in nearly all US military spending programmes.“We believe that Raytheon’s large international market presence, portfolio of programmes, technology and focus on high priority areas should help to mitigate some of the potential overall impact,” the company said.Raytheon’s upgrade for the present year and warning about sequestration’s potential consequences follows similar statements on Wednesday from Lockheed Martin, maker of the F35 fighter, and Northrop Grumman, maker of the B2 Stealth bomber.Those companies also stressed, like Raytheon, a determination to prove their products offered good value and to expand their international businesses. Most observers believe that, even if politicians hammer out a deal to prevent sequestration, the US faces significant defence spending cuts in the coming years.Raytheon’s third-quarter net income was $500m, marginally down on the previous year’s third quarter $501m, on revenue 1 per cent lower at $6.05bn. Diluted earnings per share rose 4.9 per cent to $1.50.Operating income at the core integrated defence systems division rose 18 per cent to $204m, on net sales up 8.4 per cent to $1.28bn.Operating income in missile systems rose 6.2 per cent to $189m, while space and airborne systems operating income was up 11 per cent to $190m.“Overall, the businesses performed well in the quarter,” William Swanson, chief executive, said.The shares rose 0.85 per cent to $55.62.
197;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-10-24T18:55:39Z;US defence companies – cliff ahead;It has been a good year but investors must tread carefully;If anyone is standing on the edge of the fiscal cliff, it is the defence industry. Unless co-operation unexpectedly breaks out in Congress, automatic spending reductions will kick in at the start of 2013, including cuts of about 10 per cent on most military spending programmes. This year, however, the industry has beaten Wall Street expectations, raised guidance and seen their stocks outperform.Lockheed Martin’s third-quarter earnings, released on Wednesday, beat analysts’ estimates and the company raised its guidance for 2012 earnings per share by about 4 per cent. Northrop Grumman nudged its full year target up on Wednesday as well. Shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday) have all outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year. All three, while short of their pre-crisis peaks, are at or near multiyear highs.Boeing, which gets 40 per cent of revenue from defence and space, also increased its full-year guidance on Wednesday. An increase this year in deliveries of commercial aeroplanes is underpinning the outlook, but the company also expects slightly higher revenues from defence, space and security this year.While the defence stocks do not look terribly expensive, trading at 10 to 12 times forward earnings while generating strong cash flows, the sector has traditionally traded at a discount to the wider market. The unavoidable conclusion is that investors either: (a) do not believe the cuts will come to pass: (b) think Congress will act to mitigate its effects on the military or: (c) have been hypnotised by the defence companies’ recent outperformance.All of these attitudes are dangerous. While raising this year’s guidance, Lockheed simultaneously warned of falling revenues next year, cliff or no cliff. Investors need to adopt the same realistic approach.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
198;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-10-24T17:45:33Z;Defence contractors face budget fears;;Two of the US’s biggest military contractors raised their full-year guidance as they predicted strong ends to the year, despite the looming threat of across-the-board defence budget cuts in January.Lockheed Martin, maker of the F35 and other combat aircraft, said it expected earnings per share from continuing operations for the current year of $8.20 to $8.40 per share, from $7.90 to $8.10 previously. Northrop Grumman, maker of the B-2 Stealth bomber, upgraded its earnings estimate from $7.05 to $7.25 a share to between $7.35 and $7.40.The upgrades came after both companies announced third-quarter profits significantly better than analysts’ expectations.Lockheed’s net earnings improved to $727m, from $700m for the same period last year including $35m from discontinued operations, on a 2 per cent decline in net sales to $11.9bn. Earnings per share rose 5 per cent to $2.21.Northrop Grumman’s net earnings fell 12 per cent to $459m, on revenue down 5 per cent to $6.27bn. Earnings per share fell 4 per cent to $1.82.However, General Dynamics, which makes warships, military vehicles and corporate jets, fell short of analysts’ expectations, producing net earnings down 8 per cent to $600m, on revenue up 1 per cent to $7.93bn. On a per-share basis, earnings fell 5.5 per cent to $1.71.Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin chief executive, said the “strong operating results“ were a reflection of several factors, including its focus on affordability and programme execution.“We also have a strategy that is aligned with our customers, a proven portfolio of products and technologies, and a team that is talented and dedicated, even with the uncertainties that lie ahead,” he said.Wes Bush, Northrop Grumman chief executive, attributed the results to his company’s focus on “performance, effective cash deployment, and portfolio alignment”.However, all US military contractors face the risk that the programme of across-the-board cuts– knows as “sequestration” – could cut nearly every part of the military budget by about 10 per cent in the new year.They also face the possibility that even if politicians agree an alternative to sequestration, there would still be severe spending cuts. Lockheed Martin said its sales would decline next year even without sequestration.Mr Stevens said the company had been very clear for a long period of time about its concerns over the possibility of sequestration.“It’s really not an effective way to reduce spending, particularly when it will not align with the strategy and commitments that our country has made,” he said.Lockheed Martin based its projections for next year on President Barack Obama’s defence plan for the second half of the 2013 fiscal year, and on the assumption that sequestration would be avoided. Under that assumption, the company said its net sales would fall next year in the “low single-digits”.Mr Bush said Northrop Grumman was working closely with its customers to bring innovative, affordable solutions to support their needs in “today’s fiscally constrained environment”.
199;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-10-24T13:12:10Z;Defence cuts hang over Lockheed;Rise in profit projections in spite of sales slide;Sales at Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft maker, will decline next year even if swingeing government spending cuts are avoided, the company said as it announced a 3.9 per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings.Lockheed said sequestration, which could total about 10 per cent of planned military spending, would have a “material effect” on the company’s earnings next year. But so would any big cuts in defence spending agreed to ward off sequestration – a fiscal straitjacket imposed last year as part of the raising of the US’s debt ceiling.Lockheed Martin and other US military contractors face a struggle to explain to investors their outlook for next year because of significant uncertainty over the level of defence spending.There remains a risk that programmes could face the indiscriminate cuts set out under the sequestration legislation, which would take effect from January. It is also all but certain that the next US president will cut defence spending from present levels, although Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, has called for it to be increased.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chief executive, said the company had been very clear for a long period about its concerns over the possibility of sequestration.“It’s really not an effective way to reduce spending, particularly when it will not align with the strategy and commitments that our country has made,” he said.While sounding cautious about next year, the company nevertheless raised its projections for the current year, saying it expected diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.20 to $8.40 per share, from $7.90 to $8.10 previously. Its shares rose 3 per cent by midday in New York trading.Lockheed Martin based its projections for next year on President Obama’s defence plan for the second half of the 2013 fiscal year, and on the assumption that sequestration will be avoided. Under that assumption, the company said its net sales would fall next year in the “low single-digits”. That would be mainly a result of declining sales in the information systems and global solutions division, which produces information technology products for the military.There is nevertheless speculation that, even without sequestration, large military procurement programmes such as the F35 fighter could face further cuts.Mr Stevens said F35 numbers had already been scaled back and that the programme had probably been reviewed more than any other military programme in history.“It is now sized and phased for a more risk-managed approach to bring a critically-needed tool online,” he said. “I don’t think that there’s any dispute that the current fighter fleet is ageing out and more expensive to operate over time.”Third-quarter net earnings improved to $727m, from $700m for the same period last year including $35m from discontinued operations, on a 2 per cent decline in net sales to $11.9bn. Diluted earnings per share rose 5 per cent to $2.21. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 15 per cent to $1.15.The “strong operating results“ were a reflection of several factors, including the company’s focus on affordability and programme execution, Mr Stevens said.“We also have a strategy that is aligned with our customers, a proven portfolio of products and technologies, and a team that is talented and dedicated, even with the uncertainties that lie ahead,” he said.Operating profit at the core aeronautics division – which makes fighter jets and other military aircraft – fell 6.5 per cent to $415m, on revenues down 6.7 per cent to $3.7bn. Most of the revenue fall was a result of reduced deliveries of C-130 military transport aircraft.Operating profits for electronic systems rose 14 per cent to $509m, on net sales up 4 per cent to $3.82bn.

200;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US attitude to contractor mergers unclear;;The collapse of merger talks between EADS and the UK’s BAE Systems has left a significant question hanging not only unanswered but unasked: namely what would be the attitude of the US Department of Defense to mergers between its suppliers?Following the abandonment of EADS’s tie-up with BAE, the sixth-biggest US military contractor by annual revenues, US defence companies still do not know whether falling defence spending has made the Pentagon relax its opposition to further consolidation among its big suppliers.After the end of the cold war some US industrial companies – such as Chrysler, General Motors and Ford decided to spin out or sell off military subsidiaries as defence spending fell. The Pentagon then encouraged a wave of consolidation in the 1990s: Northrop and Grumman merged in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin and Boeing in 1997 took over McDonnell Douglas.Some similar fragmentation has already taken place during this defence slowdown: Northrop Grumman spun out its shipbuilding operations in March last year, for example, while SAIC, a provider of sophisticated professional services to the military, decided in August to split itself in two. However, so far the Pentagon has said it is reluctant to see mergers of big suppliers – but stressed it would still treat each deal on a case-by-case basis.“The reality of those kinds of policy pronouncements is that they can always change,” says Pierre Chao, managing partner of Renaissance Strategic Advisors. “In some ways, they’re also administration personality-specific.”Behind much of the current confusion about the industry’s future shape lies uncertainty about the Department of Defense’s budget. Military programmes could face 9.4 per cent across-the-board cuts from January if legislators are unable to agree before then on an alternative programme to close the US budget deficit.Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, one of the top five suppliers, said last month that such cuts could prompt the Pentagon to reassess its opposition to mergers among its biggest suppliers.There has been speculation that, in such a scenario, Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft maker, and General Dynamics, the armoured vehicle maker, might team up to take over BAE together. However, people familiar with the thinking of the two companies – both of which are in the midst of leadership changes – pour cold water on the suggestions.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, says that while the Pentagon and other regulators encouraged the mergers that gave the industry its current shape, the mood now is very different.“The policy makers at the Pentagon now believe that there was too much concentration back then,” Mr Thompson says. “So they’re not going to permit major combinations.”That means, Mr Thompson and Mr Chao suggest, that corporate activity among military contractors in the foreseeable future is likely to consist mainly of groupings amid smaller operations. Following the collapse of the planned BAE-EADS merger, there is very little to prompt other big contractors into action, says Mr Thompson. “They’re waiting to see who wins the White House,” he says.
201;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-10-10T19:16:37Z;BAE left to take care of deal fallout;;"For BAE Systems and its management, the only development more dramatic than their proposed €36bn union with EADS may turn out to be the deal’s failure.Many analysts and industry executives believe BAE is not only out of good options but that its attempt to tie up with EADS has left it dangerously exposed and facing the wrath of its investors – and its most important customer, the US.Ian King and Dick Olver, respectively BAE’s chief executive and its chairman, have also been tarnished because of their inability to persuade even BAE’s most loyal shareholders of the wisdom of the deal. Many investors and analysts now believe both men’s jobs are on the line.For BAE, the future looks dimmer than it did before news of the proposed deal surfaced.“We think that BAE’s willingness to do such a deal now implies a lower degree of confidence in the company’s ability to achieve all of its large export opportunities in the reasonable timeframe expected by many investors,” says Sash Tusa at Echelon, the independent analyst.Mr Olver on Wednesday insisted there was no reason to change BAE’s management team, and investors are unlikely to want to further destabilise the company by pushing too quickly for a change of leadership.But investors have already called for a review of BAE’s strategy – a move Mr King says is not necessary.“What’s next is Plan A, that we deliver on our strategy that we articulated before,” Mr King told the Financial Times on Wednesday, disputing any need to change tack.Many analysts and investors believe BAE might now just have to ride out alone the storm of the economic downturn, the end of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the cuts in US and European defence spending.The most extreme change in strategy could involve the company being broken up into pieces; its important US arm, source of 43 per cent of its revenue, being spun off or sold; and the rest of the company – businesses in the UK, Australia and Saudi Arabia – left to limp along.The emergence of a new suitor for BAE from among the big US defence companies is another possibility some have noted, arguing that the deal’s collapse leaves BAE vulnerable.One senior UK official said BAE would remain “in play”, noting: “The risk for BAE is it has made clear that it does not have a long-term future without some kind of tie-up.”Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are said to have already approached the Pentagon to see whether such a proposal would be acceptable. Few people who have closely followed the defence industry believe it would be. The US defence department’s long-held view has been that the number of its biggest suppliers has shrunk enough after the consolidation of the late 1990s that created Lockheed and Boeing, the country’s largest defence contractors.A person close to Lockheed on Wednesday said it would not be interested in bidding for BAE. “We’re looking at focusing on our customers and our cost-reduction issues,” he said.The US government’s opposition to further consolidation in the US defence market may have eased somewhat as spending cuts have prompted companies to begin lay-offs, but BAE’s size – it is the world’s second largest defence company after Lockheed and a top 10 supplier to the US government – remains an insurmountable hurdle, say analysts.“The Pentagon has warned against consolidation and we would not expect a potential bid from any other US competitors,” says Ed Salvesen, analyst at Brewin Dolphin Investment Management.The UK government is also unlikely to sanction such a deal because a US owner would not guarantee that some of BAE’s most sensitive UK projects – such as nuclear submarine building – would remain in the UK. Bankers say they have for years tried to make a transatlantic union work and BAE has looked at, and dismissed, a tie-up with Boeing and, more recently, with Northrop Grumman.Mr King says he does not expect another suitor and that none has so far approached him. But people close to the deal say EADS could spend the next three months – with the blessing of BAE – lobbying the German government and then have another go at BAE early next year, especially given that most of the non-political details of the deal have already been agreed.For now Mr King will have to articulate a convincing strategy to his customers – particularly the US and UK governments – and his investors.“They will be under enormous pressure to explain what Plan B is and they’ll be punished if they don’t,” says Guy Anderson of IHS Jane’s, the defence industry analysts.Many fellow industry executives and analysts sympathetically note that decisions made by Mike Turner, Mr King’s predecessor, meant that the BAE chief “found himself completely exposed to two defence markets [the US and UK] just before they went belly up,” as Mr Anderson puts it.They argue BAE does not need to throw in the towel at what may be the bottom of the defence cycle, nor that its future without a deal looks as grim as Mr Turner and others have argued.Even BAE’s closest competitors envy its broad international portfolio, its ability to generate cash and a loyal following of investors drawn to the steady dividend.For all the criticism of BAE that the EADS deal has unleashed, many investors, industry executives and analysts believe that, rather than a dramatic change in direction, the company needs a management that is better at articulating its strategy.Additional reporting by Robert Wright and Anousha Sakoui"
202;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-10-10T18:32:36Z;Fears of healthcare cuts weigh on S&N;;Smith & Nephew was out of favour on Wednesday on fears that austerity budgets were putting more pressure on healthcare spending.Rival orthopaedics maker Biomet said overnight that sales of hip and knee implants had slowed sharply in the quarter ending August. The US group, which had been gaining market share following product launches, said it did not know whether the slowdown was company-specific or sectorwide.Analysts noted that Biomet’s US sales growth had unexpectedly stalled. A resilient US market had been expected to compensate for budget cuts in Europe, which provides a third of S&N’s sales.S&N, which was trading ex-interim dividend, closed 2.6 per cent lower at 655p. “Sell” advice from Société Générale also weighed against the stock.With S&N finance officer Adrian Hennah due to leave at the end of the year, any decision on acquisitions or a share buyback was likely to be pushed back to 2014, SocGen said.The broker also dismissed persistent speculation that S&N could be a bid target.Competition hurdles ruled out Johnson & Johnson, as it would have to sell too much of S&N’s business, while Medtronic would not be able to extract enough cost savings, SocGen said. It also reckoned Biomet’s private equity owners could not afford S&N, and that shareholders would not back a bid in the opposite direction given S&N management’s poor acquisition record.The wider market drifted lower for a third straight day, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.6 per cent or 33.54 points at 5776.71.Aggreko slid 1.3 per cent to £22.11 after the second profit warning in as many quarters from US engine maker Cummins, one of its biggest suppliers. Cummins cited weak international power generation markets, as well as poor sales in China and disappointing North American heavy duty truck demand.The warning also hit engineers, with GKN down 0.5 per cent at 214.1p, Bodycote sliding 3.1 per cent to 372.9p and IMI down 2.5 per cent to 920p.Croda slipped 2.3 per cent to £22.21 after EMS-Chemie, the polymer maker, talked of a “clear downturn” in demand in all its markets.Cautious guidance from Alcoa weighed against the miners, with Vedanta Resources sliding 2.8 per cent to £10.60. Iron ore pellet maker Ferrexpo slid 4.7 per cent to 193.1p even after an in-line quarterly production report.Talvivaara lost 3.8 per cent to 151.2p, with Goldman Sachs cutting its target to 158p in a note that was critical of the nickel miner’s quality of assets.Banks outperformed on news that the Financial Services Authority had relaxed capital rules to boost UK lending. Lloyds Banking Group added 4 per cent to 38.5p and Royal Bank of Scotland was up 2.1 per cent to 262.7p.Man Group climbed 3.8 per cent to 93.4p, a five-month high, after press reports reheated takeover speculation.The bid theories helped distract from another weekly decline for Man’s key AHL fund and uncertainty about a trading update next week, which analysts say was likely to show a fifth consecutive quarter of net outflows. RBC forecast Man’s outflows to have accelerated to $2.5bn for the third quarter.Meanwhile, the traders who were pushing Man as a bid target on Tuesday had moved on to United Utilities. The water group rose 1.6 per cent to 729p on familiar speculation of interest from infrastructure investors and sovereign wealth funds.Imagination Technologies slid 9.4 per cent to 455.5p after Credit Suisse started coverage of the graphics chipmaker with an “underperform” rating and 247p valuation. It argued that the stock, at 21 times 2014 earnings, was not pricing in competitive threats.“We see Arm Holdings increasing its relevance as a competitor in this space with a full complement of graphics capabilities at half the price,” said Credit Suisse. “Of Imagination’s four key customers, Samsung this year moved to Arm graphics, Texas Instruments is exiting the wireless business and MediaTek could, in our view, try Arm graphics in its smartphone chips as it already uses its graphics in feature phones and TV.”Arm lost 2.9 per cent to 578.5p, with Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Cazenove saying the stock looked expensive.Domino’s Pizza lost 2.1 per cent to 519p after directors Stephen Hemsley and Nigel Wray raised £5.2m each by selling stock.
203;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-09-19T18:04:27Z;BAE will be left behind without a safer pilot;As a result of the British group’s own decisions, a deal with EADS is the best of a limited set of choices;"It is natural to regard any merger proposed by BAE Systems, the UK’s biggest defence company, with suspicion. Had it a better record of predicting its industry’s future and doing deals at the right price, it would be in less of a pickle.So BAE’s latest brainwave – to be taken over by EADS, the Franco-German owner of Airbus, at a tricky time in the defence industry – sounds awfully typical. The company that sold a 20 per cent stake in Airbus when the latter had problems with the A380 aircraft, and ploughed the money into US defence before being hit by Pentagon cuts, is once again dealmaking in haste.Many British members of parliament would like BAE to carry on flying the flag – or to combine forces with Rolls-Royce, the UK aerospace company – rather than choose a European solution. Some investors would prefer it to plough on in defence, paying a big dividend to reward their loyalty.But the EADS merger, in which it would hold a 40 per cent share and oversee the defence side from London, is the best option BAE is likely to be offered. It would take a company with better strategic and dealmaking skills to navigate through the next decade alone. Like the UK and French governments themselves, it is time for BAE to recognise its limitations.Governments, not investors, will ultimately decide the fate of the EADS-BAE deal. In the defence industry, the customer – in the form of air forces, armies and defence ministries – is king. Sovereigns pay the bills, block unwelcome takeovers and insist on their weapons being built by their citizens.The biggest customer – and the most powerful sovereign – is the US. Its defence budget of $740bn dwarfs that of the UK, France and Germany combined. It held 46 per cent of planned spending in 2011, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, while the three European countries held 10 per cent.While the US has defence sovereignty, Europe pretends to have it. A European company has yet to break into the US to stand alongside Boeing and Lockheed Martin. EADS tried and failed last year when it lost the $35bn contract to build US Air Force refuelling tankers to Boeing after an outcry in Congress.BAE’s superior access to the US market is its best asset – it is trusted by the Pentagon and 43 per cent of its revenues come from the US. But it paid a stiff price for the status, not only abandoning its Airbus stake but overpaying in 2007 for Armor Holdings, which made armoured vehicles needed in Iraq.With the US, the UK and European countries implementing defence cuts after Iraq and Afghanistan, BAE is nastily exposed. “The reason BAE is looking at EADS is that the deals that it made in the 2000s took it into a strategic dead end: overexposure to defence in general, and US defence in particular,” says Sash Tusa, an analyst at Echelon.The UK government could block the deal and insist on BAE finding a British solution, akin to the outcome in 1999 when British Aerospace merged with Marconi rather than DaimlerChrysler Aerospace. The latter merger would have created the European defence company that governments wanted. Instead, they made do with EADS.Such an intervention would be popular with MPs, but short-sighted. Rolls-Royce and BAE are different enterprises – one is in advanced manufacturing and one in defence systems. The fact that they are both British and have headquarters on St James’s Park does not turn them into natural partners.If anything, a merger with a US defence company such as Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin would be even tougher to sell to MPs. The EADS-BAE deal can be structured to leave BAE intact as a listed British company, holding 40 per cent of the cash flows of the joint operating company, similar to the structure of Royal Dutch Shell.Any US takeover would have to be carried out simply, forming a single company run from the US. (“People doing my job have worked for 25 years to structure a two-headed Anglo-US company and no one has managed,” says a banker gloomily.) With the Pentagon in charge, BAE would be put in its place.Meanwhile, France is the more likely government obstacle to a deal. EADS has operated under a compact among the French state and other shareholders that has, for example, allocated board seats according to nationality. One of the attractions of a BAE deal for Tom Enders, the EADS chief executive, is that it lets him escape from these chains.It would be as wrong-headed for France to interfere as for the UK to exercise its veto. The Pentagon could easily block a deal by imposing a stricter separation of BAE’s US operations from its parent to offset increased French influence. This is made likelier by the history of Franco-American suspicion and rivalry in procurementIn theory, BAE does not need to merge at all. It could also carry on as an independent, making smaller deals in European and US defence,
a strategy known internally as the “string of pearls”. Pearls, however, are expensive. BAE’s balance sheet is too weak to pay in cash, while its low-rated shares are not much of an acquisition currency.From where BAE stands, thanks to its own decisions, an EADS deal is the best of a limited set of choices. It would bring a degree of managerial freedom, a healthier balance sheet, a calmer and more far-sighted strategic brain at the top in the form of Mr Enders, and some time to fashion a response to defence cuts.No defence merger is easy given the interference of governments and the pressures on the industry. BAE has made its life harder by driving into a cul-de-sac. A deal that gets it out and saves face is, under the circumstances, not bad.john.gapper@ft.com"
204;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-09-19T17:32:45Z;Warning on fallout from US defence cuts;;Military contractors could force the cost of US defence equipment to rise sharply if a law cutting spending from January took force, the chairman of the US aerospace industry’s main trade group has warned, amid a campaign to avert the cuts.David Hess, chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, also told the Financial Times that the US defence department would struggle to administer the sudden cuts to hundreds of complex programmes.Mr Hess, president of Pratt & Whitney, the aero engine maker owned by United Technologies, pointed out that many companies’ contracts with the US Department of Defence entitled them to recover certain overall costs for programmes, whatever their size. The cost for each aircraft or other item would consequently rise as the number of items purchased fell.“To the extent that they make these cuts and either reduce, stretch out or terminate programmes, there are programme termination costs that need to be considered,” said Mr Hess. “Because volumes are going down, the price per unit goes up. None of that has been considered.”The Pentagon would struggle to manage the sheer volume of work involved, he added. “I don’t know administratively how they could possibly administer sequestration or how the supply business would respond.”The threat of the cuts stems from the deal that ended last year’s crisis over the extension of the US’s national debt ceiling. The deal mandated $100bn in annual spending cuts for a series of government budget items if no other deficit-reduction agreement was reached by December 31 this year.Companies that depend heavily on US military procurement could suffer particularly severely. RBC Capital Markets in June said the full programme of cuts would cut earnings per share for 2013 at Northrop Grumman, the maker of military aircraft and electronic warfare systems, and L-3, a maker of command and control systems, by 15 per cent. EPS for Lockheed Martin, the military aircraft manufacturer, would fall 12 per cent.Lockheed Martin has announced plans to send out lay-off notices to all potentially affected workers two months before the budget cuts would come into force on November 2, immediately before the presidential election.Many analysts believe impending falls in US defence spending have also played a role in encouraging the merger talks between the UK’s BAE Systems and Europe’s EADS.
205;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;US defence groups reassess strategies;;US defence groups are scrambling to evaluate their strategic options after the news of the proposed €38bn merger between EADS and BAE Systems.While they have not ruled out the possibility of trying to scuttle the biggest ever aerospace deal by bidding for BAE themselves, large US military suppliers including Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are unlikely to make a move, according to people familiar with the matter.Defence companies are facing a difficult outlook because of political uncertainty and the squeeze on budgets in the US and are reluctant to take on the additional challenge of a large international takeover, these people say.However, a takeover of BAE by EADS could accelerate the consolidation of the US defence industry in other ways, by encouraging companies to look for acquisitions both at home and in Europe.For the moment the US defence industry is preoccupied with the threat of sequestration: the deep cuts in government spending that will take effect on January 1, if Congress fails to agree on reducing the budget deficit, under a deal reached last year. The administration’s Office of Management and Budget reported on Friday that sequestration would cut 9.4 per cent from most military programmes.Yair Reiner, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said the lack of clarity about the outlook would make it difficult to do deals.“If a chief executive of a defence company were to go with a takeover idea to the board, the response would be ‘don’t we have our hands full with much more immediate issues? We should be focused on saving the business we have, not acquiring a new one’.”The presidential election in November is another source of uncertainty. President Barack Obama has pledged to reduce military spending if he is re-elected for a second term, while Republican challenger Mitt Romney has said he would increase the Pentagon’s budget.Once those immediate issues are resolved, though, the expected long-term squeeze on the US defence budget could justify further rationalisation: certainly acquisitions of smaller companies by the leading contractors, and possibly even mergers among the big five.After a wave of mergers in the 1990s, the US government signalled that it would frown on any attempted deals between the five large “tier one” defence contractors: Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, General Dynamics and Raytheon. While consolidation can help cut costs, the Pentagon has said it does not want competition between suppliers to be eroded further.Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed, has suggested that the government’s veto of deals between the large suppliers might not last forever, and at a conference on Friday he suggested that a BAE-EADS deal would be a test of the Pentagon’s view.“I think they would both be perceived as large systems providers in the Department of Defence’s point of view, and it might be an early test of whether the unfavorability of consolidation of that tier would in fact be changing,” he said.“Right now, by policy, I don’t see the prospects for any consolidation opportunities at the top tier, but if the future were to suggest demand were declining, I’d certainly think that would be revisited.”Key metrics behind the attempted combination and a brief history of European defence consolidationOther industry executives question whether EADS, which was the 83rd largest contractor to the Pentagon last year according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, can really be seen as a tier-one supplier.Nevertheless, US groups might try to use the deal as leverage to push through acquisitions of their own that might previously have been rejected on antitrust grounds, arguing that they will need to scale up to compete with an enlarged EADS.A merged BAE-EADS, a European champion in the defence industry, could be a more effective competitor in the US and international markets, with greater financial strength, a wider range of technologies, and broader contacts with politicians and officials. EADS’s plan to build an Airbus factory in Alabama will also increase its political clout.Smaller defence companies are also set to take advantage of the proposed deal, with a slew of potential targets poised to put themselves up for sale as larger groups seek to expand through acquisitions.US groups might also turn their attention to other European defence assets, with potential targets including Finmeccanica, the Italian aerospace group, Meggitt, the UK defence group, and Safran, the French aerospace group, according to people familiar with the proposed BAE-EADS deal.Not every defence company is likely to be a buyer. Boeing probably has more attractive places to deploy capital in its thriving civil aircraft business, analysts say.Lockheed, which earns 82 per cent of its revenues from the US government, is already so closely tied to the Pentagon that it has no effective alternative to making its defence business work.A BAE-EADS agreement could also throw up opportunities for other deals. With US government approval needed for the takeover to go through, US rivals to EADS and BAE are considering what conditions they could ask regulators to impose.Concessions could include the need for BAE to dispose of particularly sensitive units that are vital to US national security, which could provide US groups with the opportunity to snatch prized assets.If it is concerned enough about the French and German governments’ stakes in EADS, the US could even encourage an American company to step in with a bid for BAE.Guy Ben-Ari, deputy director of the defence industries group at the CSIS, argues that such a move is unlikely, and that the US government will probably be satisfied with remedies short of that, including a restructuring of BAE’s US business to strengthen the “firewall” around its sensitive military technology.However, he adds, given the extent of political influence over the defence industry, such an intervention in the proposed deal would not be impossible.“When the Pentagon deems it necessary for the industry to change, it can influence private contractors to nudge the industry to move in its desired direction,” he said.
206;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-09-14T20:45:57Z;Bernard Jenkin voices BAE-EADS concerns of Tory right;;Bernard Jenkin, a former defence spokesman for the Conservative party, has become the most senior figure in Westminster to voice concerns about the impact of the BAE-EADS merger on relations between Britain and the US.Mr Jenkin, a respected figure on the right of the party, said he did not want the Americans to “call the shots” over the British defence industry but they ought to be its “partner of choice”.“My instincts are that this will create significant difficulties if we want to have bilateral defence programmes with the Americans in future,” he told the FT. “When we operate with them we get by far the best support.”Mr Jenkin and other Tory MPs believe that a counter-offer is likely to emerge from a major US defence company such as Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman.Amid a growing mood of unease about the deal on the Tory back benches, Philip Hammond, defence secretary, said the government would only approve the deal if it was in the UK’s national interest.“We will want to be reassured not just about the security implications but about the implications for the future allocation of work to the UK,” he said. Mr Hammond said he was realistic, however, that BAE Systems faced major challenges as a standalone company.Mr Jenkin said the paramount concern was Britain’s “onshore capability”, the ability to get hold of essential equipment and spare parts at short notice.The deal would have to be closely watched to ensure that Britain retained control over BAE’s technology in key areas, he said. “We have an enormous amount of intellectual property in the defence sphere, global leadership, and we need to retain that,” he said.Ben Wallace, another Tory MP, called for caution over the deal, warning that EADS was making a “grab” for BAE’s US business but could make deep cuts to its UK workforce.It was essential to clarify whether Britain’s “very important defence relationship with the US” was threatened or strengthened by the merger, said Mr Wallce.“When they start identifying overlaps, what I don’t want to see is the French sweeping in and saying we will just get rid of the British workforce – such as my constituents – because it is easier to do.”Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former defence secretary, struck a more supportive note by saying that Britain would retain considerable sway in the merged company – whereas a US takeover of BAE could see it absorbed without trace.“I would be very supportive of a US-UK relationship, that is our natural partner, but in this area I would be concerned because of the disparate size of the two parties,” he told the FT. “EADS is bigger than BAE but not that much bigger.”Sir Malcolm also pointed out that France and the UK had strong shared interests in the defence arena despite the “occasional rhetoric”.The Unite union has criticised a lack of consultation and is pressing for a full study of the social and economic implications of the deal.

208;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-09-13T19:02:00Z;A defence dream born out of necessity;A wave of mergers is likely. All the more reason for a BAE-EADS tie-up, says Alexander Nicoll;"In December 1997 the leaders of France, Germany and the UK issued an unusual joint statement calling on their countries’ aircraft manufacturers to merge and create a company on a scale that could match US rivals. If talks revealed this week between BAE and EADS come to fruition, they will finally get their wish – but not by the route they intended.Neither company then existed in its current form. What was then British Aerospace was working towards a merger with its German counterpart, Dasa, which was to be followed by a deal with France’s Aérospatiale Matra. But masterly negotiating tactics by the other big UK defence company, GEC, instead brought about in 1999 an all-British merger to create BAE Systems. The plan for a European aerospace giant to rival Boeing and Lockheed Martin was confounded. Furious, the continental companies retaliated by combining as EADS.Today’s reversion to the original goal is driven by a decline in western defence spending – just as the consolidation of the 1990s was. The difference is that, this time, Europe could be leading the inevitable rationalisation. Spending by 23 European Nato members fell 7 per cent in real terms between 2006 and 2010; the fall is set to continue with reductions in the UK and a defence review under way in France.The specific problem facing military aerospace companies is that there are no new European manned aircraft in prospect once the present generation of fighters – the Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen – ceases production. Governments have various projects for unmanned aircraft but any future production runs are likely to be small. This is a looming problem that will force changes in the industrial base.Between them, EADS and BAE have significant businesses in other areas of defence – ships, helicopters, missiles, armoured vehicles, space. But they can obviously get better global market clout by shelving rivalries and making a combined attack on remaining budgets.To make headway in Europe, however, they will need something from their customers: better co-ordination among governments on procurement, and especially on research spending to generate new technologies. Europe does not have a glorious record in collaborative defence projects, and this has often prevented companies from achieving economies of scale.EADS, after uniting bits of the French, German and Spanish defence industries, found that it still had to deal with its government customers separately, limiting the scope for synergies. The 2010 Anglo-French defence treaty was a positive step, but needs to be given real substance – and perhaps Germany will now need to be added to the set-up sooner rather than later.The goal for European companies remains, however, the huge US market. BAE has built a substantial business with the Pentagon, while EADS has a large Airbus customer base but has suffered setbacks in bidding for contracts, notably for an air-to-air refuelling tanker. The US is, to be sure, a declining market. About $500bn has been cut from planned defence spending over the next 10 years. If “sequestration” were to occur in 2013, a further $600bn of cuts would be applied over the same period. But America will remain a significant source of business.Never an easy market for outsiders to penetrate, the US will become more competitive as budgets decline. American defence companies have been feeling the effects: over the past two years, Lockheed Martin has cut 26 per cent of its executive-level personnel. A new wave of merger activity seems likely. All the more reason, then, for BAE and EADS to combine their efforts. They will face regulatory hurdles, but in the past these have been overcome by security agreements that ringfence specific sensitive activities.The Middle East, where BAE has a key market in Saudi Arabia, and Asia, which is forecast by the International Institute of Strategic Studies to overtake Europe in defence spending this year, will also be important longer-term goals in which a combined effort would help.But terms must first be agreed; and then will come the challenge of combining two very different corporate cultures. EADS is itself a case study in how difficult and time-consuming such a process can be. Given the 60/40 shareholder split that has been posited, the proposed tie-up could be viewed in effect as an EADS takeover of BAE. So the UK group’s shareholders will be coy as they seek to extract the best value. If they are won over, the result will be a deal that makes structural sense – even if it is 15 years late.The writer is director of editorial at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the editor of Strategic Survey 2012: The Annual Review of World Affairs"
209;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-09-13T16:21:27Z;Doubts grow over EADS and BAE tie-up;;Governments and shareholders have reacted with caution and scepticism to a plan by EADS and BAE Systems to create a $48bn European defence and aerospace group to rival Lockheed Martin and Boeing of the US.EADS shares closed down 10.2 per cent at €25.15 in Paris on Thursday while shares in BAE, which had risen sharply following confirmation of the talks, fell 7.3 per cent to 337.1p in London.One top 20 BAE shareholder said: “In theory, this tie-up makes sense as it will give Europe a company that can take on the might of Boeing. But big job losses could cause political problems and uncertainty that could hit share performance and the long-term worth of holding the company’s stock.”EADS suffered a bruising defeat to Boeing last year when it lost out on an order to build 179 refuelling aircraft for the US Air Force. BAE has made the US its main focus since it sold its share in EADS’s Airbus aircraft business in 2006.Under UK takeover rules, the groups have until October 10 to seal the deal or walk away. The German and French governments each control through direct and indirect holdings a 22.5 per cent stake in EADS. The UK holds a “golden share” in BAE.Media company Lagardère, a French shareholder that holds the EADS chairmanship, suggested it was not yet convinced of the terms of the deal, even though shares in Lagardère jumped 5.7 per cent.“The Lagardère group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS-BAE Systems merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal,” it said, noting the proposal had not yet been submitted to board members for their approval.In Germany, the deal was welcomed by one of EADS’s key shareholders that has long wanted to withdraw from the group. Daimler, which controls 22.5 per cent of EADS, said: “Since the planned transaction would also be linked to a possible dissolution of the [French and German] shareholder pact, all options would be open to us in principle – including the possibility of selling our stake on the open market.”In the face of a deal that would, if completed, mark the culmination of at least 15 years of efforts to fashion a European defence champion, other shareholders, subsidiaries and unions at the groups moved swiftly to declare that they would protect their interests.The German government wants to reduce direct or indirect state involvement in EADS, but the proposed merger has set off alarm bells about the potential relocation of manufacturing and jobs, especially to the UK or France.“[German] government approval is by no means a done deal,” one official told the Financial Times. “There is a huge bundle of questions which we still have to answer – or want answers for.”One person briefed on talks between EADS, BAE and the European governments involved said Berlin was betraying “an almost irrational fear” that any merger could see France assert its dominance in the civil aircraft business and the UK its dominance in the arms business.Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus, the aircraft subsidiary that accounts for two-thirds of EADS revenues, told staff in an internal memo on Thursday that the proposed deal “is not expected to affect Airbus and its employees in daily operations”. Mr Brégier is expected to remain as head of Airbus under the deal.In the UK, the government said it saw the commercial sense of the deal, but Unite, the country’s biggest trade union, has called for an urgent meeting with ministers, fearing job losses and noting a combined EADS-BAE would become Britain’s biggest manufacturer.Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, said that while BAE may struggle to secure approval from the US government, the company could find it even harder to get the backing of its shareholders. “This could be the toughest sell of all,” he added.He raised the possibility that a US defence company, such as Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman, could counter bid for BAE.Jeremy Bragg, analyst at Citi, said it could be hard for EADS to extract significant synergies from a deal with BAE, as some operations would need to be ringfenced for the deal to secure regulatory approval.The proposed tie-up – which would probably see Tom Enders, EADS chief executive, take the helm – would create a company with sales of €72bn, employing 220,000 people worldwide. It would give EADS access to BAE’s defence portfolio and significant presence in the US market, allowing it for the first time to take on Boeing.BAE hopes a tie-up with EADS would allow it to go on an acquisition drive in growing segments of the defence and security industry, such as communications and cyber technology.Reporting by Carola Hoyos, Andrew Parker, David Oakley, Anousha Sakoui and Tom Burgis in London, James Boxell in Paris and Gerrit Wiesmann in Berlin
210;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US military contractors – war horses;A tough battle that will not be won by financial engineers;The past decade or so has been a good time to be a contractor working for the US military or intelligence agencies. Between 2000 and 2010 the military budget grew 9 per cent a year, to about $690bn, faster than the budget as a whole or any of the big budget items besides Medicare. The Department of Homeland Security had a fiscal 2010 budget of $55bn, $15bn more than five years before.More recent years have been tougher. In 2010 both the secretary of defence and the CIA director went on record in the Washington Post voicing serious concerns about how many key jobs were being filled by contract employees. But the debate is not just over who should fight wars or collect intelligence. It is about how many soldiers and spies the country can afford. Hence the 2011 Budget Control Act and its threat of sequestration. If Congress is unable to agree to cut the federal budget by $1.2tn over 10 years, automatic cuts kick in next year with the axe falling heaviest on the military.Shares in the largest contractors that make the fanciest weapons systems – Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin – have held up over the past few years. Smaller contractors that specialise in providing personnel and technical support have had a tougher time. L-3, SAIC, ManTech and CACI International have all lagged behind the wider market badly. SAIC announced last week that, in an effort to create shareholder value, it would separate its low-margin IT and services arm from its higher-margin technology solutions business. This follows two other separations of lower-value divisions by Northrop Grumman (it spun off Huntington Ingalls) and L-3 (Engility). Neither of the earlier moves has generated much in the way of outsize returns, as a recent Credit Suisse analysis shows. This industry faces a tough battle, one that will not be won by financial engineers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
211;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed boosts outlook after strong quarter;;Lockheed Martin raised its full-year outlook in spite of looming cuts to the US military budget, as it reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street’s expectations.Net income from continuing operations at the world’s largest defence company by revenues was $781m, or $2.38 per share, up from $748m, or $2.16 a share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $1.91 per share.Revenues were $11.9bn in the quarter, up from $11.5bn in the second quarter of 2011 and ahead of analysts’ forecasts of about $11.3bn. Sales were up more than 18 per cent in the space division, buoyed by increased commercial satellite deliveries, as well as production volume on the Orion vehicle program for Nasa.Lockheed said it was now expecting full-year profits of between $7.90 and $8.10 per share, up from the forecast it issued in January of $7.70-$7.90 per share.The improved outlook was remarkable given the uncertain state of the US defence budget, which has prompted some companies in the industry to put a hold on investment and hiring.Lockheed builds F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, Aegis missiles and coastal warships. and Bob Stevens, its chief executive, has led the industry in calling on Congress to prevent the “sequestration” budget deal struck on Capitol Hill last year. It would see $500bn in defence cuts over ten years on top of the $485bn the Pentagon is already planning to trim from its spending over the next decade.Mr Stevens has warned that his company may have to sack 10,000 workers if the automatic budget cuts go into effect in January. He said the Pentagon and the White House had still provided very little information on how the additional cuts would be implemented.“We’ve petitioned Congress and the administration to find an alternative method …to reduce costs and lower the debt, but if sequestration is going to occur, then we need more detailed information as to how to properly plan and execute our responsibilities,” Mr Stevens said on Tuesday.In spite of the political uncertainty, the improved outlook cheered investors, with Lockheed shares rising 0.6 per cent to $87.47 by early afternoon in New York.“Whilst we had expected a good result from Lockheed this quarter (as usual), we had not expected such a strong performance on all fronts,” wrote Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets in a research note.“The upside to revenues is particularly notable in this tough defence environment, with continued progress on the margins,” Mr Stallard added. However, he cautioned: “We suspect that Lockheed will probably have a tough time sustaining 12.3 per cent margins.”Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, warned that a ten-week strike at the company’s Fort Worth factory and other sites would weigh on results in the second half of the year. Mr Tanner said the company was expecting $200m less in sales at its aeronautics division because of the industrial action.
212;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-07-22T18:02:20Z;Booz Allen Hamilton – exposed flank;Taking on extra debt when defence spending cuts loom might not be wise;The worldwide hunt for yield in an environment of zero rates takes investors to all kinds of places. Booz Allen Hamilton, the consultancy, is putting the finishing touches to a plan to borrow money for a $1bn payout to its shareholders. Among them is Carlyle, the US private equity firm, with a majority stake. Nearly all of Booz’s revenues come from consultancy services to organisations across the US government. The firm’s single biggest customer, accounting for 17 per cent of revenues last year, is the US army.The upcoming deal will increase Booz’s net debt to about $1.5bn from about $500m, pushing its net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation up to 3 times. Not terrible, but a big jump up from 1 times now. Generally, lenders do not like it when companies borrow to pay dividends, but they tolerate these deals for those that have done well. And Booz has. Revenue for fiscal 2012 was $5.9bn compared with $4.4bn three years earlier over the same period. Ebitda jumped to $488m from nearly $277m.If the US government continues to rely on Booz and other contractors to keep the military and intelligence apparatus humming, this could be a great company to lend to at the roughly 5 per cent yield being offered on the loan.The worry, of course, is that the US government, battling high-profile budget deficits, is poised to cut costs and that contractors rather than fully fledged (and often unionised) federal employees will feel the pain first. Booz itself has flagged “uncertainty” and is not forecasting revenue beyond the first six months of the current fiscal year. Lockheed Martin and other defence companies were in Washington recently, warning about how much big spending cuts could hurt their businesses. This deal leaves Booz with its defences down.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
213;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-07-07T03:21:33Z;Sales: Battle-readiness clinched biggest deal;Carola Hoyos picks over the lessons from India’s recent purchase;"There is no better advertisement than war in the multibillion-dollar battle to persuade countries from India to Brazil to buy a certain model of fighter jet.For Dassault’s Rafale and Eurofighter’s Typhoon, the conflict to unseat Libyan dictator Colonel Muammer Gaddafi helped to decide the biggest jet fighter tender ever.But beyond modern conflict, the issues of politics, military history, technology and price all play a role in deciding export deals. These are becoming increasingly important to western defence contractors, as the traditional customers, such as the US and European nations, tighten their purse strings.In fact the Typhoon and Rafale both performed well over Tripoli, bolstering confidence on both sides that they are the better aircraft.So convinced was David Cameron, UK prime minister, that Typhoon was the superior fighter he said so even after India had chosen Rafale as its preferred bidder. Eurofighter executives cringed at his bravado, fearing it would insult Delhi. Behind the scenes, even those rooting for Typhoon cautioned it was rarely clear that one fighter was better than another when all factors, including price, were considered.In fact unpicking why India had chosen Rafale over Typhoon is like trying to remove bubble­gum from hair. Among the deciding factors were: the price and accompanying decades of support; politics; technology, and the companies’ willingness to share their knowhow.Among technology capabilities, the radar and weapons the aircraft carried were particularly important, people close to the sale said. In terms of radar, the most advanced systems are found in US jet fighters such as the F35, but politics had kept US companies from the final rounds of the tender.Among Eurofighter’s partners – the UK’s BAE Systems, pan-European EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica – developing the active electronically scanned array, which improves on old systems by being far harder to detect, was the job of the Italians. Finmeccanica was at the mercy of the UK government and its decision over how quickly to integrate the critical technology into Typhoon.In the end, the French were quicker and that, say analysts, helped nudge India’s decision towards Dassault’s Rafale.The number of weapons for which the competing fighters had been approved was another key element of the deal.Typhoon may have done well in Libya by hitting its targets accurately, but its remit was limited to big bombs that could only be fired at large, stationary targets in unpopulated areas because it has yet to be approved for a wider array of weapons.In contrast, Rafale carried a varied arsenal of air-to-ground weapons that could strike moving targets and fight incoming fire, adding to its attractiveness.India’s $20bn tender was not the only fighter jet competition of the past 12 months.Japan chose – as expected – the US-led F-35, the most modern of the group and, crucially, the one being developed by Japan’s closest military ally.Lockheed Martin, the US’s biggest defence company and lead contractor developing the aircraft, says the F-35 is the only fifth generation aircraft on offer and therefore in a league of its own.“There are fourth generation air forces and there are F-35 air forces. All the world’s great air forces are moving to F35,” says Lockheed Martin’s Steve O’Bryan, who is in charge of selling F-35 internationally, listing, among others, the US, Japan, and the UK.The F-35 aims to roll into one the capability of whole fleets of international jet fighters, from the UK’s Tornados to the US’s F-4s. This, Lockheed says, will allow countries to save money by scrapping their old fighters, some of which were devised as far back as the 1950s and are becoming increasingly costly to maintain.But others are far less positive about the F-35’s value proposition. US lawmakers and the Pentagon have criticised the delays and cost overruns at the 50-year, $1tn programme– the most expensive ever. And, outside the US, many of the world’s top air forces have less money to spend and are not only delaying their purchases of F35s but also reducing the number they buy.Not all countries want to hitch their wagon to the US star, while others are never offered the chance to buy such sophisticated weaponry because the US Congress restricts defence exports to close allies.Thus South Korea and Singapore are possible next markets for F35, while others, such as Oman, are looking at Typhoon and Rafale.But the most exciting imminent decision is that of Brazil, which pits Rafale against Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and Saab’s Gripen – “an aircraft that has the unusual habit of coming in on time and on budget,” as one analyst put it.Analysts generally praise the Gripen for doing a solid job at an attractive price.While one Eurofighter executive quipped disapprovingly after Switzerland chose Gripen over Typhoon: “They test drove a Ferrari and a Fiat Punto and chose the Punto”, for Switzerland, it may well make good sense to buy a city car that is cheaper and easier to park.Ironically, Finmeccanica is in the process of delivering the Gripen’s radar, which is still missing from Typhoon.Europeans are far from the only game in town when it comes to cheap and cheerful jet fighters, at least when compared with other launchers of deadly missiles that cost tens of millions of dollars.What makes the upgraded variants of Lockheed Martin’s F-16 and Boeing’s F-18 too old for some adds to the attraction for others, because the fighters have longer records in an arena where faults cause delays, cost huge amounts to fix, kill pilots and lose wars.And then there are Russian and Chinese competitors, which – in an era when the biggest growth in military spending is coming from countries not necessarily wedded to the west – just adds to the competition."
214;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-07-04T18:24:12Z;US reforms set to help pension funds;;Looming legislation in Washington awaiting the signature of President Barack Obama is set to provide welcome relief to US pension plans.A pronounced slide in interest rates in recent years has placed defined benefit pensions at many companies such as US Steel, Goodyear, Boeing and Lockheed Martin under pressure, driving up their liabilities and resulting in an expanding “ pension funding gap”.Under the new legislation, instead of discounting long-term liabilities using a rate based on the average of the past two years, pension plans will be able to use a rate based on the average of the past 25 years. This is expected to increase the discount rate used to determine liabilities by more than two percentage points.The change only applies to the rate pension plans use to discount liabilities for the purpose of setting company contributions. It will not affect how liabilities are calculated in order to report deficits (or surpluses) on company balance sheets.But it will significantly lower many US companies’ pension plan contributions, boosting corporate profits and thereby raising tax revenue for the Federal government.Similar developments are taking place in Europe, where pension plans have also seen deficits widen as a result of record low interest rates. Denmark and Sweden last month moved to ease rules for calculating pension liabilities, and UK pensions minister Steve Webb, speaking at a recent conference, expressed interestin following their example.However, Adrian Hartshorn, partner in Mercer’s Financial Strategy Group, says there is no indication to suggest the UK would move to allow pension funds to smooth the discount rate, unlike developments in the US.He said the Pensions Regulator acknowledged in a recent announcement the low level of interest rates compared with 12-18 months ago but expected pension fund trustees “to adopt a point in time approach and not to smooth”.Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, has suggested the Regulator will have to reconsider in the light of the expected third round of quantitative easing by the Bank of England. This would have a knock-on effect on pension schemes, says Ms Segars “and we need some creative ideas [to help pension schemes]”.Looking to smooth the discount rate used in the UK triennial scheme valuations that determine funding levels could be one of the options considered, she adds.In the US, meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether pension plans are set to increase their weightings to equities as the new legislation comes into force.Since 2007 US corporations with large pension obligations have been big buyers of bonds at the expense of equities helping send US Treasury yields to their lowest levels since 1946.US Treasury debt held by defined benefit private pension plans had risen fourfold to $284bn by the end of March 2012, against $71.8bn in 2006 according to Federal Reserve data. Equities held by pension plans have fallen to $1.25tn from $1.8tn during this period.This has reduced the weighting of equities in relation to overall assets in pension plans from 72 per cent in 2006 to as low as 52 per cent in 2011.And earlier this year, Ford said it was moving towards holding 80 per cent of its pension fund assets in bonds, up from a prior weighting of 45 per cent.Companies with large pension funds and little cash on their balance sheets may want to minimise their exposure to interest rate volatility by selling long bonds or holding off on extending their long bond allocations, says Gordon Fletcher, a principal in the financial strategy group at Mercer, an advisory firm.“Some companies may be looking at that and thinking how they can make their assets less sensitive to interest rates,” Mr Fletcher said. “Long bonds are very sensitive to interest rate movements.”Some argue that pension plans will stay with bonds as they still need to match long-term liabilities. Karin Franceries, pension strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, says that the bill will cause funds that were hesitant about de-risking their plans to delay further on implementation.Other actuaries have been cautioning clients against taking a short-term position, arguing that the legislation is only giving them a short-term deferral in cash contributions.
215;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-06-27T20:35:37Z;Congress set to grant pension windfall;;US companies with large pension deficits – mostly industrial groups such as steelmakers – will be bolstered by legislation that is expected to be approved by Congress this week.A measure to stabilise the funding of corporate pensions is being used as a way to cover the cost of a two-year bill to fund road construction and a one-year bill to freeze interest rates on student loans. Talks on Capitol Hill were in their final stages on Wednesday evening and a deal was imminent, congressional aides said.The pension provision, if enacted, would give a reprieve to US groups forced to raise the value of their pension fund liabilities by the marked decline of interest rates since 2008.If approved, the change would reduce the amount of money companies have to pay into their defined benefit pension plans. In turn, that stands to boost their taxable income and so bolster government tax revenues. According to Guggenheim Partners the companies that stand to benefit include AK Steel and US Steel, Goodyear, RR Donnelley and Lockheed Martin. Although the exact terms of the legislation were not announced, one version would save $9.4bn for the US government through higher corporate tax payments resulting from the fall in tax-deductible pension contributions.Pension fund liabilities have been sharply raised by steep falls in the bond yields that are used to discount the present value of future pension fund promises. Under the provision, companies would be allowed to use an average rate based on the past 25 years, rather than one based on the past two.“The immediate effect of this legislation would be lower funding for pension plans in the coming years,” said Ira Jersey, strategist at Credit Suisse.Deutsche Bank estimated that the difference between using a two-year or 25-year average rate for a triple A/double A corporate bond was 2.3 per cent.The move comes as pension regulators in Europe have come under pressure from employers to be allowed to use a higher rate to discount liabilities, a change that reduces the size of reported shortfalls. The UK’s Pensions Regulator declined to allow artificial rates to be used, but said companies could take longer to fill scheme deficits.Any change allowing US employers to cut benefits could have consequences for the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation which insures the underfunded schemes of insolvent employers. At the end of its 2011 fiscal year, its deficit was $26bn. But the legislation would also require higher corporate fees payable to the PBGC.If the pension provision is approved, it could also spark a reversal of pension funds buying bonds at the expense of equities, say analysts, putting pressure on long-term yields.Treasury debt held by defined benefit private pension plans had risen to $284bn by the end of March 2012, against $82bn for the same period in 2007, said Deutsche Bank. “If or when the new pension bill is passed, we believe the long-dated bonds would likely underperform, at least initially,” it said. Based on Federal Reserve data bond holdings as a share of financial assets have reached 34 per cent from about 20 per cent in 2006, while equity and mutual fund holdings dropped from 72 per cent to 54 per cent during the same period.“This would ease the problem of very low interest rates that have prevailed since the 2008 financial crisis, which have caused an increase in the present value of pension obligations,” said the Guggenheim analysts.Moreover, the pension bill sets minimum and maximum values that pension plans can use, meaning there will be less need among managers to buy or sell long-dated bonds during extreme changes of interest rates. Pension plans can use the minimum rate based on a 25-year average for discounting liabilities, rather than using a much lower market rate.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York and Norma Cohen in London
216;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-06-26T19:15:50Z;Boeing and Embraer in military alliance;;Boeing has agreed to co-operate with a Brazilian aircraft maker in developing a military transport and refuelling aircraft.Embraer, which is also seeking to break into the US military market with a light attack aircraft, said Boeing would collaborate with it on its KC-390.“Boeing has extensive experience in military transport and refuelling aircraft, as well as a deep understanding of potential clients for the KC-390,” Embraer said.The Brazilian air force will be the main buyer of the KC-390, which is part of a strategy by Embraer to move deeper into the defence industry to offset a slowdown in civil aviation wrought by the global economic slump.The transport aircraft, seen as Embraer’s answer to Lockheed Martin’s Hercules C-130, will also be sold on international markets, most likely to the air forces of other emerging nations.The alliance with Boeing, a supplier of aircraft to the US air force and other Nato members, should open new doors for the Brazilian aircraft maker.“Boeing and Embraer will jointly explore the market for midsize military transport aircraft,” Embraer said. “The analysis will include markets that had not previously been considered for the aircraft.”The alliance with Boeing comes at a sensitive time for Brazil-US military relations after the US air force earlier this year abruptly cancelled a contract for Embraer to supply a light attack aircraft for use in Afghanistan.The air force said it was forced to ditch the contract after problems with its own paperwork.But this has not calmed suspicions in Brazil that the decision was driven by political considerations.Some US politicians objected to awarding the contract to a Brazilian company rather than Hawker Beechcraft of the US.Embraer said in March it expected defence sales this year of $950m compared with $868m last year. The defence order backlog had risen from $600m in 2006 to $3.5bn earlier this year.The company is developing new products, ranging from the KC-390 to unmanned aerial vehicles and surveillance and other systems designed to protect the Amazon region and Brazil’s oil discoveries off the country’s south-east coast.
217;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-06-20T22:56:05Z;BAE wins £500m Norway deal;;"BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence manufacturer by sales, has won a £500m contract to supply Norway with an upgraded version of its CV90 armoured vehicle in an increasingly rare sucess for its ailing land vehicles division.The company last month announced the closure of its Newcastle factory, ending a long and illustrious history of tank production in the UK.Revenues at BAE’s wider land and armaments business – which includes activities in the US, UK, South Africa and Sweden, where it produces the CV90 – have fallen dramatically.Sales have been hit by decreased demand for land warfare equipment and BAE’s failure to clinch some big orders, including building the next generation of armoured vehicle for the UK and upgrading its tank.In 2008 BAE’s land and armaments business made £6.4bn; by last year that had shrunk to £3.5bn.The CV90 has a strong foothold in the Nordic countries, having been selected by Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, as well as the Netherlands and Switzerland.BAE will upgrade Norway’s existing 103-vehicle CV9030 fleet, which it first delivered to the country in the mid-1990s. It will also build new vehicle chassis to deliver 144 CV90s in different configurations, including infantry fighting, reconnaissance, command engineering, multi-role and training vehicles.Land systems is a tough market, with armies shrinking as the Afghan war comes to an end and limited public finances prompting defence departments to cut procurement. In the UK, for example, the army is to be scaled back to 82,000 from 102,000 and a greater reliance placed on reserves.But even when there have been opportunities, BAE has lost out to competitors, particularly UK subsidiaries of US companies.General Dynamics UK won the last big contract to build new armoured vehicles for the UK, offering a customised version of its Ascod vehicle in use in Spain and Austria, while Lockheed Martin won the £1bn contract to upgrade the Warrior, extending the British tank’s life to 2040 and beyond. BAE had bid for both contracts."
218;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-06-03T18:05:22Z;Jump in hostile takeover bids;;Hostile deals are on the rise this year as strong companies look to take advantage of depressed stock markets and pounce on vulnerable targets.Year-to-date worldwide hostile mergers and acquisitions have jumped 86 per cent on the same period last year to $12.3bn and is at its highest level since the end of the last M&A boom in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters.Hostiles, when a company makes an offer for another’s shares without the support of the target’s board, are common when the target’s price has fallen sharply, creating an opening for a bargain-seeking buyer.GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical group, recently turned hostile in its $2.6bn bid for US-listed Human Genome Sciences after its initial unsolicited offer was rebuffed. HGS stock had fallen 75 per cent in the year before GSK launched its bid.Though the outlook for dealmaking remains poor due to the eurozone crisis, a rise in hostile bids can be a leading indicator of a revival in M&A.“It takes a great deal of confidence to launch a hostile bid,” Chris Young, head of contested situations at Credit Suisse, said: “To the extent we are seeing more hostile activity, it may prove to be a precursor to a rise in M&A activity in general, as most practitioners believe that a lack of confidence in the boardroom is the most significant impediment to dealmaking.”With depressed stock market valuations and the level of cash on company balance sheets reaching 30-year highs, bankers said the trend was likely to continue.“The longer these conditions persist with a core group of large companies in very strong positions strategically and financially, along with smaller companies trading at values seemingly dislocated from fundamental value, you will probably see continued hostile activity,” said Gregg Lemkau, head of international M&A for Goldman Sachs.“Valuations are unnaturally depressed …this makes traditional M&A challenging, but does create an environment conducive to hostile activity.”Many such bids have, however, been unsuccessful. Pharmaceutical group Roche was forced to give up its hostile pursuit of US gene-sequencing company Illumina in April. Martin Marietta, a US construction company, saw its hostile bid for rival Vulcan Materials blocked.But going hostile is still being recommended.“[Depressed share prices] make it hard for buyers and sellers to reach agreements on valuations,” said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of Okapi Partners, which advises on hostiles. “For investors who want to buy, launching a hostile is a way to get through the door right now.”
219;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Defence: Industry speaks more openly on threat from China;Carola Hoyos explains the role of cyber weapons;When China last year revealed its newest stealth jet fighter, the defence industry was taken aback.Executives of leading companies in the sector and military officials had not expected the J-20 to be as big or as technologically advanced as it appeared.Nor had they expected it to resemble their own latest generation jet fighters quite so closely. But they did have a suspicion about where Beijing obtained some of the top-secret information that might explain why this was so.The western defence industry is one of the biggest targets for cyber attacks. Many of them are believed to originate in China, as it tries to modernise its military without having to spend decades developing fiendishly complicated technology, such as that used to make the latest generation of western fighter jets that are near-invisible to radar.Groups including Lockheed Martin, the US’s biggest defence contractor by sales, and BAE Systems, its European peer, have come under particularly heavy cyberfire.The two are involved in the most sensitive and costly projects, including developing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which can perform tasks such as evading detection and allowing pilots to home in on ground targets miles away and invisible to the human eye.Because there is no law on how much companies must disclose about a cyber­attack, details about what may have been stolen and who could have been behind a theft often appear only via the grapevine.But many cyberexperts in defence companies suspect large quantities of data have been mined from programmes such as the Joint Strike Fighter.China denies wrongdoing. And western leaders keen to avoid diplomatic fallout – and often unable to pinpoint the source of an attack – have been careful not to blame Beijing directly. But that has begun to change, as China has become more aggressive not only about stealing secrets via the internet, but also using the web as a means of attack.Last year, a short clip from CCTV, the national broadcaster, brought sponsorship of cyberwar into the open.A July news story reveals footage shot at a Chinese military university of an attack being launched from custom-built software created by the Electrical Engineering University of the People’s Liberation Army.Using a simple drop-down menu, the attacker chooses minghui.org, a US-based website of the Falun Gong, a religious organisation banned in China. He then presses a button labelled “attack”.The revelation has allowed western politicians, defence officials and executives at the biggest US companies to speak more openly about the threat posed by the Chinese military.In May, the Pentagon in a report called China the world’s biggest supporter of “economic espionage”, describing it as an “aggressive and capable” collector of sensitive US technological information, including that owned by defence-related companies.The report concluded that China represented a “growing and persistent threat to US national security”.In the UK, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, who heads the UK military’s Joint Forces Command and oversees intelligence and cyber operations, says cyber warfare is a modern extension of fighting and intelligence gathering through the ages.China sees it this way and therefore it is imperative the UK and other nations take notice, he says. “The Chinese philosophical perspective would be exactly that. You could therefore argue that, in conceptual terms and in terms of our doctrine, yes indeed, we need to take the cyber element very seriously.”Jamie Shea, Nato’s Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges, agrees a battle frontier has opened.“Clearly, in the future all conflicts are going to involve people trying to disrupt information technology systems, which are not only necessary for communication, but also for the operation of highly sophisticated weapons systems, most of which these days are computer driven,” he says, adding that for now the west is losing the battle.“For a long time, the offence is going to be ahead of the defence. Although traditionally in military terms, the defence does catch up – as it is doing at the moment in the area of missiles,” he says.Western politicians, military officials and defence contractors like to talk about defending global computer networks, but are far more reticent about giving details about the offensive weapons they are developing.The best known of these is Stuxnet, widely believed to have been used by the US or Israel against Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.Sir Stuart admits offensive weapons are on the agenda, but warns against rushing into developing them: “You have to think about such things, but you also have to think of the consequences.”The danger is an arms race involving cyber weapons that are as destructive as intercontinental ballistic missiles and the western-style jet fighters China is so eager to produce.
220;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US strike action;Management is not prepared to buy off labour;North American industrial workers are revolting – or at least striking. In recent weeks, employees at a Caterpillar plant in Illinois, railway workers with Canadian Pacific and staff at Lockheed Martin’s fighter jet facility in Texas have all taken to picketing over pay and benefits.Should executives be worried? A little. According to the labour department, after declining for decades serious stoppages – involving more than 1,000 workers and lasting at least one shift – jumped from 5 in 2009 to 19 in 2011. Over the same period, annual days idle climbed from 124,000 to more than 1m.The rise is surprising. Classical economic theory would suggest that, with unemployment levels running at about 8 per cent and economic prospects cloudy at best, workers should be quiescent – willing to accept whatever management offers for fear of being replaced.But the situation is more complex. Despite the headline numbers, many industries complain that they cannot find qualified workers for skilled positions. Employees appear to be gambling that in specific circumstances they retain enough leverage to secure improved, or at least stable, terms and conditions.Employees have some cause for complaint. Pay for manufacturing workers has remained broadly flat since 2000, while output per hour has increased by almost half. At the same time, and partly as a result, corporate margins are close to record levels while the share of national income going to workers as wages is near postwar lows.Given those data points, the real question is why management is not prepared to buy off labour to avoid the hassle. One possibility: executives do not yet believe in the modest US recovery. Scepticism is understandable. Europe remains in crisis, Asia is slowing and domestic political uncertainty is high.

221;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Limits placed on costly US fighter jet;;The Pentagon has said that it will limit flight operations for the F-22 Raptor, the controversial stealth aircraft, while it attempts to get to the bottom of long-running problems connected to its oxygen systems.A spokesman said on Tuesday that the US Air Force would impose a series of measures, including restrictions on how far the fighter jet can fly from landing strips to ensure pilots can return safely if they encounter any difficulties.It is the second time the defence department has limited the F-22’s operations in as many years and will further stoke the ire of critics who have assailed the aircraft for its high costs and questionable reliability.As part of broader efforts to reduce expenditures, in 2009 the Pentagon decided to cap purchases of F-22s at 187 aircraft for a total coast of about $67bn, although perversely the move dramatically increased the unit costs of the jets.At the same time the military faces spiralling costs to “modernise” the aircraft. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional watchdog, found that upgrade costs had jumped to $11.7bn, from $5.4bn in 2004.The latest moves are bound to invite further scrutiny of the Pentagon at a time when the defence budget is under severe pressure and the department is trying to hold off additional cuts at the start of 2013.Since its belated entry into service in 2005 the F-22 Raptor has been dogged by suggestions – challenged by the manufacturer Lockheed Martin – that while extremely capable, the aircraft is difficult and expensive to maintain.In 2011 the entire Raptor fleet was grounded for four months after pilots reported “hypoxia-like symptoms”, such as disorientation and nausea, on 14 separate occasions.The Raptor eventually returned to service in September last year, even though investigators failed to determine the root cause of the issue, after the Pentagon implanted certain technical and procedural changes.The controversy resurfaced earlier this month when two serving pilots appeared on 60 Minutes, the CBS television news programme, and said bluntly that they were not comfortable flying the F-22.At a congressional hearing days later, air force officials said that 11 cases of oxygen deprivation-like symptoms have been recorded since September 2011 and admitted that they continued to search for the basic cause.Still, Lieutenant General Janet Wolfenbarger, with the US Air Force, insisted that the aircraft was “safe to fly”, pointing out that only about 0.1 per cent of all missions flown had been affected and that investigations were honing in on the problem.Lieutenant General Wolfenbarger added that the air force had made 17 adjustments to the life support systems on the F-22 in order to reduce risk, and said that “pilot safety is of utmost concern and a top priority”.A spokesman for Lockheed said the company “continues to support the Air Force’s efforts to determine a root cause of the reported physiological issues in the F-22”.
222;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-04-26T16:19:23Z;Stevens to retire as Lockheed chief;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues, says Bob Stevens, its long-time chief executive, will retire at the end of the year and has appointed its chief operating officer to replace him.Chris Kubasik, who has long been groomed for the top job, will take over at the start of January next year, although Mr Stevens will continue as chairman until January 2014 to smooth the transition process.Lockheed also appointed Marillyn Hewson, a 29 year veteran, president and chief operating officer. Ms Hewson is the second high profile female appointment in the sector this year. In March, General Dynamics appointed Phebe Novakovic president and chief operating officer.On Thursday Mr Stevens said his decision to retire was motivated in part by his age – 60 – and in part by the desire to ensure an orderly handover at a moment when the defence industry was undergoing substantial changes.“When I look at future challenges, I recognise they will certainly extend beyond my mandatory retirement age and I wanted to assure that we have a tested and trusted leadership team in place,” he said.With his retirement, Mr Stevens will bring to a close a 25-year career at Lockheed at which he became president in 2000 and then chief executive in 2004.During that time he helped to integrate several big acquisitions and steered the F-35 fighter jet, Lockheed’s biggest programme, through design and development. Cost and schedule overruns have brought intense scrutiny to the project.Mr Kubasik, 51, has landed the top job at a difficult moment. The US defence industry is experiencing a painful shift from a spending boom following the September 11 2001 attacks to severe government spending restraint.At the end of the year the US defence department may be forced to make an additional round of cuts due to the so-called sequestration process introduced by Congress as part of a deal to tackle the federal budget deficit.Mr Stevens reiterated his condemnation of the potential cuts and said Lockheed had not yet been hit, but in recent days other defence companies have noted a slowdown in Pentagon orders in anticipation of the spending reductions.On Wednesday Jay Johnson, chief executive of General Dynamics, said the industry was staring into a “fog bank” when it came to forecasting defence department spending.“Washingtonians are seemingly unified in their belief that sequestration will not happen as currently legislated, although no one can explain how avoiding the severe cut will be achieved,” he said.In response, Lockheed Martin and other contractors have cut costs, reduced headcount and reshuffled their portfolios – moves that have helped sustain their share prices and margins even as revenues have come under pressure.Mr Stevens said the company was determined to grow by boosting international sales and moving into adjacent markets and Mr Kubasik said he planned to continue with that strategy. “It will be business as usual,” he said.Despite the substantial headwinds, Lockheed Martin reported solid results for the first quarter of the year. Net income rose 26 per cent to $668m compared with the same period in the previous year.Earnings a share rose 35 per cent to $2.03, boosted in part by $242m of share buybacks.While other defence companies reported lower revenues, Lockheed increased sales thanks to an increase in Pentagon spending on aerospace products. For the three months to the end of March, revenues rose 6 per cent to $11.3bn.Still, Lockheed was not immune to the broader industry trends. The company’s backlog of orders slipped to $76.6bn from $80.7bn in 2011. Lockheed shares rose about 1 per cent to $91.95 in early morning trading on Thursday.
223;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-04-26T14:25:52Z;MoD takes flak over aircraft carrier;;MPs rounded on the Ministry of Defence’s top civil servant on Thursday over Britain’s troubled procurement of new aircraft carriers and fighter jets.In a brutal verbal grilling by parliamentarians of both parties, Ursula Brennan, permanent under-secretary of state for defence, was asked why she failed to intervene when ministers took decisions on the carrier programme without fully assessing the risks and costs.Margaret Hodge, Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said Ms Brennan should have issued a “letter of direction” – used by civil servants in rare cases to flag up concerns – when ministers decided in 2010 to convert Britain’s new carriers to handle a more powerful version of the F-35 fighter jet.Speculation has mounted in recent weeks that the government will abandon the refit and revert to its original order for the Stovl B variant of the F-35, adding another twist to the long-delayed and costly procurement.“Why on earth don’t you…stop ministers taking decisions which end up again with the tax payer having to foot the bill for a massive amount of totally, totally torn up pound notes?” said Ms Hodge.Ms Brennan insisted no decision to scrap the costly carrier conversion has been made. “I am genuinely assuring you that that process has not been completed,” she told the committee.Conversion of the ships to carry Lockheed Martin’s F35 C version of the Joint Strike Fighter would have allowed the UK to use its carriers in co-operation with the French and US navies. The FT reported earlier this month that senior government officials had told their French counterparts the aircraft carriers would not be reconfigured because the cost estimate of doing so had more than doubled.Nick Smith, Labour MP, said he felt the MoD was “fiddling around and burning £50 notes in massive buckets at the moment”. But Conservative MPs, including Richard Bacon and Stewart Jackson, were also deeply critical.The situation is particularly difficult for David Cameron, prime minister, because he categorically supported switching away from Labour’s plan to buy the F-35 B. Although this is a less powerful aircraft, it can land vertically and therefore does not need the carrier to be fitted with a catapult to launch it, and a trip wire to catch it.Mr Cameron is now widely expected to reverse the choice of fighter jet once again and return to Labour’s initial idea.Margaret Hodge, Labour MP and the PAC’s chair, said the indecision and lack of transparency on the issue called into question this government’s progress in ending the decades-long culture that left the MoD with a £38bn budget overhang.“It calls into question the ways decisions are taken and whether or not the changed culture, which we hoped we were seeing within the MoD, is in practice a reality or just a myth and a lot of words,” she said in closing the hearing.
224;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed fighter jet workers go on strike;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues, has been hit from two directions as workers at its Texas fighter jet facility went on strike and a spending watchdog urged Congress to cancel a key naval contract.Staff represented by a section of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Fort Worth at Lockheed’s Fort Worth plant took to the picket lines after voting against the company’s three-year contract proposals over the weekend.Union members are unhappy with clauses requiring them to contribute more to healthcare schemes and to accept different pension benefits for new recruits, despite an overall offer that includes a 3 per cent annual pay rise.The local IAM unit represents about 3,600 workers, many of whom work in assembling F-35 fighter jets. The plant employs about 14,000 workers in total.The stand-off also affects hundreds of Lockheed staff at two air force test sites.Bob Wood, an IAM spokesman, said the strike had hit workflow and said: “Nothing is happening in there.” But Lockheed insisted the company was well prepared and the plant remained open.Separately, the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog, urged leading congressional figures to scrap one strand of the controversial Littoral Combat Ship programme.The navy has made the LCS a cornerstone of its long-term shipbuilding plans and it could spend more than $37bn buying about 55 ships from two teams of suppliers, one led by Lockheed, the other by General Dynamics.Pogo said Navy papers showed Lockheed’s USS Freedom has had cracks and engine problems.“We recommend the more expensive and severely flawed Lockheed variant be eliminated,” it said.Lockheed said: “Reports cited by Pogo are based on selective information that is more than a year old”, adding that the purpose of testing a new class of ships was to reveal any problems. Lockheed said the project was on time and on budget.A Navy spokesman said the service was “reviewing the concerns mentioned” and that issues were not unexpected in a new class of ship and had been corrected. “We are fully confident that LCS 1 and the rest of the class will perform as designed,” he said.Lockheed reports results on Thursday and is already under intense scrutiny for its F-35 project, which has taken years longer than planned and cost more than estimated.
225;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-04-17T19:13:13Z;America: A workforce on the wane;As unemployment returns from high recessionary levels, it is becoming clear that millions in the US have left the jobs market;"A lot depends on what people such as Fred Knopsnyder, Sandy Brady and Leanne Wilson do next: the course of the world’s biggest economy, their own futures and – in strange and unexpected ways – the outcome of a presidential election.Mr Knopsnyder spent 33 years making pop-up camping trailers in Somerset, a town in the Laurel Highlands of Pennsylvania, population 78,000. He relates with engaging surprise the vicissitudes of what was to happen. “I learnt from watching the news. Real nice and warm in the house, and I’m drowsing and going to sleep, and my wife goes, ‘Honey, I don’t think you have a job any more’. I looked up,and she backed up the TV and played it again, and it just said, ‘Doors are closing’.”Ms Brady worked at the Fleetwood caravan plant too, for 40 years – 148 staff remained in the final days before operations ceased in January 2011. Ms Wilson was in management at Gilmour, a Somerset maker of garden hoses and sprinklers that closed its doors in 2009 with the loss of 330 jobs.It is nothing new when an out-of-town owner closes down a small slice of Americana. Gilmour is part of Robert Bosch, the German industrial group; Fleetwood was owned by Blackstreet Capital, a Maryland private equity firm that townsfolk say behaved disgracefully, giving no notice of the closure. Blackstreet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But as a small and relatively isolated labour market that suffered a painful shock during the recession that followed the financial crisis, Somerset may help to answer a crucial question about the US economy: why have people dropped out of the labour force and are they returning?There are about 5m more unemployed Americans today than at the start of 2008. They count as part of a workforce in which the unemployment rate stands at 8.2 per cent. But in that time labour force participation has also declined by two percentage points of the civilian adult population, equivalent to another 5m Americans who are not working, and not looking for work, but are doing something else. “Had the labour force participation rate not declined from around 66 per cent in mid-2008 to under 64 per cent in February, the unemployment rate would still be over 10 per cent,” William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a recent speech.Economists at the Fed and elsewhere tell three different stories about why this happened. The first is a sad one – that the recession left workers damaged and discouraged, sitting at home watching The Young and the Restless because their skills do not match today’s economy.The second is more cheerful. It says that those 5m workers want jobs, and are busily retraining, but they are not bothering to look actively at the moment because the economy is still too weak. When it heals, they will come back into the labour force.Story three says the decline was written in the stars because 2008 was 62 years after 1946 and hence the first year that the baby boom generation could retire on Social Security, the federal retirement benefit. Rather than the recession, it was because of ageing – and thus the only people in today’s economy who need jobs are those defined as unemployed.All this matters because labour participation is the hidden force behind the unemployment rate. If people return to the labour market it will keep the unemployment rate up and wage inflation down. That makes story two best for the US economy in the long run, because it implies the largest future labour force along with low inflation that lets the Fed keep interest rates down. Story three is worst because it suggests the opposite. Explanation one implies less economic capacity in the short term, and much heartache for the workers affected, but means that participation could recover over time.Up in western Pennsylvania, the best evidence of hard-to-heal labour dislocation is at the Somerset County Workshop, a vocational facility for workers with disabilities that got much of its work from Gilmour and Fleetwood. “It was devastating, because those were the two contracts that we had,” says Cathie Beal, the workshop supervisor.Ms Beal and her colleague Jackie O’Connor, the workshop director, have started a catering business, tried making blankets and school scarves, and won some orders from the toy company Poof-Slinky, but it is hard to find enough to keep their worker-customers busy. “If they don’t come here and make a pay cheque of any kind, they miss work, and what happens? Their disability cheques go up,” says Ms O’Connor.But the aggregate figures in Somerset belie the idea that most workers have given up, even though the average age of workers at Fleetwood was 53 and at Gilmour in the mid-40s,suggesting instead a more fluid picture of people moving into and out of jobs and training. That fits with a host of economic studies that have struggled to find much “mismatch” in the US labour market.Of the 275 staff from Gilmour attached to a petition for trade adjustment assistance, 96 went into training, of whom 21 are still in school. A further 105 are working, 25 have retired, a couple are on disability benefits and three left the area. Cathy Lilly, the redoubtable local employment chief, estimates that many of those unaccounted for are younger and likely to be in work, although others are doubtless unemployed. The figures are broadly similar at Fleetwood although with more retirements.“I’m taking [diploma] classes and I’m hoping to pass them so I can get on with my life,” says Ms Brady. “I don’t have a husband …I’d like to be back in the working world, I’d love to go to the bank every Friday and get my cheque.”For her part, Ms Wilson had begun studies to be a registered nurse before Gilmour closed. She will graduate soon. For Ms Brady and Mr Knopsnyder, who is finishing up a welding course, matters are trickier because they are dependent on the local economy to create enough jobs. Some workers from the two plants went into the local coal industry, which enjoyed a mini-boom but is now struggling against cheap shale gas. Others found work with Lockheed Martin in nearby Johnstown. But the overall unemployment rate in Somerset county is a higher-than-average 9.2 per cent and the area would benefit from a further economic stimulus.In recent months, though, the third story about demographic change has gained ground. The only way to address it is with a model that compares the decline in labour participation against some kind of trend. Dean Maki of Barclays Capital is one economist who has done so. “Our analysis indicates that the single biggest factor dragging the labour force participation rate down has been the retirements of the baby-boomers,” he says.Of a 2.8 percentage point fall in labour force participation since 2002, Mr Maki estimates that 1.6 points are due to demographics and only 0.9 points to the economic cycle. As the demographic decline will continue at 0.3-0.4 points a year, his calculations suggest all of the “cyclical” decline could be gone within a couple of years if only modest numbers return to work.Before the latest recession, labour economics was a rather unfashionable branch of the profession – taken up with arguments about minimum wages and the merits of tax credits in encouraging people to work.With the return of mass unemployment, however, the speciality has taken centre stage. One of its leading lights – Alan Krueger of Princeton University – is a senior adviser to President Barack Obama and labour economists are in demand across the Federal Reserve, the US central bank.A particular question at the Fed is “Okun’s law”, which has recently been behaving less like a law and more like the rule of thumb that it is. Okun’s law says that for a 1 percentage point fall in unemployment, the economy must grow by 2 percentage points above its long-run average. Over the last year, however, unemployment is down by a percentage point while measured growth in the economy has barely matched its trend rate.Labour force participation goes to the heart of the internal Fed debate about what is going on. “A story centred on potential workers dropping out of the labour force might seem in line with the low level of the labour force participation rate,” Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, said recently. “But other data cast doubt on that idea.” The number of workers who want a job but are not looking for one is also falling, he pointed out.That millions more Americans are willing and able to work provided the economy creates demand for their labour remains the dominant view within the Fed. But a few officials are starting to wonder whether the decline in unemployment, combined with low participation rates, may mean that the potential labour force is smaller than they previously thought.That is another reason for caution about the likelihood of more monetary stimulus such as a third round of quantitative easing – the much mooted QE3.“To the extent this trend is not fully recognised by the Fed, it does raise the risk of greater wage and price inflation sooner than the Fed expects,” says Mr Maki. “The other implication for policy makers is that potential growth in GDP is a lot weaker – we’d put it no higher than 2 per cent – and so budget forecasts are for too rosy a picture.”Others who have done similar work do not find such large declines. A recent Chicago Fed paper puts the demographic element at a quarter of the total drop and the Congressional Budget Office also projects a slower pace of demographic decline. Much depends on assumptions about whether more of the elderly will choose to work. But Mr Maki points to a sharp rise in workers receiving Social Security and to the numbers aged 55-plus who are not in the labour force and say they do not want a job.David Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley adds another element: he estimates that 0.3 percentage points of the decline in participation is because unemployed workers have moved on to disability benefits. It is hard to become certified as disabled and, once on the benefit, few workers go back. “There has been a large increase in the number of long-term unemployed and many of these people will have a difficult time reattaching to the labour market,” says Mr Greenlaw. “It seems that many of them are shifting from unemployment benefits to disability insurance benefits.”Difficult though the balance is to judge, a chunk of the lack of participation is likely to be demographic and a chunk due to lack of demand. Either way, it will affect the election.Ten months ago, Rick Santorum stood on the steps that lead up to Somerset’s grand, century-old courthouse and launched his campaign to be president. Mr Santorum’s bid for the Republican nomination ended last week, partly because his pledge to revive US manufacturing was inaudible above the abortion, contraception and gay marriage debates for which he is better known.That leaves Mitt Romney to take on Mr Obama in an election about the economy. Participation in the labour force will decide the unemployment rate on election day, assuming a moderate growth in jobs. But as Matt McDonald at Hamilton Place Strategies, a Washington policy consultancy, and a veteran of John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign points out, the actual rate matters less than which of the three stories is true. “People don’t make voting decisions based on the statistics; the statistics are our insight into the reality that people are voting on,” he says.With story one, of labour discouragement, participation stays low and unemployment falls but the economy still feels miserable. “If the unemployment rate goes down because the economy is doing badly and labour force participation falls, then does it matter?” asks Mr McDonald. “The economy is still doing badly.”Story two, although best for the long-term health of the US economy, could be even worse for Mr Obama. Participation recovers as people such as Mr Knopsnyder and Ms Brady return to the workforce, but that stops the unemployment rate going down or even pushes it back up again, making it hard for the incumbent to argue that things are getting better.Perversely, the worst news for the US in the long run could help Mr Obama the most. If story three is correct, and demographics dominate, participation will stay low and the unemployment rate will decline. A smaller workforce will mean a smaller economy. But in the short term it means fewer people to find jobs for before the labour market tightens, pushing up wages and making people feel better."
226;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-04-10T17:07:37Z;Japan and UK plan joint defence programme;;Japan and the UK have announced plans to launch “as soon as possible” a programme of joint military equipment development, a move that would mark a tightening of defence ties between the two island powers.The agreement – reached after a meeting on Tuesday between Yoshihiko Noda, Japan’s prime minister, and David Cameron, his visiting UK counterpart – comes after Tokyo last year eased long-standing curbs on arms exports.Successful co-operation with UK defence companies would ease Japan’s reliance on the US for advanced weapons systems and could open new international markets to Japanese manufacturers that have long struggled to make a profit in the limited domestic market.Such a deal would also come as some comfort for UK officials and executives disappointed by Tokyo’s decision last year to buy a squadron of F-35 stealth fighters made by Lockheed Martin, the US contractor. London had lobbied hard for Japan to choose the cheaper Eurofighter Typhoon, which is made by a consortium of European defence companies led in Japan by the UK’s BAE Systems.Noriyuki Shikata, a representative of Japan’s prime minister’s office, said details of what kind of defence equipment would be jointly developed had yet to be settled, but that the two countries aimed to launch a programme “in months”.“To my knowledge this is our first such agreement with a country other than the United States,” Mr Shikata said.The UK played a key role in supporting Japan’s emergence as a military power following the toppling of the Tokugawa shogunate in the 19th century, and the two countries were formal allies between 1902 and 1923.However, following defeat in the second world war, the Japanese defence industry co-operation has been limited almost exclusively to its current ally, the US.In a joint statement, Mr Cameron and Mr Noda said the two nations would begin a new strategic dialogue and would identify a range of possible defence equipment that could be jointly developed.“We have decided . . . to seek to launch at least one programme of such defence equipment as soon as possible and explore the feasibility of a future major programme that will also contribute to both our countries’ security,” they said.The meeting highlighted the generally warm ties between Tokyo and London, with the two sides identifying each other as their “most important partners” in their respective regions of Europe and Asia.Mr Cameron stressed UK support for the launch of formal talks this year on a trade agreement between Japan and the EU, although the UK prime minister has also been quoted as saying Tokyo needs to do more to reassure European companies that it is ensuring its markets are genuinely open.
227;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-03-22T16:27:07Z;What the Board Needs to Know About IT Risks;;It’s probably happened to most boards: there’s a newsworthy IT failure at a competitor and someone on the board asks, “could that happen here?”In 2010, a cyber attack on NASDAQ’s Directors Desk service which was used by thousands of corporate directors brought IT risks literally into the boardroom. The National Security Agency investigated, and the full impact is still not publicly known. In fact it took five months to report it to the public – how many directors’ communications were compromised in the meantime, and to whom?In 2011, two more highly public incidents raised the profile of IT risks. The first in March 2011 was at RSA, the IT security company. in which hackers obtained information about RSA SecurID tokens which are used by RSA’s customers’ employees to log in to their computers. The full impact of this hack became apparent when Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, reported that a cyber attack on its information systems was linked to the RSA hack.The second was a hack of the Sony Playstation Network in which the attackers made off with customer information, including credit card data. In response, Sony shutdown the network for a month until it had put in place better security. The outage cost an estimated $10m a day.These three attacks underscore a key principle for boards: IT risks are business risks. Poorly managed, they can and will exceed corporate risk tolerances.Okay, if IT risks are business risks, then the board needs to be more engaged in IT risk oversight. In most companies, the person to answer the board’s questions about IT risks would be the chief information officer. So what’s the CIO’s name? If you’re stumped, it’s time to find out.The CIO should be speaking to the audit committee, typically quarterly, and to the full board at least annually on risk management initiatives. That way when an incident does occur, and it will, the CIO and the board already have a foundation for communicating about it.While it helps to have someone on the board who understands IT, for effective IT risk oversight, most corporate directors don’t need to know geek-speak. Rather the CIO should speak of IT risks in terms of their business impact. “My people are working overtime to patch security vulnerabilities” is not, at face value, a board-level issue. But the same problem phrased in a different way: “Our competitors are beating us to market because it takes too long to fix security in our new products” clearly is a board-level issue.IT risks are also regulatory risks. Within the last year, the US federal Trade Commission has mandated that both Google and Facebook have biennial privacy audits for the next 20 years. In March 2011, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first fine under HIPAA, a $4.3m levy against a Maryland health care provider.In Europe, the European Commission is finalising a proposal that could impose huge fines of up to 5 per cent of global sales revenue on a company that mishandles supplier, customer, or employee data. Now it may be that such an egregiously punitive penalty is not likely to become law, but is it any comfort that regulators in Brussels see it as a reasonable proposal? With greater regulatory scrutiny, data breaches are no longer an embarrassment, they are potentially deadly to a company’s business strategy.Besides privacy and data protection, which tend to fall directly in the IT organisation’s purview, new business regulations also have a big impact on IT systems. Dodd-Frank, Solvency II, Basel III, and the UK Bribery Act all have big IT compliance implications – changes to how data is managed, systems configured, reporting, and policies. Regulatory change management is a consultants and lawyers bonanza! To deal with it, companies need a “weather bureau” that tracks regulatory developments. That may be a formal function in large, highly regulated multi-nationals, or an informal function within the legal or public affairs department in other companies.Keeping up with compliance is not the same as having good risk management practices though. Most regulations that have an IT impact are targeted at specific types of data or systems – for instance health records, credit card data, employee records, financial systems, or IT systems that operate critical infrastructure like the electrical grid. Audits to ensure compliance will be tightly focused on the information and IT system assets affected by specific regulations, and many IT vulnerabilities will be outside the scope of the audits.These audits also tend to be a snapshot of compliance at the time of the audit, and IT systems undergo frequent change. Effective IT risk management therefore requires a program of continuous monitoring, and corporate directors who are most directly involved in IT risk oversight should focus on the effectiveness of risk management program, not just audit results.IT risk exposure extends to business partners too. Your company has some level of exposure to the risks to which each of your partners are exposed. Now take partner risk exposure into the cloud, and suddenly it’s a lot harder to assess reliability, continuity and compliance than it is to evaluate those criteria with traditional IT services. Furthermore, as each of your business units engages cloud based services on its own, the number of cloud vendors multiplies rapidly. And each cloud vendor in turn has dependencies with other business partners.When a cloud service is disrupted, the disruption has ripple effects that propagate out to other companies that may even just be loosely, not even directly, dependent upon it. For instance, the Sony Playstation hack affected not just Sony, but also partners like Hulu and Netflix. To ensure that business dependencies are well understood and that the impact of vendor IT risks on overall enterprise risks are well understood, board-level risk oversight should extend to the vendor management program.Besides the cloud, social technologies are another source of IT risks – which, remember, are business risks. The growing use of social media and social collaboration make geographic and corporate boundaries amorphous, and increases the influence of nonfinancial stakeholders on corporate strategic goals and objectives. Consider the case of Petland. On July 28, 2009, a Petland employee at an Akron, Ohio store posted a photo on her Facebook pages showing grinning and holding two sopping wet dead rabbits. The photo went viral, PETA got involved and used social media in its call for action. To stem the crisis, only a week after the photo was posted on Facebook, Petland closed the store.A professional risk analyst would have calculated the loss of two rabbits as well within the corporate risk tolerance, but social media amplified those risks many times over. With wide adoption of social media, any enterprise risk can be a social risk if there are public expectations for how you will manage it. In this environment, it’s important to ensure that social risk assessments are incorporated into strategic planning and enterprise risk management, and that the company is proactively monitoring its reputation – and guess what, there are IT solutions to help with that.In fact, there are IT solutions to manage many business risks, and not just IT risks. A whole new category of software called GRC, for governance, risk and compliance, helps to automate risk management and compliance programs and enable continuous risk monitoring. It’s worth noting though that ten years after Sarbanes-Oxley, boards are getting weary of investing in solutions that may make auditors and regulators happier, but don’t seem to impact the bottom line. Therefore, it’s important for CIOs to identify to the board the business outcomes of GRC investments — for example, “reduce threats to reputation caused by loss of personal data” or “reduce chances of a restatement by automating controls in the close process.”Finally, boards should consider IT risk management as a value contributor, not just a cost of doing business. Risk value management is a term coined by Gartner to describe a discipline for treating key risk indicators as leading indicators of business performance. By linking key risk indicators to key performance indicators, businesses can use their risk monitoring to avoid disruptions to business objectives. And “Could that happen here?” becomes “How’s it help our business strategy?”
228;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-03-20T21:26:37Z;UK fighter choice risks French entente;;David Cameron’s widely expected volte-face on which fighter jet Britain should buy threatens to undermine his much-vaunted defence partnership with France.Politicians and military analysts say the U-turn would put in peril the ability of both nations to project the power that comes with having an aircraft carrier able to travel anywhere at any time.The government is due to disclose which version of the Joint Strike Fighter– the B or the C variant – it intends to buy before Easter but is widely though to have already decided that its current choice, which would require a retrofit of Britain’s aircraft carrier, could prove more expensive than predicted and would therefore be unworkable.Mr Cameron first changed the UK’s order 18 months ago in the Strategic Defence and Security Review, switching to the C variant from Labour’s original decision to go with the B variant. The review made clear that the switch was driven in large part by the need for the UK’s carriers to be able to accommodate the fighter jets of allied nations, in particular the US and France.The expected decision to shift back to buying the original choice – Lockheed Martin’s F-35 B variant, prized for its ability to land vertically but less interoperable with French and US carriers – is being closely watched by the French government. The concern in Paris is that France and Britain will be unable to share carriers.Etienne de Durand, an analyst at Institut français des relations internationales, the French think-tank, said the British U-turn was being taken in France as a sign of fickleness. “It is very hard to trust the British,” he said.He warned that French and UK naval credibility was at stake and noted that, given the budget squeeze caused by the economic downturn, the choice for the two countries’ military capabilities was simple: either share it or lose it.To share carriers so that one can be used when the other is undergoing the frequent repair and retrofit breaks to which carriers are subject, the UK would have to choose a jet and carrier programme that allowed conventional fighter jets to land on its deck.Douglas Barrie, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “If the UK moved back to the B version, with the design implications for the carrier it would mean that French navy Rafale fighter aircraft would not be able to land or take off from the British ship.” Many long-range US fighters jets would also be precluded.Mr Cameron made exactly this point when he changed the UK’s order the first time, in the Strategic Defence and Security Review released in late 2010. Mr Cameron overturned Labour’s decision to go with the B variant, announcing that the UK would buy the C variant and that its carrier would be retrofitted with a catapult and the cable arresting gear so it could carry French and US aircraft.He argued that it was also necessary to ensure the UK had round-the-clock carrier capability and the chance to join the multinational military operations of the future.The SDSR said: “A single carrier needs to be fully effective. As currently designed, the Queen Elizabeth [Britain’s new carrier] will not be fully interoperable with key allies, since their naval jets could not land on it.“Pursuit of closer partnership is a core strategic principle for the Strategic Defence and Security Review because it is clear that the UK will in most circumstances act militarily as part of a wider coalition. We will therefore install catapult and arrestor gear.”It went on to say: “This should both ensure continuous carrier-strike availability and reduce the overall carrier protection requirements on the rest of the fleet.”General Charles Wald, former deputy commander of US European Command, said Britain faced an unfortunate challenge with its carrier decision. “It’s all about force projection and presence. If you don’t have the ability to put your military out wherever you need to project it, whether it be Asia or off the coast of India or the Middle East, you give up a lot from a nation,” he said.
229;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-03-12T21:15:12Z;Cost fears cause MoD rethink on fighter jets;;"Ministers are considering another U-turn in the long-running debate over which model of the F35 Joint Strike Fighter the UK should buy, threatening further disruption to a project which has been dogged by indecision and cost escalation.The defence ministry will decide as early as the end of this month whether to switch back to the F35-B, which needs only a short runway to take off and can land vertically, 18 months after ditching the model in favour of a “more capable, less expensive” alternative.The government changed its order to the C-variant of the fighter jet, which needs a catapult to take off from aircraft carriers and a wire trap to land, in its 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. At the time, it argued the model was 25 per cent cheaper than the alternative.However, the defence ministry has now concluded the F35-C would be more costly than anticipated and is once again reconsidering its decision.The review marks the latest in a series of hold-ups and uncertainties surrounding the procurement of Britain’s next generation of fighter jets and the aircraft carriers that are supposed to carry them.Douglas Barrie, analyst at the Institute for International Strategic Studies, the think tank, said a switch back to the F35-B “would present some interesting presentational issues” for the government having portrayed the C-variant as more cost-effective.● 1998 Labour commits to replacing three aircraft carriers with two larger, more versatile ones, capable of carrying a more powerful force and including a replacement for the Harrier jets. The project is due to start in 2012.● 2002 MoD selects the short take-off and vertical landing version of Lockheed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter as its preferred aircraft to replace the Harrier.● 2008 The department signs the contract to build the carriers, aware that it needs to find an extra £234m to do so. Officials say they can find the shortfall from savings to existing projects, but the costs later balloon by £1.6bn and the project is delayed by two years.● 2010 The new coalition government opts to change the type of jet on board the aircraft carrier from the Stovl F-35B to the “cat-and-trap” version (F-35C), which catapults aircraft on take-off and catches them on landing. This is to make sure UK jets are the same as US ones, so they can use each other’s carriers. Resulting delays mean the carriers could be without jets for at least five years.● 2012 Ministers review the decisions they made two years ago, amid fears the cat-and-trap system
will prove more expensive than first calculated. Failed tests to the “trapping” element show the project could be lengthier and more complex than previously thought. A decision is expected by the end of the month.Kiran StaceyDavid Cameron, prime minister, criticised the previous Labour government for choosing the Stovl F-35B and said the C-variant would allow more interoperability with allies and was “more capable, less expensive, has a longer range and can carry more weapons”.But for the F35-C to take off and land, the deck of Britain’s two new aircraft carriers – currently under construction by BAE Systems and partners – would have to be fitted with a catapult and arrestor wire, known as a “cat and trap”.More than a year after publication of its strategic review, the government has realised that installing the system would be technically more demanding and 2-3 times as costly as initially estimated.The defence ministry on Monday said it was reviewing all procurement programmes as part of its 2012-13 budget process. This included “elements of the carrier strike programme, to validate costs and ensure risks are properly managed”.It said Philip Hammond, defence secretary, “expects to announce the outcome of this process to parliament before Easter”.The UK was already facing a capability gap of at least five years when its new aircraft carriers would not have any aircraft to carry because of delays to the F35, which is manufactured by a consortium led by Lockheed Martin of the US.Pentagon tests of the C-variant has found several serious flaws, including that the hook to catch the wire upon landing was too close to the aircraft’s wheels.Britain’s indecision comes at an awkward moment. The first F35, a B-variant, made for the UK has already rolled off its Texas assembly line and is being tested by a British pilot. The defence ministry is due to take possession of it this spring. Meanwhile, other governments, including Italy and the US, have either cut or delayed the number of F35 they will buy due to cost pressures. That will drive the individual costs up for all countries involved. The UK was due to take 138 planes, but many analysts expect it to halve its order after signalling in its strategic review that it would reduce the number."
230;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-03-11T17:24:52Z;Defence groups move to cybersecurity;;The end of a decade of war and prosperity is proving transformative for the weapons trade as cash-strapped governments are cutting military budgets while defence contractors are shedding jobs and warning of shrinking revenues.So it is with fortuitous timing – at least for defence companies – that a new enemy is emerging on the world’s stage.Cyber attacks by well-resourced, highly capable and relentless, usually state-sponsored attackers – so called advanced persistent threats – are growing.The best known example is Stuxnet, which was aimed at Iran’s nuclear centrifuges and is widely believed to have been developed by the US or Israel, neither of which have confirmed their involvement.But dozens of similarly specifically targeted attacks have infiltrated the systems of a growing number of government agencies and companies, including defence contractors Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and L-3 Communications, and natural resource companies, such as BHP Billiton.The F-35 jet fighter programme was infiltrated in 2009. Defence contractors, including BAE Systems, say they are targets of constant attacks and, in fact, use that as a marketing point when selling their cyberdefence services.Collecting precise data on such attacks is difficult because governments and companies are reticent to admit they have been compromised.Financial regulators have yet to force companies to disclose their vulnerabilities despite their huge potential financial and reputational harm.“Never before has there been such a time in IT where there was such pressure to adopt new technology practices whilst trying to deal with such a significantly sized security issue,” James Lyne, director of technology strategy at Sophos, the UK’s largest cyber security company, said in a recent speech.China is seen as the major sponsor of high-level cybercrime involving the theft of sensitive commercial and government information. Last week a US Congressional report by Northrop Grumman, the defence contractor, noted China’s cyber prowess also posed a military threat.Jamie Shea, Nato’s deputy assistant secretary-general for emerging security challenges, said: “Clearly in the future all conflicts are going to involve people trying to disrupt the information technology systems, which are not only necessary for communication, but also for the operation of highly sophisticated weapons systems, most of which these days are computer driven.”To address that new frontier, Nato last week signed one of the most ambitious cyberdefence contracts ever to secure its network across 50 sites and 28 member countries.Robert Lentz, former deputy US assistant secretary of defense for cyber, identity and information assurance, says defence companies’ access to sensitive contracts such as that of Nato – won by Finmeccanica and Northrop Grumman – gives them a vaunted position in a market that is growing in the public and private sector.“Defence ministries are the pacesetters to implement the visions and showcase capabilities that work,” he says. “Often times they can become the trusted adviser of the entire public sector and then at the same time the public sector and the critical infrastructure sectors are communicating and collaborating more than they ever have.”By now almost all the major defence contractors have a cyber element.Much of the mergers and acquisitions activity over recent years has involved defence companies buying knowhow or the access to new markets. Jane’s Defence calculates that about 14 per cent of defence acquisitions had cyber as their target last year.In Europe, BAE Systems, Ultra Electronics and Qinetiq have the highest cyber exposure but for most of the group the per cent of revenue they get from cyber remains solidly in the low single-digits.As their understanding of the market matures, defence companies are beginning to specialise their offering and spread out from their traditional defence customers to other government departments and industry.Nevertheless, cyber is not the cure for all the defence companies’ traditional ills.Even Lawrence Prior, executive vice-president at BAE, cautions against breathless excitement.“There is so much hyperbole around the market. It’s a good market. There’s real growth. But it’s high single-digit, low double-digit growth depending on how you segment the market. It’s not triple-digits growth. This isn’t venture-backed, light-your-hair-on-fire growth.”Meanwhile, cyber margins are usually well below those companies make for building and servicing defence equipment and parts.To improve on them, companies such as BAE’s Detica are moving increasingly into offering products, rather than acting largely as consultants.In doing so, they will have to adapt to a faster moving, more dynamic business than they are used to, says William Beer, PwC’s director of the information and cybersecurity practice.But, he added: “If they [defence contractors] make the jump into the private sector, they stand a good chance of shaking things up and really, really enhancing everything we do.”
231;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-02-20T17:14:07Z;Pentagon cuts could cost US more money;;The Pentagon, under pressure to slash spending, plans to slow down purchases of fighter jets, submarines and other expensive projects in order to trim billions of dollars from its budget.But military officials and defence industry executives warn that these moves, while saving cash in the near-term, could end up costing more over time.As part of the 2013 fiscal year budget request released last week, the US defence department proposed to delay many expensive procurement programmes and postpone some construction projects.This should produce about $38bn in savings for the Pentagon over the next five years – or about 15 per cent of the $259bn in budget cuts that it has pledged to make through to the end of the 2017 fiscal year as part of broader efforts to reduce the federal deficit.But the Pentagon still plans to purchase much of the delayed equipment, pushing the costs out into the future and ultimately saving far less than advertised, if anything at all.These tactics could end up creating new headaches. Under the Budget Control Act, the Pentagon must cut almost $500bn over the next 10 years, so deferring expenses for five years may require bigger cuts later on.The Pentagon’s budget travails are likely to worsen. After a decade-long boom in defence spending, which swelled as the US fought simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the defence department has found itself squarely in the line of fire as Washington wrestles over ways to reduce the national debt.The Pentagon is faced with having to cut an extra $600bn following last summer’s failure by a Congressional “super committee” to agree a debt ­reduction deal. Leon Panetta, the defence secretary, has described a reduction of that size as potentially catastrophic.Still, experts argue that while delays may help save important equipment programmes from termination, the moves may add to overall costs. Keeping industry and government teams working on projects, but at a slower pace, soaks up cash. So does maintaining older equipment until new kit is ready.Calculating the additional costs is complex but they could be substantial. A UK Ministry of Defence report argued in 2009 that constant deferrals in its £6bn annual equipment budget led to between £920m and £2.2bn a year in extra costs for government and industry.The US Government Accountability Office found in a report in 1997 that stretching out production in 17 major projects added more than $10bn to their total costs.In the latest US reprogramming, the Pentagon plans to save $15.1bn up to September 2017 by deferring the purchase of 179 F-35 fighter jets, $4.3bn from delaying development of nuclear submarines and billions more from postponed building projects.The cost of the F-35s will rise as a result of the deferrals, according to Tom Burbage, director of the programme for Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor. The programme is already years behind schedule and over budget.The delay “will raise the overall average cost of the total procurement of all the airplanes bought”, Mr Burbage said. “It just changes the dynamics of the cost equation.”Robert Hale, comptroller for the defence department, acknowledged last week that “some of the stretch-outs will result in some higher unit costs”.“If we had our way, we probably wouldn’t have done it,” he said. “But I’d start from the initial premise: Congress passed the Budget Control Act, we have to be consistent with …that act. So we had to make these changes.”Budget ruses are a time-honoured tradition for departments under pressure. In the current round of cuts perhaps the most striking scheme is the broad practice of counting reductions from notional planned spending increases as real savings.Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Center for Defence Information, likens the Pentagon’s logic to arguing “last year I planned to win the lottery. I didn’t, ergo, my flat salary this year means a gigantic pay cut.”If the Pentagon’s fuzzy math is ignored the effect is dramatic. For example, the department claims it will cut base spending by $45bn in fiscal year 2013 compared to its 2012 plans but measured against its approved 2012 budget it will lose only $5bn.
232;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-02-15T17:41:58Z;Italy to cut Joint Strike Fighter orders;;Italy intends to slash its planned orders of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as part of austerity-imposed defence cuts that deal another blow to Lockheed Martin’s troubled fighter jet programme.Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola, defence minister, told parliament on Wednesday that Italy would reduce its purchases to 90 aircraft from the 131 ordered in 2002 at an original cost of €15bn.The planned acquisitions had come under attack from various quarters in Italy, particularly the Catholic church. The defence cuts underline the commitment to austerity of the technocratic government which on Tuesday blocked Rome’s bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games.Italy’s reduction in orders follows defence cuts announced by the US this week, including the postponement of 179 F-35s at a saving of $15.1bn.The JSF is under fire in the US. John McCain, Republican senator, called it “a scandal and a tragedy” in a speech two months ago, warning that it could turn out to be the “most expensive weapons program in history”. Estimated costs per aircraft had more than doubled since 2001 and the most advanced phase of flight testing would not begin before 2015, he said.Italy has already spent €2.5bn on developing the JSF as one of nine partners in the project, and stands to benefit from assembling and maintaining some of the aircraft at a plant in Cameri. Having recently built a second aircraft carrier, the Cavour, the navy needs the short take-off variant of the F-35 to replace its ageing Harrier jump-jets.Other JSF partners are also rethinking their purchases. The UK, the second largest contributor after the US, has said it would wait until 2015 to makes its decision on numbers. Postponements and reductions in orders would drive up the price tag per aircraft, Pentagon and Lockheed officials were quoted as saying on Tuesday.Lockheed Martin’s partners in the JSF include Northrop Grumman, United Technologies’s Pratt & Whitney, BAE of the UK and Italy’s Finmeccanica.Admiral Di Paola said that over a decade Italy would reduce its military headcount to about 150,000 from 183,000 and its civilian staff to 20,000 from 30,000.
233;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-02-08T09:09:35Z;US Ex-Im Bank: expanding in Vietnam;;"Vietnam needs to invest in infrastructure if it is to grow in a more balanced fashion. But potential funding sources have been drying up because of the global downturn, Vietnam’s own financial problems and its decreasing access to development bank loans now that it’s become a lower-middle income country.Enter the Export-Import Bank of the United States (US Ex-Im Bank). The government agency, which provides credit to support American exports, is boosting efforts to help fill the gap and support business for US companies such as GE and Lockheed Martin, which are trying to sell to Vietnam.US Ex-Im Bank has picked out Vietnam as one of nine key emerging markets that it will focus on to boost American exports and support job creation (the others are Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, South Africa, Nigeria, India and Indonesia).On a mission to Vietnam to accelerate discussions about possible financing for $2bn of infrastructure projects, Fred Hochberg chairman of US Ex-Im Bank, said that such investments were “critical” if Vietnam was to tame soaring inflation and continue growing at 6 per cent or more per annum.Investing in new power plants and other infrastructure is “one of the key ways to tame inflation on a long term basis” and ensure that “goods get to market on time and produce doesn’t spoil,” he told beyondbrics.Many Western infrastructure investors are interested in Vietnam but they face stiff competition from Chinese companies, who are often cheaper and benefit from very favourable state financing, and Japanese companies, who are often the direct beneficiaries of Japanese government aid to Vietnam.But Hochberg insists that US companies can go “toe-to-toe” with other manufacturers.“Increasingly when I talk to buyers, they recognise American quality, innovation, service and delivery schedules,” he said. “We stand ready to make sure that financing does not tilt the decision making process [against American companies.]”In meetings with senior Vietnamese officials, Hochberg said he would try to advance financing talks on a number of specific investments, including a satellite project involving Lockheed Martin and power plant developments that have attracted the interest of General Electric and Black & Veatch.Although there is much in the pipeline for US Ex-Im Bank in Vietnam, Hochberg conceded that progress will be steady rather than spectacular.The bank’s current exposure to Vietnam is just $175.8m and it authorised only $1m of financing to Vietnam last year.“This is a challenging market to penetrate,” he said. “Total US exports to Vietnam are in the [annual] $4bn range. Considering the size of this economy and the size of the population, that’s still a rather light footprint.”But he said the US was keen to deepen trade with Vietnam, a mission that fits with the broader US strategic shift back to Asia:There is a great strategic alliance between the US and Vietnam at the government level and at the people level. What we’re trying to do is foster that at the commercial level.Related Reading

234;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-02-05T16:34:20Z;Pension liabilities to hit earnings of US blue-chips;;US blue-chip companies face a hit to earnings from greater pension contributions, with charges related to rising liabilities pushing groups such as Verizon and US Steel into losses during the fourth quarter.The funding gap for pension plans of S&P 500 companies almost doubled in 2011, analysts say, to around $450bn, as bond yields dropped, causing the size of future liabilities to grow. Stock market performance has also failed to keep up with rising liabilities.“In addition to higher contributions this year, it looks like pension funding may become more of an ongoing drain on cash than it has been in the past,” said David Zion, head of accounting research for Credit Suisse. He estimates that S&P 500 companies will have to contribute $90bn to their pension plans in 2012, a rise of 74 per cent on planned contributions for 2011.The bank has identified seven companies where pension contributions are estimated to be more than half of average annual cash flow from operations over the past five years: AK Steel, Goodyear Tire, Weyerhaeuser, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and US Steel.In the current earnings season, four companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have said that pension contributions will be at least triple those made in 2011, with large industrial companies that have a history of generous benefits and shrinking workforces particularly affected.Boeing’s workforce, for example, has shrunk from around 238,000 in 1998 to under 162,000. The aerospace company has an almost fully funded pension plan, but will make a $1.5bn contribution this year, as a matter of prudence, after not adding cash to the plan for two years. Pension expense will eat into 2012 earnings by around $2.21 per share, bringing expected profits down by a third.Last month Verizon said that its 2012 cash contribution will be an all-time high of $1.3bn. Alcoa expects to make a record cash contribution of $650m in 2012. Its 2011 contribution of almost $1bn was higher, but the aluminium manufacturer provided $600m of that total in the company’s own stock. Honeywell expects to contribute up to $1bn this year, following a $1.65bn contribution in 2011.Some argue pension underfunding and the requirement to increase contributions are a temporary result of artificially low rates. “Any time you evaluate a long-term obligation like a pension with a snapshot point in time you will get a skewed and very misleading picture – either positively or negatively,” said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which represents corporate plan sponsors.But others say greater transparency and focus on corporate pensions is long overdue.“If you go back a few years, most US large-caps did not spend much time discussing pension costs in earnings releases,” said Jonathan Barry, a partner in the retirement risk practice at Mercer, “I think investors and the market in general are now more attuned to deficits when assessing a company’s financials.”Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman
235;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-02-01T17:46:00Z;Dassault deal: a double-edged sword;The move to supply fighter jets to India could delay much-neededconsolidation;"Few commercial contracts flatter to deceive the way defence contracts do. India’s decision to select Dassault Aviation for exclusive talks on a $15bn-$20bn fighter jet order is a case in point. It may well be a bonanza for the French defence sector. The problem is that the deal (which is not final but is Dassault’s to lose) is likely to delay the development the sector really needs – consolidation.The US and UK defence sectors, with their histories of cost overruns, are hardly models of value. But they have consolidated around one or two core champions: Lockheed Martin and Boeing in the US and BAE Systems in the UK. That offers scope for cost savings. France’s defence sector is rife with cost duplication, however, despite the best efforts of the government to encourage consolidation and co-operation.The India contract keeps alive the business case for the Rafale fighter jet. So far, its only customer is the French air force; even Switzerland rejected it last year. So an Indian victory could be game-changing for Dassault. As the core manufacturer, it should reap a majority of the value from the contract (60 per cent, according to Deutsche Bank estimates). Thales, which supplies the Rafale with avionics (and in which Dassault owns a 26 per cent stake), and Safran, which makes the engines, should benefit, too.Dassault has secured pole position by being cheaper than the rival Typhoon offered by the EADS-led Eurofighter consortium. So margins may be thin. EADS also owns 46 per cent of Dassault Aviation, yet it was competing for the same contract. That is the type of cost duplication that should drive increasingly cost-conscious defence ministries and investors mad. Armed with bragging rights from India, however, Serge Dassault, patriarch of the family at the centre of the French defence industry, has less incentive than ever to want to address it.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
236;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-02-01T14:47:02Z;US defence cuts sink Northrop outlook;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, on Wednesday reported another drop in quarterly sales, reduced its estimated order backlog and forecast lower than expected earnings for 2012, pointing to continued US government spending restraints.For the three months to the end of December, revenues slipped to $6.5bn from $6.8bn in the same period a year earlier. Over the full year, sales dropped about 6 per cent to about $26.4bn.Between the end of December 2010 and the end of December 2011, Northrop’s order backlog dropped from $46.8bn to $39.5bn, as it adjusted its order measurement criteria to acknowledge that certain expected sales would not now occur.In recent years, defence contractors such as Northrop and Lockheed Martin have been struggling to cope with an increasingly tough market as their largest customer, the US defence department, cuts its spending in order to help bring down the US budget deficit.Last week, the Pentagon gave its first detailed insights into how it intends to trim about $500bn from its budget plans over the next decade, indicating that it would cancel one version of Northrop’s Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle.Northrop has been particularly aggressive in reshaping its business in response. In 2011, it spun off its shipbuilding division as Huntington Ingalls Industries and the company said it had also cut back on volumes in its underperforming and non-core units.At the same time, it has worked to cut costs and improve productivity. Operating income from continuing operations rose about 18 per cent to $799m in the fourth quarter and margins increased in three of its four units.Net income rose 46 per cent to $548m, giving earnings per share of about $2.09, although the results were flattered by certain charges relating to debt redemption in the prior year.“Fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our progress in achieving superior operating performance and effective cash deployment. Our businesses drove higher operating income, earnings, cash and a strong book-to-bill ratio for the quarter,” Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop, said in a statement.Mr Bush said that in 2012 the company expected to achieve profit from continuing operations of between $6.40 and $6.70 a share on sales of between $24.7bn and $25.4bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $6.82 a share on sales of about $26.1bn.“Our 2012 guidance reflects our continued commitment to performance, affordability for our customers and strong cash generation. While we are in a challenging environment, we believe that we can continue to create value,” Mr Bush said.“The pattern continues – defence revenues light, defence margins strong,“ Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. “With volumes heading down and the customer tightening the terms, we shall see how long this situation can last.”Northrop shares, which have lost about 14 per cent of their value in the past year, were up 1 per cent to $58.65 on Wednesday morning in New York.

Dassault now enters exclusive talks with the Indian government.The contract, estimated to be worth $15bn-$20bn, will help shape India’s air power for the next three decades and serve as the bedrock of a strategic partnership. It also has the potential to reinvigorate the French defence industry when military budgets are being slashed across Europe.The decision is a blow for Eurofighter, whose Typhoon aircraft was seen as the clear frontrunner. But it is a huge boost for Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president, and Dassault, which has yet to secure an export order for the Rafale. Shares in Dassault rose 18 per cent in Paris.Mr Sarkozy faces an election in May and the declining strength of French industry is expected to be a crucial campaign battleground, with the incumbent trailing his socialist rival in opinion polls.He seized on the announcement as “a signal of confidence in the French economy”. The deal “proves that if we have a good product France can win in extraordinarily competitive markets”.David Reeths, a consultant at IHS Jane’s, said: “It’s of particular importance to Dassault as [this competition] is really their last, best chance to continue high-end fast jet production.”India’s decision came after evaluating the life-cycle cost of the aircraft, the acquisition cost and so-called military offset considerations. The offsets include the level of technology that European companies will disclose to India and the share of investment they will bring to India’s defence industries.The four companies in the Eurofighter consortium, led by the Franco-German EADS and including Britain’s BAE Systems and Italy’s Finmeccanica, have vowed to fight on given India’s recent history of stripping companies of their preferred bidder status after long, drawn-out negotiations.“We are disappointed, but it’s not all over until the contract is signed. We don’t yet know the final decision,” one UK diplomat said.India’s defence ministry said a final contract would be awarded in the financial year beginning April 2012. It said the Rafale was the cheaper of the rival bids.“Rafale is the most competent contender,” said a person close to the negotiations at India’s defence ministry.After trials last year, India selected the Rafale and the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon to compete in the final stages of the competition. It had discarded bids from Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, Lockheed’s F-16 Super Viper, Sweden’s Saab Gripen and Russia’s MiG-35.The decision will be a setback to Eurofighter, which had strongly lobbied India to buy its aircraft and considered its bid stronger in terms of performance, security of supply and strategic alignment. It is also a blow for David Cameron, the UK prime minister, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who both lobbied on behalf of Eurofighter.Additional reporting by Girija Shivakumar in New Delhi and Hugh Carnegy in Paris
238;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-01-26T23:58:08Z;Pentagon to cut $485bn over next decade;Lower pay rises for soldiers but force remains;The US military will cut $485bn from its planned spending over the next decade but will still maintain a larger force than it had before 9/11.After 11 years of significant budget increases, the Pentagon started to outline on Thursday measures to restrain the growth in its spending, including lower pay increases and higher health insurance premiums for the serving military, base closures and the scrapping of some smaller weapons programmes.However, despite a political furore about the reduced military budget, the navy will still maintain all its 11 aircraft carriers and the Pentagon will continue to invest in a hugely expensive and controversial new fighter jet, although at a slower rate.“We are retaining our full spectrum capability,” said General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Under the new budget plans for the next five years, defence spending will actually increase in nominal terms by 7 per cent, although it will fall in 2013 from this year. The Pentagon has been forced to cut $259bn from what it had planned to spend over the period and $485bn from its forecast budget over the next decade. In real terms, spending is estimated to drop by 5 per cent over the next five years.“The Pentagon is taking a hit, but it is not as devastating as it once seemed,” said Daniel Wasserbly at consultancy IHS Janes in Washington. According to the Project on Defense Alternatives, the 2013 budget will be 46 per cent above 1998 spending.The measures prompted a sharp rebuke from some Republican members of Congress. Senator John McCain said the new budget “ignored the lessons of history”. The Obama administration’s intention to push for new military base closures is also likely to prompt political pushback.With the winding down in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some of the biggest cuts will be felt by the army, which will be reduced from 547,000 troops now to 490,000 in 2017. Two combat brigades based in Europe will withdrawn.The new budget underlined the strategic themes the Pentagon outlined earlier this month, including greater emphasis on Asia-Pacific and on the use of special operations forces.Defence contractors appeared to have escaped relatively unscathed. Leon Panetta, defence secretary, said he would to implement more “aggressive” contracting practices as part of $60bn in planned efficiency savings. One of the few programmes to actually be cut will be one of four versions of the Global Hawk surveillance aircraft that are being developed.Instead, the Pentagon opted to phase out some older equipment, including cargo aircraft and some older ships, and to delay certain expensive and risky projects. Purchases of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon’s biggest ever procurement project, will be slowed and a replacement for the current fleet of nuclear-missile submarines will be delayed for two years.The Pentagon also offered suppliers some notable carrots. In addition to extra spending on cybersecurity, the department will fund a next-generation bomber, a potential boon for aircraft manufacturers, and will upgrade certain submarines to carry additional cruise missiles, which will probably benefit US shipyards.“The budget recognises that a critical part of our ability to mobilise is a healthy industrial base. Maintaining the vitality of the industrial base and avoiding imposing unacceptable costs or risks on our critical suppliers will guide many of the decisions that we have made,” Mr Panetta said.
239;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-01-26T14:25:57Z;Lockheed feels pressure of Pentagon cuts;;"Another round of deep cuts to the Pentagon budget would have a devastating impact on the US defence industry, according to the head of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor by revenues.Bob Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed, on Thursday said his company and the defence industry more broadly had worked hard to adapt itself to the $487bn of cuts mandated by recent budget legislation but would struggle to cope with additional automatic reductions.As a result of the failure of the supercommittee to agree a path to reduce the US budget deficit, starting in January 2013 the Department of Defence will be required to cut an additional $500bn of funds from its long-range plans.“The impact on industry would be devastating with a significant disruption of ongoing programmes and initiatives across the board. There would very likely be facility closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact areas like advanced manufacturing,” Mr Stevens said.“It would erode engineering expertise; it would accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge and it would directly undermine a key provision of the national security strategy that was just released which is to preserve the defence industrial base.”Lockheed has already trimmed its workforce substantially. Between 2009 and 2011, staff numbers dropped by about 20,000 to around 123,000 as a result of attrition, voluntary redundancy plans and plant consolidations.The comments from Mr Stevens highlight the extreme uncertainty surrounding the medium term outlook for defence spending – a new phenomenon for an industry that has become used to ever growing budgets over the last decade or so.Late on Thursday, Leon Panetta, US defence secretary, gave the first details about how his department will handle the initial cuts, proposing a $259bn reduction over five years, but the secretary has refused to countenance the extra $500bn in reductions.Mr Panetta has argued that additional sharp spending declines would leave the military with the smallest ground forces since 1940, the fewest number of ships since 1915 and the smallest air force in modern history.“From an industry perspective,” Mr Stevens said, “I don’t believe that anyone has a plan to accommodate at the top line cumulative budget reduction of about $47bn [a year] associated with the budget control act reduction plus another $50bn [a year under sequestration].”The comments came as Lockheed released its fourth-quarter results for 2011 which underscored the challenges facing the industry. Revenues fell about 4 per cent to $12.2bn during the quarter compared with the same period last year.Net income from continuing operations dropped about 15 per cent to $698m, giving earnings per share of about $2.14, as the company grappled with higher pension costs, a reduction in certain tax credits and charges for restructuring its electronic systems unit.In its guidance for 2012, Lockheed said it expected revenues to fall to between $45bn and $46bn, from $46.5bn in 2011, and said that earnings per share would fall between $7.70 and $7.90, compared with $7.81 in 2011. The company has a record $80.7bn order backlog.“We certainly understand the pressures that our nation faces with respect to deficit reduction but $487bn is a very significant reduction in the defence budget contributing to that goal … [and] we strongly urge action to stop [the sequestration] process,” Mr Stevens said."
240;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-01-25T17:21:55Z;Defence industry braced for era of austerity;;Defence industry executives are bracing themselves for dramatic spending cuts as the Pentagon, the world’s biggest buyer of military equipment and services, prepares to release its budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.Later on Thursday, Leon Panetta, US defence secretary, is expected to provide new details of cuts to procurement programmes and troop numbers as his department attempts to make good on promises to trim about $500bn from its plans over the next decade.For companies such as Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, the 2013 fiscal year defence budget proposal, and the longer-range forecasts that accompany it, is the latest reminder that the decade-long boom the sector has enjoyed on the back of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is now drawing to a close.Analysts expect the scale of the cuts to put pressure on revenues and profits across the board. JPMorgan expects organic revenues at the largest contractors to decline about 5 per cent in 2012, and another 5 per cent in 2013.Eventually, the cuts could lead to a reorganisation of the sector, with companies shedding their poorer performing assets and new entrants from Israel to the UK providing the fighting equipment of the future – advanced computer-driven programmes, such as UAVs (drones), cyber security, surveillance and autonomous systems (robots).Traditional defence contractors will have to find “the courage to shrink” by cleaning up their portfolios, said John Dowdy of McKinsey. Indeed, Northrop Grumman spinning off its shipbuilding business last March has been cited as one example of that future trend.In the past 12 years “the rising tide lifted all boats”, Mr Dowdy said. That is no longer the case and some are going to run out of new orders quickly in this tougher market. But he saw little room left for big mergers after the consolidation of the 1990s that left the top 10 companies controlling 60 per cent of the market.Many of the cuts that the US military will have to make are expected to come at the expense of the army and marines as Washington turns from fighting ground wars to relying on its navy and air force to spread its influence, particularly in Asia.This could lead to fewer vehicles, munitions, radios and ground-based electro-optical equipment, hitting companies such as BAE, General Dynamics and L-3 Communications that generate between 15 and 35 per cent of their revenues from sales to the US army alone.New projects are also at risk and even the F-35 fighter jet may not entirely avoid the cuts due to its long-running development problems and sheer scale.Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital, estimates that up to 175 jets could be cut from the plan over five years. That would hit Lockheed, Northrop and BAE, the main companies involved, and also defence departments from London to Tokyo for whom the average cost of an F-35 would subsequently rise.In many respects, however, the 2013 fiscal year budget is but a prelude to a more painful fight. With the failure of the supercommittee to agree a deficit reduction deal, the Pentagon faces a further $500bn of automatic cuts over the next decade starting in January 2013.Many observers believe it may not come to such drastic measures but they say political inaction could lead to delays in defence procurement as officials become cautious about making expensive purchases for which they risk later being criticised.For companies, that means less clarity in an industry that relies on programmes which often cost billions of dollars and take decades to complete. From an operational point of view, company executives say they will be left with the uncomfortable decision of whether to maintain a workforce in case an order comes through eventually, or to let it go and risk losing any competitive edge in that area.One issue, however, provides a glimmer of hope. Heidi Wood, with Morgan Stanley, argues the budget crisis is so acute, that politicians may finally be forced to address the biggest cost concerns within the military – medical coverage and pensions – and that could free up cash for equipment programmes.
241;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2012-01-10T20:06:28Z;Marietta turns up heat on Vulcan over merger;;Martin Marietta, the US construction materials company, increased the pressure in its hostile bid for Vulcan Materials on Tuesday by accusing its rival of mismanaging the company and misleading investors over the nature of the $4.8bn all-stock offer.In a conference call with investors, Ward Nye, chief executive of Martin Marietta, attacked Vulcan’s management for failing to acknowledge the company’s “sustained underperformance” and “impaired business profile.”Mr Nye also criticised Vulcan for misrepresenting the bid to shareholders. He said that the offer represented a significant premium over Vulcan’s undisturbed share price and noted that the stock swap would allow Vulcan investors to participate in any future gains.Despite a long history of amicable but unsuccessful discussions about a merger, since Martin Marietta made its unsolicited bid the two sides have exchanged increasingly hostile words, set up rival websites and bombarded shareholders with competing data designed to bolster their positions.Earlier this month, Vulcan’s management elaborated on its initial objections to the offer with a long investor presentation that criticised the bid as opportunistic, inadequate and likely to face opposition from federal regulators.Vulcan argued that historically it has rebounded strongly from recessions, has greater exposure to fast-growing markets than Martin Marietta and has certain key assets, such as an extensive property portfolio, that the bid did not value appropriately.The company was also critical of the $200m-$250m in merger synergies identified by its would-be buyer. The two companies, in joint discussions, had previously identified $125m-150m in cost savings through a merger, Vulcan said.On Tuesday, however, Martin Marietta fought back, reiterating its synergy targets and arguing that the enlarged company would have a stronger balance sheet, more resources to reward shareholders and be better able to weather the choppy economic conditions.Mr Nye said that Vulcan’s case to remain a standalone entity depended on a robust economic recovery in the sector but insisted that that was unlikely. “There [are] no blue-sky prospects with this kind of recovery. At Martin Marietta, we face reality as it is.”Vulcan has been struggling to reduce its debt load after purchasing Florida Rock Industries for $4.6bn near the market peak in 2007. The company had net debt of 8.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the past year.A combined Vulcan-Marietta group would be worth $11.4bn including debt, have operations in 35 US states and control mineral reserves of about 28bn tons. The two companies produce materials for road-building and other infrastructure projects.Since Martin Marietta made its initial all-stock offer, Vulcan shares have climbed about 19 per cent, while Martin Marietta shares have risen about 2 per cent.
242;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-28T18:59:33Z;Lockheed Martin wins contract worth up to $2bn;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, has won a multi-year contract from the National Science Foundation that could be worth up to $2bn to support the extensive US research presence in Antarctica.As part of the contract Lockheed will transport US scientists and goods to and from Antarctica, support efforts to upgrade local infrastructure and manage bases in the region that provide a staging post for expeditions and research.At McMurdo Station, the main hub, Lockheed will effectively run a small town with an airport, a pier, a hospital and a hotel as well as a laboratory complete with an aquarium.Linda Gooden, head of Lockheed’s Information Systems & Global Solutions business, said that the company was delighted with the award and noted Lockheed’s “longstanding history of supporting customers in remote locations”. Environments do not come more remote than Antarctica. The continent is one of the coldest, driest and windiest places on earth, where the lowest recorded temperature is -90C.In his 2007 film, Encounters at the End of the World, Werner Herzog, the award-winning documentary filmmaker, presented McMurdo Station as an other-worldly environment, inhabited by an engrossing assortment of oddball characters.The NSF, independent federal agency that supports science in the US, has maintained a US presence in the region since the 1950s. About 3,000 Americans, from agencies such as NASA and the defence department take part in NSF research and logistics activities each year.Research projects include efforts to better understand climate change, particularly the relationship between Antarctica, its ice sheet and the Southern Ocean, and also biological experiments that take advantage of the area’s remoteness and extreme climate.Lockheed beat out incumbent provider Raytheon, to win the initial four and a half year contract. Follow-on options could extend the contract to 13 years, and if Lockheed wins those the total contract value could reach $2bn.For Lockheed the contract provides a useful boost just as pressure on the US defence budget is denting its $46bn in annual revenues. In October, Lockheed executives indicated that revenues were likely to be flat over the next few years.Earlier this month Lockheed secured another important contract win, when Japan agreed to buy about 42 F-35 fighter aircraft in a deal worth about $6bn. Analysts described the move as an important vote of confidence in what is a crucial programme for Lockheed.Lockheed Martin shares were broadly flat in midday trading on Wednesday at about $81.20. Over the year to date Lockheed shares have gained about 17 per cent.

If Martin Marietta succeeds in its hostile offer for Vulcan, valuing the construction materials maker at $38 a share, or $4.9bn, it will be picking up such assets at 1.3 times book value, near the lowest multiple in memory. Of course, Martin Marietta points out the market is valuing those assets cheaply for a reason and that it could squeeze more out of them, achieving $250m a year in synergies.Though Vulcan’s board rejected the offer and its chief executive called it “lowball and opportunistic”, the fairness opinion Vulcan relied upon from Goldman Sachs lacks heft, having come weeks after Goldman’s analysts slapped a $29 price target and a “sell” recommendation on Vulcan. This would not be the first time that analysts were wrong. But Vulcan does look sickly, having slashed its dividend and underperformed Martin Marietta. It has spent far more of the past decade trading above the offer price but is now below it largely because of the construction sector’s slump. But management is hardly blameless in reaching this point. It announced a cost-cutting plan only this week.Analyst opinions and the initial market reaction to the offer suggest that another $4 to $6 a share, or up to $1bn, may be warranted. If a richer offer is what Vulcan’s management is trying to accomplish then its aggressive defence – a lawsuit alleging improper use of confidential information from earlier talks and a warning to shareholders that the offer would be “conditional” given antitrust concerns – might be justified. If it is to protect their personal interests then it is not.Martin Marietta should go over the board’s head by making its best offer and then channelling Mr Spock. When logic failed to convince stubborn opponents that they would live long and prosper, he used a Vulcan grip to disable them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
244;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-22T18:39:54Z;Vulcan board rejects Marietta’s $4.9bn bid;;Executives at Vulcan Materials, the building materials company, have urged shareholders to reject a $4.9bn bid for the company from rival Martin Marietta, arguing that the hostile offer is illegal, inadequate and risky.In a sharp riposte to the unsolicited all-stock offer, Vulcan on Thursday laid out seven broad reasons why shareholders should resist the bid, including a pointed accusation that Martin Marietta had breached confidentiality agreements in making its offer.Since 2002, the two companies have held a series of talks about a potential tie-up and Vulcan accused Martin Marietta of obtaining and then divulging “highly sensitive, material, non-public and confidential information”.Vulcan said it had begun litigation against its rival in two US courts in an effort to forestall the offer.In response, Ward Nye, Martin Marietta’s chief executive, said: “Despite the rhetoric by Vulcan, the only real obstacle to delivering to Vulcan’s shareholders the substantial benefits of the proposed combination is the opposition of Vulcan’s board of directors.”People familiar with the Martin Marietta bid argue that it was produced without reference to confidential information and point out that the Vulcan shareholders will own about 58 per cent of the combined company, allowing them to participate in any deal benefits.On December 12, Martin Marietta offered to buy Vulcan by exchanging half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share, arguing the enlarged company would create a global leader in the construction aggregates industry, better able to weather the choppy economic conditions.Vulcan has been struggling to reduce its debt load after purchasing Florida Rock Industries for $4.6bn near the market peak in 2007. The company had net debt of 8.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the past year.A combined Vulcan-Marietta group would be worth $11.4bn including debt, have operations in 35 US states and control mineral reserves of about 28bn tons. The two companies produce materials for road-building and other infrastructure projects.On Thursday, Vulcan shares, which have fallen about 12 per cent over the year to date, rose about 1 per cent to $39.11 in early trading. Martin Marietta shares, which have dropped about 18 per cent over the year so far, slipped about 1 per cent to $75.86Much will depend on behind the scenes efforts to win over key shareholders. Earlier this week, Martin Marietta scored a coup when a prominent member of the Ireland family, owners of Vulcan’s predecessor company, endorsed the bid.In its statement, Vulcan accused Martin Marietta of attempting an “opportunistic” land-grab at a low point in the industrial cycle and said it could achieve significant cost savings on its own. Earlier this week ,Vulcan increased its cost reduction plans.
245;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-20T20:04:09Z;Relief for Lockheed Martin after awkward year;;The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s win in Japan means Lockheed Martin can let out a deep sigh of relief. The year has been an uncomfortable one in the limelight for its Joint Strike Fighter programme.JSF is Lockheed’s most important venture and also one of its most ambitious. For the US, the $382bn programme is not only the biggest military procurement project, but also the one that will define its air defence strategy for a generation. In the US and UK, the JSF’s two lead partners, the programme supports more than 150,000 jobs by Lockheed’s estimate.BAE Systems, the main UK defence contractor on the project, describes the F-35 as the world’s most advanced combat aircraft and “the first and only stealthy, supersonic, multi-role fighter”.But that ambition has come at a price. The project’s technical setbacks have pushed it far behind schedule and well beyond its initial cost projections. The fact that Japan has declared itself willing to buy 42 aircraft is in itself a leap of faith, says Robert Hewson, analyst at IHS Jane’s Defence.“This is where the promises of the F-35 crash into hard reality,” he says.For the F-35, winning the Japanese tender – the first competitive tender it has entered – comes at a critical time for the programme.In India, an important new growth area for defence contractors, the F-35 this year was not picked to compete in the $20bn tender. And among Lockheed’s traditional western customers, emaciated budgets mean big defence spenders, such as the US and UK, are having to limit and delay their purchases.The US initially anticipated buying more than 2,400 F-35s but that number is now expected to shrink. This makes many companies and governments nervous because any reduction or delay in US orders will increase the price of the aircraft for everyone else. And as fewer nations see the F-35 as an affordable option, the risk is that the JSF programme falls into a spiral from which it will be hard to extricate itself.For Lockheed Martin and its partners, which include Northrop Grumman, United Technologies’s Pratt & Whitney, BAE and others, this would mean lower revenue growth and slimmer margins.Lockheed Martin puts the average cost of the three types of F-35 jet at $65m-$85m. But that assumes a lot of them will be sold. The US has calculated the per fighter cost of an F-35 at $133m, while other estimates are higher than $200m.Those price projections may well be revised upwards in the near future, with vice-admiral David Venlet, the US official in charge of the programme, remarking that the likely future costs of fixing recently unearthed problems with the F-35 “sucks the wind out of my lungs”.At the end of last month, US defence department found a long list of flaws with the JSF. The troubles, which include the helmet-mounted display system not functioning properly, part of the fuel dump system posing a fire hazard, and the frame giving out earlier than had been expected, led the department to raise doubts about the entire structure of the F-35 programme.Revelations such as these have led to political ire, with Senator John McCain, the top Republican on the US Senate’s armed services committee, calling the programme “a scandal and a tragedy”. Meanwhile, in its most recent defence budget, the US tightened the screws on the F-35 programme by forcing Lockheed Martin to absorb all of the cost overruns beyond a certain point, rather than sharing them.Lockheed Martin, however, says the technical problems are not game changers and that this year the programme is ahead of schedule. Paul Livingston, aeronautics director for the UK, says the Japan win underscores the progress the F35 has made.“It is a strong endorsement of where we’ve got to in our actual operational tests and the progress the programme has made in the past 18 months, which is just phenomenal,” he says.Additional reporting by Geoff Dyer in Washington and Jeremy Lemer in New York
246;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-20T16:56:10Z;Japanese industry may be hit by new fighter;;In choosing the F-35 Lightning II as its new mainstay fighter, Japan has plumped for a weapons platform which lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin wolfishly boasts is of “unmatched lethality”.But rather than allowing some hostile intruder into its territorial airspace, the first fatality to be inflicted by Japan’s purchase could end up being the nation’s ability to build its own fighters.The choice – which critics say was driven largely by the desire of Japanese air force officers to have the most advanced available aircraft – looks set to deal a heavy blow to an isolated and inefficient defence industry.Japan is already facing its first fighter production hiatus in more than half a century, following the delivery in September of the last F-2 aircraft built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The defence ministry says MHI will have a role in making F-35 airframes, but US reluctance to share the technology behind its radar-evading stealth abilities and weapons networking is sure to limit the extent of Japanese involvement.This could be the final blow for many of the hundreds of smaller manufacturers vital to Japan’s military aerospace manufacturing sector, says Shinichi Kiyotani, a Japanese defence writer who argues that the F-35 purchase could “trigger the collapse of our nation’s defence industry”.Debate over the long-delayed choice of the “FX”, as the replacement for two squadrons of 1970s-era F-4 Phantom jets, has certainly highlighted the woes of Japan’s defence sector. Budget pressures and an informal rule keeping defence spending at about 1 per cent of gross domestic product has left little room for growth. Analysts say increasing numbers of small and medium-sized companies involved in making parts or specialist technologies have been going bankrupt or exiting the sector, in large part because, unlike larger contractors, they cannot balance military-related revenues with sales to the civilian sector.But times have been hard even for big companies like MHI and heavy machinery maker IHI Corp, which the defence ministry says will help to make engines for F-35s sold to Japan. Traditional defence budget-setting means that contracts for even the biggest weapons sales tend to be parcelled out into small lots over many years. The first F-35 deliveries are not expected until 2016, for example, but the government plans to include the cost of four fighters in its budget for the year starting April 1 2012.Such a system leaves procurement programmes vulnerable to change and makes it difficult for contractors to factor in upfront costs, such as those involved in research and development. Meanwhile, the erosion of once cosy ties with bureaucrats and politicians means contractors can no longer rely on the government.Just two months ago, Toshiba Corp launched a lawsuit against the defence ministry over its cancellation of billions of yen in contracts related to the remodelling of some F-15 fighters. Last year, Fuji Heavy Industries also went to court over the government’s decision to cut its purchase of Apache attack helicopters.Defence contractors’ problems are exacerbated by a legacy of Japanese post-war pacifistic principles that largely bars them from the kind of cross-border co-operation that is becoming the industry norm. Exports of almost all weapons systems are banned, meaning companies like MHI have no chance to play a full role in the sort of multinational programme that led to the F-35.Combined with Japan’s past determination to maintain an autonomous defence industry, the result is small production runs and fiendishly high prices. Japan’s F-2, for example, reportedly cost about Y12,00bn – more than twice the price of the US F-16 on which it was largely based.Given Japan’s increasing fiscal strains, it would not be unreasonable to simply decide to rely on imports for future air defence. Yet, the government is hardly entertaining such a shift. Instead, the defence ministry excitedly plans domestic development of a stealth fighter. An early test aircraft is scheduled to take to the air by 2014.How feasible such dreams prove could depend in large part on Japan winning significant access to F-35 technology. Without it, Japan risks merely driving up the cost of the new fighter while leaving itself incapable of creating a successor.Domestic media have already questioned a procurement process which appears to have favoured the largely untried F-35 over its rivals, Eurofighter’s Typhoon and Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, which are already in widespread service. Both had offered far more domestic involvement in manufacture. At least such criticism should lead to greater public scrutiny of future procurement. For sections of the domestic defence sector, however, it may already be too late.Mure Dickie is the FT’s Tokyo Bureau Chief
247;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-20T06:57:32Z;Japan opts for US F-35 fighter;;Japan’s government has confirmed its choice of the F-35 Lightning II as its new air-defence fighter, waving aside worries about its cost and likely limits to access to its most sophisticated technology.The defence ministry said it chose the F-35 over the Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet partly because of its radar-evading “stealth” capabilities.“There are changes in the security environment and the actions of various nations and we want to have a fighter that has the capacity to cope,” said Yasuo Ichikawa, defence minister.The choice of the F-35, which is made by US contractor Lockheed Martin and other companies, by cabinet members was widely expected. The deal to buy 42 aircraft could be worth $7bn initially and means the F-35, which is particularly highly valued for its ability to penetrate enemy air defences rather than as a defensive interceptor, is set to become Japan’s mainstay fighter.The decision is not such good news for Japan’s defence industry, which was offered more collaboration by Eurofighter’s Typhoon. Lockheed Martin said Japan’s role in building the F-35 would be predominantly assembling the planes and that the F-35’s parts would continue to be made by the original partner nations, with the US and UK in the leading roles.Francis Tusa, a London-based defence analyst, said Japan’s choice of the F-35 shows that the potential industrial opportunity was trumped by the importance Tokyo placed on its defence alliances.“Japan had to look for the strategic partnership. That was always going to make it turn to the Americans,” he said, adding that there was little chance Tokyo could rely on the Europeans to come to the rescue if Japan found itself in a tight spot with China or North Korea.But questions remain about whether the F-35 was a smart choice in terms of timing.Many observers of the Japanese tender believe Lockheed Martin will struggle to meet Japan’s 2016 deadline, possibly leaving the country with a gap in its defences.Gareth Jennings, senior aviation specialist at IHS Jane’s, said: “While Lockheed Martin may be able to deliver aircraft by 2016, it is doubtful whether Japan will be able to begin operating them then.”But Lockheed was adamant that it would meet the deadline and that its win in Japan underscored this.Paul Livingston, the company’s aeronautics director for the UK, said: “In the dialogue that has gone on as they [Japanese officials] have assessed these proposals, they have gone right into the nuts and bolts and they’ve definitely come away confident that this is the right choice for Japan and that in itself speaks volumes about the maturity [in terms of the F-35’s development] that we are really at.”

The German engineering company sells a range of high-tech products including electricity transmission systems, gas turbines, trains and medical scanners.Judy Marks, chief executive of SGT, told the Financial Times that Gen McChrystal would fulfil a part-time advisory function but would not work as a lobbyist. She declined to disclose his salary.“He brings tremendous leadership capabilities, knowledge as a user [of government services] …and understanding of how the department of defence acquires technology, services and solutions,” she said.Although Siemens is not a manufacturer of armaments, the US defence market represents an attractive target across its portfolio of products.In August the German company announced a strategic alliance with Boeing based on the joint development and marketing of “smart grid” technology for the US Department of Defence.Siemens also hired US Army Lieutenant General John Sylvester and Robert Coutts, a retired Lockheed Martin and General Electric executive, to serve as SGT board members.Gen McChrystal leads an advisory company called the McChrystal Group. Since his retirement from the military he has taken up directorships with JetBlue Airways and truckmaker Navistar International.Siemens is attempting to revive its reputation in the US following the uncovering in 2006 of widespread bribery of foreign officials. The revelations led to the departure of much of Siemens’ top management and cost the company in excess of €2bn in fines and advisory payments.The problems continue to cast a shadow, however. Six former Siemens executives, including a former board member and two of their agents, were last week indicted on criminal charges in a New York court for allegedly conspiring to bribe senior Argentine government officials to win a $1bn contract.Siemens has tightened its compliance procedures in recent years and has won favour in Washington by hiring hundreds of military veterans. The company employs around 60,000 people in the US and recently added a new gas turbine plant in Charlotte, North Carolina.Separately, the Munich-based company yesterday announced a €600m Russian order for high-speed trains.

But alas, this year has turned out to be another in which anxiety wracked chief executives have kept their cash piles stashed beneath corporate mattresses.There is an estimated $3.5tn in cash parked on balance sheets worldwide, according to Credit Suisse. Yet with only a couple of weeks of 2011 left to run, global dealmaking is up just 5 per cent on last year, dashing advisers’ hopes that a strong first quarter heralded a sustained pickup in activity.A prolonged period of economic instability and market volatility has meant that ambitious plans for growth and expansion have repeatedly been put on hold. That could contribute to a pent-up demand for dealmaking among those eyeing the long period of sluggish economic performance to come.Martin Marietta, the building materials company, this week demonstrated how receptive the market can be to industry consolidation aimed at creating value by slashing costs. After its hostile bid for rival Vulcan Materials was made public, both companies’ stocks rose.However, the series of crises faced in the US, Europe and beyond has also arguably underlined the need for the fortress balance sheets which companies globally built up during the financial crisis. Cautious chief executives and boards may feel that the perilous state of the world over the past three years has repeatedly vindicated their timid instincts.Others may not be so patient. This year has seen the return of the activist investor, as high-profile names such as Carl Icahn have taken aim at a host of large companies and called for change. Moreover, add some advisers, other hedge funds are branching out into activism as they seek to boost returns and retain investors.According to analysis by JPMorgan, activist situations targeting companies worth more than $1bn are up almost 55 per cent compared to the same period last year. And with the US moving into the season for annual meetings – and the window where activists can nominate their own directors to target companies’ boards – the rise in lobbying by disgruntled investors is gathering pace.Yet, with the exception of Mr Icahn, who this year has tried to gee up a sale of Clorox, the household products company, and Commercial Metals, the steel and scrap metal company, few situations have focused on putting a company into play.Back in the credit boom, activists routinely lobbied for a quick sale of companies, with the back-up option that management teams could take on debt and pay out a hefty chunk to investors. The ensuing crisis means that calls for more leverage do not fly. Instead, activists are showing a greater focus on corporate governance issues and on pushing companies to reconsider wide-ranging or overly diverse portfolios.Sceptics argue that, in many instances, activists keen to show a quick return jump into strategic reviews, taking credit for a process that is already well underway. The move towards greater clarity and focus was well established before activism started to pick up this year, they add.In fact, as activism has risen, the number of long-term proxy fights has not kept pace – evidence that investors are using different tactics or have a shorter time horizon. Companies may too be more willing to engage with activists, offering up concessions earlier in order to avoid a full stand-off.Heightened volatility has already provided ample opportunities for activists to build positions in target companies at favourable levels. And if – or when – the overhang of European uncertainty is removed and the US economy strengthens meaningfully, the activists will be ready to question boards and managers on their plans for their hoards of emergency cash.The activists are here to stay – it’s just not clear whether that translates into deals.

252;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Japan to buy Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet;;Japan’s government is set to choose the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter made by US contractor Lockheed Martin as its new air-defence fighter, Japanese media reported on Tuesday.The decision, expected to be finalised by cabinet members on Friday, would provide a big boost for the troubled F-35 programme and mark a continuation of a longstanding Japanese practice of relying on the US for almost all its imports of advanced weapons platforms.The highly advanced but largely unproven F-35 is competing against the Eurofighter Typhoon and US aerospace manufacturer Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet for the Japanese order for about 42 aircraft, which could be worth an initial US$6bn or more.Leading Japanese media, including the Yomiuri Shimbun, the biggest-selling daily and the Nikkei Shimbun, the leading business newspaper, reported on their front pages on Tuesday that the defence ministry saw the F-35 as the best candidate to replace two squadrons of ageing F-4 fighters.A spokesman for Japan’s defence ministry said the reports were premature and no decision on the new fighter had been made. However, Japanese ministries often brief domestic media in advance about their plans on important policy issues, and it would be a surprise if a defence ministry recommendation was later overturned.Choosing the F-35 could raise questions about Japanese industry’s ability to maintain a capacity to build fighters, as it is unclear how much of its technology and manufacturing Lockheed Martin and the US government will be willing to licence.The F-35, which is also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, has suffered a string of bad publicity in the run-up to Japan’s decision.In a recent interview with AOL Defence the US official in charge of the programme, Vice Admiral David Venlet, called for production to be slowed down, saying the likely future cost of fixing problem “hot spots” in F-35s currently being made “sucks the wind out of your lungs”.Senator John McCain, the top Republican on the US Senate Armed Services Committee, subsequently dubbed the F-35 program “both a scandal and a tragedy”.Lockheed Martin has insisted that, in spite of such problems, it is confident it could start delivering F-35s to Japan by the 2016 tax year as required.Picking the F-35 could also raise questions about how seriously Tokyo considered the bid by Eurofighter. The Typhoon, which is made by a consortium of European defence companies led in Japan by the UK’s BAE Systems, is cheaper than the F-35 and already available.Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Brokers, said: “Given that the Japanese Ministry of Defence had originally sought to acquire the F-22 Raptor and that there is a long history of US-based procurement, despite the excellent performance offered it has long been clear that Eurofighter Typhoon would be an outsider in this competition.”Additional reporting by Carola Hoyos

It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday.

Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500.

254;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-12T22:36:24Z;Vulcan Materials / Martin Marietta;Either a sweetened offer or more bids are expected;It has been a long and winding road indeed for Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials. The two companies began mulling a combination nearly a decade ago and stepped up talks last year, but those recently broke down. Now that it is unclear who will pay for American roads – of which the companies’ aggregates are a key component – Martin Marietta is trying to force the issue.The market reaction after the proposed $5bn all-share deal was unveiled indicates that either a sweetened offer or more bids are expected. Vulcan’s shares surged far above the proposed premium and Martin Marietta rallied, too, on a weak day for US equities.With federal and state highway spending in limbo (federal funding has been on a stopgap basis since 2009), cost savings from a combination could insulate the two companies from a weak market for road building materials. Already number one and two in the US, the combined group would be more than twice the size of their largest domestic competitor and would overtake HeidelbergCement for the top spot globally.Martin Marietta did not hesitate to highlight Vulcan’s financial woes, with its dividend being slashed to cope with looming debt maturities. Significant overlap between the two shareholder bases and the promise of a healthy pay-out from the combined group will aid approval of the deal. Even after a successful deal, the combined group would have only 15 per cent market share in the US. Aggregates are usually a very local business so economies of scale are tough to come by. The attractiveness of this deal comes from heavy regional overlap in the sunbelt – a feature that Martin Marietta must hope does not force divestitures.The reason the two failed to hook up for so long seems to have been personal, not business. If anyone should know the value of aggregation it is this bunch.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
255;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-12T16:52:53Z;Japan poised to decide on fighter jets deal;;"Japan is poised to decide which new fighter jets will defend its borders for the next generation, in the most highly anticipated deal of a miserable year for military aircraft producers.The decision, likely before the end of the year, will define whether Tokyo continues its almost exclusive technical military partnership with the US or turns to Europe for major front line weapons for the first time since the second world war.Three jet fighters are vying for the contract. These are Eurofighter’s Typhoon, made by a consortium of European defence companies; the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin, the US defence contractor, BAE Systems of the UK and others; and the F/A-18 Super Hornet, manufactured by Boeing, the US aerospace and defence company.The initial deal for about 42 aircraft would be worth as much as $6bn, while the contract to support and service the planes for their 30 to 40-year life would be even more lucrative.“These kinds of sales don’t happen very often – once every generation. It would be massive for us to achieve a sale into Japan and would support our business plan going forward,” said BAE’s Mark Parkinson, who is in charge of selling Typhoon to Japan.BAE, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, has for the past seven years spent millions of dollars and thousands of manhours preparing for the Japanese sale.The Typhoon has several things going for it, not least that it proved its value in Libya earlier this year. It is a specialist in deploying long-range missiles, is ready to go and has a price tag well short of the F-35, its fiercest competitor. Perhaps most importantly, the Eurofighter and the European governments behind it are willing to share Typhoon’s technology and collaborate in building the jets in Japan.Robert Hewson, analyst at IHS Jane’s, calls the Typhoon the outsider for whom a win would be spectacular. “Japan really wants the F-35,” he says. “If the F-35 gets dismissed in favour of the Super Hornet or the Typhoon, it will be a tremendous blow for Lockheed Martin – a punch in the stomach – and people will begin to ask what the future of the plane actually is.”The F-35 is the most modern fighter on offer and its sleek design gives it radar-evading capabilities. Japan has historically tended to buy the newest technology, increasing its chances in many observers’ eyes.But this time could be different because Japan is in a hurry. Much of its fleet of fighter jets is getting old in terms of technology, and 18 of the country’s F-2 jets were damaged in the March tsunami. The 2016 deadline could well be a stretch for the F-35, which has suffered cost overruns and delays, and whose technology, though impressive, is expensive and largely untested.“The programme is nowhere near as ready as it should be and the F-35 is in real trouble in terms of technical hitches and shrinking budgets. You’d be a brave man to sign up for the F-35 today because it has fallen so short of its earlier promises,” says Mr Hewson.The Super Hornet is the oldest and least expensive in the group. It has the significant advantage of being better tested and more ready than its competitors, but the disadvantage of being viewed as having yesterday’s technology that could soon be overtaken by Russia and China.Mr Hewson suggests that the Typhoon or the Super Hornet might get an interim deal to supply some airplanes to Japan, with Tokyo making a commitment to buying the F-35 later. Another possibility is that Japan orders more F-2 jets from Mitsubishi while it waits for the F-35."
256;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Martin Marietta launches $4.7bn bid for Vulcan;;Martin Marietta, the building materials company, has made an unsolicited $4.7bn stock offer for its larger rival Vulcan Materials, in a bid to create a global leader in the construction aggregates industry and shore up the companies against a faltering macroeconomic outlook.The US’s second-largest producer of aggregates said on Monday it would pay half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share, worth $36.69 based on the closing levels last week. That represents a premium of about 15 per cent based on the companies’ share prices over the past 10 days.The combined group would have a market value of about $7.7bn, before synergies, and would be worth a total of $11.4bn including debt.Together the two companies, which produce materials for road-building and other infrastructure projects, would have operations in 35 US states and combined mineral reserves of 28bn tons. With shipments of about 278m tons last year, the pair would edge ahead of HeidelbergCement as the largest company in the sector.“Recent events, including the fragile state of the US economy, the lack of visibility as to when a sustainable recovery will take place, and the uncertainty surrounding government spending on infrastructure projects, only strengthen the rationale behind a combination,” said Ward Nye, Martin Marietta’s chief executive, in a letter to his counterpart at Alabama-based Vulcan.Vulcan shares jumped more than 19 per cent to $39.94 on Monday morning in New York trading, while Martin Marietta shares rose 5.7 per cent to $77.54.The pair have long flirted with a deal, and have been in talks on-and-off since 2002. Mr Nye noted that the two had most recently been discussing a transaction for a year and a half.“It is our very, very strong preference to negotiate an agreed transaction with the Vulcan board of directors,” Mr Nye said on Monday, adding that he was ready to start discussions immediately. Martin Marietta intends to submit five of its own nominees to Vulcan’s 11-strong board.Vulcan said in a statement it was reviewing the offer and would advise shareholders on what course of action to take in the coming days.The deal would help to reduce Vulcan’s leverage levels and create substantial cost savings, the company added. Martin Marietta expects synergies of $200m to $250m, or about $2bn of equity value once taxed and capitalised.Vulcan has been grappling to bring down its debt levels, after buying Florida Rock Industries for $4.6bn close to the market peak in 2007. The company had net debt of 8.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the last twelve months, a figure that would fall to 5.6 times through a combination with Martin Marietta.Martin Marietta also said it would reinstate Vulcan’s dividend, which was recently cut to $0.04 per share, paying $1.60 for each of its shares annually.Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan are advising Martin Marietta. Vulcan is advised by Goldman Sachs.
257;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-12-02T21:13:31Z;GE and Rolls-Royce abandon F-35 engine;Pratt & Whitney to continue development;General Electric and Rolls-Royce on Friday abandoned their fifteen-year effort to build an engine for the F-35 fighter jet, ceding a market that could be worth about $100bn over the next three decades to their rivals at Pratt & Whitney.The two companies had been paying for the development of the F136 engine out of their own pockets since April, when the Pentagon told them to stop working on the project after Congress cut funding for the programme.Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE, said that the combination of opposition from the Pentagon to their self-funding efforts, a desire to invest in more promising engine research programmes and concerns about the timeline for the F-35 were behind the decision.“To try to self-fund an engine when you have this level of uncertainty is difficult,” he said. “Where is your return on investment if the product is not deployed until the end of the decade? The business model is not what it was when we initiated this.”So far, GE and Rolls have spent “tens of millions of dollars” on the self-funding effort. The companies said that the strong demand for commercial aircraft engines meant that they had been able to find other work for the employees involved in the project.In a statement, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney said we “remain focused on delivering F135 engines while lowering costs for our customers, and powering a successful flight test program. We are grateful for the continued confidence and support of our DoD customer for the F135 engine”.The F-35 fighter jet programme is the largest acquisition project undertaken by the US military and has struggled with substantial costs overruns and technical and production hurdles culminating in a series of delays and restructurings. Those setbacks have made the programme a target for budget hawks.GE and Rolls put a brave face on the decision emphasising their involvement in a series of ongoing engine research programmes funded by the Pentagon. Mr Kennedy also said that the company had created valuable and reusable technology in working on the F136.Still, the move marks a significant setback for the US and British industrial groups. In previous presentations, GE and Rolls have argued that cancelling the alternate engine for the F-35 would hand a lucrative monopoly to Pratt & Whitney, part of the United Technologies conglomerate.GE in particular has fought hard to keep the programme alive, proposing innovative contracting schemes and blanketing members of Congress with materials. Before a key vote earlier in the year, Jeff Immelt, chief executive of GE, personally wrote to a series of influential congressional leaders.The F-35, built by Lockheed Martin and partners, is designed to replace almost the entire US fleet of combat jets over the next 30 years. In total, the US military and its allies are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to buy about 3,000 of the aircraft, creating a large need for engines.Analysts, military officials and politicians had been divided about the need for two engines however. GE and Rolls argued that competition would reduce overall costs, but the Pentagon argued completing the second engine would cost billions of dollars it could not afford.In mid-afternoon trading in the US GE shares rose about 2 per cent to $16.22, while United Technologies shares were flat at $76.55. Rolls-Royce shares closed down about 1 per cent at 725½p in London trading.
258;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-22T16:15:44Z;Markets and US political uncertainty;What to expect as race for White House kicks into gear;The sell-off in stocks at the start of the week, after the US budget “supercommittee” failed to agree a deal, shows the extent to which political uncertainty can still roil traders.Unfortunately, there’s more to come.As Strategas Research says in a note: “The next 12 months is shaping up to be another year of uncertainty stemming from Washington, with the 2012 election, fate of the automatic cuts and expiration of the Bush tax cuts all on the table in fourth quarter of 2012.”Should those automatic budget cuts come into effect, Strategas reckons the big losers will be defence groups such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon and, further down the scale, healthcare, technology and infrastructure companies.Meanwhile, Barclays Capital has taken a look at what to expect from the market as the race for the White House kicks into gear, noting postwar elections that either followed or were held during a struggling economy.The bank reckons markets would (unsurprisingly) react favourably to the increasing probability of a Republican victory, but that past polls show equity volatility, after falling from elevated levels following primary season, will begin to rise 12 weeks prior to election day.“With equity market valuations towards the low end of long-term historical ranges the stage is set for a bullish post-election environment,” says Barclays.“However, with public policy so integral to the outlook, we believe uncertainty associated with the elections implies valuations will remain under pressure until at least August,” the bank concludes.jamie.chisholm@ft.com
259;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-16T16:10:13Z;UAE criticises Dassault’s Rafale terms;;France’s bid to sell fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates suffered its second blow in less than a week on Wednesday when Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, criticised Dassault, maker of the Rafale aircraft, and its terms for a deal.France has been working towards an order for the Rafale for more than three years but, earlier this week, it emerged that the UAE was considering the purchase of the rival Eurofighter Typhoon for its air force.“Dassault seem unaware that all the diplomatic and political will in the world cannot overcome uncompetitive and unworkable commercial terms,” Sheikh Mohammed told the UAE’s state news service on Wednesday.Under Nicolas Sarkozy, the French government has strengthened its ties with the UAE. In 2009, France opened its first overseas base in 50 years in Abu Dhabi. Furthermore in 2007, the two governments signed a deal to build a branch of the Louvre in the emirate, a project which is now delayed.France has been pushing the sale of Rafale aircraft abroad for several years but has yet to find a buyer. The Typhoon, by contrast, has won orders in both Austria and Saudi Arabia, in addition to the four “launch” nations that collaborated on developing the jet in Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain.Talks on the Rafale broke down a year ago over an article published in Le Figaro newspaper, owned by politician Serge Dassault, whose family-controlled company makes the aircraft, according to reports. The article suggested that the UAE used Israeli technology to help secure its borders.However, one person close to the deal said the sticking point is commercial: “Everybody’s bettered their offer.”Dassault declined to comment on Wednesday.Eurofighter, the consortium maker of the Typhoon, confirmed on Sunday that the UAE had approached the UK government for a briefing on the Typhoon and its capabilities. The request was for an offer to supply 60 jets.Eurofighter is a consortium comprising BAE Systems of the UK, Finmeccanica of Italy and the pan-European aerospace group EADS.The UAE air force’s combat fleet is composed of about 60 Lockheed Martin F-16s and 60 older Mirage 2000s, which are made by Dassault.French policymakers had expressed confidence that they were very close to signing a deal. The most recent bout of optimism on the possibility of sales of the Rafale came in September after a visit to Paris by Sheikh Mohammed.Additional reporting by John O’Doherty in London
260;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
261;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-11T16:29:25Z;Military transport: US prepares to lose its lead on the heavy lifters;The Airbus A400M is just the first of many, reports John O’Doherty;Relatively unglamorous they may be, but military transport aircraft are vital workhorses for modern armies.Now the world of these delivery trucks of the sky is set for a shake-up, as the production of long-dominant aircraft winds down and new competitors come to market.One of the transporters facing an uncertain fate is the Boeing C-17, the workhorse of the US Air Force – which has more than 160 of the aircraft.Australia, Canada and the UK also operate C-17s – it is used by the Royal Air Force for the “air bridge” between the UK and Afghanistan, transporting troops, armoured vehicles and medical evacuees.But orders for the big jet are winding down, and in January Boeing cut the number of people working on the C17 production line by 1,100 people.The company says it has enough orders to keep the line going until 2014, but most analysts say that, even with some orders from India, production is likely to come to an end by about 2016. The parsimony of belt-tightening governments is unlikely to be able to prolong the production run much further.“The C-17 is the platform of choice, but governments just don’t have the money at the moment to buy any more,” says Elizabeth Quintana, senior research fellow in air power at the Royal United Services Institute, the UK think-tank.She adds: “So, by 2020 there will be a gap in airlift capability, certainly in the UK if not across Europe. Everybody knows that they don’t have enough, and the operations in Libya have highlighted this.”The production run of Lockheed Martin’s C-5 Galaxy has already ended, so when production of the C-17 stops, the largest western transporter will be the newly launched A400M from Airbus, the subsidiary of the pan-European EADS.The A400M was plagued by political wrangling and technical problems in its development phase, but the aircraft is completing testing and France will take delivery of the first batch in 2013.While the A400M should benefit from the phasing out of the C-17, it will not be able to replace the older aircraft completely. The A400M, which has turboprop engines, can land on unprepared airstrips. But it cannot carry as much as the C-17.This gap could be a boon for transporters made by other countries. These include Russia’s IL-476, and possibly Ukraine’s An-70, which is under development by Antonov.The part of the industry that caters to smaller payload requirements is also facing in a shake-up.Here again, the dominant incumbent is American – the Lockheed Martin C-130J, the latest version of the long-lived C-130 Hercules, which is smaller than the A400M.The C-130J is not facing any imminent end to production, but analysts reckon that could come in 2020.Even before that, though, the C-130J is facing competition from Embraer, the Brazilian aerospace group. It is developing the KC-390, which is similar in size to the C-130J.“The KC-390 has already begun to affect the C-130’s traditional market space,” explains Craig Caffrey, an aerospace analyst at IHS Jane’s.“Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, and Portugal have all stated an intent to join the Brazilian programme to, in most cases, replace ageing C-130 fleets.“If Embraer can keep the unit cost low, then it should be a genuine contender for many countries that require a 20-tonne-payload transport aircraft.“It will be extremely difficult for any new US transport aircraft to obtain the kind of market dominance the C-130 has enjoyed for the past 50 years.”Even as the A400M and KC-390 move to occupy a larger share of airlift fleets, other countries are also building up capacity in transport aircraft.Kawasaki is working on the C-2 for the country’s air self-defence forces. However, it is unlikely to have anything but a small impact on the global market for military aircraft, as the country’s pacifist constitution prohibits exports of almost all types of defence equipment.However, a transport aircraft with greater export potential may in due course come from China.While the number of suppliers of military transporters looks set to grow in the next 20 years, one type of technology looks likely to remain on the sidelines: the airship.The merits of a military airship have long been of potential interest to defence planners – designs have been put forward that can theoretically carry more than 10 times the 77-tonne payload of a C-17. But in conflict zones, a slow and unmanoeuvrable airship would be extremely vulnerable to attack.However, says Joel Hayward, dean of the UK’s Royal Air Force College: “In terms of moving stuff and people over long distances in a safe, benign environment [the airship] has tremendous potential,” .“But it sits in the realm of futurism. There’s no credible development of any airship at the moment.”
262;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-11T16:29:19Z;Procurement: Sellers of fast jets target ageing aircraft fleets;Defence companies may have found a sweet spot, says John O’Doherty;It is a curious time for the makers of fighter jets. Their traditional markets in the developed world are hit by delays and cash-strapped customers, yet a boom in demand for defence equipment from emerging markets is throwing up a host of opportunities.Such opportunities are being chased the more eagerly by defence groups, because many countries, including Brazil, India and Japan, are still open to competition, whereas most of the developed countries that are in the market for aircraft have already decided what they will buy.The two largest programmes for fighter jets in the US and Europe are the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter built by Lockheed Martin, and the Eurofighter Typhoon, made by a consortium of UK-based BAE Systems, Finmeccanica of Italy and the pan-European aerospace group EADS.The F-35 has been subject to several delays and cost overruns, while European governments have long been wrangling over the number of Typhoons they will buy.Most observers expect that no new Typhoon contract will be signed by the four existing partner nations of Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.But perhaps the most important feature of these two programmes is that in spite of the delays and arguments, the final decision of who will buy which aircraft has largely been settled.The US and the leading European powers have generally decided which aircraft will feature in their air forces in 15 years time.But this picture of delays within a broader context of certainty over the type of aircraft being chosen contrasts with the rest of the world, where several countries plan to buy jets but have yet to decide which.Analysts reckon these emerging markets represent a great opportunity because a fleet of existing fighter jets is coming up for replacement.Craig Caffrey, an aerospace analyst at IHS Janes, says: “Several nations are flying [Lockheed Martin] F-16s and others are flying [Dassault] Mirages.“As both of these aircraft approach the end of their lives, everyone is looking for a new jet at the same time.”The biggest prize for western jet makers at present is the Indian multirole combat aircraft competition, which will see an $11bn order for 126 fighter jets to replace India’s ageing Russian-built MiG-21s.European industry is in the lead, after a decision in April by the Indian government to select the Typhoon and the Rafale, made by France’s Dassault, for further evaluation before reaching a final decision possibly late this year.The selection of two European options came as a blow to the US, as both Boeing and Lockheed Martin had competed in earlier stages of the competition with the F-18 and an updated version of the F-16, respectively.However, the US may have been hobbled by not offering its more advanced aircraft, whose technology is closely guarded.Given that India is already collaborating on an advanced aircraft with Russia, and US-India relations have improved in recent years, some analysts say the decision to select only European aircraft was an attempt to maintain a strategic balance.Brazil is also in the crosshairs of the jet-makers.Its air force is now tendering for 36 fighter jets as part of a deal worth about $5bn, but that could grow ultimately to 100 fighters.The country currently operates a mixture of US-made Northrop Grumman F-5s, Dassault Mirages and A1s made by the Italian-Brazilian joint venture AMX. Boeing is offering the F-18 Super Hornet, while Dassault is offering the Rafale. Saab of Sweden’s is offering the Gripen, which is seen as a lower-performance but lower-cost option.The assiduous courting of Brazil by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, very nearly meant that the contract was a done deal for the Rafale, which has yet to secure an export customer.But Dassault’s hopes were dashed when the newly elected successor of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Dilma Rousseff, stated that any decision would be pushed back until 2012.The subsequent appointment of a new defence minister in August this year – whose predecessor had been defence minister in both the Lula and Rousseff administrations – is now seen as a further reducing the chances for Dassault.Japan is another market that is also looking attractive for defence groups.Long the preserve of US manufacturers, the country has said it is open to buying Typhoons. Tokyo wants about 42 fighters, with a decision due to made by December.But regardless of which jets are bought by Japan, Brazil and India, the ultimate significance of the purchases may lie less in which defence group wins the contract, and more in the shift in the overall market for jets to the south and east.“Western requirements seem to be shrinking at the same time as those in emerging markets are growing,” says Mr Caffrey at IHS Janes.“The growth within the fighter market is almost completely coming from outside Europe and North America.”
263;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-11T16:28:48Z;Middle East: Gulf states start to call the shots on fighter jets;Manufacturers in the west are having to rethink their strategy, explains James Blitz;The Middle East has long been a prized region for aerospace manufacturers wanting to sell combat jets and trainers.But the competition to sell to the leading potential buyers in the region – most notably Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates – is set to become increasingly fraught in the next few years.Western defence companies have had a great deal of success selling to these states. The consortium that produces the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter – the pan-European EADS, UK-based BAE Systems and Finmeccanica of Italy – has sold a significant first tranche of jets to Saudi Arabia. Among US manufacturers, Boeing has sold its F-18 combat jet in the region, while Lockheed Martin has notched up sales of its F-16.However, after a long period of sales achievements, some leading figures in the defence industry believe the going will grow much tougher.“There is certainly an interesting sustainability issue for the UK,” says Sir Brian Burridge, vice-president for strategic marketing at Finmeccanica.“Saudi Arabia has bought two products – Typhoon and Tornado [built by the UK-German-Italian Panavia Aircraft consortium] – in numbers. But if we leap forward nine years, that part of the export market will have changed.”Another leading figure in the European defence industry agrees. “There is certainly a lot of modernisation of air forces taking place in the Gulf states and that will continue,” he says.“But it will be at the pace that purchasing countries want to run at, not one that can really be dictated by the defence companies. “In all of these sales, leading defence figures say that several factors are crucial to success. First and foremost is how technologically advanced the aircraft are. The British certainly believe, for instance, that the Typhoon – which has recently performed well in UK operations in Libya – has a competitive edge.“Thanks to Libya, we know that Typhoon is the best fourth-generation, medium-range combat aircraft on the market,” says a senior UK ministry of defence official.“If you are serious about capability, you have to buy Typhoon. France and the US will compete strongly, but if you buy the [Dassault] Rafale or the F-18 you want to be certain you will not ever be in combat against a country deploying Typhoon.”A second factor influencing sales is the broader industrial benefit that can be given to the country buying the aircraft.All purchasers are looking to reach offset agreements that secure additional benefits beyond the provision of the fighter. Such terms could include the buying country striking a deal to maintain or make part of the aircraft, or even securing investment by the vendor in other industries.There is a third factor, however, which plays to US strengths and which could prove decisive.The Gulf states will always view any purchase as an opportunity to underpin the broader security relationships they have with western governments, especially the US. Saudi Arabia looks to the US to be a key ally in the event of any conflict with Iran. This is particularly significant given Iran’s possible ambition to develop a nuclear weapon.“The US guarantee of security is a significantly strong card,” says a leading defence contractor. “It is not implausible that President Obama would phone King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to press home his points on any arms sale. In other markets that doesn’t apply. But here, that can have resonance.”Graham Chisnall of ADS Group, a defence industry trade body, agrees. “Clearly all big defence purchases are diplomatic gestures and mostly government-to-government arrangements.“Each procurement justifies itself in its own right. But it always takes place in a wider diplomatic context and that can be important.”In the years to come, aerospace manufacturers may well be looking to other states for sales. India has opened the final sealed bids in its fighter jet tender, the biggest in the world this year.Japan is undertaking a tender exercise for the replacement of its Phantom jets, while South Korea is also looking to revamp its fast-jet fleet.Meanwhile, defence companies may have to think harder about what kinds of equipment to sell to the Gulf states.“The Gulf will always be a market for defence aerospace,” says Sir Brian at Finmeccanica. “But in the years ahead, sales of combat ships may be the kind of area that compensates for declining jet sales.”
264;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-11T16:28:28Z;Overview: Eastern dawn lightens the gloom;Emerging markets are the best hope for makers of civil and military aircraft;The aviation industry’s recovery in 2010 after two years of recession-induced losses looks as if it will be shortlived. Many airlines are braced for reduced full-year profits or losses again in 2011 and 2012 because of slowing economic growth or stagnation in western countries.This may have negative repercussions for the commercial aircraft makers, led by Boeing and Airbus. Their healthy order books could be damaged if airlines respond to the deteriorating economic environment by cancelling aircraft or pushing back their delivery dates.The manufacturers are part of larger groups that are already adjusting to reduced defence spending by western governments focusing on repairing budget deficits. Both the commercial and the defence sides of these groups are likely to find some of their best business in emerging markets in the coming years.At the Dubai air show, which runs from November 13 to 17, one of the big talking points will therefore be the prospects for the airlines and aircraft makers amid a combination of weak economic growth and high fuel prices.Investors were alarmed by the September 20 profit warning from Lufthansa, Europe’s largest airline by revenue. That was blamed on disappointing passenger bookings. One week later Cathay Pacific, the world’s third largest air cargo carrier, said freight volumes may fall by more than 10 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year.Then, on October 3, shares in AMR, parent of American Airlines, plunged 33 per cent on fears the airline may file for bankruptcy because of operating costs higher than at rivals. So far this year, the Datastream index of global airlines is down 27 per cent.“The industry is brittle,” says Tony Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, the main representative body for the airlines. “Any shock has the potential to put us in the red.”The airline industry made a combined net profit of $16bn in 2010, according to Iata, but the airline body expects this figure to fall to $6.9bn in 2011 and $4.9bn in 2012.While air travel continues to rise on a long-term basis – there were 2.7bn passengers last year – it is closely correlated to gross domestic product. In September the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts for this year and next, citing the EU sovereign debt crisis and the weak US economy.Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, predicts that European flag-carrier airlines will in the coming months see a fall in demand for business – so-called premium – travel, particularly on long-haul routes over the north Atlantic. This would particularly hit the flag carriers’ profitability because, unlike low-cost airlines, they generate about 50 per cent of their revenue from business passengers.“Our caution towards flag carriers is based on a view that premium traffic is going to tumble,“ says Mr Lobbenberg. He adds that the weak economic environment will act as a spur to further consolidation between airlines. “As economic conditions deteriorate, we expect consolidation to rise up the agenda,” he says.Tie-ups between US carriers over the past three years have meant that they are responding to high fuel costs this year by cutting seating capacity, in a move that has given them the opportunity to raise fares.In Europe, by contrast, where there are still too many airlines, flag carriers are still planning to increase seating capacity.Geoff van Klaveren, analyst at Deutsche Bank, says: “The European carriers still focus too much on empire-building rather than shareholder value, and should be more conservative with capacity – especially with low economic growth and high oil prices. Perhaps one of the reasons why European airlines have continued to add capacity is that they don’t want to lose market share to Gulf rivals.”These Middle East companies – Emirates of Dubai, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and Qatar Airways – are threatening to inflict as much pain on European flag carriers on long-haul routes to Asia as low-cost airlines have inside the EU.But for the aircraft makers, the Middle East airlines are extremely important customers. Emirates, for example, is the biggest operator of the Airbus A380 superjumbo, with 17 already in its fleet and a further 73 on order.Such deals are a sign of how Boeing of the US and Airbus, owned by EADS, the European aerospace company, hope to be insulated from another aviation downturn by their large order books.Much of the backlog consists of orders from airlines in emerging markets, which have better growth prospects than western countries. Furthermore, many of the orders from airlines in developed markets are for more fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft that will replace ageing gas guzzlers.Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, the equity research company, says: “[Boeing and Airbus] are likely to see an increasing number of aircraft delivery deferrals, but their long backlogs and the ramp-up of delayed programmes means that adverse impacts on revenues are likely to be very limited, unless the economic downturn deepens and goes on for several years.”Defence manufacturers, meanwhile, are adjusting to the prospect of reduced orders for combat aircraft from their traditional customers in western countries.Development of the F-35 joint strike fighter – by Lockheed Martin of the US – has been hit by delays, leading to predictions that the Pentagon will cut the planned US order of 2,443 aircraft. One option would be to axe the jump-jet version of the F-35.“I think it’s likely the Pentagon will cut the number of F-35s,” says John Louth, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. “My feeling is that one version will get the chop.”Europe is also wrestling with political and budgetary challenges of its own.The Eurofighter Typhoon – built by a European consortium involving EADS, Finmeccanica of Italy and UK-based BAE Systems – has already been delivered to its four launch customers in Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. So far, 285 jets have been delivered to those countries, with a further 187 to come.But as European governments grapple with large budget deficits, they are cutting back defence spending. It now looks all but certain that no new orders will come for the Typhoon from its four launch partner countries, leaving the fighter dependent on winning export customers.This explains why aerospace companies are intensifying their search for deals in emerging markets, where some countries have military ambitions to match their fast-growing economic clout. The Eurofighter consortium is on a shortlist of two suppliers of 126 combat aircraft to India, which could be worth $20bn, while Boeing is hoping to secure orders for its F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet in Brazil, in a deal that could be worth $5bn.If Boeing and EADS can keep a tight rein on the cost of their development programmes – which both companies do not have a distinguished history of doing – they can look forward to a period of rising earnings.This underlines how the aircraft makers have much greater control over their prospects – in stark contrast to the airlines.With few signs of relief in western economies, many airlines are braced for a hard rather than a soft landing over the coming year.

While definitions of what constitutes an APT vary, generally the term is used to designate a cybercrime category directed at business and political targets.Typically APTs require a high degree of stealthiness and the attack takes place over a prolonged period of time. Often they appear motivated by factors beyond immediate financial gain, and compromised systems continue to be of service even after key systems have been breached and initial goals reached.More often than not, the target organisation is unaware of the attack until alerted by a third party such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Secret Service or National Security Agency in the US. Sometimes, but not always, the finger of suspicion points towards individuals or organisations in China.Examples of APT attacks include the well publicised security breaches at Google, Lockheed Martin and RSA, the security division of EMC, and Operation ‘Shady Rat’ the systemic hacking of more than 70 companies and government organisations disclosed earlier this year by McAfee, the security firm now owned by Intel.But as I have been made aware over the past 10 days, these attacks are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg and APT has become the weapon of choice for international industrial espionage.Last week Ernst & Young published the results of the firm’s annual Global Information Security Survey which, aside from sections on both mobile computing and the cloud, included a discussion of APT.Presenting the results, Jose Granado, the practice leader for Information Security Services within E&Y, noted that “over the past 12 months we have been asked to respond to more APT incidents than ever before.” Specifically he said his team has been called in by between 30 and 40 clients to investigate cyber-based intellectual property theft over the past year but added, “that is still a tiny proportion of the hundreds of attacks that probably took place.”In most cases he said the target companies were totally unaware of the attack until they were notified by “an external agency” and he suggested that there is now an urgent need for companies to set up specific teams of security specialists in order to look for unusual network activity and detect these types of attack as they happen.As if to underscore the urgency of the issue, just a few days later Symantec, another leading security vendor, published a report on what it called ‘The Nitro Attacks.’The Symantec report makes chilling reading. Specifically it reveals that computer hackers using a US based server owned by a 20-something-year-old male in the Hebei region of China (dubbed ‘Covert Grove’) attacked 29 companies involved in the research, development and manufacture of chemicals and advanced materials this summer.Symantec’s investigators said, “the goal of the attackers appears to be to collect intellectual property such as design documents, formulas and manufacturing processes.” The attacks started in late July and continued until mid-September.The report concludes, “numerous targeted attack campaigns are occurring every week, however, relative to the total number of attacks, few are fully disclosed. These attacks are primarily targeting private industry in search of key intellectual property for competitive advantage, military institutions and government organisations.”

267;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-04T08:18:54Z;India fighter jet deal soars to $20bn;;An Indian contract to buy 126 fighter jets from one of two European bidders could be worth more than $20bn, almost double the original estimate, according to government officials.The defence ministry revised up its initial $11bn estimate after opening bids on Friday from the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium and France’s Dassault, the maker of the Rafale aircraft, a ministry official told the Financial Times.Identifying the lowest bidder is likely to take up to eight weeks, the ministry said. Thereafter, the proposal would go to the finance ministry for review. The government will choose a lead bidder with whom it will then start negotiating a final price.“Various parameters will be studied to arrive at the lowest bidder,” the ministry official said. “The most important parameter remains the life-cycle cost which is an individual criteria that is added to the total cost.”When the tender to modernise India’s air force, one of the biggest military aviation orders by a single country, was launched more than four years ago, it was estimated at $11bn.In April, India shortlisted Eurofighter and Rafale after eliminating Boeing’s F/A-18, Lockheed Martin’s F-16, Russia’s MiG-35 and Swedish Saab’s Gripen.The defence official said adjustments were being made to the previous estimates of $11bn for the contract as it was based on 2007 figures and needed to reflect current prices.“I suspect there hasn’t been a firm handle on the unit costs for quite a while,” said John Louth, a former RAF officer and deputy head of the Defence Industries and Society programme at the Royal United Services Institute.Mr Louth said that the higher prices do not necessarily mean a jump in profit for the makers of whichever fighter is chosen. “If India is paying $20bn for just the physical aeroplanes, then that’s a fantastic deal [for Eurofighter or Dassault], but that’s not the reality. Much of this increase will be clawed back by the government through the support contracts to maintain the aircraft. There’s only so much money that exchequers can afford.”The decision to choose one of the European aircraft has not prevented the US from making a last-ditch effort to sell advanced fighters to India. The Pentagon this week told the US Congress that it was prepared to provide information to India about the F-35 Lightning II, a fifth-generation fighter aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin.European defence companies have expressed concern that the US might try to short-circuit the bidding process with a new, more attractive offer outside of the terms of the competition.But Indian defence analysts say that the process to choose the multi-role combat aircraft is too far advanced for a U-turn. A sudden departure from the process would dent credibility, they say, at a time when the conduct of India’s bureaucracy is under greater public scrutiny after a number of high profile corruption scandals.Additional reporting by John O’Doherty
268;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-04T00:34:24Z;Cloud computing investment accelerates;;Leading global banks and other members of the Open Data Center Alliance, a group of more than 300 companies representing over $100bn in annual IT spending, are adopting cloud computing much faster than previously thought.Members of the Alliance will triple their cloud deployment in the next two years according to a report published by the organisation on Thursday. This adoption rate is five times faster than broad market forecasts for the $90bn cloud computing market and reflects growing confidence in the delivery of cloud services based on industry standards.The forecast came as the Alliance’s leadership meeting in New York outlined plans to address the main obstacles to cloud adoption, including publication of best practices for cloud application development and resiliency as well as collaborations on potential standards with the leading industry organisations for cloud security and management, the Cloud Security Alliance and Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF).The Open Data Center Alliance was formed a year ago to push for the development of industry standards for security, data center management and cloud-enabled applications and to accelerate of over $50bn in cloud investment over the following three years. It is led by a 12-member board of directors which includes representatives of BMW, Capgemini, China Life, China Unicom, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, Marriott International, National Australia Bank, Terremark, Disney Technology Solutions and Services and UBS.“The ODCA membership comprises some of the largest adopters of cloud computing across the globe. Today’s news illustrates how rapidly our membership is implementing cloud in internal environments and with service providers,” said Marvin Wheeler, Terremark’s chief strategy officer and the Alliance’s chairman. “We’re delighted by the rapid progress to set standards for cloud security and management, and collaboration with data centre industry leaders to deliver open, interoperable cloud solutions.”Among other findings from the recent survey of the membership, over 90 per cent of Alliance members have completed strategic planning for cloud implementation or are actively developing plans for cloud adoption. Internal enterprise is leading cloud adoption growth, with more than 40 per cent of members expecting to run more a significant proportion of their internal IT on cloud-based infrastructure within the next two yearsMore than 30 per cent of the membership identified human resources, legal and finance applications as primary targets for enterprise cloud adoption. Sales and marketing tools were also cited, making these applications the top targets for public cloud implementation.Respondents identified application migration, security and simplified management as the top challenges to broad cloud adoption, underscoring the importance of the collaborative work planned with the DMTF to develope industry standards for managing cloud computing.“Transparent oversight …. is critical to broad adoption of cloud computing,” said Curt Aubley, Lockheed Martin vice president and chief technology officer. “Working with DMTF enables our members to work hand in hand with some of the world’s experts in data centre management. “
269;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;India to open bids for $11bn fighter deal;;India will open final bids on Friday in a $11bn fighter jet tender that has the potential to reshape the fortunes of the European defence industry at a time when companies are suffering from cutbacks in their traditional developed markets.The Eurofighter Typhoon consortium and France’s Dassault are competing to build 126 fighter jets to replace India’s rapidly ageing and depleted fleet of Russian-made MiG-21s, which comprise up to a third of the country’s combat aircraft. A final decision could be made before the end of the year.At the start of 2011, six fighter jets were originally competing for the contract. As well as the Eurofighter Typhoon – built by a consortium of the pan-European EADS, BAE Systems of the UK and Finmeccanica of Italy – Dassault had entered its Rafale jet and the US had two bidders in the form of Lockheed Martin’s F-16 and Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet. Sweden’s Saab proposed its Gripen jet, while Russia offered the MiG-35.In April, India shortlisted only two fighters, both of which were European: Dassault’s Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon. The decision came as a blow to the US, which had invested considerable energy in its bilateral relationship with India, going as far as assistance with civil nuclear projects. However, the American bids were hampered as they were not offering their most advanced jets and because of strong US controls on the transfer of technology to India.The Indian deal is of the utmost importance to the makers of the Eurofighter and the Rafale as they seek new export markets to compensate for the falling defence budgets in the developed world.The Eurofighter consortium is building the Typhoon for its four main customers: the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy. While Austria and Saudi Arabia also operate the jet, there are at present no other firm export orders for the Typhoon. While Eurofighter is promoting the jet in Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, the Indian contract is the most promising.For Dassault, the stakes are perhaps even higher. The Rafale is itself the result of a decision by France to pull out of a pan-European project with Germany, the UK, Spain and Italy to share the development costs of a new fighter that ultimately became the Typhoon.Dassault’s other combat jets such as the Mirage are used by foreign air forces, including India, which decided in July to upgrade their fleet of Mirage 2000s. But Dassault has had more trouble securing interest in the Rafale, which has no customers outside France, although it is hoping to secure sales in Brazil and the United Arab Emirates.Once the sealed bids are known, the Indian Ministry of Defence will start calculating the life-cycle cost of the aircraft, the acquisition cost and military “offset” considerations. These offsets include the amount of technology that European companies will disclose to India and the share of investment they will bring to India’s defence industries if they are chosen.The impending decision has not prevented the US making a last-ditch effort to promote some of its more modern aircraft technology to India. This week the Pentagon told Congress it was prepared to provide information to India about the F-35 Lightning II, a so-called fifth-generation fighter produced by Lockheed Martin.European defence companies have expressed concern the US might try to short-circuit the bidding process with a new offer outside the terms of the competition.
270;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-01T03:56:54Z;Regulation: Lawmakers asked to step into digital age;Data breaches have brought security centre stage, writes Alan Rappeport;US cybersecurity experts say that tough regulations are needed to encourage companies to work harder to protect the data of their customers. However, they fear that government gridlock is allowing the issue to languish.In the past year, several high-profile security breaches have brought cybersecurity to the fore as an important public issue. This applies to companies as well as to private users.Citigroup, Sony, Google, Lockheed Martin and Nasdaq OMX have all faced embarrassing attacks that exposed weaknesses in their systems and put sensitive customer data at risk.Chris Wysopal, founder of Veracode, a cybersecurity company, says that a year ago he surmised it would take several high-profile corporate breaches to spur new legislation – but that now it is unclear what it will take for that to happen.“I guess it will take a constant drumbeat of these breaches and maybe eventually over time, things will change,” Mr Wysopal says. “Or maybe the breaches have to be bigger.”The recent spate of attacks has generated interest in legislation with real teeth, but also pushback from companies fearful of regulatory over-reach.Last May, the Obama administration outlined a proposal that would give the US government the power to review plans that private owners of infrastructure had in place to defend against malicious hackers.The White House also called for a US law that would force companies to disclose the loss of customer data to users and federal authorities.In September, Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, introduced data breach and security legislation that would punish companies for failing to comply with minimum safeguards, require prompt notification of breaches and promote better sharing of technical information.Mr Blumenthal said: “My goal is to prevent and deter data breaches that put people at risk of identity theft and other serious harm, both by helping protect consumers’ data before breaches occur, and by holding entities accountable when consumers’ personally identifiable information is compromised.”He continued: “Systems to safeguard such private personal information, and prompt notification in cases of breach, both should be required, along with consumer remedies to compensate for any harm.”Republicans in Congress have called for increased information sharing about security threats between government officials and key industries.They have also asked for the Department of Homeland Security to obtain more support from the defence department.The Republican proposal, however, favours companies having broader compliance standards and protection from lawsuits.In spite of these efforts, political gridlock in the US has dimmed hopes that a law will be created in the near future.“The US government is so dysfunctional right now that nothing will happen,” says Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert. “There’s lots of talk, but no real action.”According to Mr Schneier, the US would benefit from a more “cumbersome” approach that challenges companies.He points to Europe’s data protection act and laws in California as models that would be helpful on a national level in the US, but says that companies have been pushing hard for more exemptions to avoid additional costs and negative publicity.Mr Wysopal says that companies would benefit from national cybersecurity legislation, because it would simplify their problem of navigating the laws that apply in the different US states.He says that there needs to be a lower threshold for corporate “negligence” when lawsuits are filed against companies for data breaches, so those companies have a stronger business case for investing in security measures.“Now it’s just about brand damage,” Mr Wysopal says.“The whole issue is that people with poor security should have liability.”Meanwhile, the threats are only becoming more challenging, as an evolving ecosystem of devices and software becomes available to new digital users.The quickly shifting landscape will put added pressure on lawmakers and regulators to act quickly.According to the Georgia Tech 2012 Emerging Cyber Threats report, mobile browsers, “apps” and cloud computing are presenting new and vulnerable targets for cybercriminals.Because mobile devices and browsers are infrequently updated or patched, they are rife with security holes.“Mobile applications are increasingly reliant on the browser,” says Patrick Traynor, assistant professor at the Georgia Tech School of Computer Science.“As a result, we expect more web-based attacks against mobile devices in the coming year.”
271;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-11-01T03:56:50Z;Viruses: Era of targeted attacks is here to stay;A new kind of risk has been found, says Maija Palmer;"Just in case anyone was starting to feel complacent, re­searchers have just discovered a new, highly sophisticated virus that appears to be designed to collect information secretly from European and Middle Eastern companies.Dubbed Duqu the virus is similar to Stuxnet, which was uncovered in 2010 and apparently designed to spy on and disrupt Iran’s nuclear programme.Stuxnet, believed to have been created by a government agency, alarmed IT security professionals because it was so highly targeted and was one of the first times that a piece of malware was able to cause real-world effects in terms of damaging Iranian nuclear reactors.The discovery of Duqu confirms that the era of cyberthreats is here to stay. Although no one knows quite what Duqu has been created for, it appears to be mining companies for data.Over the past two years, IT security experts say they have seen more of these kinds of attacks – known as targeted attacks or advanced persistent threats (APTs) – on computer networks.Hacking attacks in the past used to be widespread and scattergun; for example, sending millions of people an email tricking them into revealing bank details, or hijacking their computer to send out spam messages.By contrast, an APT is focused on just a few people in an organisation and designed in such a way that it goes unnoticed while it begins a slow and painstaking probe of the network.Duqu has only been found in some two dozen organisations so far, and security experts are still not sure how it was implanted.Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, the IT security company, says: “In advanced persistent threats, an email might be sent to just one company. In will be highly tailored to look authentic, it will be in the right language with the right content, and it tends to go completely unnoticed.”In one case, a director at a UK defence company had a virus on his laptop that had been leaking sensitive details for 18 months before it was discovered.Defence companies in general came under attack this year in a complex, two-stage operation. First, software was stolen from RSA, the security company, which compromised security tokens that it had issued. A month or two later, defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin, which used these RSA tokens, came under a highly specific assault.Leaked documents this year also showed that companies including DuPont, Walt Disney, Johnson & Johnson, and General Electric had been hit, as well as law firms and insurance companies. Investment banks such as Morgan Stanley have been attacked and the world’s biggest oil and energy companies have been infiltrated.Henry Harrison, technical director at Detica, a technology consulting company owned by BAE Systems, the UK defence group, says: “People are realising this is something they should be worried about. When we talked about this a year ago, they didn’t understand why, but now there has been a change in the level of awareness.”Malcolm Marshall, UK head of information security at KPMG, the professional services firm, says: “Companies have to accept this is inevitable, and begin preparing for how to deal with an attack.”About 50 per cent of the security work KPMG does is with companies that have been subject to such an attack. One of the problems in dealing with APTs is that most appear to come from foreign nation states, such as China and Russia, although the origin of the attack is almost impossible to prove.When Google revealed its email systems had been the subject of a targeted attack in late 2009, it pointed the finger at China. Privately, security professionals talk about the fact that many attacks happen during the Chinese working day.It is hard for companies to get redress when the threat comes from these quarters, but practical steps can be taken.One is to look for unusual network activity. If a developer’s laptop begins connecting to an internet address halfway across the world in the middle of the night, for example, it could be a sign of a spy program at work, says Mr Hypponen.Once rogue activity is detected, it is worth gathering evidence for a while, rather than removing the malware straight away.Security experts say it is worth trying to find out as much about the attackers as possible, and seeing what they are looking for.Mr Marshall says: “Having an idea of who is attacking you is helpful for getting a sense of what you need to do to protect yourself, even if being able to prove it in court and litigating is not possible.”Protecting everything in the corporate network is too expensive, but companies can identify their ”crown jewels” and put extra security around these parts of the system.The good news is that targeted attacks can take time to carry out, which means they can be thwarted before critical information has been compromised.Mr Harrison says: “The traditional view was that when someone got into the network, the company had already lost the battle.“But in these attacks, the hackers are looking for specific information and it can take them weeks or even months to find it,” he says.“Companies should not despair. It requires thinking about security in a different way, but there are things they can do.”"

But Peter Nesvold at Jefferies said investors were overreacting to the overspend on product launches in the fourth quarter of 2010.“Product launches slated for this year are much lower, and I don’t think margins are going to be squeezed by that as much as investors think,” Mr Nesvold said.The S&P 500 ended the day up 1.1 per cent to 1,242, after a late spurt fuelled by reports that French President Nicolas Sarkozy will talk to his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao today about contributions to the eurozone crisis fund.“A favourable outcome to the Europeans negotiations seems to be increasingly priced into the markets,” said Channing Smith at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “But its all talk for now, and without concrete plans we’re unlikely to buy into the rally.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4 per cent to 11,869.04, helped by a good day for Boeing. The Seattle-based aircraft and defence group jumped 4.5 per cent to $66.56 after it said it would take a profit from the first 1,100 sales of its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Fears that the expensive Dreamliner would take some time to reach profitability had weighed on the stock.The Nasdaq Composite index lagged behind the other two principal indices, up only 0.5 per cent to 2,650.67, as shares in online retailer Amazon, one of the biggest components of the index, plunged 12.7 per cent.Amazon closed at $198.40 after the company said it might report a loss in the fourth quarter due to expenditure on product development. Amazon has been profitable since 2002, but R&D expenditure has more than doubled from $300m at the start of 2009, forcing the company’s operating margin down from above 4 per cent to under 1 per cent over the same period.A relief rally in shares of solar panel manufacturer First Solar sent the stock up 6.6 per cent. The company rushed out quarterly results to calm investors following the unexplained departure of chief executive Rob Gillette on Tuesday afternoon. Results were poor, with earnings per share of 70 cents for the quarter down almost 50 per cent from the previous quarter and almost two-thirds from the same quarter of 2010But shares rallied as much as 15 per cent before closing at $46.11. That leaves the stock off 7.9 per cent for the week, after the company lost 25 per cent of its market capitalisation on Tuesday.“There were all kinds of rumours around when the chief left suddenly,” said Jeff Osborne at Stifel Nicolaus, “this gives some visibility to investors.”Lockheed Martin, the defence conglomerate, fell 3.2 per cent to $76.35, despite increasing its full-year earnings guidance as it announced healthy quarterly results.The company said 2011 profit would be between $7.40 and $7.60 a share. That was an increase of 5 cents at both ends of the range compared with the forecast made in July.But Lockheed said profit in 2012 would be flat at best, with pension costs posing downside risk.Oil refiner Valero was up 15.2 per cent to $25.11 on reports larger rivals may bid for the company. That put the stock marginally in the black for the week, after heavy selling on Monday and Tuesday, in response to a narrowing of the spread between WTI crude oil and Brent. The narrower spread erodes the margins Valero earns by sourcing some of its oil from cheaper sources.For-profit education provider Devry fell 16.8 per cent to $38.36 after the company saw profits fall 22 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2010. For-profit colleges have seen enrolments plunge.Sprint Nextel fell 7 per cent to $2.51 after the company said it would have to raise between $5bn and $7bn towards capital expenditure on projects, including a wireless network upgrade.The third-largest US mobile phone network beat analyst estimates on quarterly earnings, with net losses of $301m, or 10 cents per share, on revenue of $8.3bn.Computer network and data storage provider F5 Networks jumped 14.1 per cent to $101.26, after beating analyst forecasts with strong earnings.Fears of a slowdown in government and corporate IT spending have weighed on tech stocks, but Paul Silverstein at Credit Suisse, said F5 was “leveraged to the strongest secular tech growth drivers including data centre consolidation …cloud computing adoption and storage growth.”Express Scripts, a company which fills medical prescriptions, rose 13.5 per cent to $43.66 after earnings rose almost 10 per cent compared to the same quarter last year, boosted by a small increase in margins.Walgreen fell 1.7 per cent to $33.25 after Express’ chief executive George Paz told analysts on an earnings call that it is “less and less likely” that the company would reach an agreement for Express clients to keep filling prescriptions at Walgreen pharmacies.
273;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Pentagon squeezes defence contractors;;The Pentagon is insisting that defence contractors take on more of the costs of developing new military technology, as the defence department attempts to cut spending, according to two of the US government’s top contractors.Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by revenues, said on Wednesday that the Pentagon had taken a tougher line with the company in its negotiations over its flagship project, the F-35 fighter jet, the biggest military procurement programme US in history, worth $382bn.Bob Stevens, chief executive, said that as part of the latest round of negotiations the government was demanding that the company bear a greater share of the “concurrency” risk – the possibility that early, already-built F-35s have to be altered following flight tests.Mr Stevens said the Pentagon had also refused to pre-pay for certain “long-lead” components – such as titanium parts that must be bought years in advance because they take so long to make – forcing Lockheed to rack up $750m in potential liabilities should the programme be terminated.Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, which won a $35bn contract this year to build aerial refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, said his company was seeing similar pressures. “We do see an overall trend, which is tighter contracting and incrementally more risk on the contractor,” he said.The Pentagon has agreed to find about $500bn in savings as part of efforts to cut the federal deficit and could be hit by another round of cuts if Congress cannot conclude a broader debt deal.The two companies made the comments as they reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter and raised their full-year outlooks.Boeing made a net profit of $1.1bn or $1.46 per share in the quarter, up from $837m or $1.12 per share in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $1.10 per share.The company raised its 2011 earnings per share guidance to $4.30-$4.40 per share from its prior forecast of $3.90-$4.10., as international defence sales helped offset domestic pressure and commercial revenues continued to improve.Lockheed reported net income from continuing operations of $655m or $1.99 per share, up from $557m or $1.33 per share a year earlier, and ahead of the $1.81 per share analysts had expected.The company raised its 2011 full-year earnings forecast to $7.40-$7.60 per share, up from its prior guidance of $7.35-$7.55.However, Lockheed warned that even in it most optimistic scenario, 2012 revenues were likely to be flat and profits could be hurt by additional pension costs.Boeing shares were up 4.6 per cent at $66.64 by midday in New York. Lockheed was down 3.2 per cent at $76.38.
274;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Clinton warns Iran over expanding influence;;Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, warned Iran about trying to expand its influence in Iraq when the US military pulls out at the end of the year, telling the Islamic regime not to “miscalculate” the extent of Washington’s support for Baghdad.Her warning comes amid increasing fears that Iran will use its proxies in Iraq to gain greater political and military control of its neighbour, following President Barack Obama’s announcement on Friday that all 46,000 US troops would leave Iraq by the end of the year.“In addition to a very significant diplomatic presence in Iraq . . . we have bases in neighbouring countries, we have our Nato ally in Turkey, we have a lot of presence in that region,” Mrs Clinton told CNN on Sunday.“So no one, most particularly Iran, should miscalculate about our continuing commitment to and with the Iraqis going forward,” she said from Uzbekistan, near the end of a trip around central Asia and the Middle East.In a separate interview with CNN, President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad of Iran was asked if his government would be interested in training and support in Iraq.“I think we should have done it sooner, maybe seven or eight years ago,” Mr Ahmadi-Nejad responded.Mr Obama decided to order a complete pull-out of US troops from Iraq after his administration failed to reach a deal with Iraq’s fractured government that would have allowed a small American training force to remain in the country next year.Baghdad and Washington had been in discussions for months about the size and scope of a continued US mission in Iraq, with senior Pentagon officials expressing certainty that there would be some kind of residual force involving several thousand American military trainers.The top US commanders in Iraq had been lobbying for at least 18,000 troops to remain, but the administration was working on a plan that would have seen between 3,000 and 5,000 stay behind.All Iraqi political blocs, with the exception of the Iran-backed Sadrists, wanted some American troops to remain to help train Iraqi security forces but they could not agree to the US’s non-negotiable requirement that US troops had to be immune from prosecution under Iraqi law.Some analysts have warned that a smaller US military presence could leave Iraq vulnerable to greater Iranian influence.Shia militias backed by Iran, notably the Mahdi Army led by the firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, have vehemently opposed any continued US presence and have stepped up violent attacks this year. They will probably now take the credit for “forcing out” the American military.John McCain, the former Republican presidential contender and ranking member on the Senate’s armed services committee, called Mr Obama’s decision “a serious mistake”.“There was never really serious negotiation between the administration and the Iraqis. They could have clearly made an arrangement for US troops,” Mr McCain told ABC News from the World Economic Forum meeting in Jordan.“I'm here in the region and yes, it is viewed in the region as a victory for the Iranians . . . Sadr just announced that, once the military is gone, that embassy personnel will be targets,” he said.But Leon Panetta, the defence secretary, expressed confidence Iraq would be able to deal with any threat from Iran-backed militants after the US withdrawal.“Iraq itself has developed an effective force to be able to deal with those threats,” Mr Panetta told reporters after meeting with south-east Asian defence ministers on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, according to Reuters.“And what we've seen in the past when we had concerns about what Iran was doing was that Iraq itself conducted operations against those Shia extremist groups . . . They did it in conjunction with our support and we thought they did a great job. And they'll continue to do that,” he said.In his announcement on Friday, Mr Obama appeared to leave open the possibility of helping Iraq with military training at some stage in the future. “We will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces, just as we offer training and assistance to countries around the world,” he said.Mrs Clinton echoed that on Sunday, saying there would be a “support and training mission” in addition to the usual military personnel that work in the US embassy.“This will be run out of an office of security co-operation. It will be comparable to what we’ve done in many countries where we handle military sales,” she said. The Iraqi government recently bought M1A1 Abrams tanks from the US and has put in an order for 18F-16 fighter jets, which its pilots will require training to fly.Lockheed Martin, the maker of the aircraft, also has a contract to train the pilots.
275;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-10-12T18:01:20Z;BAE Systems: off-target;With defence spending falling, the group needs to set its sights elsewhere;"BAE Systems styles itself the world’s second-largest defence company by revenue (£22bn in 2010). But for how much longer? Defence spending is shrinking in the company’s two main markets, the US and UK. Its trading update on Wednesday confirmed an uninspiring outlook. With four years of chronic share price underperformance under its wing, BAE is an ex-growth stock in a no-growth environment. Chief executive Ian King should be looking to change the narrative.The question is how to do so. BAE is barely on page one of the textbook for increasing shareholder value. It announced a £500m share repurchase scheme in July, to accompany half-year figures. But that is a sign of a company that has more cash than strategy; a modest share buy-back is not going to move BAE’s £9bn market capitalisation (nor should it in theory). BAE has been adding small acquisitions to build up a cybersecurity division. But neither route addresses BAE’s problem, which is that, with 95 per cent of its revenues defence-related, its earnings momentum is stuck on zero.BAE is cutting costs aggressively. It is shedding 3,000 UK jobs, on top of 15,000 positions lost globally in the past two years. Important as cost management is, it will not by itself do much to close BAE’s hefty valuation discount to US peers. The trouble is that it has few realistic options. It has been streamlining its operating divisions back to the core, so it has nothing substantial to sell.A break-up or transforming merger looks unrealistic. A pension deficit of £4.3bn and liabilities of £22bn at the end of June argue against the former; the latter is stymied by the lack of visibility on defence spending – which also limits the scope for a takeover. BAE shares have returned a negative 12 per cent this year; Lockheed Martin a positive 13 per cent.

276;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-10-10T16:43:12Z;Defence groups turn to cybersecurity;FT series: Sector shifts to resist online threat;Inside the Silicon Valley offices of Narus, an obscure internet traffic analysis business, Greg Oslan is plotting the future for Boeing.Boeing bought Mr Oslan’s small company last year, attracted by Narus technology that can detect malicious internet traffic in an ocean of data. This may seem far afield for Boeing, known primarily for building aircraft. But through Narus, the 95-year-old aerospace company gained a piece of the hottest area of the defence industry: cybersecurity.The internet is turning the defence industry on its head, just as it transformed media, retail and other sectors before it.“We have moved from hackers having fun, to a wave of organised crime, to more sophisticated ‘malware’ being used as a threat to a country’s way of life,” says Mr Oslan, who also runs Boeing’s cybersecurity business.For decades, Boeing and rivals such as Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin built the aircraft and heavy equipment needed to fight wars – making the companies charter members of what former US president Dwight Eisenhower famously referred to as the “military-industrial complex”.Today, those same companies are investing heavily to create a cyber-industrial complex, a development likely to have vast consequences for the future of the internet.Major military contractors have been expanding into cybersecurity by acquiring smaller, specialist firms. This graphic highlights the deals shaping the emerging cyber-war industrial complexThe market for cyberarms is thriving in the wake of high-profile attacks, such as Russia’s alleged attack on Estonian government websites in 2007 and the Stuxnet attack last year on Iran’s nuclear programme. An array of companies now sell software to the US government that can break into and degrade or destroy an enemy’s computer network, as well as programmes aimed at blocking such attacks.“There is a feeding frenzy right now to provide products and services to meet the demands of governments, law enforcement and the military,” says Ron Deibert, a University of Toronto expert on internet freedom and director of the Canada Centre for Global Security Studies.Boeing and its rivals are expanding largely through acquisition. More than a dozen buy-outs of cybercompanies have been announced this year, according to the advisers ERG Partners – double the number than in 2010. These companies have sold for as much as $1.8bn, the price paid by private investment firm Providence Equity Partners for SRA International, a defence consulting company. SRA employs 1,000 people in its cybersecurity arm and its customers include the US army, navy and air force.SRA says it “offers everything that’s required to build a strong defence against the cyberthreat”, including Cybergami, a tool for visualising where data are moving on a network.Most of the companies getting snapped up are smaller than SRA, but still attract premiums. ERG calculates that because of the demand they typically fetch 20 per cent more for their cash flow than other private intelligence industry companies.Join the conversation: Put your questions on #cyber warfare to the FT’s @josephmenn on Tues at 3pm UK time (10am EST)“Cybersecurity will remain a key focus area” for acquirers because it supports “key national security priorities,” ERG said in September.Hundreds of specialist firms have popped up outside Washington, in the state of Maryland, home to the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command. The spate of start-ups is pushing overall information technology employment in the greater Washington area to more than 280,000 – more than in Silicon Valley or New York City.“We see a tremendous boom,” says J. Thomas Sadowski, chief executive of the Economic Alliance of Greater Baltimore. Most of the new companies have fewer than 100 employees and many team up for government deals with big defence contractors, which sometimes buy them outright.Clustered in bland office parks near the defence agencies, some firms are created by reformed prankster hackers and others by military veterans. Outwardly, they tout their ability to protect networks from attack, while also quietly offering tools to penetrate the networks of others.The companies are all hoping to get a piece of the growing US budget for cyberarms. US defence, intelligence and homeland security agencies spend $10bn annually on cybersecurity, Deltek estimates. That remains a small fraction of the Pentagon’s annual budget of $600bn, but the figure is expected to climb by at least 9 per cent annually – even as the White House seeks $40bn in annual defence cuts. The Pentagon will have 10,000 people at Cyber Command when fully staffed and far more are employed through outsourcing.“The Obama administration has committed half a billion dollars to develop advanced defensive technologies, including novel approaches to improving network security,” wrote William Lynn, the outgoing deputy secretary of defence, last month in Foreign Affairs. “But much remains to be done, and the window for doing it is short.”Add in what private companies are spending and the cyberarms market is more like $100bn in the US alone, says Kent Schneider, a former army officer and Northrop executive who leads the non-profit Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.That figure includes goods sold to ward off cybercrime gangs that try to steal financial data, as well as goods to protect or attack nations. But the work of gangs, spies and soldiers is increasingly intertwined.“Criminals are in a lot of places that the nation states might want to go,” says Ashar Aziz, founder of Silicon Valley security company FireEye, which has seen “collusion” between criminal gangs and nation states in programs designed to steal defence industry secrets.At Northrop, cybersecurity sales account for $1.1bn of its $27bn annual revenue, but the company expects that to rise.“We’ve identified cyber as one of our four key areas for growth for the next five years,” says Tim McKnight, vice-president at Northrop’s intelligence systems division.The US spends far more than any other country on its military and other nations have followed its lead in cyberinvestment. Since Cybercom became operational last year, the UK, France and more than a dozen others have moved to set up similar commands.“Any country with a credible military is doing something like this,” says James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has advised US leaders and participated in semi-official cyberarms talks with rival China.This increased spending on defence may be designed to protect the US from cyberattack, but the fact that as much as 85 per cent of the internet is under the control of private companies leaves it vulnerable to assault on infrastructure.The companies that control the US electric grid and transport network lack a business need to invest in safer infrastructure, experts say, and an attack on either could devastate the US economy. The White House and Congress have yet to agree on how to share information about new cyberthreats with the private sector, let alone who should pay to protect it.This quandary is one of the problems for an industry that is otherwise surging ahead in the near-absence of export controls and global rules limiting cyberaggression. Unlike fighter aircraft, most cybermonitoring and exploitation software can be sold to any country with which the US has relations.Like many of its rivals, Narus sells its non-classified gear anywhere it can find a legal market, including China and pre-revolution Egypt.All governments deserve help in preventing malicious software from spreading, Mr Oslan says. “We’re in the infancy, on a global basis, [of being able to discover the source of attacks], which is a very difficult and expensive proposition.”The rules of cyberwar, along with the privacy issues it raises, will be debated in the years ahead. But for now they are taking a back seat to the industriousness found in Maryland’s office parks.“The market is dominated, obviously, by the government,” says Mr Sadowski of the Baltimore economic development group.And right now, the government is bulking up on cyberarms.
277;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-27T18:51:36Z;BAE Systems: it is right to cut costs;Lower defence spending globally is largely priced in;A chill wind is blowing through the defence sector. BAE Systems may cut 3,000 jobs, or about 8 per cent of its UK workforce, more than three-quarters of them the result of production slowdowns on the Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet and work on Lockheed Martin’s F-35 joint strike fighter project. BAE, the UK’s biggest manufacturer by sales and the world’s second-largest military equipment maker, blamed the potential cuts on European and US government budget constraints.But the lack of export orders for the Typhoon, built by a four-nation consortium with Finmeccanica and EADS, is also to blame. By slowing production of possibly the last piloted fighter it will produce, BAE hopes to keep the production line ticking over until export orders land.The cuts run contrary to the UK government’s post-crisis aim of creating jobs outside the financial sector and highlight contradictions in the coalition’s austerity policies. BAE has already axed 15,000 jobs globally in the past two years, in response to global budget pressures, and warned this year that they would not be the last. In the US, for example, $350bn of the $900bn cut to discretionary spending is supposed to come from the defence budget. The trouble is that BAE’s wares appeal only to a small number of friendly government clients. And buyers such as India are likely to insist on a proportion of local manufacture, rendering UK capacity – and dreams of rebuilding dark satanic mills – redundant.Lower defence spending globally is largely priced in, however. A 10 per cent cut in UK defence spending would shave off about 2 per cent of group turnover, or a penny off earnings per share, for example. With free cash flow of about £1bn a year, a dividend yield of 6.4 per cent, low net debt and a buy-back, BAE is attractive enough. But it is right to cut costs to keep investors on side.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
278;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-22T12:21:01Z;Japan says ‘open’ to Eurofighter deal;;Japan is open to choosing a European aircraft as its long-awaited new air defence fighter, despite decades of reliance on the US for imports of sophisticated weapon systems, according to new Japanese defence minister, Yasuo Ichikawa.In an interview with the FT, Mr Ichikawa said Japan’s alliance with the US would not be a “major criterion” in deciding between the Eurofighter Typhoon and US rivals Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.After years of delay, Tokyo is now set to decide before the end of December on the purchase of around 42 fighters, a deal estimated to be worth more than $6bn and that could have far-reaching implications for the competing aircraft.Analysts have in the past generally assumed that Tokyo’s close military alliance with Washington and post-war practice of relying almost exclusively on the US for imports of advanced weapon systems meant Eurofighter had little chance of winning the deal.However, Washington’s decision not to allow Japan to buy Lockheed’s stealthy and highly capable F-22 – Tokyo’s favoured option – appears to have opened an unprecedented opportunity for the Eurofighter consortium.The four nation European group received a major boost in April when its Typhoon fighter was shortlisted, along with France’s Dassault Rafale, for an Indian deal to purchase 126 aircraft. That decision was a heavy blow to the US defence establishment, after heavy lobbying from Washington.The US had pitched Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed’s F-16 Super Viper to India, both planes defence experts considered to be less advanced than some of the competition.Mr Ichikawa, who was named defence minister earlier this month, insisted that the Japanese selection process would be “rigorous and fair”, and waved aside suggestions that spurning the US could cause strains with Washington.“Though there may be all kinds of talk on the sellers’ side, we don’t intend to take that into account when making the choice,”Mr Ichikawa said. “We’ll just calmly take those issues in our stride and make a proper decision from a technical point of view, as that is in Japan’s national interest.”Kunihiko Miyake, a security expert at the Canon Global Institute, said buying a European fighter would have a “big political impact” on Japan-US ties.However, Mr Miyake said the defence minister would be right to put technical and tactical issues before procurement diplomacy, noting delays to the F-35 programme that meant it might not be available for delivery for some years.“If they are not going to sell us the F-22 and the F-35 is not ready on the shelf, then other aircraft are available that are good enough,” he said.A pioneering sale to Tokyo would be a major boost for Eurofighter and the UK’s BAE Systems, the consortium’s lead company for the Japan market, and would be sure to win a warm welcome in European capitals.“It would be a great step forward for the security relationship between the UK, Europe and Japan, and would have the additional benefit of strengthening trade relations,” said Tony Ennis, BAE’s president for north east Asia.As well as promising quicker delivery than the F-35, Eurofighter is also thought to be willing to share much more of the Typhoon’s core technology with Japanese contractors than its US rivals.Unlike the F-35, the F/A-18 Super Hornet is already in service. However, it suffers from perceptions that it is older platform that in its rivals – claims that Boeing dismisses, saying the total redevelopment of the airframe used in earlier F/A-18 models and all new electronics mean it is “very much a 21st century aircraft”.
279;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-20T21:59:00Z;Politicians dodge the details in US tax debate;;Democrats and Republicans have claimed that reforming America’s outdated tax system is at the forefront of their respective agendas on Capitol Hill, but politicians on both side of the aisle are playing a subtle game of chicken that may undermine the chances for change.The White House, which this week presented a deficit reduction and tax reform package that it said would ultimately lower rates on corporate and individual taxpayers, has so far been conspicuously silent on the one detail the business community wants to see: the new target tax rate that the Obama administration would be willing to agree to make the US more competitive. Instead, Barack Obama has centred his message on the need to extract more tax revenue from wealthy Americans and some corporations and make the tax system more “fair”.At the same time, Republican leaders have called for a decrease in US tax rates from 35 to 25 per cent but offered scant details on how the US Treasury might pay for such a change. John Boehner, the Republican speaker, has said that he would support closing some corporate tax loopholes and deductions in exchange for a rate decrease but has not been forthcoming on exactly which individual and corporate tax perks he would be willing to scrap.While there appears to be recognition among both parties that the only politically feasible way tax rates can will be lowered systematically for individuals and corporations is if many special loopholes and deductions are cleared out, neither side has shown willingness to be the first to make concessions.One top business lobbyist told the Financial Times that companies at the centre of the tax reform debate were not willing to go to Capitol Hill and offer up their own tax breaks for sacrifice unless they have an indication that the White House was prepared to make a serious cut to corporate tax rates.Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, on Monday said the Treasury would be releasing “broad proposals” on corporate tax reform that would make the country more competitive and strengthen incentives for investing before the end of the year. But he also added that the administration’s strategy on tax reform would be guided by “how to make sure we maximise the chances of reform coming on sensible terms”.He told Bloomberg that it was “hard to tell” whether changes to the corporate tax system had a greater than 50 per cent chance of passing in Congress.The tax debate has been complicated by divisions within corporate America on what kinds of reforms would be most beneficial. While some companies, led by Cisco, Apple and Pfizer, are pushing for a temporary “repatriation holiday” that would allow the companies to bring back hundreds of billions of dollars in profits earned oversees at a rate as low as 5.25 per cent, senior White House officials have suggested their campaign is a non-starter. They argue that the poor job market is not correlated to lack of US profits and that there is no evidence that such a change in tax policy would encourage growth.On Tuesday another group of companies, including United Parcel Service, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, announced the creation of a new coalition supporting an overall decrease in tax rates.“A lower corporate tax rate will boost investment in the US, bringing more American jobs, innovation and growth,” executives from the companies said in a letter to Mr Obama.
280;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-20T17:04:38Z;Defence groups diversify amid budget cuts;;Defence contractors are renewing efforts to expand their non-military businesses as they search for strategies to cope with declining defence budgets worldwide.Last month, General Dynamics, the fourth-biggest US defence contractor by government revenues, agreed to buy Vangent – which provides healthcare information technology services to the Department of Health and other agencies – for about $960m in cash.Also last month, Lockheed Martin, the biggest US defence contractor by revenues, snapped up QTC Holdings, which provides medical evaluation services to the Department of Veterans Affairs, for an undisclosed sum.Though better-known for their tanks and aircraft, most large contractors have established positions in non-defence markets. Lockheed has built a multibillion-dollar federal IT services unit, while GD has an IT unit and owns Gulfstream, the maker of business jets.But experts say the recent decisions point to a revived interest in certain non-military markets as companies undertake broader strategic reviews of their portfolios and struggle to sustain their revenue lines and to find profitable uses for their cash.“The industry has talked for a long time about getting into adjacent markets to help grow the business and help offset the declines in defence spending. But a lot of it has been talk and now you are starting to see some real activity,” said Scott Thompson, who leads PwC’s aerospace and defence practice.Most defence deals are likely to remain within core sectors, such as defence electronics, but industry bankers note that limited growth in the base businesses and competition for more attractive assets will drive companies further afield.Jay Caldwell, head of the aerospace and defence investment banking group at RBC Capital Markets, said a number of clients had requested a complete “white board” analysis of options and expects a “wave” of deal activity, if financial markets stabilise.Industry consultants point to healthcare IT, cybersecurity and energy markets as attractive targets for defence companies given their scale, their faster than average growth profiles and their “short commutes” from existing businesses.For example, by 2016 the Department of Veterans Affairs alone will spend $4.1bn on IT systems, up from about $3.2bn in 2011, much of it on healthcare IT, while state and local healthcare IT spending will rise from $8.6bn to $10.1bn in 2011, according to Deltek, a software provider.Still, non-defence markets are not a magic bullet. Earlier this year, Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, told investors that cybersecurity, healthcare IT and energy markets were maturing “a little slower than we anticipated”.Mr Stevens also promised that the company would not “lower our standards and pursue initiatives in areas where we don’t believe we can be successful …If we can’t find acquisitions that make a lot of sense …we’ll continue to pursue our share buy-back programme [and] our dividend programme.”The defence industry has a mixed record when it comes to exploiting other markets. Lockheed, for example, tried to move into commercial telecommunications in the 1990s, buying Comsat for several billion dollars only to sell the business in pieces a few years later.Norm Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed and undersecretary of the army, noted wryly more than a decade ago that the “industry’s record of diversification is unblemished by success”.However, Denis Bovin, co-chief executive of Stone Key Partners, which advises the aerospace and defence industry, insists that the industry has learnt its lesson. “Rather than wildly diversifying, companies are looking for areas that take them further from their base but don’t require learning a whole new business,” he said.Mr Bovin added that the Vangent and QTC deals were “not so much about diversification. Rather, they are about dealing with the federal customer in a different way. The acquirers are choosing to grow in areas where they already feel comfortable.”To demonstrate their new-found conservatism, defence companies prefer to talk of making smaller deals in “adjacent markets” rather than “diversification”, said one analyst. “It suggests nothing completely out of left field, just stuff we can see over the fence.”So far, Lockheed has pushed further than most, investing in research projects to create power from the difference in temperature in the oceans as well as making forays into smart grid technology and energy efficiency.But the strategy has been a careful and largely organic one, starting with a focus on the military and then moving on to other parts of the federal government before attempting to sell to utility companies.“We have taken a phased approach and managed our entry into the market as opposed to making a super-large acquisition that might be more risky,” Ray Johnson, chief technology officer at Lockheed, told the Financial Times last year.However, Mr Caldwell questioned whether the industry discipline will last. “The large prime contractors will very quickly gnaw through the natural adjacencies and then the big challenge will be what fields do they move on to next?”
281;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-19T23:07:43Z;Consortium signs green property deals;;"A consortium backed by companies including Lockheed Martin and Barclays Capital is on Tuesday announcing the first deals for a new scheme for energy-saving investments in offices and factories.The plan is to open a market that could be worth $1,000bn or more in the US alone.The scheme allows owners of financial and commercial buildings to finance energy-saving works such as insulation with bonds paid for through the property tax system.The consortium, set up by the Carbon War Room, an environmental group, has signed deals with two US counties – Miami-Dade, Florida and Sacramento, California – that will deliver an estimated $650m of investment, with more projects to follow.The potential for companies to make energy efficiency improvements to commercial and industrial buildings has often been described as “100-dollar bills lying in the street” because of the potential for investments to deliver very rapid pay-backs. It has also been identified as the most cost-effective way to cut carbon dioxide emissions.In practice, however, that potential has often gone unrealised because of problems of financing, administrative complexity and the risk that the promised savings will not materialise.The Carbon War Room’s plan aims to surmount all of those obstacle by bringing four companies together: Lockheed Martin, the contractor to lead the works; Barclays, a bank to provide finance; Energi, an insurance company that is a partner of Hannover Re, to guarantee the savings from energy bills; and Ygrene, an energy efficiency company that specialises in putting projects together.The debt issued to pay for the works is intended to be highly attractive to investors because the service will be paid by an extra charge added to the building owner’s property tax, with the agreement of the local authorities.The consortium members say companies should be able to save 30-70 per cent of their energy bills as a result of signing up for the programme: enough to create a good return for investors in the debt and the companies doing the works.Sir Richard Branson, a founder of the Carbon War Room, said: “There is good money to be made, and good money to be saved …It stacks up, and you can get cities all over the world wanting to do it, and financiers all over the world wanting to do it.”The tide of political opinion in the US has in the past two years been shifting against taking action to combat the threat of climate change.However, the consortium members believe their product will still be attractive enough to local authorities to create a market worth hundreds of even thousands of billions of dollars in the US alone.Sir Richard said energy security and the threat of oil shortages was another important motive. “The world six, seven, eight years from now could be facing a potential catastrophe of demand exceeding supply,” he said.The consortium also said its programme would be effective at creating construction-related jobs that are badly needed in the US.The first two counties to sign up are expected to add a forecast 17,000 jobs."
282;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;US to announce Taiwan arms deal;;The US is expected to announce within days a new arms deal for Taiwan, carefully timing the release of the long-expected decision to minimise damage to Washington’s delicately balanced ties with Beijing.The administration has briefed Congress that the US will offer to refurbish the F-16 jets sold to Taiwan in 1992 but will not sell the island the latest model of the fighter planes, as some in Washington and Taipei have pushed for.The announcement has been slotted into the busy Sino-US diplomatic calendar, coming after vice-president Joe Biden’s recent trip to China and ahead of the summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in November.The US has also been at pains to cultivate ties with the incoming Chinese leadership, led by Xi Jinping, who is expected to take over as the head of the ruling Communist party late next year.Mr Xi spent an unusually long amount of time with Mr Biden in China last month, a gesture that the US would like to reciprocate when the Chinese vice-president comes to Washington later this year or early in 2012.“I think the administration has been paving the way for this decision for quite some time,” said Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Taiwan accused the Obama administration on Monday of yielding to pressure from China over the arms sale, renewing its push for the new Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 fighter aircraft.“These years, China is showing stronger and stronger reaction to US-Taiwan arms sales, and that has turned your country more wary with arms sales,” Andrew Yang, the deputy defence minister, told an annual US-Taiwan defence industry conference in Virginia.China’s initial reaction to reports of the decision have been relatively mild, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterating on Monday that “China firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan”.This standard formulation, which is not expected to be Beijing’s final response, contrasts with the vitriolic commentary in the state media in response to support from Taiwan-friendly US lawmakers for the sale of new F-16 aircraft.The People’s Daily, the Communist party’s mouthpiece, called the Taiwan Relations Act, the US law requiring Washington to help the island defend itself, a “cancer”.“At present, some madmen on Capitol Hill are making an uproar about consolidating and expanding this cancer,” it wrote, adding that the US could pay a “disastrous price” if it sold advanced weapons to the island over which Beijing claims sovereignty.In January of last year, China postponed a number of military contacts following the Obama administration’s final announcement of a long-awaited decision on a $6.4bn arms package. The suspension of contacts came only months after the end of a previous chill when Beijing interrupted military dialogue following an earlier Taiwan arms sales announcement in October 2008.In Taipei, Taiwan’s official news agency reported the deputy defence minister as saying Taiwan would be happy with the F-16 upgrade but hoped in the future to buy the more sophisticated F-35 model.Additional reporting by Reuters
283;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Cyberattack on Japanese defence group;;Computers and servers at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan’s largest defence contractor, have been hacked in a cyberattack.One local report described it as Japan’s first known cyberattack on the country’s defence industry. Targets included about 80 personal computers and servers at MHI’s submarine, escort ship, missile and nuclear plant component-making factories.The company said it discovered the hacking in mid-August and the investigation was likely to continue until the end of this month.MHI said that, so far, it had not uncovered leakage of important data relating to its technology and production. However, access had been gained to some internet protocol addresses.The incident follows a recent cyberattack on McAfee, the US security software company. According to McAfee, the attack penetrated 72 government and other organisations, mainly in the US, that copied a range of data from military secrets to industrial designs. Other victims ranged from the UN to governments, including those of Taiwan and South Korea.Earlier this year hackers accessed data for the SecurID tokens made by security company RSA, on which many government employees and suppliers rely. Lockheed Martin, one of the biggest defence contractors, also said in May it had been targeted but that no data or information had leaked.Governments have been concerned about cyberspying – particularly by China – for a number of years and the potential loss of intellectual property rights and defence secrets.Japan’s pacifist constitution bans it from arms exports. However, there are exemptions, including the country’s tie-up with the US for joint research and development of anti-missile defences and the sale of armoured anti-pirate patrol boats in Indonesia.The US recently unveiled its strategy to deal with cyberattacks on its computer networks that included the potential for a military response, if considered necessary .Japan highlighted the growing concerns about cyberattacks in its recently published defence white paper, where it was less specific than the US but said it would continue to “pay attention” to cyberthreats.MHI did not speculate on who might be behind the cyberattack.
284;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-18T16:00:43Z;Cyber-espionage hits defence companies;;The victims in a big cyber-espionage operation linked by a leading researcher to China last month include US defence contractors ManTech and CACI International, adding to the long list of intelligence and military support companies whose security has been compromised.The latest operation drew international attention after it was described in a research paper published in early August by Dmitri Alperovich as Shady RAT after the hacking technology known as a remote access tool.The report resonated because internet-assisted spying has become a significant national-security concern in the west, which fears it is losing masses of intellectual property as well as defence secrets to China and other nations.Defence contractors have been a prime target of cyber-espionage, which US intelligence officials attribute to the Chinese military or affiliated hackers, for more than 10 years. Lockheed Martin recently said it was targeted in a computer intrusion in the wake of a successful attack on EMC-owned RSA, which provides tokens for authenticating remote internet access by 40m government and other employees.Mr Alperovich had come across a command server used in the operation and analysed the electronic logs that showed which computers around the world were sending it information. His original paper did not name the victim companies, but said they included 13 defence contractors as well as government agencies of the US, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Vietnam and Canada and groups affiliated to the UN and various Olympic committees.Since then, other researchers visited the same server and duplicated some of the McAfee findings. One anonymously published on the web a list of all the entities whose internet protocol addresses had connected to the server, including ManTech and CACI.The two companies did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview at the weekend, the now-independent researcher Mr Alperovich confirmed to the Financial Times that the two big contractors were among those that he had found lost data in the operation. He did not say what was taken from the companies and said not all of the other names on the list were accurate.Thomson Reuters, the data group, was also breached, he said, but not the Reuters news operation. Thomson Reuters said it was not aware of the breach.Some others on the list, including the Aspen Institute, a non-profit think-tank, confirmed to the FT that they had been the victim of intrusions.“We did not do a major investigation,” said Walter Isaacson, institute chief executive. “I assume the Chinese didn’t find too much interesting in our e-mails or servers, so we just let the FBI handle it.”The FBI, which is leading the inquiry, declined to comment. Mr Alperovich did not attribute the operation to the Chinese government, but other researchers said the absence of a profit motive in hacking think tanks and government agencies strongly suggested a government role.The Chinese foreign ministry has repeatedly rejected all allegations that Beijing was involved in the attacks.Confirmation also came from the American Soybean Association, a trade group, which said it learnt of the breach from the FBI more than a year ago.“An employee had downloaded something that was infected. It wasn’t something that spread throughout our system”, said Stephen Censky, chief executive. “We don’t have any super-duper top-secret intelligence that we think they would have been after.”Mr Censky said the FBI theorised that the attackers would have wanted access to the trade group’s servers as a launching pad for attacks on other US targets, and Mr Alperovich agreed.As for the think-tank, Mr Alperovich said that such outfits were often penetrated for their e-mail exchanges with government officials, which could be useful in crafting attacks on those officials’ agencies.
285;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
286;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-13T22:27:45Z;Directors ‘uninformed’ of cyber threats;;Board directors at some of the UK’s biggest banks, utility companies and law enforcement agencies remain “largely uninformed” about the financial and reputational risks of a cyberattack, according to new research by the think-tank Chatham House.The report comes just ahead of publication later this week of the government’s strategy on how to combat the cyber threat. Ministers upgraded cybercrime to a so-called “tier one” national security risk in October, alongside terrorism, and set aside £650m to improve the UK’s resilience to electronic attack.However, the Chatham House researchers, who interviewed 20 senior managers or board-level directors at organisations considered vital to the UK’s critical national infrastructure, found there was “no coherent picture” of what constitutes vulnerability to cyberattack and “no agreement on the nature and gravity of the problem”.Although the private sector, and particular the defence industry, is considered to be at high risk of cyber intrusion, the report found that in some companies the heightened perception of online security risks had been met with “diminished resources and interest”. This is despite high-profile cyber breaches earlier this year including a Sony network outage which cost the company £108m in lost revenue and legal fees, and attempted hacker attacks on the military supplier Lockheed Martin.Dave Clemente, a cyber security researcher at Chatham House and one of the report’s authors, said he was surprised that the potential risks of laxity in cyber security had not made it up to board level.“It’s not appropriate for senior managers to work in technical language or understand the IT systems but I would expect them to be aware of the reputational risks they face,” he said.Mr Clemente added that while some sectors, such as financial services, were able to calculate financial losses from cybercrime very exactly and even account for them as budget liabilities, it was more difficult for other companies to assess the cost of stolen intellectual property.“If you’re an energy company and someone hacks into your systems and steals a tender for a project you’re planning somewhere in west Africa, how can you calculate the costs of that?” he said.The report did not say that companies should bear the entire burden, however, and pointed out that the government should be playing a more “integral role” in raising awareness of the issues.One of the authors’ core recommendations was for the government to set up a “single, accessible bank of cyber security information and advice” on which organisations, enterprises, government bodies and individuals could draw.
287;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-12T13:55:44Z;Industry faces a tough decade;;The defence industry is coming to the end of what many of its senior figures regard as a golden decade.Ten years ago, in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the US government began a huge injection of cash into the Pentagon budget.Over the course of the decade, the US annual defence budget has doubled in cash terms to reach nearly $700bn in 2010. The profits of the US defence industry have quadrupled over that period. The country has come to dwarf all other nations in the amount it spends on military equipment.Now, however, the tap has been turned off and defence companies in the US – as well as in Europe – face more challenging times. The US government is deeply in debt. Some senior executives in the industry believe Congress will take out up to $1,000bn from the core Pentagon budget over the next decade.As the west winds down its involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan – and after the killing of Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader – it is hard to imagine anyone making a case for increasing US defence expenditure.One strategic threat is very much on the minds of US policymakers: the military build-up of China. In the past five years, Beijing has expanded its capability at a pace that has taken many defence experts by surprise. The People’s Liberation Army has evolved from being an internally focused force to one that regularly deploys overseas. In the course of 2011, China has flexed its military muscles, deploying an aircraft carrier and stealth fighter for the first time. China’s defence budget grew 7.5 per cent in 2010 – faster than that of most other countries in the world.But while policymakers in Washington are becoming increasingly alarmed by the challenge from China, the threat is unlikely to halt the retrenchment of US defence spending in the near future. In 2010, China’s defence budget was one-tenth the size of that of the US. Its defence assets are still some way from being at the technical level of those of the west. “The technological gap between China and the US could narrow but it will not disappear for a long time,” says Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). “The US has an accumulated advantage going back decades.”As a result, defence companies in the US must face up to a demanding environment. The pressures are even greater in Europe, where national governments, including the UK, have taken an axe to military budgets over the past few years in response to the budget crunch.Defence groups are having to cut costs aggressively in order to survive. They are also engaging in a frantic search for new markets. As Alberto de Benedictis, chief executive of Finmeccanica UK, puts it: “Over the next few years, managements will be called to task. People in the defence sector will need to be more proactive about the way they run their businesses.”The shadow of cuts and delays is already being seen over existing programmes. In the US, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter multi-role jet, whose lead contractor is Lockheed Martin, is a project worth more than $380bn.The jet is expected to come into service over the next six years. But Robert Gates, the former defence secretary, said just before leaving office this year that he thought “the size of the buy” might have to be cut.In Britain, the Ministry of Defence is also pressing ahead with substantial equipment programmes. By far the biggest is the plan to build a submarine platform for the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent, a project that will cost about £25bn ($40bn).But the MoD is in the throes of a savage budgetary cut equal to 8 per cent in real terms over the next four years. As a result, political debate may yet intensify in the UK over whether the nuclear deterrent is financially viable.Companies in the US and Europe are having to respond. Several, such as Lockheed and BAE Systems, have cut their workforce. But the big strategic question facing many of them is whether they can win in the fierce competition to find new markets to sell their equipment.Some nations with deep pockets and significant security threats on their borders will certainly remain big purchasers of equipment.Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab states – uncertain about the intentions and nuclear capabilities of Iran – will remain big clients.Last year, the Saudis signed a deal with Boeing for the sale of $60bn worth of jets, including F-15 fighters. States which are concerned at China’s growing military role – most notably Japan, South Korea and Australia – will provide strong demand for new equipment.Two other nations, however, are attracting particular attention. One is India, which is seeking to enhance its security advantage over Pakistan and responding to the growing military might of China. It is emerging as one of the world’s biggest arms buyers, especially of fast jets.Brazil also plans to increase spending on military assets, thanks to high economic growth rates. There is speculation it could increase its order for fast jets to more than 100 over the next 15 years.Competition among defence exporters will be tough – especially if China follows Russia’s tradition of being an exporter of capability to these markets.US and European companies may have to rethink how they do business. One big pressure they face is to offer purchasing countries a partnering arrangement, allowing them to develop a local capability or production line, creating jobs and skills in the region.“If India buys large numbers of Eurofighters, it won’t want them all to be produced in Germany or the UK,” says Professor Chalmers of RUSI. “Some of the more technologically sophisticated countries will want those contracts to have a large indigenous component.”In the short term, US companies may find it harder than their European rivals to get into these markets, because Washington heavily restricts technology transfer. But over time, the main challenges in the defence industry will be faced by European companies. “The real problem for Europe is that governments are not spending enough on research and development,” says Clara O’Donnell, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think- tank.“This means that in the years to come, European defence companies will find it harder to compete in export markets. Even more problematically, European companies will increasingly struggle to supply their own governments.”In short, US companies go into this decade facing a fight to compete. But European companies may be facing a fight to survive.
288;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-12T13:55:44Z;US: Bye, big spender, as budget is scaled back;;Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, defence companies have feasted on a surge of spending by the US military. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drove revenues and profits ever higher as the Pentagon bought equipment and services.Ten years on, the outlook is very different. In May 2010, Robert Gates, then Secretary of Defence, signalled the change in clear terms. “Given America’s difficult economic circumstances, the gusher has been turned off, and will stay off for a good period of time.”Faced with the prospect of substantial reductions in US military spending and demands from the Pentagon for cheaper equipment, big defence companies have found themselves in an unfamiliar position – having to cut costs aggressively in order to survive.“On the defence side of our business, all of our customers are asking us about cost reduction and affordability,” says Scott Thompson, who leads the US aerospace and defence practice at PwC, the professional services firm.“They want to know how to do more without more. That is the number one area of focus right now.”In May, a sombre Bob Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the biggest defence contractor in the world by sales, reflected the new mood, telling reporters that “the global security environment …is only growing more volatile and more complex, while economic resources are sure to be constrained. That’s why we’ve been giving cost reduction and affordability a top priority.”Headcount has been an early target. Companies such as BAE Systems, the biggest UK defence contractor by revenues, have begun to slash personnel working on defunct programmes. Lockheed has reduced its workforce by more than 20,000 people in the past two years, mostly by attrition.Lockheed has been particularly aggressive, asking hundreds of mid-level managers to take early retirement and freezing the salaries of senior executives in order to reduce its central costs. The company expects the moves to save more than $350m over the next five years.A tougher line from the Pentagon, demanding greater “productivity” from contractors to help offset pressures on the military’s budget, has served to reinforce the new-found resolve among defence companies to keep a check on costs. Under the title “Better Buying Power”, the Department of Defense has introduced stringent efficiency measures.Analysts note that the years of rising budgets have created plenty of fat to cut. “The defence budget has been going up since 1999. Inefficiencies have inevitably crept into the system,” says Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, the investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Canada. He adds: “There are considerable costs to be taken out if companies are motivated to do so, and now they are.”Indeed, companies have also been taking a closer look at their industrial footprint in search of savings they can pass on to the DoD.L-3 Communications, the US defence electronics and services company, and ITT, the US conglomerate that includes a substantial defence unit, have both consolidated business units and factories.David Wajsgras, chief financial officer of Raytheon, the US defence contractor, says the new environment has led to an important shift in emphasis. Until recently, he says, defence companies had been more focused on producing the most technologically advanced equipment, rather than the most cost-effective.“Given the fiscal environment that the world finds itself in, there is going to be an increased focus on the cost side of the equation,” he told the FT in an interview at the Paris Air Show this summer. “But we all have to be very thoughtful that you don’t sacrifice the technological components just to save on costs.”He says that Raytheon saw the downturn in defence spending coming and has been rationalising the business since 2005. At the moment, it is working to reduce the number of suppliers it uses in order to extract lower prices from its partners.Still, Mr Thompson at PwC points out that there are limits to the savings the defence industry can achieve. Unlike commercial companies, defence contractors tend to produce things in relatively small batches, which raises costs, while the necessity of securing key skills can make efficiency a secondary priority.At the same time, Mr Thompson notes, “there are two sides to this equation. It is not just about how the contractors perform, it is also the Pentagon’s behaviour which drives a lot of costs.” He points to the unwillingness of the services to collaborate on programmes, and excessive project oversight, as cost drivers.And some industry executives worry that the renewed focus on cost-effective products may have unintended consequences, encouraging the brightest engineering students to pass over the defence industry in favour of sectors that are exploring cutting-edge technology.Dan Crowley, president of Raytheon Network Centric Systems and previously the head of Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet programme, is cautious but optimistic. “Do we have something as exciting as a moon shot? No, but students like the challenges of material science, of software technology and communications. And that is what the military is focused on.”
289;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;India: A tiger awakes to challenge Chinese military;;If ever there was a potent reminder of the need to modernise India’s ageing defence capability, it was the regular tailspins and nosedives of its Russian fighter jets.The MiG-21 is known among the brave ranks of the Indian Air Force as the “flying coffin”. Of the almost 800 MiG-21s inducted into the Indian Air Force since 1963, more than 350 have been lost in accidents, killing about 170 pilots.Air Chief Marshal N.A.K. Browne, the head of the IAF, is counting the days until the country renews its strike force, which currently consists of Russian, British and French aircraft. At the end of last month, he said India’s pilots would be “greatly relieved” when the country finally agreed a contract for the supply of 126 jet fighters, worth $11bn.The Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, or MMRCA, deal is one of the biggest arms deals in the world. India, which has relied heavily on Russian supplies during the past 50 years, is one of the biggest arms buyers, with a military budget of Rs1,420bn ($31bn) a year.A closely watched competition has pitted US, Russian and other European aerospace companies against each other. All have extended a hand of industrial partnership in order to win a prize that promises a strategic reorientation by the world’s largest democracy.While deadlines are notoriously fluid in India, many now consider the deal to be in the final lap, and down to price. Air Marshal Browne says he expects the contest, narrowed to a choice between the Eurofighter and France’s Rafale, to be concluded by the end of the year.Snubbed US competitors Boeing and Lockheed Martin have found consolation in government-to-government deals between Delhi and Washington.Delhi has bought C-17 military transporters to improve the forces’ airlift capacity, as well as Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft. In Washington, multibillion-dollar defence orders for India’s 1.5m-strong armed forces are viewed as a vital component in cementing ties between the two countries.Air Marshal Browne has another reason to be “relieved”. Among India’s military leadership and security hawks, China looms larger and larger as a potential threat. They are particularly concerned about what they identify as a “collusive threat” posed by a nuclear-armed neighbour, the traditional foe Pakistan, and the growing military might of China.China’s supply of weaponry to Pakistan, particularly JF-17 jets, has fuelled these suspicions. So too has China’s assertiveness over territory in the Himalayas and at sea. Delhi was alarmed by a challenge to an Indian naval vessel by the Chinese navy in July off the coast of Vietnam – described by Indian officials as the first “incident” of its kind.China has also rattled India’s defence establishment by parading technological breakthroughs, like its own aircraft carrier and ship-busting missiles, all of which could come to challenge India’s dominance of the Indian Ocean and crucial shipping lanes between the Middle East and Asia.India has been no slouch itself. Although 70 per cent of its military hardware is imported, it has launched its own stealth frigate and a nuclear submarine modelled on a Russian design. It has tested a range of longer-distance missiles, including a supersonic cruise missile called the Brahmos, and boasts a capable space programme.Closer to the ground, military planners carefully eye what the US, UK and France have done to equip their infantry better.Some private Indian companies, including the Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra and Larsen & Toubro, have a growing interest in developing their defence expertise in partnership with international defence groups.Increasingly, international investors see opportunity among India’s small, technologically advanced defence companies. Yet some senior officers now openly voice their concerns about the gap in defence capabilities that has opened up between big-spending China and what they see as “dithering” in corruption-prone Delhi.The officers complain that military spending, just over 1 per cent of gross domestic product, is hampered by fears in the civilian government of over-militarisation and the need to spend more on development than arms. They identify key vulnerabilities in cyberwarfare and China’s record of reverse engineering advanced technologies, as opposed to India’s lumbering public sector defence companies.Nonetheless, India’s military establishment is looking more to its eastern border, where the Chinese invaded, albeit briefly, in 1962. A programme of infrastructure and airfield improvement is under way to give greater reach into the Himalayan region. The army is pushing for a $2.5bn Mountain Strike Corps, which would lead to the deployment of a greater number of high-altitude troops (required to operate up to a height of 20,000 feet).China holds lessons, just as it poses a threat.Jasjit Singh, director of the Centre of Air Power Studies in New Delhi, says India’s challenge is to build a defence industry base rapidly after what he says was 250 years of de-industrialisation under British colonial rule. He estimates that the process is only 10 years old.“India is in the process of an industrial technological revolution, and at the forefront is the aerospace industry. But we are still at the beginning,” he says.Air Marshal Browne says that China has some of the answers. One is that India’s defence companies should devote far more resources to research and development.The second is that India should not try to “go it alone” – as it has with the 30-year development of the Light Combat Aircraft or Tejas – but rather “learn from” licence agreements with foreign partners.In the manuals of the integrated staff headquarters at India’s Ministry of Defence, diagrams show a fighting force typically has 30 per cent advanced, 40 per cent current and 30 per cent obsolete equipment.Getting closer to this blueprint, and retiring the MiGs and Lee Enfield rifles, is a top priority for India’s longer-term security.
290;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-08T18:22:47Z;Contingency planning: Focus shifts from physical to virtual threats;;The attacks of September 11 2001 revealed not only gaps in national security, but also showed how vulnerable companies could be to terrorists.It took almost no time to bring down skyscrapers full of employees and with billions of dollars of intellectual property and technology.After 9/11, corporate security and contingency planning became a growth area, as companies focused on ensuring they were as prepared as possible for the next disaster.By the end of 2001, chief executives were very aware they would need to spend more to make their companies secure. A report by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton showed that three-quarters of chief executives at big US companies were reviewing their insurance policies and disaster plans and those that had not yet started to do so had made them a top priority.Many companies relocated their operations or created satellite offices where data could be backed up in the event of an attack on corporate headquarters.The US Federal Reserve recommended that companies should improve their contingency plans so they could continue to operate seamlessly if an external event shut down telecommunications. Still, even the central bank acknowledged that predicting these events was a challenge.“We have much less experience in modelling and predicting these operational risks than we have for understanding credit or market risk, and some threats may be too idiosyncratic to be modelled at all,” said Roger Ferguson, then vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, in 2002.Such concerns provided opportunities. Chris Falkenberg, head of Insite Security, had been a secret service agent, but after September 11, decided to start a corporate security business.“It was clear to me after September 11 that there would be a need for sophisticated security advice, so I opened this firm to tap into that need,” Mr Falkenberg says.His clients include big retailers, such as Ralph Lauren, that manage sprawling supply chains, hedge funds, and very wealthy individuals who travel frequently. The company provides risk analysis and preparation for everything from terrorist threats and health risks to natural disasters.“Big companies with lots of cash and revenues that don’t want to build their own security infrastructure come to us,” he says.In the year after 9/11, companies increased their spending on corporate security and contingency planning by a median of 4 per cent, according to a report by the Conference Board, a US research group. Large multinationals increased their spending the most, and investment in security and risk management was concentrated in the north-east of the US.According to Mr Falkenberg, spending on contingency plans for terror threats peaked in 2006 and has since fallen back, as the absence of another attack in the US has eased fears.However, companies have become more sensitive to threats posed by cyber hackers, who have the power to breach technology safeguards and steal sensitive data.This year has been a high mark for cyber breaches, with high-profile cases involving corporate stalwarts such as Citigroup, Sony, Google, and Lockheed Martin.In May, Citigroup learnt that hackers had accessed data on 200,000 of its customers’ credit cards in North America. Because of the breach, US regulators called for tighter security for customer accounts.That attack followed one on Sony in April, when 77m users of online video game network, PlayStation, had their name and address details stolen. The company had to shut down the network while it investigated the breach.“Cyber crime is something to reckon with,” says Joe Gottlieb, chief executive of Sensage, a cyber security firm. “There are definitely sweet spots, like medium-sized banks and retailers that have plenty of credit card information to steal.”Mr Gottlieb notes that small and medium-sized companies are particularly at risk from cyber attacks because they tend to lack the defences to combat them. Companies are also concerned with the rise of data leaks, he said, and are taking greater precautions when giving employees access to systems.More broadly, corporate security experts say businesses must avoid complacency, even when threats seem like remote possibilities.Michael Denison, research director at Global Risk Analysis, a consultancy, says companies need to be constantly assessing threat risks, analysing and planning for the worst to “embed security awareness into the wider corporate culture of the business”.“Companies must have sound, flexible and testable procedures, at the heart of which is communication,” he says.
291;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-09-05T16:19:13Z;Gap in US pension plans hits $388bn;;The funding hole in US corporate pension plans is now larger than at the height of the financial crisis, according to a new analysis by Credit Suisse.A $388bn gap has opened due to a combination of weak equity markets and falling interest rates, eliminating improvements in the funding of defined-benefit pension plans at S&P 500 companies since the end of 2008. The gap leaves pension schemes with assets worth only 77 per cent of their liabilities.From a moderate surplus at the end of 2007, plunging markets left the corporate plans with a deficit of $326bn just a year later, or a funding level of about 79 per cent.At eight companies, including Lockheed Martin and Ford, the pension deficit represents more than a quarter of the companies’ market capitalisation.“If you think about the typical corporate pension plan, they are continuing to take two big bets: they are betting on interest rates and they are betting on the equity market – and they hope that both go up”, said David Zion, head of accounting research for Credit Suisse.Neither bet has worked this year, producing a deterioration in funding levels of about $139bn, he calculates, due to poor stock market performance and falling interest rates, which increases the size of future pension obligations.The corporate bond yields typically used to discount the value of pension promises have dropped by about 50 basis points this year. Credit Suisse estimates that each 25bp fall in the discount rate would increase liabilities by about $45bn.The deterioration has also come despite an improvement in the quality of the S&P 500 constituents – the 2008 index included companies such as General Motors, the car maker pushed into bankruptcy in part by the weight of its pension obligations. There are 326 companies in the S&P 500 with defined-benefit pension plans.Pension funds face further challenges in a low interest rate environment. Unless companies close defined-benefit schemes to new employees, new obligations continue to accrue, while existing obligations are not static but grow over time, requiring normal investment returns just to keep pace.“The hole is already dug, you have to fill it in”, said Mr Zion, arguing that corporate contributions would have to rise if levels of underfunding persist.Attempts to match pension plan assets to obligations, by switching out of equities and into bonds, may also weigh on long-term bond yields. “As more and more large corporate pensions gear up to extend duration, demand has the potential to vastly outpace supply,” said Paul Sweeting, European head of Strategy Group at JPMorgan Asset Management.There are about $1,500bn of long-dated corporate and government bonds outstanding in the US. The bank calculates that insurers already hold $788bn of long-duration bonds, meaning there would be substantial impact on bond yields if the $2,215bn assets in private defined-benefit pension plans were to shift away from stocks and into bonds.Source: Credit Suisse
292;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-08-05T21:07:42Z;European hopes aid Wall St;;US stocks managed to pare early losses as initial fears of a market meltdown abated amid reports that the European Central Bank was willing to buy Spanish and Italian government bonds, easing fears on the eurozone debt crisis.Positive jobs data and a clutch of strong earnings reports earlier had failed to convince traders worried about a return to a US recession, with the benchmark index falling more than 3 per cent by the end of morning trading.In a choppy session, stocks in the afternoon were buoyed by the reports that Italy was willing to reform to facilitate ECB help. The benchmark S&P 500 had managed to pull itself flat to 1,211.37 in the late afternoon. The index was still down 6.5 per cent for the week after a previous session of steep decline that saw its biggest one-day drop for two years.The session opened on a positive note on Friday when US non-farm payrolls came in up by 117,000 jobs, ahead of consensus forecasts of a gain of 85,000. The unemployment rate also dropped to 9.1 per cent.But fears over fundamentals in the global economy overrode the brief confidence that the data inspired, before reports of the ECB move surfaced and restored a measure of confidence.There were also some gains on the back of strong earnings. Priceline.com, the discount travel website, among the best market performers of the past two years, led all shares higher by jumping 10.6 per cent to $534.33. It said earnings were $5.49 a share, versus forecasts of $4.86, and forecast a jump in international travel bookings in the third quarter of as much as 67 per cent, citing an increase in bargain-hunting.“Today’s numbers may quell recession anxiety at the margin,” said Jay Feldman, economist at Credit Suisse, adding that the recent string of poor data were “consistent with sluggish growth, not recession”.Kraftwas also up 3.4 per cent to $34.94, continuing its surge following the announcement it would split into two companies.But the volatile session still left the Nasdaq Composite down 0.9 per cent to 2532.41, compounding a heavy week of losses which saw it hit its lowest point since November 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to edge up 0.5 per cent on Friday to 11,444.61 but lost 5.8 per cent for the week. Energy shares were among the biggest losers on Friday.Sunoco, the petroleum group, which said on Thursday it had just finished an “abysmal” quarter, fell 5.2 per cent to $34.03, its lowest price since last September.Alpha Natural Resources, the coal supplier, dropped 2.8 per cent to $32.31 after its operating profit missed analyst forecasts, pushing it down 24.4 per cent for the week. The rest of the sector suffered while AK Steeldropped 1 per cent to $9.12.But Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, maintained that stocks tied to China’s consumption of energy and resources were the “best of bad options”.“If the three options are, the US gets better, Europe gets better, and China has no hard landing, the best option of the three is China. It’s the Chinese consumer who is setting the price of crude oil,” he said.Financials suffered on Friday after RBS in the UK reported a first-half loss and Credit Suisse reduced its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 1,350 from 1,450. AIG fell 4.9 per cent to $25.10 despite swinging to a profitable quarter but it missed estimates of 98 cents, earning 69 cents a share. AIG shares also tend to decline on good news as traders then expect the US Treasury to sell more shares. The stock was down 12.5 per cent for the week.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch fell 7.5 per cent to $8.17 on Friday, declining 15.9 per cent for the week, while Citigroup lost 12.8 per cent for the week to $33.44.The week opened in more sanguine circumstances with US stocks up in early Monday trading in anticipation of a resolution to the debt ceiling debate. But the gains were short-lived, halted by weak manufacturing data.“The poor [US manufacturing data] was the most important news of the week because it was manufacturing that kept the big mature economies on both sides of the Atlantic afloat year-to-date and was a key profit growth driver,” said David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. “Thus, this disappointment with persistent European sovereign and bank funding strains pushed stocks lower most of the week.”Defence groups were hit after the debt agreement stipulated around $350bn in sector cuts over the next 10 years. Lockheed Martin was down 3.8 per cent for the week to $72.82 while Boeing fell 11 per cent to $62.75.The final debt agreement sent shares in healthcare and other providers down on fears that it would cut back on Medicare funding.Health insurer Aetnadropped 9.8 per cent to $37.42 for the week.By Thursday, the mood of traders had turned completely as both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell by more than 4 per cent as fear in the markets threatened a meltdown.
293;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-08-03T15:26:26Z;US job creation slows and redundancies soar;;The US private sector added jobs for the 19th straight month in July but growth remained below the level needed for a steady recovery in the struggling labour market, while planned lay-offs jumped to a 16-month high, adding to worries over the health of world’s largest economy.Wednesday’s employment report from ADP, the payroll processor, showed job creation slowed to 114,000 new positions last month from June’s downwardly revised 145,000. The July increase was slightly ahead of expectations of 100,000 and in line with estimates for the private sector component of Friday’s government non-farm payrolls report.“While the ADP has stopped the rot in the run of recent data it still is very far from providing us with any comfort about the outlook for the labour market,” said David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered.“Today’s report shows modest job creation for the month of July at a rate of half what is needed for meaningful employment and economic recovery,” said Gary Butler, ADP chief executive.A separate report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company, added to the gloomy labour picture with the news that the number of announced lay-offs at US companies surged 60 per cent in July to 66,414, a 16-month high. Lay-offs were concentrated at large firms, with cuts at Merck, Borders, Cisco Systems, Lockheed Martin and Boston Scientific accounting for more than half the total.“July marks the third consecutive increase we have seen in monthly job-cut announcements, which certainly seems to provide additional evidence that the recovery has stalled,” said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The labour market has been mired at anaemic levels through the recovery, with the unemployment rate stuck at 9.2 per cent two years after the official end of the recession. Friday’s labour department report is expected to show the economy added 85,000 jobs in July following June’s nine-month low of 18,000.Lacklustre gross domestic product growth figures released last week confirmed fears that the “soft patch” seen in the spring was in fact a broader and more prolonged slowing of the economy, raising the spectre of stagnation and even double-dip recession.“The slowdown in employment makes more sense in light of last week’s revised GDP numbers showing the economy grew slower late last year and this year than initially reported,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which produces the ADP report.ADP’s figures showed the service sector added 121,000 jobs last month, led by professional services and education and healthcare, while construction employment fell 11,000. The goods-producing sector shed 7,000 positions. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000, a small decrease but a worrying sign for the industry that has been a powerhouse through much of the recovery.Small and medium-sized businesses were the biggest contributors to job growth, with companies employing less than 50 people adding 58,000 jobs and those employing 50 to 500 people hiring 47,000 new workers. Companies with more than 500 workers added 9,000 positions.However, some economists warned against reading too much into the report as a signal for the labour department reading.“ADP employment provided a misleading signal on payrolls for June, which may result in lower than the usual market sensitivity to this report,” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics. They noted that ADP originally showed a 157,000 rise in private sector employment in June, while the government report found companies had added just 57,000 positions.Meanwhile, growth in the US service sector slowed to the lowest level since February 2010 in July, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The non-manufacturing index fell to 52.7 last month from 53.3 in June, missing expectations of a slight rise to 53.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
294;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-08-01T21:01:42Z;Wall Street erases gains after weak data;;US stocks closed slightly lower after a turbulent session that saw the session open with shares sharply higher on the US debt agreement and then tumble after weak manufacturing figures damped sentiment.Leading defence companies came under pressure on worries that fiscal retrenchment in the wake of the debt deal will hit the Pentagon’s defence budget.Lockheed Martinlost 1.7 per cent to $74.46, Boeingfell 2 per cent to $70.33 and Northrop Grummanwas down 1.5 per cent to $59.60.The broader aerospace and defence sector, which is still undervalued according to Citigroup analysts, was lower.About $350bn of cuts over 10 years are expected in the Pentagon’s defence budget. Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.
295;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-07-28T18:49:06Z;L-3 plans spin-off of units to boost growth;Defence group under pressure from activist investors;L-3 Communications, the US defence electronics and services company, is to spin-off its consulting and training units to shareholders in the latest move by a contractor to shed slow growing segments amid declining military budgets.The spin-off comes in response to a weak performance in 2010, characterised by contract losses and a falling stock price, and pressure from activist shareholders which have urged management to aggressively pursue divestments or even to split the company up.In June, Relational Investors, an activist investment fund run by Ralph Whitworth, revealed a 6 per cent stake in L-3 and said it had spoken to senior executives about the company’s underperforming stock price and “suboptimal business mix”.Michael Strianese, L-3 chief executive, said the spin-off was the best option because it would improve the growth rate of the remainder of the company, end conflicts of interest between offering consulting services and selling products and it is likely it would be tax-free.A number of defence companies have spun off or sold divisions in recent months as they rejig their portfolios to cope with the stark prospect of declining US defence budgets, and demands for cheaper products and services from the Pentagon.In 2009 Northrop Grumman sold its consulting unit to two private equity companies for about $1.7bn in cash and earlier this year it spun off its shipbuilding business to shareholders as Huntington Ingalls Industries.“We are creating two very strong companies and shareholder value will follow that” Mr Strianese told the Financial Times, dismissing suggestions that the plans were too timid after a year-long review. “The market reaction has been very positive.”L-3 shares, which have climbed about 12 per cent over the year to date, rose about 4 per cent to $82. When the spin-off completes in the first half of 2012 L-3 expects to receive a dividend of up to $650m from the sale by adding debt to the new entity.The divestments will leave L-3 with revenues of about $13.5bn and four main divisions, providing aircraft modernization and maintenance, electronic systems, intelligence and surveillance systems, and cyber security services to federal agencies.But growth for the company remains ellusive. On Thursday, L-3 reported second quarter results showing a 5 per cent decline in sales to $3.8bn as contract losses in 2010 and contract delays in 2011 took their toll. Profit rose 6 per cent after certain tax benefits.Engility – as the new company will be known – also faces an uphill struggle. It will have about 10,000 employees, sales of about $2bn and operating income of about $179m, but its revenues are declining as the US military withdraws from Iraq and Afghanistan.Engility provides linguistic services, defence-related training and software development to the US military. Executives in its operations argue that as an independent entity it will be able to bid for “hundreds of millions of dollars” of work that it is currently barred from by conflicts of interest within L-3.L-3 has a long history as a buyer and seller of companies. It was built in the 1990s and early 2000s by the late Frank Lanza, a former top Lockheed Martin executive, who scooped up dozens of niche defence companies orphaned by a wave of mega-mergers in the sector.Since Mr Lanza’s death in 2006, however, the rate of acquisitions has fallen dramatically, although it remained a favourite with investors until a difficult year in 2010, when the company was hit by the drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan and its stock fell about 19 per cent.
296;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-07-26T21:04:58Z;New York stocks down on debt worries;;US stocks stumbled for a second straight session on Tuesday as investors waded through a heavy volume of quarterly earnings reports amid continuing anxiety over the US federal debt limit.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.94 in New York.The benchmark was weighed down by the industrials sector, off 1.9 per cent, and materials, which declined by 1 per cent, while technology shares offset the gloom.Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, ended the day down 8.2 per cent at $52.34 after profits missed analysts’ forecasts. 3M, which produces goods from Post-it notes to stethoscopes, dropped 5.4 per cent to $89.93. Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.
297;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed profits hit by staffing cuts;;Lockheed Martin reported lower second quarter profits on Tuesday due to increased severance pay and higher pension costs, but sales rose and the world’s biggest defense company by revenues raised its outlook for the year.Over the last year, Lockheed has cut back sharply on staff and other costs in an effort to deal with what Bob Stevens, chief executive, calls the “new reality” of declining government defence spending and rising performance demands from the Pentagon.For the three months to the end of June, Lockheed earned net income of $742m from continuing operations, or $2.14 per share, down from $824m, or $2.22 per share in the same period a year ago.The second quarter results were hurt by a $97m charge associated with cutting about 3,000 jobs in its aeronautics and space systems businesses earlier this year. Higher pension expenses also trimmed profits but a one-off tax benefit offset some of the impact.Analysts were expecting earnings of about $1.93 per share on revenue of about $11.42bn.“During the second quarter, we had strong execution across the company even while implementing difficult measures to rightsize our business for an environment that remains challenging,” said Mr Stevens.In spite of the tougher environment, Lockheed raised its 2011 outlook for a second time this year. The company now expects earnings per share of between $7.35 and $7.55, up from previous forecasts of between $6.95 and $7.25 of earnings per share.Still, sales will be lower than Lockheed forecast in April. The company now expects revenues of between $46bn and $47bn compared with previous expectations of between $45.8bn and $47.3bn.The company’s backlog, the queue of work orders it has received but not yet fulfilled, also slipped to $77.3bn from $78.4bn in the same quarter last year, an indication of tougher times ahead.There was a pop in sales at the company’s aeronautics unit, which is steadily increasing production of the F-35 fighter jet. The aircraft is behind schedule and over budget but remains a top Pentagon priority.Aeronautics sales climbed about 9 per cent to $3.4bn but margins dipped slightly. Margins on new programmes such as the F-35 are typically lower than more mature programmes.

Earnings per share were $7.79, well above the consensus forecast of $5.87.The shares hit $396.27, an all-time high in early trading, before closing at $386.90, still up 2.7 per cent on the session.The sector was not cheered by the news, falling 0.43 per cent, after seeing its biggest one-day gain in a year earlier in the week.“Technology as a sector …is starting to splinter,” Nicholas Bohnsack, sector analyst at Strategas Research Partners, said. “Apple is a bellwether of a different stripe, generating the lion’s share from consumers. It speaks in part to consumer and discretionary shares have held up well over past several weeks. Apple is a very momentum, growth-driven stock …with a very specific product set that not generally a bellwether.”Citigroup analysts raised their one-year price target to $480 for the second time in a week, expecting “a steady stream of new product introductions and peak seasonal demand”. Apple is expected to release a new version of the iPhone before the holiday season. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their target to $525 a share.Sales of the iPhone exceeded estimates, with 20.3m units sold in the quarter. Over the same period, iPad sales were 9.2m versus 3.3m a year earlier.Cirrus Logic, a parts supplier for Apple, was up 4.4 per cent to $17.60.There were cautionary flags for tech investors after Yahoo said revenues slipped on falling advert sales, though quarterly income of 19 cents a share topped forecasts. Yahoo fell 7.6 per cent to $13.48.Shares of equipment makers tumbled after Riverbed Technology, a networking hardware maker, reported a sharp drop in profits. Its shares were down 22.5 per cent to $32.05.F5 Networks, a networking group that led gains on Tuesday, was down 6.1 per cent to $111.44.After the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 1325.84, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.43 per cent to 2814.23. Sentiment was damped by a 0.8 per cent dip in existing home sales, which was the third straight month of declines.Zillow, the real estate website, debuted on the Nasdaq, tripled in value in its first day of trading on Wednesday. Shares opened at $60 and closed at $35.77.United Technologies fell 1.8 per cent despite raising its full-year profit forecast from $5.35 a share to $5.45, citing strong performance in its Carrier unit.However, traders focused on UT’s unit Pratt & Whitney, along with Lockheed Martin, after they reported cost overruns in a programme to build the F-35 for the US military. The two groups will pay $283m to cover those costs. Lockheed Martinwas down slightly at $78.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.12 per cent to 12,571.91.American Airlines said it planned to upgrade its fleet, sending the shares 0.2 per cent lower.

299;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-07-12T16:53:47Z;Hacking group targets Booz Allen Hamilton;;The US defence department is investigating a cyber attack on a government contractor in which hackers claimed to have obtained 90,000 e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords of military personnel.A Pentagon official said on Tuesday that it was looking into the breach at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton but lacked “concrete information”.“We don’t have all the details”, the official told the Financial Times on condition of anonymity. “That said, there may be some information that we can’t share once we do.”The cyber-activist group called Anonymous took credit for the breach and posted the data on the Pirate Bay file-sharing site. It said that data had been taken from a poorly-protected server on the Booz Allen network and that it was “surprisred” at how easy it had been to hack into a company working for the US military.Booz Allen Hamilton confirmed on Tuesday night that it had been subject to a hacking attack, and said it was investigating the extent of the breach. The company said it believed hackers had only been able to reach data that related to a learning management system it ran for a government agency.The breach is an embarrassment for the company, which has a former US director of national intelligence as its head of national-security contracting.Experts said the type of encryption used for the passwords could be broken, with the difficulty of that task determined by factors including whether numbers and special characters were required. “If they are smart, [the military] will reset the passwords”, said Jerry Dixon, former director of the cyber security division of the US homeland security department.Otherwise, hackers in control of accounts could send e-mails tricking still more defence employees into installing malicious software on their machines.“At this stage it will be important to focus on suspicious traffic leaving the network and making sure the problems are contained while forcing the password resets”, Mr Dixon said. “This is why two-factor authentication is so important.” But even two-factor techniques, such as requiring tokens with fast-changing numeric codes, are no guarantee of security.In May, Lockheed Martin, the largest defence contractor said it had been subject to a significant attack on its IT system that included a compromise of tokens provided by RSA.The Lockheed attack appears to have been a targeted attempt to steal intellectual property or defence secrets, while Anonymous says it hacks companies in order to publicise their security flaws. In a tongue-in-cheek move, the hackers posted an invoice for $310 to Booz Allen Hamilton on the Pirate Bay site for their “audit” of the security system.
300;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-07-10T15:38:23Z;Suppliers switch tactics to hold on to customers;;Small US industrial companies that supply components for some of the world’s biggest manufacturers have turned to a range of new customer-service techniques – from cutting the time they take to complete an order to communicating with customers via Facebook and Twitter – amid intensifying competition in the manufacturing supply chain.Although thousands of small industrial suppliers went out of business during the downturn, many of those that survived did so by expanding into new sectors and winning new customers, increasing competition for business as suppliers diversified into each others’ traditional territories.Lingering worries that the companies they supply could go bankrupt and increasing competition are the top concerns of small and medium-sized US industrial groups, according to a survey of 3,400 companies due to be released on Tuesday by ThomasNet, a website for researching industrial suppliers.“The competition is the fiercest I’ve ever seen it,” said Nancy Simmons, president of Aero Industries, a metals distributor based in Orlando that has nine employees and whose customers include Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Nasa.In response, Aero has sought to differentiate itself by offering its customers a range of business consulting services. It has drawn on its own experience – expanding exports from 1 per cent of revenues three years ago to one-fifth now – to advise on export opportunities, giving help on logistics, markets and legal issues.“There’s been consolidation among industrial suppliers, so we’re seeing bigger, more aggressive competitors, while at the same time the customer base has been shrinking,” said Richard Rubin, president of Maxi Container, a Detroit-based maker of industrial packaging with 20 employees, whose customers include Campbell Soup, BASF and Ford.To win and retain customers, Maxi has begun blogging, and is using social media such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Mr Rubin said such strategies helped him win a new contract with Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paint and chemicals group. Mr Rubin has also instituted a “customer of the month” award.Perfection Spring and Stamping, a family-owned business in Mount Prospect, Illinois, that makes metal components for companies including Continental, Bosch and Whirlpool, recently increased its sales team’s travel budget by $50,000, overhauled its website and upgraded its sales tracking and reporting system.“We’ve added 13 new customers that came through the website – half of them multinational companies and eight from sectors we’ve never served before,” said David Kahn, chief executive.For large manufacturers, the intensifying competition among suppliers has helped drive down costs and lead times. “The big manufacturers are really beating us up on price, delivery time and quality,” said Ms Simmons.“A lot of former automotive suppliers have transferred over to the medical equipment market,” said Mr Kahn. “They’re bringing auto-industry ideas – such as annual cost reductions – with them.”
301;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-06-08T17:48:44Z;Resellers rethinking RSA;;So it begins. Infosec, a UK-based IT security company has said it will no longer be selling RSA’s SecurID tokens, following news that the authentication devices had been hacked and used in an attack against defence contractor Lockheed Martin.RSA, the IT security arm of EMC, reported in March that information related to its SecurID tokens had been stolen by hackers. Earlier this week it admitted that there was a link between this attack and a hacking attempt on Lockheed.“Our main concern is that the integrity of the RSA SecurID brand has been irrevocably damaged,” said Steven Malone, Technical Director at Infosec Technologies.“We take a high profile breach involving one of our vendors extremely seriously and in light of the seriousness of the RSA hack, have taken the decision to focus 100 per cent on our other two-factor identification vendor.”“We’ve had a lot of interest from customers who are concerned about the breach and as an alternative, we’re recommending a tokenless two-factor authentication solution.”The company still technically remains an RSA partner but this is under review by the management team.Mr Malone added that many other resellers that the company was in touch with had similar concerns.RSA has offered to replace tokens for customers whose intellectual property needs protecting. The wording on this is ambiguous - the offer is for “customers with concentrated user bases typically focused on protecting intellectual property and corporate networks”. It is hard to imagine a company that doesn’t want to protect its network and its IP.Certainly some were scrambling to take up the offer. Software company SAP, for instance, is finalising the details of a token replacement with RSA.Many others, however, could be looking to go elsewhere. The number of defections is certain to grow.

The L-3 attack makes the company the second hacker target linked to the RSA breach. It was revealed at the weekend that Lockheed Martin had also suffered an intrusion.Jonathan Kaplan - founder of Pure Digital Technologies, the maker of the Flip pocket camcorder – revealed his latest project at the D9 conference — a grilled cheese sandwich. Venture Beat says that Kaplan’s new company, The Melt, will be a “next generation fast, casual restaurant.” Users will order grilled cheese sandwiches and soups via a mobile website. Then they receive a QR code, redeem the code in any Melt restaurant, and receive their freshly made order in minutes.Harper Reed, former chief technology officer at community based T-shirt group Threadless, has been appointed to oversee technology for the Obama 2012 campaign, says The Washington Post.

303;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed cyberattack exposes flaws;;A hacking attack disclosed at the weekend against the largest US defence contractor suggests that government and private efforts to protect military secrets are struggling with cybersecurity.Lockheed Martin and US officials confirmed the attack after media reports linked it to a breach in March at RSA, the company that provides tokens authorising computer access by remote users at Lockheed and many other companies and agencies.Lockheed did not confirm that the raid on its data built on the attack on RSA, but many analysts said that it was likely, because one of Lockheed’s first acts had been to disable the remote logins.More disturbing, they said, was the fact like others in the defence industry, Lockheed had previously acted to make itself less dependent on the rapidly-changing numeric passwords the RSA tokens produced.The RSA breach began with e-mails sent to its staff with an attachment that contained a hidden remote-access program that took advantage of a security flaw in Adobe’s Flash software for viewing content.Without saying exactly what had been taken, RSA warned that the stolen information could be used in future attacks on its SecurID token customers.Analysts said it appeared the hackers had obtained the “seed” numbers used to generate passwords. If they combined that with administration information kept by customers associating tokens with specific employees, the passwords could be duplicated.The National Security Agency went further, declaring not long after the RSA attack that the tokens should no longer be deemed sufficient to grant access to “critical infrastructure”. Defence contractors including Lockheed began requiring employees to put in extra personal passwords.Although Lockheed said its programs and customer data had not been compromised in the attack, the breach suggests that the extra passwords were not sufficient to repel hackers, an ominous sign for remote-access systems in defence and other industries.Richard Stiennon, a former Gartner security analyst and author of a recent book on cyberwar, said: “If there is a direct connection between the RSA breach and the subsequent attacks on Lockheed Martin and other defence contractors, this will be one of the most sophisticated sequences of attack events ever”.Neither the RSA nor the Lockheed breaches have been blamed on any hacking group or country.However, senior US intelligence officials have repeatedly accused China of orchestrating a campaign of cyber espionage aimed at stealing defence secrets, and the trails from many of the most recent sophisticated intrusions in recent years at leading US concerns have led back to the mainland.
304;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-05-29T18:46:00Z;Lockheed data secure despite cyberattack;;Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor by sales, has said no data on its customers, programs or employees has been compromised by a “significant and tenacious” attack on its information technology system discovered nine days ago.Reports of the attack were confirmed on Saturday by the company and the US government, but Lockheed insisted that its computer network remained secure. The US Department of Defense said that it did not “expect any adverse effect” as a result of the attack.Several high-profile hacking attacks against large companies have hit the headlines in recent months, most recently the data breach at Sony that forced the Japanese electronics group to shut down some online services.However, the attempt to breach security at Lockheed is potentially the most serious, affecting a company that supplies many of the most sophisticated weapons systems for the US military and other armed forces around the world.Lockheed said in a statement that its information security team had detected the attack “almost immediately”, and taken “aggressive actions” to protect its systems and data.The company refused to comment on a story from Reuters, the news agency, saying that its “SecurID” electronic keys had been breached. Reuters also reported that other companies had been subject to attacks, although none confirmed over the weekend that they had also been threatened.SecurID, which can work through electronic tokens or other systems, changes the user’s password every 60 seconds in an attempt to defeat hackers. The system is supplied by RSA, the security division of EMC Corporation, the Massachusetts-based IT group, which revealed in March that it had discovered “an extremely sophisticated cyber attack in progress being mounted against RSA.” It said that “while at this time we are confident that the information extracted does not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers,” it was nevertheless “providing immediate steps” for its customers to strengthen their security.EMC declined to comment on Sunday.Lockheed said at the weekend its team was continuing “to work around the clock to restore employee access to the network, while maintaining the highest level of security.”The company added that it faced “constant threats … from adversaries around the world” but “our policies, procedures and vigilance mitigate the cyber threats to our business, and we remain confident in the integrity of our robust, multi-layered information systems security”.
305;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed Martin set to cut more jobs;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, is likely to make further job reductions as it seeks to cut costs and respond to calls by Pentagon officials for contractors to make their products more affordable.Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed, said staff numbers had declined by about 20,000 since 2009 but added that additional reductions might be necessary in the coming months and years.“Two years ago, we had 146,000 employees. We now have 126,000 employees and that number may well continue to decline,” he said, adding that while the contraction was painful “these are extraordinarily demanding times and we cannot fail to take action.”The job cuts came amid a broader effort by Lockheed to trim costs. In recent months, it has sold two units, consolidated factories and used buy-outs to cull about 600 executives from its ranks. The executive cuts will reduce net costs at Lockheed by $350m over the next five years and by about $105m every year after that. Meanwhile, closing down one of its mission systems and sensors facilities will save about $160m.Over the past year or so, Robert Gates, outgoing secretary of defence, has pushed contractors to become more efficient and deliver cheaper weapons to help offset pressures on the Pentagon’s budget. While some officials have argued that contractor efficiencies can be achieved without job losses, Mr Stevens said the demands of achieving “affordability” meant that some jobs would inevitably be cut.The military budget is set to flatten out over the next few years, but even that forecast, sketched out in the president’s 2012 budget, could be overly optimistic. In Congress, politicians from both parties hope to cut defence spending to reduce the federal deficit or to limits cuts in other areas.“The unpleasant reality,” Mr Stevens said, is that “very often the actions that need to be taken to get lower levels of cost involve facility consolidations, capital reductions, as well as reduction in the workforce and you see that in our business and I believe you will see that in any business.”After 10 years of rapid growth in the wake of September 11, contractors are now adjusting their size and shape to cope with stagnant or falling budgets. In 2010, Boeing said it would cut 10 per cent of the executives in its military aircraft business. In Britain, BAE Systems has announced plans to trim hundreds of staff.
306;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-05-01T17:03:31Z;India teaches US the need for patience;America needs to build trust and not get too hung up on formal agreements;When Ratan Tata, the 73-year-old chairman of the Tata Group, strapped himself into the cockpit of a Boeing F/A–18 Super Hornet three months ago to blast into the sky above Bangalore, Washington must have felt that payday was within its grasp.Ever since former US president George W. Bush agreed the Indo-US civil nuclear deal three years ago, the White House has keenly waited for its investment in India to produce a return.US diplomats call it “payback” for a deal that legitimised India’s nuclear industry and opened a way to the top table of nations within the nuclear club, the United Nations and the G20.Mr Bush’s successor Barack Obama put top of the list big business deals that create much-needed jobs in the US across multiple sectors and states. That message was made plain with the feting of Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, at the White House and with Mr Obama’s visit to India in November. The US cash register was primed to ring with new business.On that trip, Mr Obama walked away with deals worth $10bn, representing 50,000 American jobs. But Washington wanted more.A contract to deliver 126 multi-role combat aircraft, worth $11bn, was one suitable prize. Boeing and Lockheed Martin were both in the competition.But, last week, France’s Dassault and the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon consortium made the shortlist. The US, alongside Sweden and Russia, did not.It was an embarrassing blow to the White House. Particularly humiliating was being outflanked by French president Nicolas Sarkozy, coupled with the Indian air force’s declaration that US technology was inferior to Europe’s.On the day of the defeat, Timothy Roemer, the US ambassador to New Delhi and a personal friend of Mr Obama, resigned. He departed from the usual rhetoric to admit that Washington was “deeply disappointed”. He could have just as easily said “short-changed”.The pressure to win defence contracts is all the more acute because of setbacks in India’s nuclear energy sector. US companies still hope to win big. But they are discouraged by nuclear liability legislation. Less squeamish competitors, like Russia and France have rushed in where General Electric and Westinghouse tread more fearfully.Worse still, the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan makes it more difficult to accomplish goals in India, where concern about nuclear energy is rising.So what are the lessons of the defeat? One is that India resists, openly at least, transactional relationships. Many US partners do. Neighbouring Pakistan similarly bridles, but with a broken economy can less easily resist. Islamabad deeply resents the predicament of being Washington’s “hired gun” to fight Islamist extremists.Another lesson is that India drives a hard bargain.Lalit Mansingh, India’s former foreign secretary, says the US needs to build trust and not get too hung up on formal agreements.The Russians have understood this over the past six decades of support for India. The US friendship is far younger and less tested. Aggressive sales pitches do not work. Mr Roemer, who has served barely two years in India, knows by now that India rewards time and punishes the impatient.But he can take comfort. First, what is happening between India and the US was unthinkable a decade ago, when Washington imposed sanctions after India’s nuclear weapons tests in 1998.Second, India, the world’s fastest growing economy after China, is buying American. It has ordered C-130 transport aircraft and P-8 maritime surveillance planes. It stands to buy C-17 aircraft for $4bn.Third, it would be reckless to let the disappointment of Boeing and Lockheed sour a partnership that holds promise, especially when New Delhi’s bureaucracy in many ways least reflects the economic and social change sweeping a country of 1.2bn people.Shortly after announcing his exit, Mr Roemer reflected: “Our relationship with India is not perfect – no relationship in the world is.”The jet deal may have eluded the US, but others are needed to give credence to Mr Obama’s billing that the US-India partnership is one that will define the 21st century.
307;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;US groups look for answers on jet snub;;US defence contractors are seeking explanations from New Delhi about why their aircraft failed to make a shortlist for the supply of 126 jet fighters, worth $11bn, to India.India has selected European aircraft over Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Super Viper to modernise its air power in what is one of the largest arms contracts in the world.People close to the bids said puzzled US companies were pressing for more detailed explanations of the failure of their aircraft to meet the competition’s technical specifications.US bidders were “confused” by the reasons offered by India’s defence establishment for their aircrafts’ rejection, and questioned why the US offer of highly advanced radar systems had been ignored.The aerospace companies received letters this week outlining why they had not joined France’s Dassault Rafale and the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon on the shortlist. Swedish and Russian bids were also jettisoned. US bidders were riled by the success of the Rafale, a fighter jet that has yet to be sold outside France. It had been withdrawn from the contest, and then re-entered.Timothy Roemer, the departing US ambassador to India, said he was “deeply disappointed with the outcome” that had spurned well-priced US bids. He also questioned why India had overlooked the US Active Electronically Scanned Array radar system, a key technological advantage held by US aircraft.The ambassador said the broader US-India partnership would survive the blow and should not be hostage to one lost deal.Indian officials told the Financial Times that they considered the shortlist a closed chapter. They do not intend to make a public statement until a sole bidder is identified.“The evaluation has been done. All six bidders have been debriefed at every stage,” said Wing Commander T.K. Singha, an Indian defence spokesman.Additional reporting by Amy Kazmin
308;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-04-28T18:54:04Z;Tight race to secure once in a lifetime deal;;For many of the world’s leading aerospace companies, the contract to build 126 jet fighters to protect India’s skies is a once in a generation opportunity.Defence experts consider it the Al-Yamamah – the famed contract to supply Saudi Arabia with arms in the 1980s – of the modern era.India, the world’s largest democracy, ranks as one of the biggest arms markets as it seeks to modernise an antiquated military. Unlike neighbouring China, India is open to buying its hardware either from Russia, its traditional military supplier, or from Europe and the US.A successful bid would secure an aircraft’s future at a perilous time of shrinking military budgets in Europe. It offers long-term industrial partnership with the globe’s fastest-growing economy after China and one of the lowest-cost engineering hubs in the world.The deal is also a strong strategic indicator. Senior India strategists consider the country at a geopolitical crossroads, and say the deal has the power to decide a stronger future partnership with the west over Russia.Failure would jeopardise prized hi-tech jobs when politicians, such as Barack Obama, US president, are fighting to increase employment. It will also threaten the end of the production line for some aircraft models, either the old such as the F-16, or new, such as the Rafale.For Eurofighter, winning the Indian contract is of a far different order than previous deals to supply Saudi Arabia and Austria, or consortium partners the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain.Likewise, success for Dassault’s Rafale would transform the prospects of an aircraft, admired by many in military aviation, but not as yet sold outside France.The French defence ministry has to shell out €800m ($1.17bn) a year to buy the minimum 11 units a year needed to keep production lines open. Knowing an export order would ease pressure on state finances, Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, has tirelessly promoted the aircraft on official visits abroad.By sidelining Sweden’s Gripen, New Delhi has signalled a preference for a heavier, twin-engine jet that can carry a larger payload of weapons and undertake longer-range sorties in the Himalayan region.The greatest upset has been the decision not to include any US aircraft in the shortlist. Lockheed Martin and Boeing were competing with their F-16 and the F-18 Super Hornet respectively. Both models were introduced in the 1980s, and based on older technology than the Rafale or Typhoon.Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said the age issue might mean India’s decision was a bigger blow for Lockheed than Boeing after being judged to be offering inferior products.“The F-18 remains in production for the US navy, which has extended the production run,” Mr Barrie said.“That keeps the production line hot and keeps it on the export market for other competitions. For the F-16, this is probably more difficult, since its getting closer to the end of its life span.”Lockheed said on Thursday that the US government was working on a response to the India’s decision to drop its bid, suggesting that the battle was far from over.The US has jealously guarded its defence technology and its more advanced jets such as the F-22 and the upcoming F-35 were not in the competition.“This is good news for EADS, Finmeccanica and especially BAE Systems [who make up the Eurofighter consortium],” said Guy Brown, an analyst at Evolution Securities. Defence industry analysts reckoned that BAE Systems’ supply of the Hawk trainer aircraft to India and longstanding partnership with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics gave it an edge over some of the competition.No surprise is the removal of Mikoyan’s MiG-35 from the competition, regarded by its rivals as an aircraft that existed on paper alone because as an upgrade of the MiG-29 it is still under development. The Russian aerospace industry will continue to benefit from its relationship with India as the two countries are already collaborating on the development of the so-called fifth generation stealth fighter aircraft.Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger in Paris
309;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-04-26T19:20:03Z;S&P higher after strong US results;;A batch of strong results from leading US companies including Ford Motor, UPS and 3M helped push the S&P 500 index to its highest level since June 2008 in a sign of rising market confidence in spite of concerns about the world economy.Ford, the second-largest US car company by revenues, reported its highest quarterly profit for the period in 13 years, in the latest sign of the revival in US manufacturing.UPS, the logistics company, and 3M, the diversified manufacturer, raised their guidance for full-year earnings after first-quarter profits beat analysts’ expectations. Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor, also raised its full-year projection.The news follows excellent results from industrial companies such as United Technologies, Eaton and Honeywell.Of the 154 constituents of the S&P 500 that have reported earnings for the first quarter, 122 have delivered earnings ahead of average expectations, according to Bloomberg data.The S&P 500 index was 0.9 per cent up at 1347 by midday in New York and up 7.1 per cent this year. The rally this year has been led by the energy sector, which has risen 16 per cent, followed by the industrial sector and healthcare, which are both up 10 per cent.The benchmark has nearly doubled from its low of 676 set in March 2009, during the financial crisis, but is still 14 per cent below its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007.Ford’s first-quarter earnings were $2.55bn, up 22 per cent on a year earlier and far ahead of analysts’ estimates. The company ascribed the rise to higher volumes and selling prices, as well as lower interest payments. Operating profits in Europe almost trebled, helped by new models.However, Alan Mulally, chief executive, said that despite the strong first quarter, Ford was sticking to earlier 2011 sales projections due to uncertainties.The company warned that results later in the year “may not be as strong as the first quarter”. It cited lower profits at Ford Credit, its financing arm, rising commodity prices and expanding investments, especially in emerging markets such as Russia, which Ford expects will be Europe’s biggest car market by 2015.Mr Mulally added however, that while new investments would push up costs, “they are also driving higher volumes, richer mix [of vehicles] and stronger transaction prices”.UPS also raised concerns about risks in the world economy, saying that the outlook was “a little cloudier” than it was three months ago.Ford shares climbed 2 per cent to about $15.90 at midday in New York, far above their lows of close to a dollar in late 2008, but still below January’s recent peak of almost $19.3M shares were also up about 2 per cent at $96.14, while UPS and Lockheed were both up about 1 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
310;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-04-26T17:13:59Z;Lockheed Martin to pursue growth outside US;;"Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor by revenues, expects a strong rise in international sales to provide most of its growth over the next two to three years, while US sales are flat, the company said on Tuesday.It made the prediction as it reported first-quarter earnings from continuing operations up 12 per cent at $1.55 per share, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations. The company raised its projection of expected full-year earnings slightly, to $6.95-$7.25, from previous guidance of $6.70-$7, thanks to a $90m benefit from a successful appeal over tax payments for 2003-08.Although the immediate budget crisis in the US has passed with the agreement to avoid a government shutdown, Lockheed is still facing a future of constrained military funding in its home country, which accounts for about 85 per cent of revenues.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said he believed Lockheed’s portfolio of aircraft and other equipment, which was “proven on the battlefield and in other spaces”, would enable it to succeed in a more difficult environment.“The industry has had the benefit of a rising tide over the past 10 years, which has enabled everyone to grow. We won’t have that in the future; it will depend on the quality of the portfolio,” he said.He added that although there was clearly no support in the US government for mergers of the large tier one defence contractors, consolidation among smaller companies remained possible.“In any environment where a sector is facing slower growth, one of the most effective means of reducing costs is consolidation. So just because there is no more consolidation among the tier one suppliers, that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in tier two and tier three,” he said.Lockheed would always be “opportunistic” about future deals, based on its strategy of adding small add-on acquisitions in a “string of pearls”, rather than simply trying to grow larger, he said. “I’m not sure we need any more size.”Indeed, in April Lockheed fianalised the sale of its Pacific Architects and Engineers unit to Lindsay Goldberg, the private equity group, for an undisclosed sum, and last year sold its Enterprise Integration Group, which provides engineering consulting services to the Pentagon, to Veritas Capital for $815m.Instead, Lockheed is looking for growth by expanding in international markets, with strong sales of its new F-35 fighter, the older F-16 and the C-130 transport aircraft.In two to three years, the company expected its non-US sales to rise to 20 per cent of total revenues, from 15 per cent today, as US sales were “flattish” while international markets grew, Mr Tanner said.In the first quarter, total revenues rose by 3 per cent from the equivalent period a year ago to $10.6bn, and operating profits fell 9 per cent because of a higher pension expense.In morning trading in New York, Lockheed’s shares were up 1 per cent at $78.24. They have fallen 9 per cent over the past year."
311;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-04-25T20:32:55Z;‘Say-on-pay’ rules hit US executives;;US companies have begun cutting pay and benefits for top executives, and disclosing more details of packages, in anticipation of the effect of new rules that give shareholders greater power to vote down remuneration structures.According to pay consultancy ClearBridge, which has examined the first 100 Fortune 500 companies to file details of so-called proxy statements – resolutions to be voted on at annual meetings – there is clear evidence of a shift in pay practices.“Executive compensation tends to go up or stay flat, so any time it goes down is the beginning of a noteworthy trend,” said Russell Miller, partner at ClearBridge.The 2011 annual meeting season is the first to see the implementation of evidence of the effect of new “say-on-pay” rules, introduced as part of last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reforms.Nearly 40 companies, including AT&T, Walt Disney and OfficeMax, have eliminated tax breaks that have seen them take on executive tax bills under some circumstances.At the same time, General Electric has lengthened and toughened the terms of the share option plan for Jeff Immelt, its chief executive, responding to shareholder criticism ahead of Wednesday’s annual meeting.A portion of the $7.4m option award that would have vested in 2013 was pushed back to 2015, and the entire award only vests if the company meets performance targets.Companies are also reducing multiples of salary paid to chief executives as part of severance packages, and are adopting provisions to claw back bonus payments at a later date. Of the 79 companies disclosing clawbacks for executives, 34 adopted or enhanced these recently, according to ClearBridge.Disclosure of pay in proxy materials, the documents sent out to investors before annual meetings, has improved. “Companies have taken it upon themselves to think about what their story is,” said Robin Ferracone of Farient Advisors, a consultancy.GE put a summary of its pay programme at the start of its proxy statement.Several companies, including Kimberly-Clark and Lockheed Martin, have anticipated future requirements of say-on-pay rules by adding a comparison of total shareholder returns to chief executive pay.
312;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-04-15T16:51:07Z;Space shuttle leaves trail of opportunity in its wake;;“Two, one, booster ignition…and the final lift-off of Discovery!” boomed the loudspeaker. As it vanished into the sky, the shuttle left behind an arc of white smoke and a legacy of 30 years of space flight. Discovery is being retired from low-Earth orbit flights, its mission outsourced to private enterprise.“I will miss these boys, I will definitely miss them”, says Dan Quinn, a technician who started working for the shuttle programme in 1988. Standing at a hangar below the shuttle Endeavour, which makes its final voyage this month, he says: “We made history with them.”Mr Quinn is one of 7,000 to 9,000 workers who are losing their jobs with Nasa, the US space agency, and its private contractors.Nasa’s mission has been updated in keeping with these austere times: to put astronauts in orbit using privately run launch, transport and services companies. Nasa will now focus its resources on “deep space exploration”, such as potential landings on asteroids and, eventually, Mars.“The goal is to take low-Earth orbit and make it a marketplace as compared to just a Nasa destination”, Ed Mango, who heads the Nasa commercial crew project, told the Financial Times. The changes were heralded when Barack Obama, US president, signed legislation in October calling for $1.3bn to be allocated to the development of commercial crew services over the next three years. The money will help private companies design and build devices capable of delivering astronauts to the International Space Station – currently jointly operated with the Russian space agency. Nasa will aim to fly two shuttles to the space station by July – Endeavour on April 29 and Atlantis by the end of June – and then close the programme.“The whole concept of Nasa retiring the shuttle was to enable more exploration outside of low-Earth orbit. The shuttle can’t go outside of there, so maybe there are other methods we can use to go there for cheaper”, Mr Mango says, adding that each shuttle flight costs an average of $100m.“It started with the idea that Nasa development programmes can become very expensive and Nasa really should be focused on things we haven’t done before”.But in spite of a temporary spending measure signed by Mr Obama in December, uncertainties abound. Nasa could be left waiting for new appropriations legislation before it can get started on its deep space exploration programme. The administration has also decided not to fund a replacement rocket capable of sending people into space this year.Aeronautics companies that have been providing technology to Nasa – including Lockheed Martin and Boeing – have said they will compete in the astronaut transport, cargo and even space tourism industries. Others are trying to get a slice of the market, including Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which is building a spaceport facility in New Mexico, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is working on reusable orbital rockets. Nasa will offer private companies training and safety certifications. In addition, Nasa facilities such as the Kennedy Space Center will offer logistical services to the highest bidder, just like an airport offering gates to different airlines. It is expected that everything will be up and running by 2015.“Nasa struggles with what role it plays going forward, it needs to change things, it is not the only rocket-maker in town now and this is what is going to create commercial opportunities”, says Howard Haug of Space Florida, an aerospace development agency that offers consultancy services for investors interested in the space business.“This means opening a route. The key point here has got to be low-cost, reliable, frequent access to space,” he says.Space Florida cites business opportunities in the extraterrestrial market: from launch systems and satellites to technologies that could only be developed and used from low-Earth orbit, such as monitors to predict weather and agricultural fertility, and new forms of energy. Then, of course, there is the ultimate in adventure tourism. “When one does the size of the space market now, the numbers are already $280bn dollars. So there is a major upside”, says Mr Haug.But the promise of a new era comes with a deep sense of nostalgia at the Kennedy Space Center. Mr Quinn hopes his last task this year will be to bring one of the spacecraft to a Washington museum.The mood at the centre seems to be summed up by a bumper sticker on an employee’s car outside a hangar built for the Apollo programme that brought astronauts to the moon: “I’d rather be flying.”
313;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-04-05T22:09:02Z;Groups call for census boycott;;The role of one of the world’s largest defence companies, Lockheed Martin, in Britain’s census has led some opposition groups to urge householders to boycott it or tamper with their forms ahead of a formal deadline on Wednesday.“Lockheed Martin produce F-16 fighter jets and other weapons, and this is legitimising the arms industry,” said Chris Browne, a founder of the Count Me Out campaign that urges non-compliance with the census.“At the end of the day, the profits from Lockheed Martin UK and the census go back to the same parent company, and we think the arms industry is an inherently unethical industry.”Lockheed Martin makes the Hercules transport aircraft, missiles, and a range of fighter jets, earning $46bn of annual revenues last year. The group also has a division that manages census contracts, and has conducted censuses in the US and Canada as well. However, critics argue that the company’s defence profile should preclude it from the census.“Lockheed Martin played a major role in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” said Symon Hill, of the think-tank Ekklesia. “I worry that awarding a major government contract to them implies an endorsement of their work. As a Christian and a pacificist, I can’t in conscience cooperate with an arms company. So, I have decided to boycott the census. “I’m going to return the form with my name and address and with a letter explaining why I’ve not filled it in, politely.”Count Me Out is not advocating any one single response to the census, instead placing on its website advice and letter templates so respondents can engage in various levels of dissent. At the more mild end, respondents can enclose a letter with their census stating their objection to Lockheed’s involvement, or step up their response by tampering with the form by smudging boxes or filling in barcodes.“Because the data capture process is automated, if you can ensure the form has to be processed manually, then Lockheed won’t be able to make as much money off it,” said Mr Browne.Beyond the broader ethical objections, campaigners have also expressed their opposition to Lockheed’s involvement in the census out of fear that data could be accessed by the US authorities under the terms of the Patriot act. The Office for National Statistics vigorously denies this claim.“Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that US authorities are unable to access census data,” the ONS said in a statement. “All data is the property of the ONS, and all data processing will be carried out in UK – no data will leave or be held at any point outside the UK. The only people who have access to the full census dataset in the operational data centre will be ONS staff [and] no Lockheed Martin staff (from either the US parent or UK company) will have access to any personal census data.” Lockheed declined to comment.With forms still being filled in, the ONS says it is still too early to make any assessment of the extent of tampering or census spoiling. While there is a soft deadline of returning the forms by Wednesday, the ONS will send out thousands of officials in the following weeks to call door-to-door on those households that have not returned their forms.In addition to questions over the involvement of Lockheed, some campaigners have taken issue with the structure of the census questions itself, in particular the section on religion. “The question on religion was only introduced to the census in 2001,” said Bob Churchill of the British Humanist Association.“We believe it’s a leading question. It asks what is your religion as opposed to do you have a religion, and the question is in amongst questions on nationality and ethnicity, so you’re geared up to answer it in a broad cultural way.”The BHA is concerned that this will lead people who only feel a vague cultural affiliation to a religion but are not practising, to tick this religious box rather than the ‘no religion’ choice. This could lead the census to overestimate the true level of religiosity in the country.“That data gets used to reinforce the idea that religious identity is especially important. It is used to justify existing policies such as bishops in the House of Lords, and also to create new policies such as the number of faith schools or introducing academies that are religiously sponsored.”
314;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-03-25T04:03:25Z;GE, Rolls-Royce defy Pentagon order;;General Electric and Rolls-Royce said on Thursday that they would continue to develop an alternative engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, despite being ordered by the US Department of Defense to stop work on the programme.“Stop work” orders usually require contractors to put down tools for 90 days while the government considers the future of a project. But Rolls-Royce and GE said they would “self-fund” the development work, costing about $1m a day, to keep the programme alive.The second engine programme has provoked controversy for years. Powerful forces in the US Congress argue that an extra engine will provide competition and reduce costs over the long run, but President Barack Obama and the Department of Defense say it is a wasteful duplication.“The administration and the DoD strongly oppose the extra engine program,” the defense department said. “In our view it is a waste of taxpayer money that can be used to fund higher departmental priorities, and should be ended now.”For the companies involved, the stakes are significant. GE estimates that the market for F-35 engines could be worth about $100bn over the 30-year lifespan of the F-35 combat jet.GE expects to win half of all orders, with the other half going to the main engine maker, Pratt & Whitney, which is part of United Technologies. GE will split proceeds with joint venture partner Rolls-Royce.The multibillion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter programme is a new generation of single-engine fighter jet built by Lockheed Martin. The US military and allied countries, including the UK and Italy, are expected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to buy about 3,000 of the aircraft.Powerful figures in the US Congress, including John Boehner, speaker of the House of Representatives, support the second engine but political support seems to be ebbing. In February the House of Representatives voted down $450m in 2011 funding for the programme.However, Rolls-Royce and GE said that Thursday’s decision by the Pentagon would not be a setback.“We intend to self-fund the programme while we get through this budget issue,” said GE. “Congress hasn’t resolved the budget for this year yet so they have taken a unilateral action without allowing the budget to be resolved, which is very unusual.”Rolls-Royce said it was confident political support for the project would coalesce next month.“We are grateful for the recent support for engine competition from several House and Senate leaders and we look forward to a continuation of this when they convene in early April to complete the FY2011 budget process,” the company said.

317;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;F-35 purchase could prove costly for Canada;;Canada’s decision to purchase 65 fighter aircraft made by Lockheed Martin could end up costing the country about $30bn or almost two-thirds more than the government estimated last year, according to a report by the parliamentary budget office published on Thursday.The report provides another round of ammunition for opposition parties in Canada, which have heavily criticised the decision by Stephen Harper, Conservative prime minister, to move ahead with the deal without a competition and in spite of uncertain costs.When the government announced that it would purchase 65 F-35 fighters in July 2010, it forecast that each aircraft would cost about C$75m ($77m) and the fleet would cost about C$250m to C$300m to maintain over 20 years, for a total cost of about $17.5bn.The budget office, an independent financial watchdog, challenged those assumptions arguing that “the capabilities of the aircraft remain uncertain given its current state of development … and the acquisition and long-term sustainment costs have not been determined.”Using calculations based on the historical costs of combat aircraft, which are closely correlated to the weight of the airframe, the budget office report said that each aircraft would likely cost Canada about $148.5m given the stage of the production cycle when it will make its purchase.Lifecycle maintenance and support costs could come to about US$450m over 30 years, although the budget office said that there was greater uncertainty around this estimate, bringing the total procurement cost to about US$29.3bn.The report also raised questions about the benefits that the F-35 would bring to Canadian industry which is expected to supply about C$12bn of parts and services to the programme.In a statement, the Liberal party said the report suggested that the government had misled Canadians about the cost of the programme and described the price tag as “unconscionable”.But Dan Ross, assistant deputy defence minister, said his department stood behind its earlier estimates, which were based on a decade of study of the actual costs of the F-35, not on historical comparisons.“We are dealing with a highly complex project that involves a number of different variables and factors on cost, which can vary depending on how they are calculated,” he said.The Liberal party has threatened to cancel and re-tender the programme if it wins office. But the budget report offered a small fillip to the Conservatives, noting that the F-35 was the only aircraft that would meet military requirements as they stand.The F-35 fighter jet is the largest procurement programme ever undertaken. It is designed to replace much of the US combat fleet and will also form the backbone of allied air forces around the world.Still, the project has struggled with substantial cost and schedule overruns. The development and production profile has been restructured several times to cope with unexpected supply chain issues and problems with particular technology components.Lockheed said on Thursday it was examining the review but that “contrary to the PBO report, our estimates are based on actual, detailed F-35 programme data. Initial deliveries of F-35s to Canada are expected to begin in 2016 … [and] will cost C$70m to C$75m.”
318;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-03-09T23:02:03Z;Liam Fox holds talks over budget bail-out;Defence secretary makes frank admission over cash shortfall;Liam Fox is locked in talks with the Treasury to bail-out a defence budget that has reached “crisis point”, with a £500m black hole this year from an incomplete deal to sell Typhoon fighter jets to Oman.The defence secretary’s frank admission that he inherited an “unmanageable” budget comes at a critical time in negotiations to avert last October’s strategic defence review from being prematurely reopened.Mr Fox told the Commons Defence Committee that a combination of “missing receipts” from Typhoon sales, increased fuel costs and currency fluctuations had forced him to seek Treasury dispensations to make his 2011 budget affordable.The revelations over the budget came as the MoD confirmed to the Financial Times that it is attempting to renegotiate a £400m commitment with the US to buy three prototypes of the F-35 jump-jet, after ministers cancelled plans to bring the specific model into military service.Senior defence figures put the MoD funding shortfall this year at about £1bn, forcing ministers to consider sweeping cuts to equipment programmes – such as Tornado jets and Chinook helicopters – as well as personnel levels.One person closely involved in the budget talks warned that without extra Treasury support, the end result “would not resemble the defence review in the slightest”. While the Treasury is working with the MoD on its cash flow problems, there is no appetite for reopening the budget settlement.Asked whether the estimate of a £1bn shortfall was correct, Mr Fox said: “That is of course dependent on the resources that we are discussing at the moment with the Treasury.”“For example, about £500m of that money would be the money we might have expected from proceeds of previous sales of Typhoon which are not available, which we might have expected.”The problem has arisen because MoD officials under Labour booked the proceeds from an expected sale of Eurofighter Typhoon to Oman in the 2011 budget, even though the deal had yet to be completed.When asked how the MoD budget now compared with the difficulties under Labour, Mr Fox said: “We’ve now got to the point where it’s become unmanageable. It has reached crisis point and we’ve had to do something about it.” His aides said the defence secretary was referring to the financial crisis before the defence review.Jim Murphy, shadow defence secretary, described the review as “rushed and botched”. “We are worryingly close to the red line,” he said. “Ministers must stop and think again.”As part of its budget round, the MoD is in the midst of negotiating hundreds of contracts, including its £400m commitment to buying three F-35B Joint Strike Fighter jump-jets.The three test aircraft are due to be delivered to the MoD even though last year’s defence review scrapped plans to deploy the jump-jet variant – known as Stovl, or short take-off and vertical landing – in favour of the conventional carrier version.Mr Fox has asked the US to change the order for test jets so that the UK would have one F-35C carrier aircraft, the variant that is to be deployed on the UK’s next generation of aircraft carrier. However, Lockheed Martin is at an advanced stage of building the order.Mr Fox said the Stovl variants, ordered under Labour, will still prove valuable. “The mission systems on both variants are identical so almost all of the test plan for the Stovl variant is applicable to the carrier variant,” Mr Fox told the FT.“The variant we have chosen has a longer range and carries a heavier payload, it is also cheaper to acquire and support.”

The S&P aerospace and defence sector was up 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 index was up 0.9 per cent at 1,321.82 as the oil price fell on news that key oil producing nations were boosting their production to make up for lost supply out of Libya.The S&P 500 is still down 1.6 per cent since its mid-February highs on fears that elevated oil prices caused by the troubles in North Africa and the Middle East could damage the domestic economic recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 12,214.46 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,765.77.Some strategists argued that this rally for US equities would be short-lived as turmoil in the oil markets looked set to continue.“While we might have a day or two of stable or falling oil prices, the situation in North Africa and the Middle East is far from over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “Oil prices are likely to climb higher, which in turn will put further short term pressure of equities.”Financial and industrial stocks were some of the chief beneficiaries of the upturn in risk appetite in the session.General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.62 while 3M put on 1.5 per cent to $93.75. The S&P industrial index was up 1.5 per cent.Financial stocks saw even sharper gains with the S&P sub-index adding 2.2 per cent. PNC Financial Services gained 4.4 per cent to $63.37 while Zions Bancorporation rose 2.9 per cent to $23.14.Bank of America added 4.7 per cent to $14.69, helped by comments from Brian Moynihan, chief executive, at the bank’s first investor day conference since 2007.Mr Moynihan said he believed the bank had the ability to earn between $35bn and $40bn a year in pre-tax earnings when the business normalises, a figure significantly higher than any earnings reported in the past 15 years.The bank lost $1.3bn in 2010 and earned $4.4bn pre-tax in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, it earned $20.9bn, in 2006 $32bn and in 2005 $24.5bn.Mr Moynihan also said that the bank had no intentions of making any more acquisitions and instead would focus on returning “every dollar” in capital to shareholders through regular dividends, share buy-backs and special cash dividends.Only the energy sector lost ground in the session due to the lower oil prices.Marathon Oil was down 2.4 per cent to $50.18 while Conocophillips, another oil company, was down 1.1 per cent to $78.32. The S&P energy sector lost 0.6 per cent, although it is still up 13 per cent over the year.In corporate news, shares in Urban Outfitters lost ground after the retailer reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that fell short of expectations.The company reported earnings per share of 45 cents, falling short of the 52 cents expected on Wall Street. Its shares tumbled 16.7 per cent to $31.66.Analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note: “[Urban Outfitters is] a great long-term growth story but we are still more guarded on the near-term, given uncompelling valuation . . . risks of higher sourcing costs, and potential difficulty navigating through fashion shifts.”Elsewhere in the retail sector, Casey’s General Stores fell 7 per cent to $37.71 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 37 cents a share, falling short of the 49 cents a share expected by Wall Street.McDonald’s reported that same-store sales had risen by 3.9 per cent worldwide in February. This was ahead of expectations but its shares were down 1 per cent to $75.55 after like-for-like sales growth in US fell short of forecasts.
320;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Defence: A question of scale;Pentagon spending is under rare scrutiny – but substantial cuts would have a wide impact;"High above the Pacific en route to Beijing in January, Robert Gates let slip he was travelling to China bearing gifts – not for the country’s rulers, with whom he soon squared off, but for US commanders in the region.Mr Gates’ staff soon fleshed out details of the plans – a new nuclear-capable bomber able to reach east Asia from the US, modernised radar for the F-15 fighter jet, a launch vehicle for sending satellites into space, and seaborne drone aircraft – aimed at countering China’s own military advances.All this – in parallel with $185bn to modernise America’s nuclear weapons systems over 10 years, increased spending on missile defence and more investments tailored for Afghanistan – forms part of President Barack Obama’s defence spending plans.Over the past decade, grand US defence budgets have faced little opposition, passed by Congress as part of the price for global leadership and the prosecution of the war on terror. But with Washington in a fever over the country’s record budget deficit and weary of foreign wars, Pentagon spending is now causing deep fissures across the political spectrum.Prominent conservatives, long a bastion of support for military spending, have joined forces in recent weeks with left-leaning opponents to back cuts to the Pentagon budget and even voted to cancel entire programmes. The war against the Taliban is gradually being framed by its opponents as a fiscal issue.So vast is the Pentagon’s budget – one in five government dollars goes on defence – that the impact of any cuts will reverberate around the world, influencing everything from a possible pull-out of US troops from Europe to the response to China’s rise and whether to invest in 20th-century equipment such as aircraft carriers or 21st-century cyberwar technology.More profoundly, the debate over the military is a symbol of the evolving new world order, in which US power is enfeebled at home by deficits and checked abroad by rising rivals. Two decades after historian Paul Kennedy coined the phrase “imperial overstretch” to describe a superpower committed beyond its means, the theory is fast approaching reality.“In 2000, we were responsible for one-third of the global economy and one-third of defence spending. Now, we have a quarter of global GDP [gross domestic product] and 46 per cent of defence spending,” says Loren Thompson, of the Lexington Institute, a Washington think-tank.US defence spending has almost doubled since the attacks of September 11 2001 and the invasions of Afgh-anistan then Iraq – even as the budget deficit rose under President George W. Bush then soared in the wake of the financial crisis. The Pentagon is seeking $540bn in the still-unresolved budget for the current fiscal year, in addition to $159bn on the two wars and the $7bn being spent by the Department of Energy on nuclear weapons.The Pentagon’s spending on health alone, which rose from $19bn in 2001 to a budgeted $53bn for 2012, amounts to the sixth-largest military budget in the world, just behind Russia and ahead of Germany. But rather than take on the system, Mr Obama has entrenched it, spending more on defence than Mr Bush did.The president has cast his decisions in terms of the nation’s safety – not least by boosting US troops to Afghanistan to 100,000. But many see domestic politics at work, as Mr Obama seeks to rebut criticism that he is soft on defence. The result, in the eyes of many policymakers, is a national security apparatus that favours military solutions over diplomacy – exactly the “military-industrial complex” decried by Dwight Eisenhower when president 50 years ago. “The country’s posture is gridlocked,” says Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser. “It’s like this great ship where the captain can only change course by one degree.”Mr Gates warns deep cuts would be “calamitous”. Others argue that they simply reflect a new economic reality and the constraints under which the US now operates. To keep the government running, the US has to borrow 40 cents in every dollar it spends.Mr Gates depicts past defence cuts, such as those overseen by the Bill Clinton administration in the 1990s, as mistakes that had to be rectified at great cost. A 10 per cent cut in defence would save $50bn compared with a federal budget shortfall of $1,645bn, meaning “you haven’t gotten very far toward dealing with the deficit”, he told the House armed services committee last month.…Mr Gates has tried to get ahead of the budget axe by ordering the Pentagon’s bureaucracy to find $100bn of efficiencies to invest in forces in the field. After prodding by the White House, he also agreed to cut planned spending by a further $78bn over five years, which would mean the Pentagon budget levelling off in 2015 and 2016. But that is as far as he wants to go.“With the exception of the late 1990s and the early 2000s, at 18.9 per cent, it is the lowest level of federal percentage of outlays since before world war two,” he says of the defence budget. “We still live in a very dangerous and often unstable world. We shrink from our global security responsibilities at our peril.”Indeed, many of his future savings are predicated on reductions in the size of the army in 2015, a decision the Pentagon will revisit if circumstances – notably in Afghanistan – dictate.But the debate is starting to leave defenders of the military budget behind. The fiscal crisis, and a large dose of war-weariness seeping through the system, is changing the calculus in Washington. “It is simply not credible to describe a reduction of even perhaps $23bn from the 2011 defence budget as the end of the world – it is about 3 per cent of the department’s resources last year,” says Gordon Adams, of the American University in Washington.Any conservative who questioned defence spending might once have been labelled unpatriotic. But efforts by some Republicans to quarantine the Pentagon from budget cuts have been swept aside by the party’s increasingly ascendant fiscal hawks. “I think it is now a settled issue on the right. The defence budget should be on the table, as should the entire budget,” says Grover Norquist, of Americans for Tax Reform. “There was an effort by a couple of people to say that that shouldn’t be the case but with hundreds of billions of dollars being spent, that’s just silly to say.”Thomas Donnelly, of the American Enterprise Institute, a strong supporter of defence spending, points to the new Republican-controlled House of Representatives as a big factor, with scores of new members having little exposure to national security issues. “I think the landscape is pretty clear – that in the budget, defence is just going to be treated as first among equals,” he said. “It may be nothing more than a new generation coming to grips with reality. But the fact that American strength and power require constant investment is not deeply appreciated.”Part of the culture shock for members of Congress is the inscrutability of the Pentagon’s accounts. In spite – or perhaps because – of the scale of its budget, the Pentagon does not file fully audited financial statements. Senators such as John McCain complain bitterly about the lack of competition for big defence contracts.Contractor fraud remains a big concern; an internal January report revealed that $270bn in contracts had been awarded over three years to 91 companies involved in civil fraud cases. James Amos, commandant of the US Marine Corps, says the focus on the Iraq war created a “culture of plenty”, which he is trying to overcome by getting back to his service’s “frugal roots”. Gen Amos says: “You needed something, you got it, you didn’t have to sit around and barter and say: ‘What’s more important, A or B?’ …For the last six years we’ve been able to get A and B.”Like most efforts to reduce budgets, cutting the Pentagon’s domestic and global footprint is a lot easier said than done. Mr Gates, for example said this year that “it is clear we have excess force structure in Europe”. Yet he himself halted a 2005 decision by Donald Rumsfeld, his predecessor, to bring home two of the four US brigade combat teams in Europe, which each number about 4,000 troops. Washington is now looking at the decision again and officials say one likely outcome is to withdraw just one brigade – because of the importance of reassuring European allies of American commitment – and that nothing will happen before 2015.…Numerous officials as well as outside experts say the US needs to increase its presence in Asia, to balance China’s growing influence, after 10 years in which resources were diverted to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. That was the conclusion of a commission headed last year by Steve Hadley, former national security adviser, and William Perry, a former defence secretary, which also called for a larger air force and navy.They argue that such steps are necessary because of cuts that brought the number of naval ships down from 570 in 1990 to 266 today and that they need to be financed by cutting personnel costs and, if necessary, more spending. “The problem isn’t spending on areas like defence; it’s entitlements,” says Mr Hadley, arguing that the key to getting the ballooning deficit under control is reforming bigger-ticket items such as Social Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and health schemes.All the same, those are arguments that are unlikely to satisfy the new Republicans, nor perhaps those Democrats who have always been wary of big increases in defence spending. In January, Republican members of the House of Representatives united with Democrats to vote down $450m in 2011 spending for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, even though it was supported by John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House.Opponents including Mr Gates had been trying to kill the second engine programme for a decade. But powerful members of Congress on both sides of the aisle had kept it alive, to protect jobs in their constituencies.For the first time in more than a decade, the language of defence cuts – rather than just “savings” – is being spoken in Washington. After a decade of war, even Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, regularly says that America’s biggest national security challenge is its national debt.Some longtime observers of the Pentagon and its far-flung web of valuable interests, however, are sceptical that lessons have been learnt from the costly military build-up of the last decade. “The US is the opposite of the Balkans,” says the Lexington Institute’s Mr Thompson. “No one remembers anything.”……………………………………….Industry implicationsDefence contractors blatten down the hatches and survive the worstWhen the Pentagon said in January that it would cut $78bn from its five-year budget plan and cancelled a series of procurement projects as part of a separate $100bn efficiency drive, for defence contractors the news came as something of a relief, writes Jeremy Lemer.On the day, defence stocks rallied as much as 3 per cent, against a slight decline in the broader market. Since the start of the year, shares in Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, the sector’s big three, have climbed 5-16 per cent.The reaction reflects the poor investor sentiment that had surrounded defence groups, which compete for about $400bn of the Pentagon’s $700bn-plus annual budget. Shareholders were preparing for the worst. Over the past two years, the stocks have slid amid concerns that US military spending is set to decline as the “war on terror” winds down and the war on deficits ramps up.Relative to prospective earnings, the hit has been even harder, with defence companies trading at levels not seen since the 1990s, when the Pentagon slashed spending by more than 30 per cent in the wake of the cold war.Publicly, defence contractors have taken heart from assurances by Robert Gates, defence secretary, that internal efficiency measures and better prioritisation can free up enough cash to keep raising investment on crucial equipment. High-profile casualties, such as a $15bn “swimming tank” designed by General Dynamics for use by the marine corps in taking enemy beaches, have been offset in part by extra money for other areas such as unmanned aerial vehicles.Still, the industry outlook remains uncertain at best. Analysts note that the government’s long-term spending plans have usually been far too optimistic, and that the various reform initiatives could put pressure on contractors’ margins. At the same time, companies complain that the lack of an official 2011 defence budget – due to the fight about how to reduce the deficit – is delaying projects and hurting their businesses.Contractors have found themselves in the unfamiliar position of cutting costs and shrinking their business. Lockheed has reduced executive headcount and BAE Systems, the UK defence company, has shed thousands of workers. Northrop is spinning off its shipbuilding unit.Dave Melcher, president of ITT’s defence unit, says that his company has been preparing for more than a year. It has cut costs, diversified into non-military federal work and faster-growing niches, and expanded its services business.Mr Melcher notes that instability in the Middle East and security threats elsewhere will limit Congress’s ability to make big cuts. But even so, he expects ITT’s defence revenues will decline by about 2 per cent this year from some $5.9bn in 2010."
321;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-02-23T01:19:03Z;Lockheed sells Pacific Architects and Engineers;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor by sales, has agreed to sell its Pacific Architects and Engineers unit to Lindsay Goldberg, the private equity group, for an undisclosed sum.In a statement, Lockheed said that the deal was expected to close in the second quarter of 2011, subject to certain conditions, and added that it would not have a material effect on the company.Late in 2010, Reuters reported that Lockheed was looking to sell PAE for about $500m and that a number of private equity groups and engineering services companies were interested.Lockheed put the unit up for sale in June alongside its Enterprise Integration Group as part of efforts to streamline its portfolio and remove concerns about conflicts of interest between defence companies that sell products and consulting services to the military.EIG, which provides engineering consulting services to the Pentagon, was sold Veritas Capital for $815m in October while a deal for PAE, which provides peacekeeping, infrastructure support and other services, has taken longer to complete.Lockheed bought PAE in 2006 for about $700m and until recently had high hopes for the business, noting early in 2010 that, thanks in part to the unit, it was well positioned to take advantage of the growing interest in “soft power”.But over the summer the company said that its plans for PAE had not worked out and that rather than providing access to lucrative IT and systems integration contracts, customers had wanted Lockheed to combine construction work and physical security services.In the last year or so, a number of defence contractors have begun to reshape their businesses as the US military has come under pressure to cut its spending by politicians concerned about the federal deficit.Last year, Northrop Grumman announced that it would sell or spin off its shipbuilding business while other companies have looked to acquisitions to bulk up faster growing areas of the budget such cybersecurity.At the same time, contractors have started to cut costs in order to protect their profit margins. Lockheed has undertaken a number of efficiency exercises announcing an extensive voluntary redundancy programme for executives in September.In after hours trading, Lockheed shares were flat at about $80.20. Since the start of the year the stock has rallied about 15 per cent. Lockheed’s leading products include the F-35 fighter jet and the C-130 transport aircraft.
322;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-02-17T19:50:04Z;US doubts over India jet fighter partner;;The US government has expressed doubt about the suitability of corporate partnership with an Indian state aerospace company as Boeing and Lockheed Martin bid to supply New Delhi with 126 strike fighters.The US is pitching for what is one of the world’s largest military contracts, worth $11bn. Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed’s F-16 Super Viper are vying with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab’s Gripen, Dassault’s Rafale and Russia’s MiG-35 in a competition expected to be decided this year.Any winning bidder would have to work with Bangalore-based Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which has in the past worked closely with Russian, British and French defence companies and produced an estimated 3,600 aircraft and helicopters. HAL’s turnover last year was $2.5bn.“The potential for HAL to successfully partner with US firms on a truly advanced aircraft remains untested and suspect,” Timothy Roemer, US ambassador to Delhi, wrote in a confidential cable released by WikiLeaks and seen by the FT.After a visit to the company’s plant in Bangalore in February 2010, he described India’s aviation industry as “two to three decades behind the United States and other western nations” despite advances.Mr Roemer was also struck by the lack of automation and safety precautions at the HAL plant, adding that US companies needed to “approach partnerships carefully to understand the management and technological experience of Indian firms”.The US embassy in New Delhi said it could not “confirm the authenticity” of the cable, adding that the US State Department did not comment on classified documents that may have been leaked.Mr Roemer based part of his assessment on difficulties BAE Systems, the British defence company, had experienced with HAL over the assembly of Hawk training aircraft– a project that fell behind schedule.“BAE technicians supervising work at HAL became aware that parts were being taken from the kits intended to assemble new aircraft and used instead as replacement parts for the aircraft already delivered,” wrote the ambassador, a former Congressman from Indiana. “Lack of controls left BAE unsure of what parts were now missing from the kits.”BAE said: “All the spare parts ordered were and have been delivered to schedule”. ‬‪ ‬‪Boeing said it enjoyed a “productive partnership” with HAL, building parts for the Boeing 777 airliner and the F/A-18 fighter jet. Orville Prins, Lockheed’s vice-president, business development India, said Lockheed could “ensure HAL will be successful” as a partner to produce F-16s.Ashok Nayak, the chairman of HAL, said he was unaware of Mr Roemer’s assessment and declined to comment.
323;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;GE Hitachi and Lockheed in nuclear security tie;;GE Hitachi, the US-Japanese nuclear joint venture, has formed an alliance with Lockheed Martin to develop high security control systems designed to protect a new generation of reactors against cyberterrorism.The two companies will design and manufacture the main control room systems for GEH’s Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor, its new nuclear power plant being developed for the US and export markets such as India.Danny Roderick, senior vice-president of new plant projects for GEH, said: “When you have cyberterrorism and cybersecurity issues, these platforms have to be completely resistant to those threats … When you look at the digital controls that we had 20 years ago, that won’t work today. The old generation was the equivalent of eight-track tape, compared to today’s technology, which is like digital music.”GEH hopes that offering the highest level of security and reliability in computer systems will be a key selling point in a highly competitive global market, where suppliers compete ferociously for a small number of high-value contracts.The possibility of cyberattacks on reactors was highlighted last year, when Iran’s nuclear programme was disrupted by the Stuxnet computer “worm”.In 2009, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission added the protection of computer and communications systems and safety-related networks to its security regulations.Lockheed, the largest US defence contractor by sales, said it would not be using any military technology for its reactor control systems.Dan Heller, the vice-president of its nuclear business, said the company would be “starting from scratch” with a “top-down systems control approach”.However, he said, Lockheed would be drawing on its experience of systems integration for aircraft, ships and spacecraft.Using military technology would have caused problems in some of the markets where GEH is hoping to offer the ESBWR, including Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Taiwan, as such technology requires special export dispensation.The most promising export prospect appears to be India, where GEH, a US-based 60/40 joint venture between General Electric of the US and Hitachi of Japan, hopes to sign a deal by the end of the year.In the US, in spite of hopes of a renaissance for nuclear power, the market is “still sluggish”, Mr Roderick said. Just two developments, each with two reactors, have started construction and both have chosen reactors from GEH’s rival, Westinghouse.The alliance with GEH represents a further push into civil nuclear power for Lockheed, which is being squeezed by defence budget cuts in the US and Europe.But Mr Heller said the move was not far removed from its core defence business. “This is about energy security and that is a global security issue,” he said. “It’s about offering the US and its allies a reliable source of nuclear power.”Control systems are a significant proportion of a reactor’s cost and can account for about 20 per cent of the value of a project.
324;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-02-10T22:30:30Z;Eurofighter woos India with partner offer;;The Eurofighter consortium is prepared to offer India a manufacturing role, as the international race intensifies to supply 126 jet fighters worth $11bn to New Delhi.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bernhard Gerwert, chairman of Eurofighter’s supervisory board, said so-called work-share agreements – which determine what parts of the aircraft are made in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy and support valuable high-tech jobs – would have to be adjusted if India bought the Typhoon multirole combat aircraft.Speaking at the Bangalore air show on Thursday, Mr Gerwert said the manufacture of the aircraft would have to be “rebalanced” to meet the requirements of the world’s largest democracy, should it choose to become part of what he called “the Eurofighter family”.“All of the partners will have to reduce content in Europe and shift to India,” he said.In contrast to the terms surrounding the purchases of the Typhoon by Austria and Saudi Arabia, Mr Gerwert envisaged India becoming a “new industrial partner” to join the 400 European companies that make the Eurofighter.Indian companies would become “significant manufacturing and engineering” partners contributing to the future development of the aircraft alongside Finmeccanica, BAE Systems and EADS.Mr Gerwert forecast that as many as 20,000 jobs would be created in India.The emphasis on industrial partnership reflects the importance of the deal to the future of the Typhoon after European government spending cuts.The consortium is increasing efforts to persuade New Delhi to opt for Europe’s largest military collaboration as the hard-fought competition reaches a climax.Eurofighter faces stiff competition. Saab’s JAS-39 Gripen, Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault’s Rafale, Lockheed’s F-16 Super Viper and Russia’s MiG-35 are also vying for one of the world’s biggest current military contracts by offering their own offset, transfer of technology and price incentives.P.V. Naik, head of the Indian Air Force, said he expected a decision on the aircraft to be made by September.
325;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-02-08T00:35:34Z;US Congress warned over defence bill delays;;Manufacturing jobs are being threatened and the defence industry disrupted by Congress’s failure to pass a comprehensive defence spending bill, senior executives have warned.The warning, in a letter from more than a dozen defence industry executives, comes only weeks after Robert Gates, US defence secretary, warned that his department faced a “crisis” over funding, with a shortfall of more than $20bn that could “hollow out” the military.The Pentagon is unable to start fresh defence projects or increase production rates on old programmes because of Congress’s reluctance to approve the defence appropriations budget proposed by Barack Obama, US president.Instead, the defence department has been operating under a resolution which capped funding at last year’s levels, leaving a wide gap between the $548bn or so the Pentagon has budgeted for and the $530bn it is able to spend.In the letter, 14 industry leaders, including the chief executives of Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, threw their weight behind Mr Gates, urging Congress to pass an omnibus national security appropriations bill.“Failure to address funding decisions for individual national security programmes on a full-year basis will lead to programme dislocations, funding interruptions and adverse consequences on US employment . . . for many years to come,” they said.The letter was sent to John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, as well as Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader.In a companion letter, sent last week, a handful of industry associations wrote that a failure to pass a proper bill would lead to “a series of costly schedule delays” that would increase overall costs and “could adversely affect our war fighters”.Defence companies are walking a tight line. Cutting the defence budget, which makes up about a fifth of federal spending, has steadily moved up the political agenda as both parties have sought to trim the deficit.The Pentagon laid out plans for a $100bn efficiency drive last year and supplemented them with proposals in January to cut acquisition spending, troop levels and departmental head office costs by $78bn over the next five fiscal years.While the cuts have provoked debate, Mr Gates and his supporters have made a strong case for an orderly approach to the funding debate.
326;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-01-27T17:43:50Z;Eaton looks for acquisitions;;Eaton Corp, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, reported an “outstanding” fourth quarter of last year and said earnings could grow by up to 38 per cent this year, thanks to strong growth in its markets in the US and around the world.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, also said the company was now looking more actively for acquisitions than it had in the past few years.Pre-tax profits of $1.04bn for 2010 were more than triple their 2009 level, on revenues up 19 per cent at $13.7bn. Earnings per share were more than doubled, to $5.46 in 2010 from $2.27 the previous year.The dividend for the year was up 8 per cent at $2.16 per share. Eaton also announced a two-for-one share split.The company expects some slowdown in its markets this year compared to 2010, from about 10 per cent to about 8 per cent growth, as the world economy moves from a recovery to more steady expansion. There was a particularly sharp rebound in some of Eaton’s markets coming out of the downturn, with hydraulic equipment, for example, going through a “v-shaped” bounce back, it said.However, Mr Cutler said all six of Eaton’s business segments – electrical equipment in the US and the rest of the world, hydraulic equipment and components for aircraft, trucks and cars – would benefit from growth in US and internationally.For some US industrial companies, growth in world markets has been stronger than in America, but in 2011 Eaton expects the US to outpace its non-US markets. While emerging economy growth is still very strong, and Eaton reached $1.1bn sales in China last year, developed economy markets such as European countries have been sluggish.Economists have predicted a “three-speed recovery” this year, with Europe showing the slowest growth.Signs of a stronger upturn in the US include the truck market in North America, which was very badly hit by the recession, but where “we really are starting to see a recovery,” Mr Cutler said.The US aerospace industry has been hit by concerns over cuts to the defence budget, and Lockheed Martin, the largest US military contractor, predicted on Thursday that its earnings would fall this year. However, Mr Cutler said there was a “very different dynamic between the defence side and the commercial side” of the aircraft parts business, with the civil side growing very strongly.He added that he did not expect rising costs to hit profits this year, saying: “We expect margin expansion in spite of commodity price pressures.”Speaking on an investor conference call, Mr Cutler also said Eaton was looking for more acquisitions, and its balance sheet was in good shape to do deals.He said a large deal was possible, although smaller acquisitions were more likely.“I would not take that [a large takeover] off the table, but I also don’t want to say that is necessarily where we are going to end up,” he said.
327;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-01-27T14:13:50Z;Lockheed report strong fourth-quarter profits;;Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor, said it had a record year for new orders in 2010 in spite of the squeeze on military budgets, as it reported better-than- expected earnings for the fourth quarter.It also issued guidance that earnings would be stronger this year than previously projected, although still lower than in 2010. Lockheed’s margins are being squeezed by a changing mix of programmes in its work schedule.Pre-tax profits from continuing businesses, excluding two services companies that Lockheed is selling, fell 10 per cent to $3.83bn for 2010 as a whole, while earnings per share, again from continuing operations, were down 7 per cent at $7.18.In the fourth quarter, earnings were up 5 per cent at $2.30 per share, when analysts had expected they would fall slightly.The company paid a total dividend of $2.64 per share for the year, up 13 per cent from 2009.After sustained outperformance for most of the past decade, Lockheed Martin’s shares have begun to lag behind the S&P 500 in the past year, because of concerns about the need to rein in US defence spending to help bring the country’s budget deficit under control.This month Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, announced cuts of $78bn from the defence budget over the next five years, representing a 3 per cent reduction in projected military spending over the period. The cuts were the first significant cuts in US military spending since the 9/11 attacks.Matthew Rothman at Barclays Capital estimates that Lockheed receives 85 per cent of its revenues from the US government and a further 13 per cent from other governments around the world, many of which are also facing severe financial constraints.However, Lockheed said on Thursday that it had booked $20bn of orders in the quarter, making 2010 its best year ever for order intake, and its backlog stood at $78.2bn at the end of last year, up from $77.2bn at the end of 2009.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, said: “Secretary Gates had some very tough decisions to make. But we’ll be OK with the portfolio that we’ve got.”The changing mix of its business is putting Lockheed’s earnings under pressure, however, as the more mature and higher-margin F-22 jet fighter programme winds down, and the newer and lower-margin F-35, another fighter, ramps up.As a consequence, the company expects a rise in revenues of 0-3 per cent, but a fall in earnings per share of 3-7 per cent, to $6.70-$7, for 2011.The squeeze in margins is being offset by a smaller rise in pensions contributions than previously thought, and a lower tax charge thanks to the agreement on taxes between President Barack Obama and the US Congress last month that extended the tax credit for research and development spending through to the end of 2011.Lockheed plans to buy back more shares this year, indicating it would spend at least $1bn on buy-backs, compared with $2.5bn last year.Mr Tanner suggested the company would be interested in small bolt-on acquisitions, rather than large-scale consolidation of the US defence industry.“Historically we have had a ‘string of pearls’ approach, and I would not think that strategy would change,” he said.
328;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2011-01-07T23:43:11Z;Pentagon faces big budget cuts;;The Pentagon has entered a new era of austerity with the announcement of large budget cuts that have been timed and tailored to take advantage of mounting rhetoric in Congress to cut the ballooning deficit.The cuts of $78bn over five years detailed by Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, are the first big reductions in US military spending since the 9/11 attacks lifted outlays on antiterrorism measures.Mr Gates said on Thursday his department would not be spared, given the “extreme fiscal duress” on the federal government.The cuts represent about 3 per cent of projected spending over the period.But he pushed back at the idea of more radical cuts, proposed by some politicians and analysts, describing them as “math not strategy” and “potentially calamitous” given the vital role the US plays in ensuring global security.The cuts will have to be approved by Congress, where members of both parties have traditionally fought off reductions in military spending because of the potential economic impact in their districts.In spite of some public criticism of Mr Gates from members of Congress, defence analysts said they expected the cuts to be approved. “Gates has come up with a list of cuts that are remarkably palatable to the political system,” said Loren Thompson a defence analyst.The incoming Congress has placed deficit reduction at the centre of its political programme, which should help ensure that the cuts go through. In addition, the largest cuts announced by Mr Gates will not take place until 2014-15, meaning the most painful decisions will not have to be taken for four years.“The cuts are somewhat meaningful, but because most are in the out years, there may be less than meets the eye,” said Michael O’Hanlon, of the Brookings Institution.Mr Gates said the services had followed through on the efficiency drive started last year and found another $100bn in savings on top of the cuts announced on Thursday that could be shifted within the department to buy vital equipment and pay for rising health costs.Under the new proposals, the Pentagon budget will grow slightly in 2012 to $553bn. After that, spending will slow and then flatten out in 2015 and 2016. That represents a less generous settlement than planned a year ago.To reach those goals, the defence department plans to cut up to 47,000 US troops, but only from 2015 – one year after soldiers are set to begin pulling back from Afghanistan. Even with the cuts, the army and marines would have more troops than when Mr Gates took office, he said.In the longer term, Mr Thompson said the Pentagon’s 20 per cent plus share of federal spending meant defence would be cut even further as part of overall deficit reduction.Mr O’Hanlon predicted President Barack Obama would be cautious about making further defence cuts in the short term, to ensure his opponents could not paint him as weak.
329;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Lockheed slams US defence cuts plans;;Lockheed Martin has hit out at a blueprint to cut US defence spending by $100bn in 2015, arguing that parts of the plan by the fiscal commission’s co-chairmen are unworkable and could damage national security.Cutting hundreds of F-35 combat jets from the Pentagon’s planned order would hurt “overall affordability” and would be “unfortunate [for] maintaining security”, according to executives at Lockheed, which has invested heavily in the stealth fighter.The defence budget is under scrutiny from Pentagon officials, politicians and think-tanks. They recognise that it and the F-35 programme are a target for savings as Congress looks to deal with the deficit.In November, the co-chairs of the bipartisan Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform added to pressure, suggesting the Department of Defense trim the programme as part of plans to stabilise public finances.As part of a list of cuts that could provide $100bn in defence savings in 2015, the co-chairs recommended dropping one version of the F-35 and cutting about 300 of the aircraft and replacing them with cheaper F-16s and F-18s made by Lockheed and Boeing.On Friday the 18-member bipartisan panel will vote on a final version of the proposals by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles that puts forward plans to cut “all excess spending” – a nod to their more detailed ideas on defence.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer of Lockheed, described the defence plans as a “showstopper” at an industry conference sponsored by Credit Suisse and Aviation Week.Mr Tanner said Lockheed had scaled back its ability to build F-16s and could not meet a rapid burst in demand. The F-16 lacked the ability to penetrate heavily defended air space of the type that the US increasingly faced and the F-35 was designed to beat.Ralph Heath, who runs Lockheed’s $12bn aeronautics division, said the cuts would compromise “overall affordability …[and] be really unfortunate in terms of the needs of the nation and maintaining security”.The F-35 is the largest single procurement project for the Pentagon and Lockheed. It has experienced delays and spiralling cost estimates. Buying about 2,400 of the aircraft could cost the US up to $382bn, 65 per cent more than predicted in 2002.On Wednesday, Ashton Carter, the Pentagon’s top procurement officer, told the conference he was “not happy” with the F-35 programme’s performance and would “not pay more for the airplane. There isn’t going to be ever more money”.Mr Tanner said he was also “not real happy with where we have been and where we are today. But we are making the changes that are necessary to make this programme successful at the end.”
330;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-11-11T00:46:57Z;Initial salvo fired in effort to reduce defence costs;;High-profile equipment such as the F-35 combat jet and overseas military forces could be targeted for cutbacks under proposals to slash defence spending by $100bn in 2015.Draft proposals from an influential deficit-reduction commission, co-chaired by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, recommend that the US Congress should pursue the most dramatic cuts in military spending since the cold war, reversing a decade-long trend of defence budget growth.Under the proposals, spending on equipment would be slashed by 15 per cent and that on research by 10 per cent. The number of overseas troops would drop by a third and 30,000 civilian contractors working in the Pentagon would be fired.Other suggestions would squeeze more from current spending, taking advantage of $28bn of efficiency savings, a freeze on non-combat military pay for three years and higher contributions from retirees towards their healthcare costs.Analysts said implementing the proposals of the bipartisan commission would be challenging, given the powerful military and industrial constituencies in­volved, but they indicated how far political thinking had changed and provided a useful guide to projects that were on the table.“This is the opening salvo – the first time a quasi-official group has proposed real cuts to the defence budget rather than just rearranging the categories,” said Bill Hartung at the New America Foundation. Mr Hartung calculates that the proposals imply about $800bn could be cut from the defence budget by 2020. For comparison, the base budget is currently about $600bn a year.The Aerospace Industries Association, the main lobby group for the defence industry, called the plans “arbitrary” and argued they would “undermine” critical US security and manufacturing capabilities.By cancelling the version of the F-35 designed for the marines, the commissioners suggested they could save $17.6bn between 2012 and 2015. Substituting different versions of the F-35 with cheaper kit from Boeing could also lead to savings.Such a move could hit Lockheed Martin because fewer orders would substantially raise the unit costs of the F-35. Scrapping a suite of new armoured vehicles could hit companies such as BAE Systems and General Dynamics.“We are currently reviewing the commission’s proposed defense spending recommendations, however we believe it is premature to discuss any potential impact to the F-35 program,” said the spokesman for Lockheed Martin.“These are arbitrary proposals made by two members of the commission, and we don’t expect them to go forward,” said Cord Sterling at the AIA.Faced with escalating national deficits, military officials and industry executives have slowly confronted the prospect of tighter budgets, touting efforts to find cost savings and efficiencies but balking at the idea of outright cuts.Robert Gates, defence secretary, has repeatedly warned against the US awarding itself a “peace dividend” by reducing defence spending.“Four times we have had to rebuild and rearm at huge cost in blood and treasure,” Mr Gates said in August, referring to the temporary – and painfully reversed – defence cuts in the 20th century.Earlier in the year, Mr Gates ordered his staff to pursue efficiency savings of $100bn over the next five fiscal years that could be used to maintain spending on key equipment. By contrast, the commission implies that the money should go to deficit reduction.At the same time, some analysts said the recommendations did not go far enough. “I wonder how solid the figures are,” said Carl Conetta, co-director of the Project on Defense Alternatives. “To achieve real savings the administration needs to go after the number of troops, ships and fighter jet units in the military.”Still, beneath the top-line figures Messers Simpson and Bowles recommended cutting some substantial and well supported programmes including most of the new weapons earmarked for the US marines and a suite of armoured vehicles.
331;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-11-05T17:59:15Z;Obama’s quest for an Indian pay-off;;When Barack Obama arrives in Mumbai on Saturday he will see large red and yellow billboards telling him that foreign direct investment from the US in India’s retail sector is not welcome.But with a midterm election “shellacking” behind him, the US president can ill-afford to return short-changed after a three-day stop in India accompanied by the likes of Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, large power companies GE and Westinghouse and aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Lockheed.The billboards in south Mumbai are a reminder that fast-growing India, where local companies are fiercely competitive and regulation often opaque, is not a market easily conquered. Maharashtra’s retailers, as in many other parts of the economy, are not about to embrace foreign participation.A nuclear liability law, recently passed by the Indian parliament, has served as a caution to Washington that a political breakthrough along the lines of the 2008 US-India civil nuclear deal does not necessarily clear the way for US investment.Now Washington is eager to garner what some officials bluntly call “pay-offs” for former president George W. Bush’s bold initiative to legitimise India’s nuclear programme and put the relationship between the two capitals on a new footing. About $10bn worth of deals are expected to be signed.Before leaving Washington on Friday, Mr Obama said that a four-nation tour of Asia taking him to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan would open new markets for US companies and create jobs at home.“The primary purpose is to take a bunch of US companies and open up markets so that we can sell in Asia, in some of the fastest-growing markets in the world,” the president said.Mr Obama is bringing to India’s financial capital the biggest presidential business mission ever to leave US shores. It numbers about 200 chief executives and the delegation is holding business summits in both Mumbai and Delhi that will seek opportunities to boost bilateral trade estimated at $50bn this year.Among Mr Obama’s key goals will be pushing for a contract to supply the Indian air force with 126 fighter jets made by Boeing and Lockheed, worth $11bn. The contract is to be decided early next year, and is part of a bigger rearmament estimated to be worth $100bn over 10 years.In spite of political will to buy American, the Indian defence establishment is unwilling to sign agreements with the US that would allow the bigger partner any after-sale claim on the technology it has sold.Others US goals include reducing tariff barriers in sectors where its exporters are strong, including agriculture and engineering.One message that Mr Obama will bear is that, if India wishes to access the global economy, it must open up its own.What is at stake is India’s IT outsourcing industry, which has been built up over the past 20 years by servicing US multinationals. Its executives, many based in Bangalore, are anxious about protectionist measures against their companies as the US faces an unemployment crisis.Already the US has increased the price of temporary work visas which are essential for Indian professionals working there.Ahead of Mr Obama’s arrival, New Delhi was defensively stressing India’s foreign direct investment in the US.“This investment from India is creating, saving or supporting tens of thousands of jobs in the US,” said Nirupama Rao, India’s foreign secretary. “India’s defence acquisitions and major purchases in the energy and aviation sectos …are contributing in a substantive manner to the US economy.”Agreements are expected in joint space launches, a global disease centre and a big education summit next year. Yet the US’s private sector will want more. India’s greater claims to the US’s support for its permanent seat in the UN Security Council and access to US technology will depend on that.
332;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
333;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;India eyes $11bn US fighter jets;;India will turn increasingly to US defence products to secure its borders and wider interests, top Indian officials have said ahead of a visit by Barack Obama, US president, next month.The desire for a closer defence partnership comes as New Delhi considers an $11bn deal to buy 126 multi-role combat fighter jets to rearm India’s out-of-date air force and boost defence capabilities against Pakistan and China.Lockheed Martin and Boeing are among six foreign companies competing for the sale.India is one of the world’s largest arms bazaars with a military budget of Rs1,420bn ($32bn). Mr Obama’s visit will be followed this year by those of Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president, and Demetri Medvedev, president of Russia. Both would like to supply India.The Indian army is the third largest in the world, with 1.1m soldiers in active service. India ranks third after Russia and China as one of the fastest growing defence spenders.Top Indian officials say defence co-operation and the purchase of equipment is a key part of the strategic dialogue between New Delhi and Washington. They say their potential purchase of military equipment from the US is important for the American economy at a time when the administration needs to create jobs to overcome an unemployment crisis.However, people familiar with the bidding process for the fighter jets say any decision is unlikely until mid-2011 and will in large part depend on sealed bids by the defence groups that will determine the price of any transaction.In addition, the attractiveness of the US offers could be affected by India’s reluctance to sign technical agreements with the US that would allow transfer of navigation and targeting technology.Some Indian officials have expressed misgivings about acquiring equipment that is “interoperable” with the US, for fear of aligning New Delhi too closely with Washington.US defence sales to India have risen steadily, with Robert Gates, defence secretary, saying India’s decisions concern not just equipment but relations between the two countries.Mr Obama is expected to conclude a deal to buy 10 C-17 transport aircraft from Boeing as part of a package worth as much as $3.5bn.Last year, India agreed to buy eight long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft from Boeing, its largest acquisition of military hardware from the US. The $2.1bn purchase of P-81 Poseidon aircraft highlighted the possibilities opened up by a civil nuclear deal that ended a cold war-era stand-off.Additional reporting by Daniel Dombey in Washington and Jeremy Lemer in New York
334;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-10-20T22:39:50Z;Winners and losers emerge in defence cuts;;As defence companies digest this week’s UK military budget cuts, winners and losers are beginning to materialise.Those active in cyber security and in supplying special forces equipment such as communications devices are expected to fare better than those who rely on making equipment for the handful of large programmes that are being scaled down significantly.Though this will benefit UK companies such as BAE’s Detica, Ultra Electronics and Cobham, it will also provide new opportunities for foreign companies. One example is Northrop Grumman, which has 30 years’ experience in cyber security in the US and will on Friday open the UK’s only sophisticated cyber ‘test range’ outside that of GCHQ.Ironically, many of the big UK military programmes that had been under threat but were saved will benefit big foreign companies. EADS, for example, is the lead partner in AirTanker, which will supply the UK with up to 14 aircraft capable of refuelling jet fighters in mid-air and transporting troops. The company also makes the A400M transport aircraft, which, together with the C-17, its bigger rival manufactured by Boeing of the US, was also spared.In terms of land-based vehicles, while the UK is cutting the number of its heavy tanks, maintained by BAE, it is going ahead with the Scout reconnaissance vehicles and, further down the line, the Fres, delighting General Dynamics of the US.But, like many other defence companies, General Dynamics is still far from reassured about the volumes the Ministry of Defence will now acquire, especially given the double whammy of financial constraints and general cutbacks in the sizes of all three of its military services.One of the biggest concerns is over how many Joint Strike Fighters the UK will now order given the change in the configuration of its carriers. Lockheed Martin, BAE, Pratt & Whitney and smaller providers are keenly awaiting better clarity.Meanwhile, surprisingly little has been said in the review about cost savings the MoD could make by outsourcing some of its work. So sure was Peter Rogers, chief executive of UK-based Babcock International, about the prospect of outsourcing that even before the review he predicted he would have to hire more staff and that the whole exercise would be a net positive for his company. Serco is also widely expected to benefit from outsourcing, while formerly government-owned Qinetiq is seen as one of the bigger losers, especially after having to make a £37m writedown because of the cancellation of a big training programme.“The overall challenge is a very big one. There is still a lot of significant detail to work through, not least, where precisely will the manpower reduction come from?” says Tony Poulter, partner at PwC.But clarity is expected to take months to materialise.“There’ll be continued uncertainty at least until the defence industrial strategy review in early 2011, given that the SDSR did not specify by how much it would be cutting some programmes, such as the JSF, or explain to what extent it would be renegotiating contracts and changing the way it will agree new ones,” said Jeremy Bragg, analyst at Citi.Executives fear that just cutting the numbers of MoD procurement staff, without a complete revamp, would further slow the process, rather than fix it.
335;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-10-19T21:35:22Z;RAF base closure clouds future of region;;The dark clouds hanging over Moray, in north-east Scotland, matched the mood of foreboding that gripped an area that claims to be the most dependent on defence jobs in the UK.Moray has two RAF bases, Kinloss and Lossiemouth, that employ more than 5,700 people. The jobs are highly valued in an area that otherwise relies on farming, tourism and distilling.But RAF Kinloss is set to close after the prime minister announced the cancellation of the nine new Nimrod surveillance aircraft that had been due to fly from there.The future of nearby RAF Lossiemouth, home to four Tornado squadrons, remains uncertain.Sue West, who owns a newsagent’s in the town of Forres, just outside Kinloss, said: “It will be disastrous for the town – the people from the bases are just part of the community.”In a last-minute plea to David Cameron, a group of local business leaders warned that closing both bases would have an impact on the Moray economy equivalent to 700,000 jobs losses in London. “One in five jobs is dependent on the RAF bases and the effect is hard-wired into the very fabric of our society in Moray,” they said.No RAF personnel at Kinloss wanted to be identified, but one airman said: “The decision on the new Nimrods is the one we’d all been dreading.”Meanwhile, there’s a simple question being asked on the shop floor of Lancashire’s aircraft factories, said Derek Poynor, a convenor for the Unite union. “What’s the point of having aircraft carriers without any aircraft to put on them?”The 11,000 employees at BAE Systems’ sites at Warton and Salmesbury, near Preston, are heirs of a proud lineage that includes the Lancaster and Halifax bombers.They were preparing for at least a decade of stability as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme scaled up, building on production of Eurofighter Typhoons. Now they fear the first compulsory redundancies in 20 years as Harriers are scrapped, Tornados reduced and orders for US-designed F-35s cut back, all to pay for carriers that many in the MoD seem not to want.“It’s too soon to know the impact but it will be difficult to manage it all voluntarily,” says Mr Poynor, who works at Warton, the former US airbase where many aircraft are assembled and tested.
336;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-10-19T17:58:53Z;Lockheed warns on spending squeeze;;"The long-awaited squeeze on US defence budgets is taking hold and will restrain revenues and crimp profits in 2011, says Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company by revenues.Reporting quarterly results on Tuesday, Lockheed said it had experienced “numerous delays” to key projects such as the
terminal high-altitude area defence anti-missile system and the littoral combat ship.It is competing with General Dynamics to build the first tranche of close-to-shore vessels, which could be worth about $6bn, but the programme is about six months behind schedule.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said Lockheed’s attempts to break into adjacent markets, such as the solar energy industry, had been delayed, with the result that 2011 revenues would probably grow in the low single-digits range and profits would be flat.The results came as the UK government revealed plans to buy cheaper versions of Lockheed’s flagship F-35 combat jet, because of cuts to its defence budget.Mr Tanner said the UK move would affect Lockheed, but analysts said the long-term impact would be muted because the US plans to buy more than 2,400 aircraft.After years of rapid growth to fund overseas wars, US defence companies have been preparing for a slowdown in spending in the face of growing national debt and the drawdown of international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.In the US, administration planning calls for modest growth to the $560bn base budget, but procurement spending is being edged out by rising healthcare and maintenance costs, forcing an efficiency drive to free up money for new kit.“Lockheed clearly has some challenges ahead,” said Rob Stallard, with
RBC Capital Markets. “The organic outlook is flat (excluding F-35) and margins are under pressure.”He said pension concerns were also weighing on the company’s stock.For the three months to the end of September, revenues rose 6 per cent to $11.4bn compared with the same period in 2009, although analysts had been expecting sales of about $11.6bn.Net income from continuing operations slid from $786m to $565m, giving earnings per share of $1.55, against $2.04 in the third quarter of 2009, including the impact of one-off redundancy charges and broadly in line with consensus market forecasts.Operating margins also slipped from 11.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent and the backlog of orders continued to fall, dropping from $72.8bn in the second quarter of 2010 to $70.5bn in the third quarter.For the full year, Lockheed now expects sales
of between $44.9bn and $45.9bn, $600m lower than its previous estimates, reflecting the disposal of its Enterprise Integration Group, a consultancy unit, which had revenues of about that amount."
337;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed to sell advisory unit for $815m;;"Lockheed Martin has agreed to sell a division that advises governments on purchasing military hardware as the company responds to new US laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest between contractors and consultancy units.The world’s largest defence company by revenues said the Enterprise Integration Group unit had been bought for $815m in cash by Veritas Capital, a New York-based private equity company specialising in defence and government service investments.Lockheed put the unit up for sale in June in the wake of
Pentagon rules passed in 2009 as part of the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act, a move to shake up the way the US purchases major weapons systems.The sale also forms part of a wider effort to reshuffle the company to cope with what Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, has called the “new reality” facing defence companies – a cash-strapped but increasingly demanding US customer.In June, Lockheed also said that by the end of the year it would sell its Pacific Architects and Engineers unit, bought in 2006 for $700m, which builds military bases and provides training. Other defence companies have been confronting similar challenges. Last November, Northrop Grumman agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services division, for about $1.7bn to a group including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.Since then, the company has said it will sell or spin off its shipbuilding division. Northrop argues the $6.2bn division has never produced the expected synergies with its electronics units but analysts point out that naval spending is under pressure due to spiralling costs.Lockheed has disclosed few details about the EIG unit but Veritas said the business has about 1,800 employees and generated $626m of revenues in the twelve months ended June 30, 2010. The deal is subject to regulatory review.For Veritas the acquisition marks a foray into familiar territory. The group has a long track record in the defence and government services sectors including its sale of DynCorp International to Cerberus Capital Management in April for $1.5bn.Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that defence companies could turn to acquisitions as they seek to outgrow the defence budget. He estimated they could raise $60bn for deals if they took on more debt. But big deals are hard to find for companies such as Lockheed, which had revenues of $45.2bn in 2009.Lockheed shares were up about 1 per cent to $71.18 in afetrnoon trading. They are down about 6 per cent over the year to date on fears that US military spending could fall substantially."
338;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-10-12T19:28:18Z;Defence M&A;Too big to combine, maybe it’s time to split up;"Forget being lean and mean; for two decades the defence industry has championed size when it comes to building killing machines. To handle multibillion-dollar programmes, contractors merged and acquired their way to greater stature: 16 years ago, the main bits of today’s five largest US defence suppliers were owned by 30 different companies. The problem, as growth in US defence spending finally moderates, is what to do next.Big purchases are out. For a start, few options large enough to make a difference remain. Boeing could perhaps buy Northrop Grumman, leapfrogging Lockheed Martin to become the largest contractor with a combined $66bn in annual defence revenues. But even if antitrust issues could be overcome, it would be hard to generate the cost savings to justify a takeover premium (say about $800m annually for a 30 per cent premium) and both Boeing and Northrop already have the scale they require. Cross-border ownership issues make the UK’s BAE Systems an unlikely target.Furthermore, greater consolidation is unlikely to be favoured by a Pentagon already trying to tackle a bloated contracting system. In most competitive bidding situations there already tends to be one company that clearly has the best capabilities, making aggressive pricing unlikely. Diversification also seems an unlikely route for an industry that has largely proved unsuccessful at selling to the private sector.An alternative is to shrink. Northrop already intends to sell its shipbuilding assets, and Lockheed has two small services businesses on the block. The latter in particular appear vulnerable as Robert Gates, secretary of defence, looks for back-office savings to fund operational spending. Ditching low-returning businesses and ploughing the cash back to shareholders might also start to rehabilitate a sector trading on historically low multiples.

339;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-10-05T17:16:39Z;Cheap bonds help fuel share buy-back rebound;Groups exploit attractive relative cost of debt to equity;"Are companies starting to turn the dial away from bondholders and towards shareholders?It is a question investors and analysts are increasingly asking as the cheapness of debt and relative costliness of equity gives companies big opportunities. Some groups such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are already exploiting what UBS is calling the most attractive relative cost of debt-to-equity in 30 years by issuing bonds in order to buy back shares.“We think we are at a tipping point in terms of corporate behaviour. Companies have been deleveraging and have got ample cash on their balance sheets: we believe we are at the start of the process where the focus will shift back to shareholders,” says Sunil Kapadia, global asset allocation strategist at UBS.With equities still an unfashionable asset class for most investors and companies hoarding record amounts of cash, investors are urging companies to take the matter into their own hands and take action to prop up their own valuations. “I can’t see investors changing their minds any time soon so in a way it has been left up to companies to step in and act as asset allocators,” says Robert Buckland, equity strategist at Citi.One side of the coin is the well-known cheapness of issuing bonds. Microsoft set a new record last month when it issued three-year debt with a coupon of just 0.875 per cent. On the flip side is the relatively high cost of equity. Comparing the free cash flow yield of stocks and shares against the yield for US Treasuries, Citi analysts found that the difference between the two has become positive in the past few years in both the US and Europe.That gives companies an enticing arbitrage opportunity between the cost of debt and equity. The question is: how many of them will take it on? Mr Buckland says: “If you can borrow money in the corporate bond market at 3 or 4 per cent and buy cash flow in equity markets at 7 per cent, then you have got a 3 or 4 per cent carry. Some companies are going to take this on.”Evidence is already building that many companies are prepared to do this as share buy-back activity starts to rebound after plummeting last year.Data from Birinyi Associates, a research group, shows that in the second quarter of this year executed buy-backs – those that actually happened compared with those that were merely announced – rose to $85bn in the US. That is back where buy-backs were in the middle of 2005, although this is still a long way off the peak of $228bn reached in the third quarter of 2007.Mark Bamford, head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Capital, says: “We are seeing a number of companies exploring the idea of accessing the debt capital markets to retire more expensive equity capital.” Few are willing to make the connection explicitly but companies such as McDonald’s and HP have issued debt and made buy-back announcements close to each other recently.UBS calls this phenomenon “releveraging”. Mr Kapadia says: “Companies and investors should use the currency of cheap credit to unlock equity valuations. There is a huge incentive for companies to leverage again given this valuation gap.”Analysts at Citi see it as part of a broader trend, to which they give the particularly ugly name of “de-equitisation”. In essence, this looks at the total number of shares in issue and whether this number is rising or not. Rights issues or flotations cause shares in issue to rise whereas buy-backs and acquisitions cause this number to fall. Citi even argues that increased dividends should be seen as part of its “de-equitisation” trend as it is the preferred form of returning capital for many investors.BHP Billiton’s $39bn hostile bid for Potash is a good example of potential de-equitisation. If this deal were to proceed, BHP would issue no equity but would finance itself entirely through bank loans and bonds. Heath Jansen at Citi estimates that these current funding costs are less than 2 per cent and would rise only to 3-4 per cent as a bridge loan is replaced by long-term corporate bonds.Citi recommends looking at strong companies that face persistent takeover speculation such as Anadarko, or Capital One in the US, or ITV and Prudential in the UK; or groups that have consistent policies on buy-backs such as Akzo Nobel, BASF, Lockheed Martin or Texas Instruments; or businesses with a high dividend yield and a history of increasing it such as Deutsche Börse, Vivendi, Altria and Qwest.But while many see a clear trend towards deleveraging as – post the crisis – companies finally start to favour shareholders over bondholders, some bankers are sceptical. “It is very cynical to view providing balanced returns to shareholders as bad for bondholders,” says Larry Wieseneck, head of global finance at Barclays Capital. “Hoarding cash is not so good either: shareholders get very nervous, and bondholders should get even more nervous.”Perhaps the most intriguing part about de-equitisation is the suggestion from some that it could have helped J apanese companies as deflation took hold in the 1990s, with some arguing that it could have helped prop up share prices. With a persistent fear of deflation still in western countries, it gives companies more food for thought. “If there is one country in the world where the de-equitisation trade has made sense for 13-14 years it is Japan,” Mr Buckland says. “De-equitisation would have done a world of good to Japanese stock markets.”"
340;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-30T19:53:46Z;Washington pins hopes on India fighter deal;;The US administration is stepping up pressure on India to buy US military hardware five weeks ahead of Barack Obama’s first state visit to India.Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, and Robert Gates, the defence secretary, have pressed AK Antony, the Indian defence minister who is on a two-day visit to Washington, to opt for US bids to supply more than 100 multi-combat fighter aircraft to India. The project – worth up to $11bn – is the world’s largest pending military hardware deal.Lockheed Martin and Boeing are among six foreign companies that India is evaluating, and winning the work would create or save thousands of US jobs.“We think we have the finest military hardware in the world, and if India is upgrading its defence capabilities, they should buy American,” PJ Crowley, a state department spokesman, said following Mr Antony’s meeting with Mrs Clinton. “Our understanding is that some of those decisions are coming up fairly soon.”The selection of one of the US fighter jet bids would help cement a growing alignment of two of the world’s largest democracies, a political bond that Mr Obama will stress heavily on his visit.US officials say privately it would also take the sting out of the recent Indian nuclear liability law, which would make suppliers, as well as operators, liable for any accidents at Indian civil nuclear plants.One of the main selling points of the controversial 2008 US-India civil nuclear agreement, concluded by George W. Bush’s administration but upheld by Mr Obama, was that it would create a huge flow of business for US companies in India’s planned civil nuclear expansion. The deal gave India access to civil nuclear technology and material without requiring it to renounce its nuclear weapons or join the non-proliferation treaty. But the passage last month of India’s nuclear liability law, which US companies describe as draconian, has put paid to such hopes.Washington’s hopes of achieving a big commercial “deliverable” from next month’s presidential visit are now pinned on the fighter jet deal. There is also hope that India might conclude a deal to buy 10 C-17 transport aircraft from Boeing in time for the state visit as part of a package worth as much as $3.5bn.Indian defence analysts say the world’s largest democracy faces a choice of turning more to the US for sophisticated defence equipment or maintaining supplies from Russia, its traditional defence partner, whose maintenance and spare-parts support has weakened since the collapse of the Soviet Union. New C-17s would replace an ageing fleet of Russian Ilyushins. Likewise, any new fighters would replace Sukhoi and Mig jets.New Delhi, however, wants the US to ease technology controls on its defence exports to give it access to more advanced technology. It also seeks assurances from Washington that US military support for arch-rival Pakistan in the fight against Islamist militants cannot be used against India.“There is a great deal of focus in Washington on achieving commercial results to announce during the Obama visit,” said Tezi Schaffer, a south Asia expert at the Center for International Strategic Studies in Washington. “But the more important aspect to the trip may be in the quieter conversations about strengthening the India-US strategic relationship.”US officials have been struggling to come up with initiatives that would cement ties with India in the knowledge that nothing could emulate the drama of the Bush administration’s nuclear agreement, which brought India’s nuclear programme out of international isolation. US officials are also aware of lingering Indian sensitivities about the Obama administration’s initial overtures to China at a time of growing friction between Delhi and Beijing.Mr Antony, the latest of many senior Indian officials to visit Washington, reiterated demands for the US to drop Indian companies from its “entity list” requiring approval to import US technology.The US could also back India’s aspirations to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. However, there are divisions within the administration on how far Washington should go.“There is a camp within the administration, particularly at the state department, that understands India’s huge geostrategic importance to America, and there is a camp that is much more sceptical and wants first to see the pay-off to the nuclear deal,” said a senior India lobbyist.
341;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-30T01:40:44Z;Cabinet Office to simplify supply process;;Companies that supply the public sector would deal with central government as a single customer rather than a range of different departments under a streamlined procurement process being considered by Francis Maude.The Cabinet Office minister is expected to discuss the proposals on Thursday with executives from 34 of the state’s biggest contractors. Although the plans are at an early stage, Mr Maude believes that a cross-government approach to procurement may be more efficient than at present, when the process is handled by individual departments.The “big four” professional service firms, construction groups including Balfour Beatty and defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin are among the companies that will be called in for contract renegotiations on Thursday.The Cabinet Office has already told 19 suppliers of services to government – from custodial services to IT– that they must accept lower profit margins in order to help reduce the nation’s deficit.Mr Maude said the process would “deliver savings running into hundreds of millions of pounds”. He added, however: “It’s not just about the money …It is about changing the way government does business over the long term.”The Cabinet Office has already appointed John Collington, the Home Office’s commercial director, to become head of procurement in the recently created “efficiency and reform group”. Upon his appointment last month, the Cabinet Office said Mr Collington would push for a new approach to procurement that would allow the government “to use its scale to ensure it always gets the best value for money”.John Tizard, a former director of government business at outsourcing group Capita and now director of the Centre for Public Service Partnerships, said some may welcome any change that makes the system more efficient. Outsourcing executives, including Paul Pindar at Capita, have bemoaned the length of the procurement process, which can take up to two years for some contracts.But Mr Tizard also said that suppliers’ margins could be squeezed further as a result of a more centralised system. “The disadvantage is that it [the state overall] will have much more significant purchasing power than individual departments.”Mike Murphy, equity analyst at Numis Securities, said it was likely that larger contractors that provided complex services would be better placed to cope with the mooted changes than their smaller rivals.“Those who supply commodity-type items – such as office stationery – are going to feel more pressure,” he said. “But for the specialist service providers it does provide the opportunity to provide a service across central government.”
342;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-28T23:21:09Z;Defence industry braced for mauling on home front;;As ministers hammer out the role the armed forces should play over the coming decades, executives of defence contractors are bracing for deep spending cuts they believe will reshape the UK’s sizeable defence industry.BAE Systems, the UK and Europe’s largest defence contractor, Babcock, one of the armed services’ biggest providers of training, refitting and decommissioning, and QinetiQ, the formerly state-owned defence technology group, are the three UK companies likely to bear the brunt of the cuts due to be announced by the end of October.From the aircraft carrier orders that may be dropped, through the fate of the submarine fleet, to the fighter jets being curtailed, BAE is involved in almost every area at risk of falling under the government’s austerity axe.The company has already had to make tough decisions. This month, BAE cut 740 jobs at its UK-based Military Air Solutions on top of the 3,300 jobs it has already shed this year.But investors have grown jittery. BAE trades at a 25 per cent discount to US rivals, such as Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, which are less exposed to the UK. Two years ago, that discount was only 5 per cent.Several analysts say shareholders have over­reacted because they have failed to acknowledge how “un-British” BAE has become since its merger with Marconi Electronic Systems in 1999.The UK accounts for less than 30 per cent of BAE’s revenue, with the largest individual programme, the Typhoon fighter aircraft, making up 7 per cent, notes Roger Johnston, an analyst at Edison Investment Research. “BAE is an important part of the UK defence industry but there is much more to BAE than UK defence,” he says.BAE is not alone in having shrunk its UK footprint by moving to the US, the world’s largest defence market, and more recently to fast-developing countries such as Brazil and India.UK-based Cobham derives only 9 per cent of its revenue from Britain compared with 60 per cent from the US. India and the Middle East, are its next growth markets, but Andy Stevens, Cobham’s chief executive, is already looking further east.Within two months of taking the reins at Cobham, Mr Stevens took his executive team to Singapore to meet government and university officials. “There is life beyond Europe and the US,” he said. “They got excited, I can assure you.”Diversification also stands UK-based Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of engines for civil and military aircraft, in good stead. The company gleans less than 5 per cent of its overall revenue from the UK.In contrast, 80 per cent of Babcock’s revenues come from the UK, and like BAE, it is active in many of the areas under threat from government cuts. For example, it owns the Rosyth dockyard in Fife, Scotland, where BAE is building the aircraft carriers that could be cut.But there is a silver lining for Babcock. If the government decides to save money by further outsourcing activities such as training, procurement and managing bases, the company is well positioned to win new business, according to analysts.QinetiQ, meanwhile, on Tuesday issued a trading update in which it warned investors: “The outlook remains extremely uncertain particularly against the backdrop of the UK’s Strategic Defence and Security Review.”Behind BAE, Babcock and QinetiQ is a long tail of smaller companies that supply the defence industry.In total, there are more small UK companies contributing to defence than there are in all of Spain, Germany, France and Italy combined. They contribute to an industry that employs more than 300,000 people in the UK, almost 20 per cent of whose work is exported.ADS, the industry trade group, calculates that one in every 10 of those jobs would be at risk if the UK military was forced to cut 16 per cent of its equipment budget.Many of the jobs to be lost would come from smaller, less diversified companies, or from those businesses whose balance sheets are not able to withstand cuts and contract delays.For Richard Martin, the chairman of Kembrey Wiring Systems, whose 210 employees in Swindon manufacture the electronics used in civil and defence aircraft and other vehicles, the biggest threat comes from the indecision and delays that often accompany big changes in government spending.Mr Martin says putting together teams and developing equipment only to hear the contract is delayed is a cost most small companies can ill-afford.It is the collective capability of the engineers working for smaller companies and those from which big companies are willing to source from overseas, that defence executives say the government must consider when it makes its cuts.As Ian King, BAE’s chief executive, warns: “You cannot take capability holidays and then say we will come back to it.”
343;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-28T15:11:47Z;Aerospace: Finding spares can be a complex challenge;;Modern civil airliners are complex pieces of equipment with as many as 4m components involved in their manufacture. Organising the supply chain that delivers anything from nuts and bolts to complete sub-assemblies is equally tricky.Enterprise resource planning systems are common throughout many industries as a way of managing a wide range of company functions, from finance through human resources to supply chain.Big ERP suppliers, such as SAP and Oracle, offer systems that can manage ordinary supply chains, but aerospace industry experts say specialist products to meet the sector’s requirements are needed.For all its high-tech image, the aerospace industry has proved less than leading-edge in managing its supply chain – as both Boeing and Airbus have found. Delays to recent launches by the two leading aerospace companies have revealed gaps.Boeing made the mistake of subcontracting large parts of the manufacture of its 787 Dreamliner while at the same time boosting the quantity of high-tech composite materials in the design. EADS, the European aircraft-making consortium, faced problems installing the 500 kms of electrical wiring in each of its Airbus 380s.“The aerospace industry has been very much a craft industry for a lot longer than the automotive sector,” says Peter Dickin, marketing manager for Delcam, a Birmingham, UK based developer of manufacturing software. “Until now, the industry didn’t make aircraft in anything like the volumes cars have been made in for decades.”“The sector is split between large groups, such as Rolls-Royce, that are global, and a very long tail of smaller companies,” explain Ed Savage and Tim Lawrence, supply chain experts at PA Consulting Group. “There are thousands of components in an aircraft and any one can stop it flying. There is a real logistical challenge in tracking all these components deep down into the supply chain.”The challenge facing the industry is complicated by the fact that aircraft may remain in service for decades and need spare parts for their entire working life.“Auto manufacturers bring out a new model every four to six years, but an aerospace company can be making the same components 40 years later,” says Andrew Mair, chief executive of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, a UK regional grouping of suppliers.“Companies have to service, overhaul and repair aircraft, but that often involves only small volumes of a particular part.”Just as specialist logistics companies have evolved to handle deliveries in sectors such as food retailing and automotive components, similar organisations have emerged in the aerospace industry. Umeco, a London-listed company, works with customers, such as engine supplier Rolls-Royce, to establish their needs, create bills of materials required and match that with inventory that it holds from component suppliers.“We provide an outsourced solution for C-class parts, the nuts and bolts of the industry,” says Clive Snowdon, chief executive. “We inspect products and deliver to the point of use. We have a proactive vendor management programme and may put our people into suppliers if they default. We look for well financed, well-resourced suppliers, because a casualty can cause enormous disruption.”Umeco uses a common IT platform to link its five supply hubs around the world so it can see where it has a particular product in its network.It originally bought an IT package from a local supplier, but when that company said it would no longer support the software, Umeco bought the code and continued to update it and broaden its functionality.“A lot of mainstream distributors have tried to break in, but they realise their systems are not capable of dealing with the complexity,” says Mr Snowdon. “Our customers need full traceability, so we have to provide provenance back to the base metal.”Michael Burkett, managing vice-president of supply chain research at Gartner, an IT research company, says: “The aerospace industry has a need for basic supply chain management capability, such as demand planning and production scheduling, but there are also business processes that are unique to aerospace.“The big airline manufacturers have long order books but they don’t necessarily know the configuration customers want. When they get the final order, they have to be prepared for things to change. They need the capability to deal with that.”This has led to the creation of a web-based business-to-business hub called Exostar, formed by a partnership of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. This allows customers to forecast their requirements and source material from suppliers.“The ERP vendors have achieved a deeper penetration of supply chains, but ERP its still not 100 per cent what the aerospace industry needs,” says Mr Burkett. “Spare parts planning, in particular, requires unique algorithms to forecast demand. The problem is still the ability to make rapid changes.”
344;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-20T22:00:49Z;Iran fear triggers arms surge;;The Gulf kingdoms have always been big spenders on weaponry, but Iran’s nuclear ambitions have caused their defence budgets to surge.Most of them currently host batteries of US-made Patriot missiles. This investment in advanced systems designed to destroy incoming missiles betrays the scenario that preys on the mind of the rulers of the Gulf’s Arab states.The prospect of Iran marrying its arsenal of long-range ballistic missiles with unconventional warheads – perhaps, in time, nuclear warheads – is the possible threat they most fear.Hence the United Arab Emirates wants to buy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence system, designed to guard against a missile attack. The country is also investing in weaponry produced by European companies: the UAE is due to buy up to 80 Rafale jet fighters, built by Dassault of France.As well as dealing with any threat from Iran, the Gulf states are also trying to broaden their military capabilities. Saudi Arabia wants equipment designed for counter-insurgency, following its experience this year in trying to combat Houthi Shia rebels based in neighbouring Yemen.This triggered the largest Saudi military operation since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, but commanders found that advanced weaponry like F-15 jets and main battle tanks were of little use in fighting guerrillas. The kingdom has asked the US for more helicopters and night-vision equipment to build up its counterinsurgency capability.The threat posed by Yemen’s instability has led the US military to favour providing the country with more than $1bn of military assistance. Officials say that Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, backs the plan, which would include the sale of weapons.John Brennan, the White House’s senior counter-terrorism adviser, visited Yemen on Monday to discuss co-operation against al-Qaeda.Only Qatar, which hosts the forward headquarters of US central command at al-Udaid airbase, is not joining the big spenders on weapons. Instead, the country is relying for its safety on the established US military presence, while buying transport aircraft to expand its ability to deliver humanitarian aid and project soft power.Defence companies in the US are the major beneficiaries of export deals to four Gulf states that total some $122.88bn over the next four years. Travis Sharp, an analyst at the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank, says that Boeing will gain the most from the arms deals. It will supply the Royal Saudi Air Force with 85F-15 fighter jets and upgrade another 70 already in service.“The clear winner from the recent arms sales agreements is Boeing, which has been struggling to keep a toehold in the fighter market as the new generation of fighters are being built by Lockheed Martin,” he said. Raytheon also stands to gain from the investment in advanced missile defence technology, added Mr Sharp.US and European defence companies have recognised the Middle East as a crucial source of future sales, especially as the UK plans to cut its defence budget by at least 10 per cent over the next five years and the US seeks to save $100bn in the same period.The US administration aims to achieve more than simply promoting the country’s defence industry. If Washington’s allies in the Gulf buy their weapons from US supplies, this will also ensure that they use compatible technology and are trained on common platforms, enhancing their future ability to fight a common adversary.Additional reporting by Daniel Dombey in Washington
345;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-13T07:06:50Z;BAE prepares to streamline US business;;BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, has confirmed it plans to sell parts of its US commercial businesses in a house-cleaning sale that could yield as much as $2bn (£1.3bn).“The company regularly reviews its portfolio to ensure it is delivering the best value for shareholders and customers,” BAE said in a statement on Monday.The sale comes as BAE and its competitors look to rationalise their businesses as they prepare to deal with the consequences of defence budget cuts in the UK coupled with Washington’s drive to slow military spending as the administration aims to save $100bn over the next five years.BAE last week announced it was shedding almost 1,000 jobs, mainly in its UK military aircraft division. The news followed job cut announcements by Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US.People close to the BAE sale said the two units up for grabs included the company’s business that sells aircraft engine controls for General Electric and one that builds hybrid propulsion systems for vehicles, such as buses and lorries.Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase are BAE’s advisers on the deal, but declined to comment.Commercial aerospace companies, as well as private equity groups, are thought to be the most likely potential buyers.In the US, BAE has grown by acquisition, increasing its position in the world’s largest defence market and one that is seen as more robust than that of the UK and some other European countries.But even in the US, the defence budget is coming under pressure and BAE is competing to redeploy funds into areas considered likely to prove government priorities and therefore offer higher growth.In May, BAE acquired Atlantic Marine, a privately-held vessel maintenance, repair, overhaul and conversion company, for $352m in cash. The deal “demonstrates that defence acquisitions can continue to be made at sensible multiples,” analysts at JP Morgan said in a recent note. “Current interest rates make most acquisitions accretive relative to holding cash in the bank,” they added.BAE has increasingly moved into the support and security business and away from merely supplying the big platforms, such as aircraft and ships. Support now accounts for almost half of BAE’s revenue. Ian King, BAE’s chief executive, has said the company would continue to move in that direction.Even before the news of the sale of some of its US units, analysts estimated BAE had the scope to undertake £1bn-£2bn of further acquisitions.In recent months, Northrop Grumman has said it may sell or spin off its naval shipbuilding business, while Lockheed Martin has put two of its units on the market.Many companies have sought to boost their capabilities in communications, cyber and intelligence, which they believe will continue to be well funded areas by governments and others potential customers.Boeing in June beat competition from rivals, including Raytheon and BAE itself, agreeing to buy ArgonST for $775m.US government rules related to perceived conflicts of interest within big defence companies have also helped motivate some sales.
346;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-09-09T15:10:29Z;BAE to shed about 1,000 jobs;;BAE, the UK’s largest defence contractor, has announced it will shed almost 1,000 jobs, mainly within in its military air division.Union leaders reacted with shock at the cuts, which will affect manufacturing jobs in Brough, Chadderton, Samlesbury and Warton in northern England, and Farnborough in the southeast. BAE plans to reduce the number of jobs at its Military Air Solutions business by 740, or 5 per cent.Hugh Scullion, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said he was shocked at the depth of the cuts and warned that the announcement could prove to be “the tip of the iceberg”.But BAE said the cuts were a necessary part of streamlining the business, as several lines of its aircraft, including Harriers and Nimrod MR2s, were either being reduced in number or retired altogether.Kevin Taylor, managing director of Military Air Solutions, said: “These potential job losses result from the impact of the changes in the defence programme announced in December 2009, together with other workload changes.”He added: “We appreciate this is difficult news and we are committed to working with employees and their representatives to explore ways of mitigating the potential job losses.”BAE also confirmed that 206 jobs would be shed at Insyte, its integrated technology business. That number, however, was part of previously announced job cuts, BAE said.In total, BAE has said 642 Insyte jobs were at stake, the bulk of which have already been shed. This year, the company said it had eliminated 3,300 jobs worldwide as part of its “streamlining process.”The cuts come as defence companies in the UK brace themselves for what they believe will be a cut of up to 15 per cent in the UK’s defence budget, which is expected to see the scaling back of big procurement programmes such as aircraft carriers, also manufactured by BAE.Details of the UK budget cuts are expected to emerge by the end of next month.But the UK is far from alone in needing to cut its defence budget because of the economic downturn. The US, which has by far the world’s largest defence budget, is also seeking cost reductions of about $100bn over the next five years as it slows spending.Boeing, one of the US’s largest defence contractors, this week announced it would shed jobs, in a major restructuring of its military aircraft division.The announcement was swiftly followed by Lockheed Martin, the US’s largest defence contractor, saying more than 600, or 25 per cent, of its executives had agreed to buy-out packages. Those cuts come amid US pressure for the company to reduce the price of its F-35 programme.BAE employs 39,200 people in the UK and almost 107,000 globally. The company’s Military Air Solutions business in the UK employs about 15,000 people.Thursday’s announcement about the 740 Military Air Solutions jobs, will potentially affect the following sites:• 212 jobs lost at Brough in East Yorkshire, predominantly on the Hawk programme.• 26 jobs lost at Chadderton in Greater Manchester, mainly in the large aircraft business because of the completion of work on VC10 packages and the retirement, early next year, of Nimrod R1.• 55 jobs lost at Farnborough in Hampshire mainly because of the UK’s decision to reduce the number of Harriers in service, but also because of imminent completion of the capability upgrades to the GR9 aircraft• 149 jobs lost at Samlesbury in Lancashire because of a decrease in work on several programmes, including for Spirit Aerostructures.• 298 jobs lost at Warton in Lancashire because of the cut in work on the Tornado, Harrier and Hawk programmes, as well as other engineering development and test work.
347;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-27T20:48:08Z;Consumer confidence data weigh on Wall St;;"US equities nudged down on Tuesday after worse than expected consumer confidence figures erased early gains made after positive earnings reports.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,113.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,537.69 and the Nasdaq closed 0.4 per cent lower at 2,288.25.Investor sentiment was dampened by the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index for July, which said confidence had hit a five-month low. The index fell from 54.3, a revised figure for June, to 50.4, below forecasts of 51.“Generally nobody wants to see a jobless recovery and the consumer confidence number indicates that there’s still uncertainty out there even though earnings numbers have been generally very very good,” said Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners.“The everyday consumer doesn’t necessarily see all that, they see that their neighbour is unemployed.”The S&P 500 retail sector led the fallers, down by 1.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary sector fell 1.2 per cent. Best Buy was down 3.9 per cent to $35.45; Urban Outfitters lost 4.8 per cent to $32.97 and Gap fell 3.9 per cent to $18.29.Before the open, data on the housing market showed a rise in property values of 4.6 per cent in May, compared with a predicted rise of 3.9 per cent. But the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 Financials index edged up 0.1 per cent after positive earnings from European banks UBS and Deutsche Bank and news that new tighter Basel III capital rules would be delayed. US-listed stocks of UBS rose 8.9 per cent to $16.51 and Deutsche Bank’s US shares were up 2.8 per cent to $68.06. Bank of America rose 0.3 per cent to $14.19 and Citigroup was up 0.2 per cent to $4.16.Positive earnings news from the industrials and materials sectors raised hopes of industrial recovery in early trading.DuPont reported its second-quarter profit nearly tripled because of a surge in sales and volume across all five divisions. The company said net income rose to $1.17bn, or $1.26 per share, from $417m, or 41 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier. The chemicals group raised its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share, excluding exceptional items, from a previous forecast $2.50 to $2.70. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $40.38.Industrials reporting included Fluor Corp, the engineering and construction group, which said it might reach a record backlog of projects this year because of demand from the energy industry, helped by new awards of $9.3bn. It reported better than expected second-quarter net income, which fell to 87 cents per share compared with analysts’ estimates of 93 cents per share. Shares rose 2.6 per cent to $49.10.Cummins, which makes engines and generator equipment, added to the picture of a rise in industrial activity as it reported better than expected quarterly results and raised its full-year forecast. Sales outside the US, which make up two-thirds of its revenue, rose 51 per cent in the quarter. Shares rose 2 per cent to $79.43. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence group, fell a fraction to $74.87 after it posted a 12 per cent jump in profit and increased its full-year forecast.But the materials sector was pushed down by a more negative mood in steel. US Steel Corporation said it was seeing slower order rates in spite of doubling its sales to $4.68bn this quarter. It posted an unexpected second-quarter loss because of revaluing a $1.4bn loan made to a European loan unit. Shares fell 6.4 per cent to $45.76. The negative outlook pushed AK Steel Holding Corp down 4.7 per cent to $14.49 in spite of reporting better than expected earnings.Gold producers fell as the metal hit an 11-week low because of the rally in equities. Newmont Mining Corporation fell 4 per cent to $55.78. Goldcorp dropped
3.7 per cent to $38.82.US-listed shares in BP fell 1.7 per cent to $38.00 after it reported a $17bn loss for the second quarter, after making a pre-tax provision of $32.2bn for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It plans to sell assets valued at $30bn to meet the costs."
348;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-27T15:28:33Z;Lockheed reports rise in profits;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor by revenues, on Tuesday reported second-quarter results that beat analysts’ earnings estimates but fell slightly short of forecasts for revenues.In recent months, defence stocks have slumped on fears that the growing fiscal deficit in the US will force the government to sharply cut defence spending, and efforts to reform the Department of Defense will cut into contractor margins.In response, Lockheed executives have attempted to prepare the company, and its shareholders, for what Bob Stevens, chief executive, has described as the “new reality of escalating demands and increasing constraints on resources”.Last month the company said it would sell two of its non-core business units and reorganise two others in an effort to reshape its portfolio to prepare for tougher contracting rules and tighter defence budgets.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, said the company had received dozens of expressions of interest from private equity and strategic buyers but was now looking at spinning off rather than selling one of the units for tax reasons.Lockheed said it would hold on to Enterprise Integration Group, which offers systems engineering services to the US defence department, until “we either conclude that a sale is probable or close a spin-off transaction”.In the three months to the end of June, net profits rose to $825m, from $724 in the same period in 2009. Earnings per share from continuing operations climbed to $2.22, up from $1.88 in 2009, thanks to about $782m of share buy backs.Sales rose 3 per cent to $11.4bn but analysts were expecting earnings per share of about $1.78 on sales of about $11.5bn.The company’s backlog of work fell to $72.8bn from $77.5bn in the same period in 2009 but Mr Tanner said that was largely because of the timing of certain contract awards and forecast that the backlog would be up to about $78bn by the end of the year.Beneath the headline numbers the results were mixed. At Lockheed’s key aeronautics unit operating profits fell 7 per cent to $372m as it received fewer favourable performance awards on legacy programmes such as the F-22 fighter jet after a strong year in 2009.Mr Tanner said that contract negotiations for the fourth production lot of the F-35 fighter jet, which is the DoD’s largest ever procurement project and Lockheed’s biggest programme, were also taking longer than expected.In an effort to head off concerns about escalating costs and poor performance, Lockheed has agreed to a fixed price contract for the batch of aircraft, but Mr Tanner noted that this had added “complexity” to the negotiating process.Lockheed’s outlook for the year remained essentially unchanged although the headline revenue forecast dipped by about $750m to take into account the planned sale of Pacific Architects and Engineers, a defence and infrastructure services company.For the full year, Lockheed expects sales of $46.3bn-$47.3bn and earnings per share of $7.15-$7.35, slightly higher than previously forecast on the back of more extensive share repurchases than originally planned.Lockheed shares, which have fallen 13 per cent in the past three months, were unchanged in early trading. General Dynamics, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman all report later in the week.
349;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-20T00:50:40Z;BAE Systems adopts new battle plan;;BAE Systems’ US operations will have to keep rationalising and “focus on being more productive” as government budget cuts start to have an impact on the industry, the head of the business has said.The aerospace and defence company was having to adjust to a “ very different market” amid slowing defence growth in the US, said Linda Hudson, who took over as president and chief executive of BAE Systems Inc last autumn.Speaking at the Farnborough air show in southern England, she said: “It has been no secret over the last year that a change in defence spending was coming”.The substantial growth in government spending from which contractors had benefited in the wake of military operation in Iraq and Afghanistan was not something “that could be sustained”, she said.Customer expectations had changed, said Ms Hudson. “It is no longer ‘build it fast and get it to me’. Now it’s ‘what can you give me with a very constrained set of funds’. This is a very different business proposition.”The chief executive’s comments echo those of Robert Stevens, her counterpart at Lockheed Martin, the US defence group, who has talked of a “new reality” facing contractors where economies are sluggish and budgets are under pressure.Ms Hudson, who ran BAE’s land and armaments business, which builds armoured trucks and mine-resistant vehicles, before becoming chief executive of BAE Inc, has already cut costs across that business.The unit had been the star performer for the UK defence group in recent years, buoyed by US orders for military units operating in Afghanistan. However, it has suffered, in part because of the loss of a contract to supply trucks to the US army. The rationalisation programme has seen headcount reduced by 12 per cent and the closure of seven facilities.Ms Hudson said since becoming chief executive she had recognised that a similar repositioning was necessary in the company’s electronics, intelligence and support operations. Across the company, she said, “we came to the conclusion that we were not organised as effectively and productively as could be”.“So we changed the structure [in the US] to be more cost-effective, more agile, more flexible in the environment.”In spite of the continued focus on efficiencies, Ms Hudson insisted that “we are not mortgaging our future. We are still investing in our future”.Given the lack of new programmes available, Ms Hudson said that the company was focusing on two areas: support solutions, which includes such activities as repair and maintenance, and intelligence and security.The company is actively targeting acquisitions in both sectors and recently acquired Atlantic Marine, the shipbuilding and repair company.
350;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-19T21:25:42Z;Fox seeks price falls to limit defence axe;;Liam Fox will on Tuesday tell the defence industry it can save equipment programmes from the axe by “reducing prices”, amid signs that the defence secretary is losing ground to the Treasury over funding for the Trident nuclear deterrent.Mr Fox’s speech at the Farnborough airshow will be his sternest warning yet to industry to tighten its belt in line with the defence budget, which faces cuts of up to 20 per cent over the next four years.His frank call for support in managing the public spending squeeze comes as the Treasury made clear that the core Ministry of Defence budget would carry the full £20bn costs of renewing the nuclear deterrent.The budget planning assumption – which one Whitehall insider said had been “agreed within government” – stands in contrast to Mr Fox’s claim at the weekend that Trident capital costs were covered by the Treasury. “There has always been an understanding that the budget for the nuclear deterrent came from outside the defence budget, the core defence budget,” he said.The Trident funding dispute is one of several points of tension between Mr Fox and the Treasury as he prepares an autumn defence review that is likely to cut armed forces numbers and severely scale back equipment programmes.Although the accounting “clarification” will be interpreted as George Osborne’s Treasury team reasserting its authority, defence insiders say the talks over the impact of Trident on other defence capabilities will continue.Mr Fox will push for a budget settlement that takes account of the sharp post-2016 rise in Trident spending, which a defence insider said would otherwise “overwhelm” the core defence equipment budget.“The agreement was that there would be no impact on the core programme,” said one official. “That’s still open for negotiation.”Although the spending round will cover a four-year period, one of Mr Fox’s stated priorities is to bring the over-committed defence equipment programme back into balance against a 10-year capital budget.Mr Fox will call on the defence industry to show how it can make procurement “more affordable for the taxpayer”.Industry’s prosperity “rests on offering better value for money,” he is expected to say. “I do recognise that the UK defence industry is a special strategic asset,” he will add. “But industry must bring more to the table. If you can help us reduce costs, and that includes reduced prices, we won’t have to reduce programmes.”The message of austerity, which could involve cutting margins and waiving fines for scaling back programmes, was reinforced by Vince Cable, business secretary, who warned of “painful decisions” ahead for industry.Executives at Farnborough Air Show said they were positioning their companies to adapt to the tighter defence spending environment. Companies such as EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence group, and BAE Systems are aggressively pursuing exports and investing in related markets like security and intelligence to drive growth.Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, which is building the A400M military transport aircraft for European governments, said the most important challenge facing the company was “reduced defence budgets”.“The environment we see in every country in Europe is decreasing spending – or not increasing. We must adapt …the next three to four years will be difficult.”Absent from the show is Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor. The US company has sent about half the usual number of staff to Farnborough in response to what Mr Stevens has described as the industry’s “new reality”.
351;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-19T20:15:26Z;F-35 cuts would hurt UK’s status;;The UK would find it much more difficult to sustain its position at the top tier of military capability if it drastically cut the number of F-35 fighters it bought, the Lockheed Martin executive leading the programme has warned.The comments by Tom Burbage, general manager of the largest-ever defence procurement programme, come ahead of his meeting on Tuesday with Liam Fox, the UK defence minister.The UK, which is a key partner with the US in the programme, and has invested $2bn from the start, had originally said it would order 138 aircraft to fly off the Royal Navy’s two proposed new aircraft carriers. But the new coalition government is facing serious budget constraints, fuelling speculation that it could cut its actual order by up to two-thirds.Speaking at the Farnborough air show, Mr Burbage said the UK would find it much more difficult maintaining its status as a serious military power with just 50 aircraft – the number being speculated among defence experts in the UK. He said the front line force “could be very small” as some of the aircraft would be used for training, while others would be grounded periodically for maintenance.But Mr Burbage insisted that despite the speculation about the cuts, Lockheed had heard “some counter-arguments” and that the UK still wanted to be a top tier power.The UK had so far given no indications of wanting to cut its order drastically, he added, noting it had already committed to buying three test aircraft, two of which have been delivered.Mr Burbage’s visit to the UK is just one stop of a wider tour of the eight nations partnering with the US on the project. Lockheed Martin has been struggling with technical and production problems and delays on the programme. It has been at pains, in recent weeks, to convince the eight countries that have been involved in developing the jet that the costs have not escalated out of control.Cost projections for the aircraft have jumped twice in the past six months. The US, which has indicated it would buy up to 2,500 F-35s, now estimates development and purchase costs at $382bn – up more than 65 per cent on 2002 estimates.Mr Burbage, however, said partner nations should focus on the actual costs of each jet and that production costs were actually “coming down a nice curve” as the company approaches the fourth production contract for the aircraft.“We are coming down a cost curve that over the course of the programme equates to about a $60m per aircraft in current day, 2010 economics,” he said.Production contracts will also move to being fixed price, he added. The greatest reassurance Lockheed Martin could give partner nations, he said, is to show them the downward cost curve for the production of the aircraft from the first three batches to the fourth.“There has been a lot of outreach to the partners to rebuild their confidence in the programme,” he said.
352;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-18T23:13:35Z;Navy: Raising hopes for helicopters;;Building a fleet of helicopters for the express use of the US president is a prestigious and potentially lucrative endeavour but it has also proven a risky one, as Finmeccanica, the European industrial conglomerate, knows only too well.In 2005, AgustaWestland, the Anglo-Italian manufacturer owned by Finmeccanica, surprised the defence community by winning a contract in collaboration with Lockheed Martin.To do so, Agusta defeated the incumbent Sikorsky, part of United Technologies – which had built and maintained the Marine One helicopters since 1957 – in what was seen as a litmus test for the competitiveness of European defence companies in the US.Last year, however, the Pentagon terminated the initial contract after politicians attacked it as an example of waste.According to the Department of Defence, the project was six years behind schedule and costs had spiralled from $6.5bn to $13bn – figures Finmeccanica disputes.In February, the Navy raised the hopes of manufacturers, requesting information for a new programme, dubbed the VXX, that envisioned a fleet of between 23 and 28 helicopters that could begin operations some time between 2017 and 2023.Despite their previous experience, Finmeccanica intends to bid with Boeing as a partner, tempted by a contract that could be worth between $7bn and $10bn to the winning consortium.Lockheed Martin has chosen to team up with Sikorsky.Still, the risks are high for both sides. In June, Ashton Carter, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, singled out the VXX as an example of a programme that would be closely monitored for affordability as part of efforts to rein in waste and save money.
353;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-18T23:13:35Z;F-35: Fighter maker on defensive;;Every week scores of people, including politicians, government officials and schoolchildren, are ushered into Lockheed Martin’s Global Vision Centre in Washington DC.The sleek, high-tech facility, just a stone’s throw from the Pentagon and not far from Capitol Hill, is a showroom for Lockheed’s products.Prominent among the displays is an exhibition dominated by the F-35, the family of fighter jets that the company is building for the US and eight international partners.Visitors are shown glossy videos promoting the “affordable” and “stealthy” “fifth-generation” fighter jet, they see detailed mock-ups of the different versions, and can sit in a cockpit simulator.The full-blooded sales pitch has never been more important. The programme is the largest ever undertaken by the Pentagon, is crucial to the commercial future of Lockheed and, according to analysts, is at a make-or-break stage.In the past six months, cost projections for the aircraft have jumped twice and the estimate to complete the development and purchase of about 2,500 of the aircraft now stands at an eye-watering $382bn – up more than 65 per cent on 2002 estimates.Alerting Congress to the problems, the Pentagon noted ominously “a general reluctance to accept unfavourable information [which] slowed down the ability of the contractor and the government to recognise and respond to problems”.Politicians have begun to take note. In June, a panel recommended that the F-35 be scrapped as part of $1,000bn of defence cuts over the next 10 years to trim the federal deficit.At the same time, international partners appear to be wobbling. Reports suggest that the Netherlands, down to buy 85 F-35 jets, is considering withdrawing from the test phase, while the UK, due to purchase 138 planes, is facing a budget crunch and is reviewing military expenditure.Lockheed has also been struggling with a number of technical and production problems including higher than planned labour and overhead costs, delays in the test programme and parts shortages.The Department of Defense this year withheld a $614m award fee from the company, citing its failure to meet deadlines. And last month, it warned that further sums could be docked if Lockheed did not work out how to fix its deficient programme management system.In February, Ashton Carter, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, extended the development programme by 13 months, added extra test planes and slowed the production ramp rate to allow a greater margin for delays.Steve O’Bryan, director of business development for the F-35 programme, concedes that the cost estimates have created “real damage”, but insists that international partners remain committed and that the aircraft will sell more than initially planned.Lockheed has adopted a conciliatory tone, assuring investors and customers alike that they understand the gravity of the situation.“I do want to reinforce for you how very mindful we all are of the discussion about how much this programme costs our taxpayers,” Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed, told reporters at a recent event, where he noted the “new reality” budget constraints were imposing on the industry.“We are absolutely committed to getting this programme right, and we’re determined to beat the government’s cost estimate,” Mr Stevens added.But the company has also pointed out that many of the cost overruns reflect conservative estimates and accounting methods for inflation, not current performance.The company says that flight testing is ahead of the revised schedule this year and notes it has offered to sell the fourth tranche of early production fighters for a fixed price, roughly 20 per cent lower than the most conservative cost estimates.“Despite what you read, financially we are performing pretty well,” says Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer. In the first quarter, the company stepped up the profit rates on the first three production lots of the F-35 because they were performing well.Still, the company’s strongest card is perhaps the lack of alternatives to the programme, says Doug Harned, an analyst with Alliance Bernstein. He explains the rationale as: “We have invested a fortune in it – and so we have to make it work.”

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
355;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-18T23:13:35Z;Finmeccanica: Group is keen to target emerging markets;;Pier Francesco Guarguaglini will be attending his 12th Farnborough Air Show this week. At 73, the industry veteran and chief executive and chairman of Italy’s Finmeccanica shows no signs of slowing down.Since taking the helm in April 2002, Mr Guarguaglini, an engineer from Tuscany, has masterminded a series of bold, often complex restructurings and acquisitions to focus the Italian industrial conglomerate on defence electronics and aerospace.Along the way he has also established Finmeccanica, still 30.2 per cent owned by the Italian government, as a key international force with a presence in the US and in the UK, where it owns the AgustaWestland helicopter group and BAE Systems’ former avionics business.The moves have paid off. Its changing shareholder base reflects its increasing internationalisation. Whereas in 2002, Italian institutions held 63 per cent of the outstanding share capital, today they hold just 12.3 per cent. UK institutions, meanwhile, have increased their holding from 7 per cent to 23 per cent and US groups from 11 to 43.3 per cent.Operationally, aerospace and defence has increased its share of group revenues from 55 per cent in 2002 to 71 per cent in 2009.But with all three of its main defence markets – Italy, the UK and the US – facing a spending squeeze, Mr Guarguaglini is having to target sales in emerging markets aggressively.The intention is to build a truly international group. Finmeccanica said in March at its full-year results for 2009 that it expects more than 50 per cent of orders to come from outside Italy, the UK and the US in 2010. It is ambitious – last year, those three accounted for 60 per cent of new orders of €21.1bn ($27.3bn).“If you consider that the European and US budgets are flat, you must go around the world and get the orders,” Mr Guarguaglini said.He identified Brazil, Libya, Algeria, Turkey, India and the Middle East as near-term targets where his team is chasing contracts in areas including helicopters, security and transport.Russia, where the company already has Superjet, a partnership with Sukhoi for 75-100 seater regional jets, is another opportunity.Alongside these activities, Finmeccanica remains focused on gradually reducing its involvement in commercial activities, notably in the energy and transportation fields.The company is looking for an industrial partner for Ansaldo Energia, its power generation business, to take a partial stake with a view to floating it.Executing all this will take time. In March, Finmeccanica reported solid results with group revenues up 21 per cent to €18.2bn for 2009 and earnings before interest tax and amortisation 22 per cent higher at €1.59bn. Some concerns remain, however. The company has highlighted issues over its railway rolling-stock business and some industry analysts remain cautious about the outlook in its home markets.“The concern people have is that there are budgetary issues in all three of its main markets,” says Zafar Kahn, an analyst at SG Securities in London who has a “hold” rating on the stock. He also highlights Finmeccanica’s relatively high level of net debt compared with its peers. It took on debt to buy defence electronics group DRS Technologies in the US in 2008 and, although it has fallen, it was €3.1bn at the end of 2009.In the US, the company is trying to bounce back from having a high-profile programme with Lockheed Martin to supply the president with a new helicopter fleet cancelled by the Pentagon, which cited delays and cost overruns.Finmeccanica has since agreed a licensing deal with Boeing under which the US group will offer its own version of AgustaWestland’s 101 helicopter to the government in a new competition.The deal gives Finmeccanica another stab at the competition, while the partnership with Boeing could eventually include other programmes. Finmeccanica already participates in Boeing’s 787 and the CH-47F Chinook transport helicopter.In the UK, meanwhile, Finmeccanica is the second-largest defence company by sales. But the tight government defence budget and ongoing strategic review are a worry.Questions also remain over the level of work at its AgustaWestland plant in Yeovil.In Italy, Finmeccanica has been battling press reports alleging the company has been caught up in a judicial investigation focused on a group of businessmen and politicians alleged to have been engaged in money-laundering and tax invasion in a scam involving units of broadband operators Fastweb and Telecom Sparkle.Finmeccanica and the judiciary have both said that the group is not under investigation.“I have never believed in conspiracies, but it is clear that someone is out to get me,” Mr Guarguaglini told Panorama, a weekly magazine. But not the US administration, he added.The reports have refocused attention on Mr Guarguaglini’s tenure as chief executive, which expires next year. The decision is in the hands of Giulio Tremonti, finance minister, as holder of the Italian government’s stake in Finmeccanica.Additional reporting by Guy Dinmore in Rome
356;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-07-14T20:08:33Z;Austerity cruises on to Farnborough’s radar;;Captains of industry, military top brass and government ministers will this weekend gather for the biennial jamboree that is the UK’s Farnborough air show.This year, however, one big name is missing from the usual line-up of executives: Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin. The world’s biggest defence company is sending about half as many people as usual to the show in recognition of what Mr Stevens has described as “a new reality” facing contractors.That reality is one of sluggish economies, tighter defence budgets and governments demanding more value for money.In the US, the world’s biggest single defence market, the Pentagon is looking for $100bn of savings from personnel and procurement over the next five years. In the UK, Europe’s largest market, the government is in the midst of a review that is examining cuts to its capital budget of up to 20 per cent.Companies have already seen lucrative equipment programmes cut: last year Robert Gates, US defence secretary, cancelled 30 programmes. Investors have responded, selling their shares and sending company valuations down.“It is obvious the defence budget has plateaued,” said Heidi Wood, aerospace and defence analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. “The consensus on Wall Street is that defence won’t provide attractive returns. However, while defence valuations have fallen and the plateauing has been priced in, the question is, is it a value trap? The industry group as a whole is cheap but could it get cheaper – there is no obvious catalyst for an upturn.”Executives insist that things have been worse, noting that today’s downturn is different from the 1990s when defence spending dropped sharply after the cold war ended.This time round, argues Mark Newman, chief executive of DRS Technologies, a defence electronics company owned by Italy’s Finmeccanica, global security threats remain and the military has a pressing need to replace worn-out kit.“The Department of Defense’s first focus is in managing overheads as opposed to cutting programmes indiscriminately. First, they are trying to become more austere within the department and second they have gone to industry and asked them to become more competitive,” he said.Contractors, however, know they need to adjust. Operationally, most have reduced workforces. Northrop Grumman, the US Navy’s largest shipbuilder, this week announced it is consolidating its Gulf Coast facilities and exploring strategic alternatives for its shipbuilding business.“The consolidation will reduce future costs, increase efficiency, and address shipbuilding overcapacity,” said Wes Bush, Northrop chief executive.In terms of new business, contractors are focusing on winning exports to emerging markets with rising spending. They are also moving into adjacent areas such as cybersecurity.Finmeccanica is targeting Brazil, Libya, Algeria and the Middle East as near-term targets in areas including helicopters, security and transport.Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence contractor, said this week that increased exports of aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon would help offset the slowdown in spending in the UK. BAE also plans to increase its support and services revenues which are characterised by multiyear contracts.At Lockheed, despite Mr Stevens’ absence from Farnborough, executives expect it will fare well under most scenarios thanks to its involvement in key programmes such as the F-35 fighter jet.Bob Trice, senior vice-president of corporate strategy, said last month that Lockheed is “going to be OK …We just want to make sure that we don’t compromise the bottom line by doing anything silly.”That means focusing on executing existing contracts to time and budget, and avoiding the ill-judged adventures in the commercial arena that many companies pursued in previous years.Acquisitions are also on the agenda as organic growth slows and companies look to deploy large cash piles. According to Jane’s, the defence analyst, a total of 64 deals were announced between January 1 and June 1, an 18 per cent upswing compared with the same period last year.Some even predict the time is right for more radical action. Denis Bovin, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Stone Key Partners, the advisory investment bank, earlier this year said the environment was ripe for a large contractor to go private.With very few new programmes for companies to bid on, the industry would “haemorrhage cash over the next two to four years”, he said.“If they are restrained from doing mergers and acquisitions of size, then there’s only a limit to the amount of stock or debt that they can buy back. And the question is, where does that capital go?” he said at a forum by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
357;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-06-29T03:47:38Z;Pentagon puts pressure on defence industry;;The Pentagon on Monday launched a drive to squeeze more from the $400bn it spends on weapons each year in preparation for years of flat budgets and runaway personnel costs.Ashton Carter, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, told acquisition officials and the defence industry alike that they must “abandon inefficient practices” and learn to “do more with the same”.The moves will heighten industry concerns that after a decade of rapid budget growth and comfortable margins, the terms of business are set to deteriorate as the military adjusts to new funding pressures.The Pentagon announcement opens a new front in the defence department’s evolving austerity programme. Last year, Robert Gates, secretary of defence, cut several high-profile weapon systems and hired more acquisition experts to improve internal processes.In early June, the defence department said it would sustain 2-3 per cent growth in investment budgets by saving $100bn over five years, implicitly from operations and maintenance spending, that could be ploughed back into procurement.On Monday, Mr Carter called senior executives from America’s largest defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and BAE Systems to tell them that he would be pushing for better performance from its industry suppliers.The aim, Mr Carter said, was to secure productivity improvements that had long been elusive in the defence sector.“In the rest of the economy …you get a better computer every year and cheaper,” said Mr Carter. “But we haven’t seen [that] in the defence industry.”Jim McAleese, a defence consultant, said that new and early stage programmes, such as a new presidential helicopter, would likely be a particular focus because the Pentagon would find it hard to change the terms of existing contracts.The defence department will consult with contractors about how to achieve specific effiency goals, but preliminary guidelines suggested that they may be achieved by imposing tougher requirements on industry.Mr Carter said the Pentagon would work to phase out contracts which reimburse contractors for most expenses plus a profit margin, and instead use more fixed-price contracts that cap the department’s risk and costs on projects. Final rules will be issued later this summer.In a note written before the Pentagon briefings, Patrick McCarthy, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said the moves would likely “increase uncertainty and the risk profile of the defence industry and we expect it to cause the group to weaken as a result”.Aligning the interests of industry and the Pentagon could prove problematic. While Mr Carter focused on changing contracting processes to hold industry to better account, the Aerospace Industries Association responded with an entirely different set of priorities.The lobby group welcomed the consultations but said Mr Carter should focus on promoting US defence companies abroad, stabilise programme requirements, plans and budgets and overhaul “duplicative” auditing process.Defence companies are not without leverage of their own. Consolidation in the industry has created dominant operators able to push back against the defence department.Earlier this year, Northrop Grumman walked away from the $35bn contest to select a replacement for the air force’s fleet of refuelling tankers in part because the Pentagon insisted on a fixed-price development contract, which Northrop claimed was too risky.In an effort to reassure industry, Mr Carter said fixed-price contracts would also hold the Pentagon to account by making it responsible for expensive last-minute changes to kit designs – something contractors have long criticised.And he went out of his way to dismiss comparisons with the “last supper” in 1993, when the then defence secretary told the sector to merge because the end of the cold war meant that the industrial base was too large for the budget.To those hesitant about reform, however, Mr Carter warned that the alternative was broken and cancelled programmes, industry uncertainty and ultimately “lost capability for the war fighter”.
358;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-06-22T21:11:20Z;US housebuilders hit by weak home sales;;US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as worse-than-expected existing home sales figures set a bearish tone to the session, with the energy sector perfoming worst.Existing home sales, measuring contracts closed during the month, fell 2.2 per cent last month while analysts expected a 7.5 per cent rise.Sales in June were expected to be higher as potential buyers hurried to close on contracts before the expiration of the homebuyer credit.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, expects the market to remain in a tight trading range for the next couple of days in the absence of macroeconomic data to trigger a large move.He added: “There will be more focus on the value of the yuan in the coming days, but the market will be more focused on the path of profit growth into the release of earnings mid July.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.6 per cent to 1,095.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4 per cent to 10,293.52 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,261.80.The weak housing data weighed on homebuilder stocks. Pulte Group was down 3.2 per cent to $8.86, Toll Brothers fell 3.2 per cent to $17.06 and DR Horton lost 3 per cent to $10.22. Home Depot, a home improvement retail chain, dropped 2.6 per cent to $30.61.Walgreen lost 6.5 per cent to $28.17 as the drugstore chain posted a fiscal third-quarter profit of 53 cents per share excluding some items, falling short of the 58 cent per share average analyst estimate.Rival Rite Aid fell 2.9 per cent to $1.01 and CVS Caremark declined 1.2 per cent to $31.40.Intel fell 1 per cent to $20.98 even as the company and the Federal Trade Commission indicated that they may soon reach an out-of-court settlement on an antitrust case, filing a joint motion to suspend administrative trial proceedings until July 22.If the agreement is accepted, it will head off a September trial that would have likely put the spotlight on Intel’s relationships with Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.Apple led the technology stocks higher as the company announced that it had sold 3m iPads in 80 days, sending its stock 1.4 per cent higher to $273.85.The stock’s target price estimate was raised to $375 from $350 at Deutsche Bank. The broker said that demand for iPhones and iPods had exceeded its expectations.Petsmart was 0.4 per cent lower at $31.55 as the pet-store chain announced plans to buy back $400m worth of its shares. It will also increase its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share from 10 cents per share.Patriot Coal Corp lost 16.8 per cent to $13.48 as the coal producer said it is permanently closing its Harris Number 1 mine near Wharton, West Virginia.US-listed shares in Carnival Corp dropped 4.5 per cent to $33.19 as the cruise ship operator said third-quarter earnings would be as low as $1.43 per share. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $1.51 per share.The company’s second-quarter results beat its prior forecasts, with net income of 32 cents per share, against 33 cents per share a year ago. It predicted in March second-quarter earnings would be between 26 and 30 cents.Jefferies Group rose 5.7 per cent to $24.17 after the New York-based securities firm that specialises in mid-sized companies posted second-quarter net income of $85m, or 41 cents per share. The consensus was for a profit of 34 cents a share.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, fell 3 per cent to $64.11 even as James Owens, its chief executive, said its revenue would increase 25 per cent this year. The company also expected its exports to jump 65 per cent.Analysts said that the stock had risen 17.6 per cent over the past two weeks, suggesting that the good news was priced in.Big Lots, a close-out retail chain, was down 8 per cent to $31.56 after the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan.Rival discounter Family Dollar Stores declined 1.5 per cent to $38.45.
359;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-06-10T19:55:06Z;Overseas defence clients get tougher;Offset deals becoming more costly;Western aerospace and defence companies have spent the past decade pursuing lucrative overseas contracts as defence spending in their home markets has slowed.As the sales have risen, so have the commitments to “offset” spending – a promise to invest directly to build up the industrial base of their government clients or foster inward investment by others.Until now, most contractors have, on balance, benefited from these arrangements. But the landscape is changing and the burden of these “offset obligations” is set to increase with key countries realising their original offset policies have failed to deliver.Some of the world’s biggest spenders on defence (both in real terms and as a percentage of gross domestic product) are seeking to introduce more formal and onerous terms on contractors. Penalties if contractors do not fulfil their obligations within certain timeframes are rising.South Korea and Taiwan are both looking to formalise existing ad hoc demands and India wants a better return from key programmes.In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates is to announce an overhaul of its offset policy as early as next week, while Saudi Arabia is also conducting a review. During the next three to four years, the two neighbours are planning to spend a total of about $100bn on defence equipment. Both countries want to put greater emphasis on the transfer of technology rather than on straightforward subcontracting.“Things are getting more onerous,” says Richard Aboulafia, analyst at the Teal Group and a critic of offsets. “There seems to be a massive confusion about who pays for offsets. It’s the buyer, not the seller.”Governments have become increasingly aware that there can be a big gulf between the aspirations behind these offsets and the reality. For example, Saudi Arabia’s first recognisable defence offset accord, the $3.8bn US Peace Shield programme in 1985, envisaged creating about 75,000 jobs. According to research by Jane’s, the defence consultancy, the four joint venture companies that were established employed 3,540 staff as of 2009.India has also faced challenges in making its offset policy – introduced in 2005 – deliver.The target was for $10bn in commitments to domestic industries by 2011. According to Jane’s, $1.9bn had been generated through offset by 2010.For the companies involved, the challenge lies in learning to adapt to the changing policies.“Old defence markets like the UK, the US and mainland Europe, are looking pretty bleak right now: growth to keep shareholders happy means making a serious effort in the new emerging markets,” says Guy Anderson, editor of Jane’s Industry Quarterly.“Some companies are having to learn pretty fast how to break those markets and navigate their procurement rules and ever-changing offset requirements.“In short, a successful handle on offset makes the difference between export success and failure.”The value of the outstanding offset obligations facing the industry has soared to between $75bn-$100bn as of late 2009. There is some debate about what this means for companies’ balance sheets.Grant Rogan, chief executive of offset advisory group Blenheim Capital Services, says the size of these commitments is starting to take up more management time.“The scale and complexity of offset obligations residing with the major defence contractors is increasingly making their management a balance sheet and boardroom issue,” says Mr Rogan.At the end of 2009, Boeing, for example, had outstanding obligations totalling $11bn taking it to 2024.US rival Lockheed Martin had outstanding agreements totalling $10bn, some of which extend to 2025.John Brosnan, head of offset at the UK’s BAE Systems, says it has fulfilled about £6bn ($8.8bn) of commitments over the past 10 years and has obligations in 17 countries amounting “to several billion pounds”.One of the biggest problems facing suppliers and customers is that not all markets are ready to absorb the level of investment that governments are increasingly demanding.A recent survey of executives by PwC found that many emerging markets do not yet have the required skills and infrastructure to be able to develop and maintain many aerospace and defence technologies.Other challenges include the rising percentages demanded by buyers: some countries have in the past demanded that companies invest more than 100 per cent of the value of the procurement contract.“The landscape has definitely become more tricky to navigate. Now, even smaller companies are having to grasp the issue as the big ones push the offset obligations right down the chain,” says Mr Anderson.……………………………………………………….Q&A: Understanding OffsetsWhat are offsets?Offsets require sellers of equipment to ensure a percentage of the contract value remains in the purchasing country. Their purpose can range from securing technology transfer to creating new export markets, jobs and sometimes direct investment.Do they work?Many clearly haven’t which is why some customers are now reviewing their policies but offsets can have profound results. A recent study by Jane’s, the industry consultancy, found that Poland’s $3bn deal for 48 Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets in 2002 spawned 104 offset projects, including General Motors’ selection in 2004 of the country as a production site of the Opel Astra. Under the deal Poland bought the jets for more than $3bn and in exchange the US government and Lockheed committed to more than $6bn of investments, import deals and technology transfer.How do companies account for them?There is no requirement to account for them separately. One financial analyst says he is not concerned about their increasing value as no company has ever had to take a hit for failing to fulfil an obligation. But one industry source says penalties have been paid but are usually covered by confidentiality agreements. Some US companies report the aggregate value of their outstanding obligations in 10-K filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Is that why they are still poorly understood?That and the fact that the government customer rarely discloses the details. The lack of transparency is such that even the size of companies’ outstanding obligations is subject to debate. The quoted “commitments” are based on the value attributed by the customer countries to the benefit of the offsets to them, rather than the cash cost to the supplier company. “Offsets are often poorly understood both in terms of the size of the obligations and the benefits they can bring to customer countries,” says Guy Higgins, a director at PwC. “Where you don’t necessarily have visibility and transparency it can lead to an element of confusion and may lead to the perception that something underhand is going on, even though this is not normally the case.”What is the offset policy of the world’s two largest weapons exporters: the US and the UK?The UK does not have a legally binding offset policy but tries to encourage industrial participation. The US, the world’s largest defence market, has no formal policy but European executives argue privately it has the toughest policy of all because of its so-called Buy American Act which says the government should buy domestically made goods.
360;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-06-07T14:50:19Z;Boeing bids to supply presidential helicopter;;Boeing will enter a controversial multibillion dollar competition to supply the US with a new presidential helicopter, teaming up with Italy’s Finmeccanica to make a bid.The US aerospace and defence group said on Monday that it would buy the rights to build a mid-sized helicopter from AgustaWestland, Finmeccanica’s helicopter subsidiary. Under the licensing deal Boeing will offer its version of AgustaWestland’s 101 helicopter.The news gives AgustaWestland another stab at the long-running competition. The Pentagon cancelled an earlier contract the company had won together with its then US partner Lockheed Martin in June 2009, citing cost overruns and delays.Lockheed announced earlier this year it was teaming up with Sikorsky, the incumbent, to bid in the new contest. The two companies plan to offer a helicopter based on Sikorsky’s H-92 medium-lift craft.According to Boeing the licensing deal will give it all the intellectual property, data and production rights for the helicopter, enabling it to build it in the US at one of its facilities. It will be called the Boeing 101. A team of subcontractors, including AgustaWestland, will work with Boeing if the bid is successful.“As a leading original equipment manufacturer in the military helicopter market and with our nearly 50 years of experience in presidential transport, we believe we are uniquely positioned to make the most of the navy’s significant investment in this aircraft,” said Phil Dunford, general manager for Boeing Rotorcraft Systems.Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, chairman and chief executive of Finmeccanica, told the Financial Times in April that the company was in talks with Boeing over a possible joint bid.The original decision in 2005 to choose an Anglo-Italian design for the president’s personal helicopter was seen as a breakthrough for European defence contractors in the US. Tony Blair, then UK prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, his Italian counterpart, both lobbied then President Bush on behalf of Finmeccanica. The decision was also a huge blow to Sikorsky, which had supplied the helicopters for the fleet, commonly referred to as Marine One, since 1957.The Pentagon said it had scrapped the original contract because it was running six years late and the cost had doubled to $13bn. Mr Guarguaglini in April countered that the company had “maintained the date and the cost” but that the US navy had increased the specificationsIn February, the navy requested information from manufacturers for the new programme, dubbed the VXX, which envisioned a fleet of between 23 and 28 helicopters that could begin operations some time between 2017 and 2023. The projected cost is between $6bn and $10bn.Pentagon officials are seeking preliminary information from potential bidders this month.Analysts said Boeing’s involvement will heighten the competition but that ultimately, the government would probably end up choosing between two helicopters similar to those in the original contest in 2005.
361;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-05-23T11:18:45Z;For-profit schools facing cuts;;Visiting Washington these days, I have the same top-of-the-roller-coaster sensation I had around the contemporary art auctions in 2007, or the tech company launch parties in early 2000. For all their semi-automated expressions of concern for the future of the country, DC people don’t have the acidic anxiety eating at Americans dependent on the private sector.Yet there is a Greece-shaped cloud over the city. It is understood that tax increases and spending cuts are not to be seriously discussed, let alone implemented, until after the November mid-term elections.After that, there will be years of relentless pressure on the Federal and state governments to reduce their borrowing.Since quick results are what get you promotions and bonuses, even in government, the grim post-November meetings are going to focus on the least popular contributors to the Federal debt.Politicians and the bond market will be looking for announcement effect.I believe one of the first targets will be the proprietary education sector, or for-profit post-secondary schools. The unpopularity of this industry with many in the administration is the obverse of what you read in the Wall Street analysts’ reports.The for-profit schools’ revenues have been growing at a very fast rate, the margins are extremely high, and much of the counterparty credit risk of the customers is negated by government guarantees. Investors like that. Civil servants do not.Education is everywhere and always the home of the Left. Firing teachers, cutting their pensions, and subjecting them to much stricter performance criteria will be a far more traumatic task for the education bureaucrats than it would be for their counterparts in Wall Street or corporate America. But they will have to do it. In return, they will want to see blood, corporate blood.How vulnerable are the for-profit schools to the budget-cutters? Let’s consider the margins of others dependent on government business. Defence contractor Lockheed Martin last year received 85 per cent of its sales revenue from the US government. On its $45.18bn (£31.4bn, €36.1bn) in net sales, it earned a pre-tax operating profit of $4.46bn, or about 9.8 per cent.Now let’s look at a leading for-profit education company, Bridgepoint Education. Bridgepoint, which operates Ashford University, had its first full year of operation as a for-profit school in 2005. As of March 31 this year, it had 65,788 students. Ninety nine per cent “accessed their classes exclusively online”, according to first quarter’s earnings release.In 2009, Bridgepoint received 86 per cent of its revenues from the Department of Education’s Title IV higher education financing programmes. With another 4-5 per cent of its revenue coming from members of the military, Bridgepoint is arguably more dependent than Lockheed Martin on the US government.But Bridgepoint’s margins are far more impressive. Of the Q1 2010 revenues of $156.1m (an 85.2 per cent year-over-year increase), $50.1m came down to operating income, up from $7.2m in the first quarter of last year – over three times the margin on sales earned by Lockheed.Another $44.2m of that $156.1m was spent on marketing and promotion. (Lockheed doesn’t report a comparable number.) Instructional costs and services, or cost of goods sold, comprised $39.4m, or about a quarter of total revenue.Since Bridgepoint concentrates on four-year degree programmes, the benefits of which are harder to measure than those of vocational courses, it is not easy to determine what the 65,000 students are getting from their online coursework. You can guess what the education establishment thinks about these numbers. But what can they do about it?A lot more than they are, and soon. Within a month, the DOE will be publishing a set of proposed rules that will restrict incentive compensation for enrolment staff at post-secondary schools. This could affect the growth prospects of companies such as Bridgepoint.The 2007 student loan cohort default rate for Ashford’s customers was reported by the DOE to be 17.4 per cent. These loans are difficult or impossible to discharge in bankruptcy.To address the problem of student loan defaults, the Department will also publish draft guidelines on “gainful employment”, or the apparent utility of the courses in increasing students’ ability to service their education loans.The longs on the for-profit sector point, correctly, to the low multiples, high margins and extraordinary counter-cyclical growth. The short sellers cite the political risk, and the difficulty in finding ever more students to keep the story going.Neither group seems to notice the forthcoming swing of the budget axe. I have the sense that the new rules might well be interpreted to the detriment of the proprietary schools’ margins and growth.johndizard@hotmail.com
362;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-04-30T18:30:45Z;Communicating good news all round;John Lee: Communicating good news all round;"Acouple of weeks ago, a brief newspaper comment caught my attention: “Cable & Wireless Worldwide has won a deal with PZ Cussons to build a network connecting the soap company’s offices in Europe, Asia and Africa.”Further research revealed that this was
a multi-million pound three-year contract to provide a high-speed, next-generation, fully-converged communications system that will carry all PZ Cussons (PZC) voice data and internet traffic with in-built security, resilience, and scalability. As a shareholder in both companies, it was clearly good news all round.PZC has been a great success story over the years and is one of my biggest holdings.I bought shares in Cable & Wireless – before it split into C&W Worldwide and C&W Communications – in January at 148p. C&W Worldwide has a global telecoms network that reaches 35 countries and has 19 per cent of the UK corporate telecoms market but less than 1 per cent of the world market.C&W Communications provides fixed-line and mobile phone services to consumers in small countries across the world, most being formerly part of the British Empire.Since the split, there has been substantial director buying of both stocks and
I have followed their lead. Broker coverage of the two is up, growth opportunities are considerable and likely further consolidation in the telecoms sector adds potential.There has also been good news for the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) shares in my portfolio.Concurrent Technologies, the designer and manufacturer of rugged, long-lasting computer products, has been awarded a coveted “Star Supplier” award from Lockheed Martin – which itself has just won a huge US military contract for jamming technology to combat improvised explosive devices.London-focused Capital Pub Company, whose shares have been edging up nicely but remain below their net asset value, has been declared “Pub Company of the Year” for companies with less than 100 pubs. According to the judges: “Capital impressed …with its non-hierarchical management style, diverse estate, quirky and innovative ideas, entrepreneurial flair and confident in-pub teams.”Delcam, the UK’s leading developer and supplier of advanced software solutions for product development and manufacture, has been presented with the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in the innovation category –
for its software for the design and manufacture of dental crowns and bridges. These can now be produced within hours, giving a much faster service to patients.Corporate voucher and Christmas savings company Park Group is preparing to launch a range of pre-paid “flexecash” cards, redeemable in many of the UK’s largest retailers, including Argos, BHS, Comet, Debenhams, Matalan and New Look.
So these are likely to open up a number of new market opportunities for the group.And finally, Grainger’s opportunist 185p per share approach to equity release specialist Sovereign Reversions – NAV 250p – means that the latter is now very much “in play”. However, as a fellow investor from Yorkshire recently said to me: “Any successful bid will need to start with a ‘2’!”John Lee is an active private investor writing about his own investments. He may have a financial interest in any of the companies and trading strategies mentioned."
363;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-04-30T02:52:35Z;Finmeccanica ponders fresh Pentagon bid;;Finmeccanica is in talks with Boeing over a possible joint bid to supply the US with a new presidential helicopter after the Pentagon cancelled the Italian defence and industrial group’s original contract last year.Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, chairman and chief executive, said the company had been looking for “a new team mate” following the decision to scrap the original $6.1bn programme, which had suffered delays and cost overruns.AgustaWestland, Finmeccanica’s UK subsidiary, and Lockheed Martin of the US had jointly won the original contract, offering a helicopter based on the AgustaWestland AW-101, in a highly politicised battle against the incumbent Sikorsky in 2005.Lockheed announced earlier this month it was teaming with Sikorsky to bid in the new contest.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Guarguaglini said Finmeccanica was talking to Boeing and L-3 Communications, the US defence electronics company. The Italian group needs a US partner because of the sensitive nature of much of the work involved. Boeing, he added, would only participate if it was the prime contractor. He hoped a decision would be made in the next few weeks.Boeing declined to comment on the discussions. Securing the US aerospace and defence group as a partner could significantly boost Finmeccanica’s chances in the new contest.The original decision to choose an Anglo-Italian design for the president’s personal helicopter was seen as breakthrough for European defence contractors in the US.Tony Blair, then UK prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, his Italian counterpart, both lobbied then President Bush on behalf of the company. The decision was also a huge blow to Sikorsky, which had supplied the helicopters for the fleet, commonly referred to as Marine One, since 1957.The Pentagon said it had scrapped the original contract because it was running six years late and the cost had doubled to $13bn. Mr Guarguaglini countered that the company had “maintained the date and the cost” but that the US navy had increased the specifications.The move to scrap the presidential helicopter programme followed the cancellation of the only other big Pentagon programme based on a non-US design. A consortium of Northrop Grumman and EADS, the Franco-German defence group, had its contract to supply the US air force with new air-to-air refuelling tankers, based on Airbus aircraft, terminated in 2008.Asked whether he felt the political atmosphere in the US had turned against foreign defence contractors, Mr Guarguaglini said: “We consider the US a good market but at the same time we understand we have to produce our products over there.”
364;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-04-21T20:34:42Z;Strong earnings bolster anxious Wall St;;US stock prices put in a mixed performance on Wednesday as they see-sawed around the flat mark, in spite of results from Apple that smashed analysts’ expectations, with Morgan Stanley and Boeing also posting better-than-expected first-quarter numbers.“This suggests that recent market advances may have fully priced in expectations of this quarter’s results,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent at 1,205.94, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent 11,124.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,504.61.Apple led the technology stocks in the Dow higher, rising 6 per cent to $259.22. The company reported a 90 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and a 49 per cent increase in revenue after the session’s close on Tuesday, far surpassing bullish Wall Street estimates.The consumer technology products group had been expected to record earnings per share of $2.46 on sales of about $12bn, instead, it reported earnings of $3.33 per share, or $3.1bn in total, on sales of $13.5bn in the first quarter.AT&T, the largest US phone company by revenue, lost 1.2 per cent to $26.34 as first-quarter sales came in slightly below average analyst expectations. The company’s exclusive contract with Apple to offer the iPhone helped drive earnings but a number of analysts raised concerns over its dependency on the contract.Yahoo was 5.1 per cent lower at $17.45 as the search engine provider forecast lower-than-expected second-quarter sales after the session’s close on Tuesday, citing falling market share.The company also reported first-quarter sales that missed average analyst estimates.Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter results before the session’s open yesterday morning, and its shares rallied 4 per cent to $31.68.The bank’s earnings beat average analyst estimates, helped by a strong performance of its fixed income division.Earnings from continuing operations, including a 21 cent tax benefit, were $1.03 per share, compared with analysts’ average expectations of 57 cent per share.Wells Fargo slid 2 per cent to $33.01 as it reported first-quarter earnings that were lower than the same quarter a year earlier, however, non-collectable loans were lower than the fourth quarter of last year. The bank also originated fewer mortgages compared with a year earlier.Gilead Sciences fell 9.6 per cent to $40.76 after the drugmaker which focuses on Aids treatments lowered its full-year forecasts, and said sales of Truvada and Atripla, its flagship drugs, missed expectations in the first quarter.Boeing was up 3.9 per cent to $74.16 as the aircraft manufacturer reported higher-than-expected first-quarter results. But it cut full-year guidance due to the higher costs of providing health benefits to employees as a result of recent US healthcare legislation. It maintained its full-year delivery guidance of 460 to 465 aircraft, saying those were all sold. Revenues would be $31bn to $32bn.Altria, the world’s largest tobacco company, added 1.4 per cent to $21.46 on its first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, helped by a strong performance by its smokeless tobacco business.The company left its full-year guidance unchanged, adding that high unemployment and economic pressures continue to weigh on its customers.Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, was 1.5 per cent higher at $86.25 even after reporting lower first-quarter profits and reducing its full-year outlook, also partly due to the impact of the healthcare bill. Net earnings in the quarter fell 18 per cent to $547m, or $1.45 per share, compared with $666m, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier.For the full year Lockheed said that earnings per share would be $7-$7.20 per share, down from its prior estimates of $7.15 -$7.35 per share.AMR, parent company of American Airlines, slumped 9.2 per cent to $7.77 after reporting a widening loss amid higher fuel prices and meagre growth in passenger traffic.
365;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-04-21T13:46:58Z;Lockheed Martin reports drop in profits;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defense company, reported a drop in first-quarter profits and reduced its full-year earnings estimates as it absorbed the tax implications of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform legislation.Net earnings fell 18 per cent to $547m, or $1.45 per share, compared with $666m, or $1.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier.The defense company is exposed to the healthcare reforms because it has 49,000 retirees who are eligible for the healthcare benefits affected by the reforms.Excluding a $96m charge relating to changes in the new tax treatment for certain prescription drug benefits, earnings per share totalled $1.70, considerably higher than consensus estimates for about $1.55 earnings per share.Revenues for the three months to the end of March were in line with expectations at $10.6bn, a 3 per cent increase over the previous year.For the full year Lockheed said that earnings per share would fall between $7.00 and $7.20 per share, down from between $7.15 and $7.35 per share, although pre-tax earnings will in fact be slightly higher than previous estimates.Lockheed is the first of the big defense companies to report its earnings. Analysts note that US defense spending has peaked but anticipate unspectacular results as companies continue to work through substantial backlogs.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, described the performance as “solid” and noted that the company was pleased with its cash flow. The company generated $1.6bn of cash from operations, up from $1.2bn in 2009.Mr Tanner said the cash would be used to fund a $1.4bn discretionary contribution to its pensions trust in 2010 and will also buy back a further $500m of shares later this year.Beneath the headline numbers, analysts and investors were focused on Lockheed’s F-35 programme. The contract to build a new fleet of combat jets for the US military is the largest the Pentagon has ever let and has suffered from a run of cost increases and delays.In March the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, noted that the Pentagon was now budgeting $273bn for procurement, up from $255bn in 2008. Other official reports have put the potential bill as high as $379bn.Mr Tanner admitted that the contract was at a “critical phase” but said that the highest estimates were government predictions about future cost growth that had not yet occurred. Lockheed’s own estimates are lower.In the first quarter, the company said performance on the programme improved although the moves were not enough to offset a 9 per cent decline in operating profits in its aeronautics division due to lower awards on it F-22 fighter jet contract.For the quarter the backlog of orders slipped to $75bn, from $80.8bn in the same period in 2009, affected by seasonal fluctuations and also by a reduction in the number of contracts available.
366;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed in US presidential helicopter bid;;Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky will bid together for a controversial multi-billion dollar programme to build a new helicopter for the US president, turning the teams that competed for an earlier failed contract on their heads.The move potentially leaves AgustaWestland, which surprised the defense community by winning the first contract in collaboration with Lockheed against the incumbent Sikorsky in 2005, without a partner.The company is owned by the Italian industrial conglomerate Finmeccanica. Sikorsky is part of United Technologies, a US conglomerate with interests in aerospace and equipment for buildings.Because of the sensitive nature of much of the work, any foreign bidders will likely need a US company to do much of the systems integration work on the helicopters.The Department of Defense terminated the first contract last year after politicians attacked it as an example of waste. According to the Pentagon, the project was six years behind schedule and that costs had spiraled from $6.5bn to $13bn.In February, the Navy requested information from manufacturers for the new programme, dubbed the VXX, that envisioned a fleet of between 23 and 28 helicopters that could begin operations in some time between 2017 and 2023.In a recent presentation Finmeccanica predicted that the contract could be worth between $7bn and $10bn to the winning consortium.A spokesperson for Finmeccanica said that AgustaWestland had yet to find a partner but was committed to participating in the contest and would offer the same platform that won the first version - a variant of the AW101.Possible partners include L-3 Communications, the defense electronics company that is currently in talks with EADS, another European defense company, about bidding together for a multi-billion-dollar air-to-air refueling tanker contract.Sikorsky meanwhile said that its new team had submitted a joint response to the Navy and that it would offer the H-92, medium-lift helicopter. Lockheed will be the main supplier of subsystems and the two will explore further collaborations.
367;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-04-13T17:45:01Z;Battling BAE Systems takes the defence high ground;;The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has long been analysing trends in the defence industry and for the past two decades has ranked the world’s largest arms-producing companies in a top 100 league.The Swedish think-tank has released its latest rankings, and although they relate to 2008 they still make pertinent reading, especially for Europe’s big defence contractors. For in 2008, a European company has for the first time unseated its US rivals at the top of the league.What is perhaps even more surprising, on the face of it, is that the world’s leading defence group is the UK’s BAE Systems, a company based in a country supposedly with no manufacturing left. But then it is also a logical consequence of BAE Systems’ strategy over the past decade of focusing on defence. It has shed its stake in Airbus and pulled out of other civil ventures – and transformed itself into a truly international company.BAE System’s defence sales of $32.42bn already accounted for as much as 95 per cent of the company’s revenues in 2008. It sold about $2.5bn more arms than Lockheed Martin, the number two, and about $3bn more than Boeing, the number one in 2007, which slipped to third place in 2008.The main reason for BAE Systems becoming the world’s largest arms-producing company is its push in the US market, where it has placed the headquarters of its two largest operating defence groups. Sales in the US, which accounted for 59 per cent of its 2008 defence turnover, continued to increase, offsetting decreases elsewhere – including in its UK home market.Another reason for BAE Systems’ success is that its arms sales rely on production outside the UK, including Australia, where it is now the country’s largest arms producer after its acquisition of Tenix. It also manufactures in South Africa, Sweden and of course the US.This shows the increasing internationalisation of the defence industry and the need for any self-respecting European defence company to have a strong US footprint. BAE Systems’ European rivals have certainly been trying to achieve this, but with mixed results. Probably the most successful so far has been Italy’s Finmeccanica.The Italian company, which has also acquired substantial defence assets in the UK, has continued to climb in the defence sales league and is number eight, just behind EADS, and ahead of Thales in 10th place. As for EADS, its chief executive Louis Gallois has long tried to persuade his core French and German industrial shareholders – Daimler and Lagardère – to support his efforts to expand in the US market. In 2008 defence accounted for only 28 per cent of EADS’ total sales, compared with 48 per cent for Boeing. But Mr Gallois’ core shareholders have so far been reluctant to dig in their pockets and back the Franco-German company’s US acquisition plans. The example of BAE Systems should help him argue his case even more forcefully.Unfortunately for Mr Gallois, Daimler these days seems far more concerned with its car business, while Lagardère is struggling to fend off the attentions of activist investor Guy Wyser-Pratte.A passage to Indian ITIndia’s Infosys Technologies on Tuesday released what at first appeared to be muted forecasts for the coming financial year, at least by its previous standards.Infosys, India’s second-largest information technology outsourcing company and the first leading group in the sector to report during the results season, said revenue in the year ended March 31 2011 would grow 9-11 per cent year-on-year to up to Rs252.4bn ($5.6bn). Earnings per share during the same period might decline by up to 2.1 per cent to Rs106.82, the company said.The expected revenue is an improvement on the year ended March 31, 2010, when turnover grew 4.8 per cent, although the projected net profit lags last year’s growth of 3.9 per cent. The projections also appear modest compared with Infosys’ pre-crisis growth rates of more than 20 per cent, suggesting that the industry is indeed still facing “challenging” conditions, said chief executive R. Gopalakrishnan.But it was in line with analysts’ forecasts and is largely explained by a 4.31 per cent appreciation in the rupee so far this year against the dollar.In dollar terms, it is predicting growth to be nearly twice as fast as in rupee terms, with revenue growth projected at 16-18 per cent. This is good news but the question for shareholders will remain whether Infosys and its peers can return to the growth rates of the past.To this end, Infosys might come under pressure to make better use of its cashpile of $3.5bn. Has the time finally come for a landmark Indian IT overseas acquisition?world.view@ft.com

Both, like the travel industry itself, have significantly re-engineered and diversified their business over the past few years. Both are controlled by private equity groups – Blackstone in the case of Travelport, and BC Partners and Cinven at Amadeus.Travelport was keen to float ahead of Amadeus, but ultimately decided the market was not ready for its $1.8bn IPO. Amadeus seems more bullish and hopes to make its return on the stock market at the end of this month with an IPO involving roughly $1.8bn for about 25 per cent of its share capital. It is planning both a primary offering of new shares and a secondary offering by current shareholders.

369;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-04-12T22:35:31Z;Qinetiq seeks to avert staff battle;;Qinetiq, the former government defence research group, is due to meet union representatives on Tuesday to head off a potential battle with its UK employees after announcing plans to terminate all collective agreements, including the current redundancy terms.The proposal has been branded “a hostile act” by Prospect, which represents about 2,000 of Qinetiq’s 6,500 UK employees. The move does not “reconcile well with the company’s stated intention to negotiate constructively with the trade unions around creating a sustainable future for Qinetiq”, it said.Although the union said that it was committed to engaging with the management, it said it had received “authoritative legal advice” that Qinetiq’s actions were challengeable in law.David Luxton, national secretary of Prospect, said: “There is clear evidence that all current terms and conditions of employment that have been secured through collective agreements with the trade unions are incorporated into individual contracts of employment, and as such cannot be unilaterally terminated or varied without the express agreement of individual employees.”Qinetiq said it was confident that the steps it was proposing were “entirely legal”.The proposals are part of a restructuring plan being put in place by Leo Quinn, Qinetiq’s new chief executive. One of Mr Quinn’s priorities is to cut costs, but as about half of the group’s UK staff who are former defence ministry employees are entitled to public sector-type terms and conditions, any restructuring would be extremely expensive.● BAE Systems has topped an international list of the world’s biggest arms groups, knocking rival Boeing off the top spot and becoming the first non-US company to hold the position, according to the latest ratings from a leading defence think-tank.The study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said BAE’s jump to the top of the list was helped by demand for mine protected vehicles in Afghanistan. The company reported arms sales of $32.4bn in 2008.Boeing dropped to number three while Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor by market value, rose to number two, according to the study, which only focuses on companies’ arms sales. Total arms sales for the top 100 weapons suppliers were $325bn in 2008, an increase of $39bn over 2007.
370;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-03-29T22:16:48Z;Saab’s special weapon in fighter jet sales;;When Sweden competes with France for a big overseas business contract, there is one trump card its Gallic rival cannot match: a sitting monarch.So it was clear that Saab’s battle with Dassault for a multi-billion dollar Brazilian fighter jet order was nearing crunch time when King Carl XVI Gustaf landed in Brasilia last week to make a sales pitch to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Dassault’s Rafale fighter is considered favourite for the long-awaited deal, involving an initial 36 jets with the possibility of scores more in future, but Saab has waged a strong campaign behind its Gripen warplane.Brazil’s is the first of three forthcoming fighter contracts that will test Saab’s ability to compete in the big league of defence contractors, with the Gripen also in contention for orders from India and Switzerland.Åke Svensson, Saab chief executive, insists that, with deals secured from South Africa, Thailand, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as Sweden, the Gripen’s future is safe.But the forthcoming contests appear to offer Saab its best chance of significant new aerospace business. The three independently minded countries – Brazil, India and Switzerland – are more likely to provide a less political contract process than markets where non-business factors often tip the balance for US manufacturers such as Boeing and Lockheed.“We can offer a high-tech, cost-effective aircraft without any political strings attached,” says Mr Svensson.The fighter bids promise to thrust Saab into the spotlight after months in the shadow of its former affiliate, Saab Automobile, as the carmaker fought and eventually won a battle against closure. While the defence group is much the healthier of the two, both Saabs face a similar challenge as small players pitted against bigger global rivals.“Saab risks being caught between niche companies and the top tier,” says Sandy Morris, defence analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.Like its carmaking counterpart, the defence group experienced boardroom upheaval this year when BAE Systems decided to sell its 20 per cent stake.BAE teamed up with Saab in 1995 to jointly market the Gripen, but the alliance ruptured in 2004 when the British contractor switched focus to its roles in the rival Eurofighter Typhoon and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. BAE remained Saab’s largest shareholder but its boardroom presence became increasingly awkward.Half the BAE stake was sold this month to Investor, the holding company of Sweden’s powerful Wallenberg family, with the remainder to be sold in the market. The deal increased Investor’s stake to 30 per cent and its voting rights to 39.5 per cent, with the Wallenberg family foundation controlling a further 6 per cent of votes.The Wallenbergs helped found Saab in 1937 to provide Sweden with an aircraft-making capability to underpin its military neutrality.Only recently has the group broken its dependence on domestic sales, lifting exports from a third of revenues a decade ago to more than two-thirds last year.While the fighter jet market has proved tough, Saab has prospered in areas such as radar systems and training equipment. It is also pushing into the growing market for unmanned aerial vehicles.Civil security is another focus, including technology to protect infrastructure such as airports, prisons and nuclear plants. This has helped offset decline in military orders since the financial crisis as defence budgets are cut.The Gripen remains Saab’s biggest source of revenues and prestige but most growth and profits is coming elsewhere. “Any Gripen order is a bonus rather than something to be relied upon,” says Mr Morris.Sales rose 4 per cent to SKr24.6bn last year in a difficult market, and net profits climbed to SKr699m from a loss in 2008. But the year-end order book was down 21 per cent at SKr18.4bn ($2.5bn), signalling tough times ahead.While Mr Svensson is praised by investors for increasing exports, his planned retirement in September after seven years in charge is seen as a chance to accelerate change. A search is underway for his successor.Some analysts still doubt the prospects for a company with less than a tenth the revenues of rivals such as BAE, Boeing and Lockheed. But Mr Morris says investors are encouraged by its efforts to refocus on growth markets. “The company has at least shown it has a grip on reality.”
371;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-03-17T22:56:14Z;Space: The pull of gravity;Parlous US finances are halting manned missions;"Three elderly American heroes have been touring US military bases in Europe and Asia this month, telling inspiring tales of space adventures that took place before most people in the audience were born.But the Apollo astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan and Jim Lovell – were not just living on past glories. They looked at the future of manned space flight and lamented President Barack Obama’s decision last month to cancel the Constellation programme under which Nasa would have taken Americans back to the moon by 2020.“We will go back to the moon, notwithstanding our president and his outlook for the future of space,” said Mr Cernan at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The man who in 1972 was the last to walk on the lunar surface added: “Under the president’s proposed budget, it is a mission to nowhere.”The astronauts’ intervention is part of a growing backlash against the plans of Mr Obama, who argues that the US cannot afford to build the Ares rockets and Orion crew vehicle that make up Constellation and needs a nimbler development programme led by private companies. His opponents, from both political parties, say the decision jeopardises national security, prestige and commercial interests at a time when other countries are boosting their own space programmes.When Mr Obama announced the death of Constellation in his 2011 federal budget last month, after the agency had already spent $9bn (£5.9bn, €6.5bn) on it, the political and industrial reaction was initially subdued. “People were so taken aback at the scale of the changes that they were left almost speechless,” says Elliot Pulham, chief executive of the Space Foundation, an organisation representing all sectors of the space industry. “But now there is uproar.”Mr Obama did propose a $6bn increase in Nasa’s funding over five years, with a new emphasis on paying the private sector to develop spacecraft to carry people and materials into orbit. The administration says this could provide a good service to the International Space Station, which orbits 340km above the Earth, more cheaply than Constellation. Funds are to be transferred from Nasa’s in-house facilities and its traditional contractors including Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing to newer space companies such as SpaceX, Orbital Science and Blue Origin.Charlie Bolden, a former astronaut recruited by Mr Obama to run Nasa, proclaimed “a bold and ambitious effort to explore new worlds, develop more innovative technologies, foster new industries and increase our understanding of the Earth, our solar system and the universe”. But Mr Pulham calls the vision “a dim, lethargic, uninspired view of the future. The administration proposes to strip Nasa of meaningful human exploration goals, and instead turn the agency into a space technology hobby shop with a charter To Boldly Go Where Ever,” he says.At a time of growing polarisation in US politics, space remains a relatively bipartisan issue. In the southern states, notably Florida, Alabama, Texas and California, where Nasa and its contractors are big employers – and high-technology status symbols – Republicans and Democrats are combining to defend their interests.Florida, the home of manned space flight, probably has most at stake, with 40,000 jobs and $2bn in private income depending on Nasa. The state’s entire congressional delegation, Democrat and Republican, has written to Mr Obama expressing concern about his proposal. “This leaves the future of US human space flight in serious doubt, and the highly skilled workforce with the prospect of a major upheaval from which it and our space programme will not have the hope of recovery for many years,” the Florida politicians say. They are expected to propose legislation that would preserve a domestic US capability to carry astronauts into orbit.Such reactions are pushing space up the White House political agenda. Next month Mr Obama will address a “space summit” in Florida, conscious that his plans for Nasa could have a significant impact on the state’s delicate political balance.As things stand, the retirement of Nasa’s Shuttle fleet at the end of September will leave Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft, based on an ultra-reliable Soviet design from the 1960s, as the only means of conveying people between Earth and the Space Station.Mr Bolden, the Nasa administrator, says a privately developed US “crew taxi” could be ready by 2016 but many regard his timescale as optimistic. In another “save Constellation” letter, sent to the president this week, the Utah congressional delegation writes: “Since private businesses have never previously developed a low Earth orbit system to transport humans to the International Space Station, one can naturally hypothesise lengthy delays and expensive cost overruns for this novel venture.”While Russia may now be a US ally – at least in space exploration – many Americans with memories of the cold war remain suspicious of the country. They worry too about the rapid progress being made by China and India in space. “There is a direct link between our national defence capabilities and our role as global leaders in space exploration,” says Rob Bishop, a Republican congressman from Utah. “Destroy one and we stand to lose our global dominance in the other.”Such comments illustrate the uncertainties about the real point of manned space flight. Its promoters have mixed motivations, some expressed more clearly than others.One is the human imperative to explore – and conquer. Just as the 19th-century American pioneers believed it was their “manifest destiny” to push west to the Pacific Ocean, Nasa was founded partly on the faith that human destiny calls us to move beyond Earth, first to the moon and then into the solar system and eventually through the galaxy.This view may be heard less in the early 21st century but is still a powerful lure for some. Linked to it is the more fashionable argument that space exploration is one of the most effective ways of inspiring young people to study and then pursue careers in science and engineering.National glory and military might were also powerful considerations from the start. They fuelled the original space race between the US and the Soviet Union; since the latter’s collapse Nasa has found it harder to command federal dollars.Then there are commercial and industrial benefits. Space is a large global industry with a worldwide turnover of $257bn, according to the Space Foundation’s 2009 Space Report. While a lot of the technology originated in manned space programmes, the commercial space industry today is based largely on building, launching and operating satellites for communications, broadcasting and Earth observation. Space tourism is unlikely to become a significant business for several years.Scientific curiosity is the final driver of the space programme. But many scientists maintain that unmanned missions offer better value for money. Martin Rees, the cosmologist who heads Britain’s Royal Society, supports Mr Obama’s decision not to send people back to the moon. “It is very important we pursue science in space,” says Lord Rees, “but the case for sending people into space is getting weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturisation.”In the long run there is a role for people in space, Lord Rees says, but no point in going back to the moon 50 years after Apollo. “If people want to go to Mars, that should be a high-risk, low-cost adventure, not an extremely expensive Nasa-style programme.”While some scientists complain that the huge cost of manned space flight sucks funding from wider space research – pointing out for example that no probes to the outer solar system are currently under construction – industry advocates say that is the wrong way to look at the issue. They argue that the US should increase spending on all space activities, manned and unmanned.Nasa’s spending, at around $19bn a year, accounts for 0.5 per cent of the total federal budget – down from almost 5 per cent at the peak of the Apollo programme. In 1966 the government spent more on Nasa than on health and human services; this year the health and services budget will be almost 50 times greater than Nasa’s. While not even the wildest enthusiast advocates a return to expenditure on the Apollo scale, Mr Pulham argues that the US should be willing to devote 1 per cent of the budget to Nasa, as it did in the early 1990s.That would permit the agency to resume development of Constellation, while encouraging innovative private companies to enter the field.In reality, given the budgetary constraints, the Obama administration is not going to give the industry the money it wants. But the political pressure on the president may lead to some concessions when he speaks in Florida on April 15. One possibility is to keep the Shuttle fleet flying beyond September. More likely, because the main costs will lie well in the future, is a more specific and inspiring long-term destination in space than Mr Obama has offered so far. This might be Mars or one of the Martian moons.One day, Americans will probably walk again on a celestial body beyond Earth. But it is unlikely that any of the first group of Apollo astronauts will still be around to celebrate their achievement."
372;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-02-22T19:27:40Z;UK warned not to raise taxes on wealthy;;Britain must not raise taxes on wealth-creators any higher if it wants inward investment to spur recovery, one of the world’s leading competitiveness experts said on Monday.The warning from Michael Porter of Harvard Business School came as Gordon Brown assured a London conference of 250 global investors that enterprise would be the engine of Britain’s growth as it emerges from recession.Professor Porter, who spoke at the government-run conference, told the Financial Times in an interview that the 50p income tax rate due in April for those earning more than £150,000 was “at the upper end of the band right now”.“If it goes any higher than that – and if that is perceived as being a long-term policy – then I think that’s going to create some real problems in the long run,” he said.Prof Porter also urged ministers to “maintain every pound they can” of spending on the innovation infrastructure, including universities, although he accepted that there would have to be expenditure cuts to deal with the budget deficit.The prime minister launched a new investors’ charter and a tax framework for business aimed at maintaining the UK’s position as the leading European destination for inward investment. Ministers want to encourage companies, particularly from India and China, to invest more in the UK.He also announced that the European Investment Fund had raised £100m to match the government’s contribution to a £200m future technologies fund. It will be used to finance life sciences, digital and advanced manufacturing businesses.Mr Brown said the UK Border Agency would introduce a scheme this autumn allowing “highly trusted” companies to benefit from a streamlined process for bringing skilled staff into Britain.He told the conference he was committed to re-establishing Britain as a “low-debt” economy and to maintaining London’s position as one of the world’s premier financial centres.Among those attending the conference at the Saatchi Gallery in west London were representatives of Ford, Hitachi, Bombardier, China Merchants Bank, Burberry and Lockheed Martin.Lord Mandelson, business secretary, said global investment flows fell 40 per cent last year as mergers and acquisitions dropped two-thirds. He urged co-ordinated action at national and international level to restart investment and avert a “lost decade” of low growth and high unemployment.The UK attracted 1,744 new investments in the year to March last year, an increase of 11 per cent but many were on a smaller scale than in the past.Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said if ministers wanted to make a tangible difference to competitiveness they should “reverse the planned [increase] in National Insurance contributions and ditch the new top rate of income tax”.“Unfortunately there seems to be little recognition in today’s proposals that we need to get the tax burden down to attract foreign investors. In a global economy, you simply cannot beat the numbers. If other countries are cheaper, they win,” he said.Prof Porter said it was becoming “more challenging” to continue the improvement in UK competitiveness seen over two decades. He said policies must remain consistent and warned against “intervening too much” in an effort to emerge quickly from the crisis, such as by creating too many artificial jobs.He said the UK had a stronger portfolio of business clusters – in which companies, their suppliers and services achieve critical mass – than other countries of similar size but could do more to support them.
373;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-02-18T20:47:07Z;Route ahead lies across rough terrain;;Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, has had 15 challenging months at the head of Europe’s largest defence contractor. But the next few years could prove even tougher.With government defence budgets under pressure in the UK and the US, two of BAE’s largest customers, Mr King will need to ensure the company has placed its bets – and its cash – in areas and countries where spending will still rise.The comparison with the past will be painful. BAE has grown rapidly in the past few years. Big acquisitions in 2005 and 2007 and big government spending on armoured trucks and mine-resistant vehicles for Afghanistan have driven growth. BAE’s land and armaments business, which builds the vehicles, has been the star performer.All that is about to change. On Thursday, at its annual results presentation, although BAE said it expected growth across most of its businesses in 2010, it warned the focus would be on reducing costs.“Defence budgets in the UK and the US are expected to come under further pressure, and with the expectations of a more challenging business environment ahead, the focus on driving performance and efficiency in the business will be key. Cost reduction measures are being aggressively implemented across the group.”The results were also accompanied by a £973m ($1.52bn) non-cash impairment charge largely because of the loss of a contract to supply trucks to the US army . Oshkosh won the contract. Mr King warned that BAE did not expect growth from its land and armaments business in 2010. Return on sales will improve, however, but only as cost-cutting takes effect.Uncertainty also surrounds the company’s UK land business where BAE is competing for a £2bn armoured vehicle contract from the ministry of defence. The company has already announced the closure of three land facilities along with several hundred job losses in the past year.The question for investors is where growth will come from next.Mr King insists BAE has a “pretty robust order book” – orders were £46.9bn last year – and argues that other parts of the company’s portfolio will pick up the slack from the armaments business. He picks out BAE’s combat aircraft business which helps build the Eurofighter Typhoon and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft jets.European partner governments last year committed themselves to half of the final production run of Typhoon aircraft which should sustain production at BAE’s plants until at least 2018. Growth should also come from the F-35 programme. Despite doubts about how many aircraft the UK government will order, BAE has a 17 per cent share of the programme to produce the 3,000 or so aircraft on order from all customer governments, including the US.Mr King also picks out the rising level of orders from providing maintenance and support on equipment, with about £3bn worth of new orders booked last year. About 40 per cent of the company’s 2009 sales were related to maintenance contracts.With the US government in particular focusing its spending priorities on new areas such as cyber warfare, BAE expects future growth from orders of electronic systems and unmanned aerial vehicles.Nick Cunningham at Evolution Securities describes what is happening at BAE as a “relay race” where each of BAE’s four main divisions picks up the baton to drive growth in turn.Now that the armaments business has dropped back, BAE’s programmes and support business, which includes combat aircraft and long-term UK programmes such as submarines and aircraft carriers, will take up the baton, he argues. BAE’s international business, including its Saudi Arabian business, should pick up sharply in the next few years.The Saudi business – notably sales of Eurofighter – accounted for about £2bn of BAE’s group operating sales last year. Mr Cunningham expects that to rise to about £4bn in four to five years time as BAE begins to deliver more Typhoons and support those already in the country.But long-term company watchers are nevertheless warning investors not to expect a repeat of the dramatic growth of recent years.“Right through the middle of this decade, BAE continues to grow. The big question is what happens after sales for Typhoon begin to slow and once major programmes like the Astute submarines in the UK have ended,” he says.
374;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-02-16T21:34:43Z;Governments demand A400M profit share;;European governments have demanded a share in any future export profits from the troubled A400M military transport programme in return for providing a €3.5bn ($4.8bn) rescue package.The seven customers – France, Germany, Britain, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Turkey – who have pledged to buy 180 of the turboprop aircraft on Tuesday delivered their “final and best” offer to EADS, parent of the A400m’s maker, Airbus.In a letter sent by Rüdiger Wolf, German junior minister for defence procurement on behalf of all the client states, the governments agreed to offer €1.5bn in advance payments in return for the promise of a share in future export profits.A further €2bn in support will be made up of a combination of cash and cost cuts to the programme. The governments have also indicated that they would be prepared to talk about absorbing future price rises caused by external factors, such as increased raw material costs.The €3.5bn package still falls short of the €5.2bn funding gap identified by EADS on the programme, one of Europe’s largest defence projects. It is already running four years behind schedule and some €11bn over its initial €20bn estimate.The future export potential of the aircraft is also unclear as it faces competition from successful US programmes – Lockheed Martin’s C-130 Hercules and Boeing C-17s.The future of the C-17 programme is, however, in some doubt after the Pentagon recently halted further orders for the aircraft. Boeing must find export markets to keep the line open.EADS was on Tuesday night examining the offer and people close to the talks suggested it could be accepted if the governments accepted a few further changes “at the margins”.EADS is reluctant to accept any further large writedowns on the fixed price contract, which could wipe out its profit for 2009. EADS has already taken a €2.4bn provision against the programme. The current offer could leave the group facing further provisions of about €1.7bn or more, against profits forecasts of roughly €2bn.An announcement, at least on an agreement in principle, is expected in the coming days. EADS is under pressure to agree a deal before it closes its accounts ahead of its results next month.Defence procurement ministers from the customer governments are due to meet with company representatives later this week.
375;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-02-15T03:12:29Z;Defence fills the aviation procurement gap;;The world’s big air shows have become best known in recent years for multi-billion dollar aircraft orders from airlines. With the civilian industry mired in gloom, though, it was the defence contractors who put the sparkle into Asia’s largest show in Singapore this month as they chased up to $100bn in procurement contracts from India.“India has huge potential for us in terms of defence business,” says Christian Duhain, a vice president at EADS. “The demand is huge.”India’s procurement programme is driven by concerns about China and Pakistan, together with growing regional commitments such as a recent defence pact with Qatar, and the need to replace ageing weapons systems, many supplied by the now defunct Soviet Union.However, it is India’s growing economic clout, together with the removal by former president George W Bush of a long-standing US arms embargo, that has turned the country into the most most fiercely contested arms market in Asia.“There are so many projects I find it hard to keep track of it all,” says Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, a former director of operations for the Indian air force who is now director of the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi. “Wherever you look you find that there is just enormous activity going on.”The biggest deal is a tender for 126 multi-role fighter aircraft, worth about $10bn, which is being contested by Boeing’s F/A18 Super Hornet, France’s Dassault Rafale, Lockheed Martin’s F16, Russia’s Mig35, Sweden’s Saab Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a European consortium including EADS.As Boeing’s F16 and other fighters went through their paces overhead, defence executives interviewed at the Singapore show said they expected this turnkey order to be expanded to include a second tranche of 60 aircraft, which could increase its value by up to half.“I think it is probably going to be a programme of about 180 aircraft eventually,” says Mark Kronenberg, Boeing’s vice-president for defence-related international business development. “They haven’t said they are necessarily going to buy the 60, but if you look at the way they lay it out in terms of reducing the number of platforms that’s what makes sense.”Executives say India is also looking for transport aircraft and heavy-lift helicopters for the air force, 197 light helicopters together with infantry systems and howitzers for the army, and a range of submarines, frigates and multi-role helicopters for the navy.KPMG in New Delhi estimates the value of these programmes at about $20bn.A wide range of other contracts are, or may, soon be up for grabs, according to manufacturers. These include airborne tankers, radar systems, air-to-air and anti-tank missiles, encrypted telecoms and border surveillance equipment.India is also refurbishing and upgrading its Mirage 2000 fighter force, and discussing joint development of an advanced fighter with Russia.A range of defence companies is bidding for parts of this business, or is expected to do so, including Sikorsky, Bell, Raytheon and Honeywell of the US, Israel’s Elbit, France’s Thales, Augusta Westland, the Anglo-Italian helicopter maker, Finmeccanica of Italy and Eurocopter, an arm of EADS.Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, which manufactures howitzers and the Leopard II main battle tank, also hopes to sell to in India in the long term.“India is a market that is increasing fast. It has one of the largest populations and one of the largest defence budgets in the world. It is investing so it is one of our key tasks to have a look at India,” says Christian Goettfert, managing director of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.Analysts said that India will be looking for substantial offsets and joint venture deals for most of the contracts, in line with a government commitment to increase local content, including design, to an eventual target of 100 per cent.Charles Pybus, a defence expert at KPMG in New Delhi, says foreign companies will have to be ready for close co-operation with Indian defence contractors. These include government-owned Hindustan Aeronautics, which makes combat aircraft and helicopters, Larsen & Toubro, which makes missile systems and naval engineering systems, and Mahindra Defence Systems, which manufactures armoured vehicles, weapons systems and ammunition.However, the requirement for joint ventures or offset deals is unlikely to be a disincentive for most manufacturers.“The western defence market is drying up at an alarming rate, while at the same time they have cost pressures which are making them look towards lower cost centres like India anyway,” said Mr Pybus.
376;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-02-02T20:59:31Z;Lockheed under fire from Pentagon;;At a meeting with investors last week, Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, told shareholders the industry had to prepare for a changed environment.“We and our customers are facing a new reality,” he said, “as [our customers] confront expanding mission requirements and greater fiscal pressure that is simply not going to go away in the near term.”On Monday that “new reality” arrived for Lockheed as the Pentagon approved a radical shake-up of the F-35 programme, Lockheed’s $300bn project to build a new combat jet, and confirmed that defence budgets would grow more slowly in future.The progress of the F-35 “has not been what it should, as a number of key goals and benchmarks were not met,” Robert Gates, US defence secretary, told reporters. “The taxpayer should not have to bear the entire burden of getting the JSF [joint strike fighter] programme back on track.”As a result, the Department of Defence will replace the official in charge of the F-35 programme, the successor for much of the US combat aircraft fleet, withhold $614m of performance fees from Lockheed and shift more money to the development stages to reduce risk.For Lockheed, the F-35 decision marks a setback for a crucial project. The programme made up about 10 per cent of its $45.2bn revenues in 2009 and as production increases it expects it to reach 30 per cent of revenues at its peak.The aircraft has struggled with delays and cost overruns in part because Lockheed has tried to compress the testing and development cycles and accelerate production to achieve economies of scale earlier than would otherwise be possible.However, Itay Michaeli, an analyst with Citigroup, argues that DoD support for the F-35 remains strong, with funding boosted by 2 per cent to about $11.5bn in 2011, and that restructuring could be positive for Lockheed if it sets more realistic expectations. “The question is whether Lockheed can execute,” he said.Dan Crowley, F-35 programme general manager at Lockheed, said the company hoped “to re-build our customer’s confidence through execution against a series of milestones”.He admitted that “without results there is an expectation that [the performance] fee will be withheld”.But the DoD’s moves will also heighten broader concerns that the terms of trade are set to deteriorate for the defence industry as the department prepares to spend less but demand more from suppliers.As part of reforms launched in 2009, Pentagon officials have expressed a desire to use more fixed-price contracts to cap the department’s risk on projects and shown a willingness to restructure and even eliminate under-performing systems.Defence companies are not without some leverage of their own. Recent interactions have been co-operative, said Mr Michaeli, but consolidation in the industry has created dominant operators able to push back against the DoD.Last year, Northrop Grumman threatened to walk away from the $35bn contest to select a replacement for the Air Force’s fleet of air-to-air refuelling tankers in part because the DoD insisted on a fixed-price development contract, which Northrop claimed was too risky.“As the industry leader,” Mr Stevens, told Lockheed investors last week, “we are working to contain costs …with the recognition that we really should seize this moment to do a better job.”
377;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-02-02T20:15:27Z;China warns US over Dalai Lama;;China warned the US on Tuesday that any meeting between President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama would further damage relations, in the latest sign of the deteriorating political mood between Beijing and Washington.Speaking on the day Beijing restated its pledge to impose sanctions on US companies that sell arms to Taiwan, a senior Chinese official said that meeting the Dalai Lama was not in the interests of the US at a time when it was trying to recover from the financial crisis.“If the US leader chooses this period to meet the Dalai Lama, that would damage trust and co-operation between our two countries, and how would that help the United States surmount the current economic crisis?” said Zhu Weiqun, a vice-minister who handles Beijing’s contacts with the Dalai Lama.White House officials on Tuesday confirmed that Mr Obama would meet the Dalai Lama – and that Mr Obama had conveyed this information to Hu Jintao, China’s president, on his visit to Beijing last November.“Our relationship with China is mature enough that we can work with each other on issues of mutual concern and be candid with each other on areas where we disagree,” said Benjamin Chang, a spokesman for the White House national security council. The date of the meeting would be announced later, he said.The potential acrimony over meeting the Dalai Lama follows a series of contentious issues that have soured relations since Mr Obama’s visit to China when he sought Beijing’s help in tackling several global concerns.US officials were irritated by China’s tactics at the Copenhagen climate change conference. They have also criticised the 11-year prison sentence given to Chinese political activist Liu Xiaobo, while the White House said it was “troubled” by cyberattacks on Google alleged to have originated in China.Meanwhile, Beijing has been angered by the Obama administration’s decision last week to approve a $6.4bn arms deal to Taiwan, over which it claims sovereignty, and has resisted US calls to strengthen its currency.Some analysts say that the sour mood could pass, particularly as Mr Hu plans to visit the US this summer. But they say that ill-feeling could affectother policy issues, such as sanctions against Iran and bilateral trade.“China is getting more assertive,’ said Ken Lieberthal, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The key question is whether China will sanction Boeing, which would be a very big deal.”Ma Zhaoxu, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, reaffirmed on Tuesday that US companies involved in any arms deal with Taiwan would face unspecified sanctions.The companies include United Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing, which has been at the centre of US-China economic ties for the past three decades.
378;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Lockheed failures lead to Pentagon shakeup;;The US Department of Defence will replace the official in charge of the F35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, the successor for much of the US combat aircraft fleet, and withhold $614m of performance fees from maker Lockheed Martin for failing to meet key goals.Analysts say it is the clearest evidence of the administration’s resolve to implement acquisition reforms, launched with the 2010 budget and designed to cut failing legacy projects, rebalance spending towards current operations and improve value for money.“Robert Gates, secretary of defence, has been a strong proponent of acquisition reform and I think that he is putting those words into actions with the Joint Strike Fighter,” said Todd Harrison, of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington.The shake-up came as the defence department announced its 2011 fiscal year budget, highlighting that spending will hit record levels next year at $708bn, although the rate of growth is slowing and will flatten out over the medium.In total, funding to buy kit will rise by 7.7 per cent to $112.9bn in 2011, with an emphasis placed on purchasing new unmanned aerial vehicles and helicopters crucial in Afghanistan, although spending on research will fall by about 5 per cent to $76.1bn.The F35 is a priority for the defence department, which intends to spend almost $1,000bn to develop, buy and support about 2,458 of the combat aircraft over the next few decades, making it the most expensive procurement project ever.For Lockheed Martin, the F35 decision marks a setback for a crucial project. The programme made up about 10 per cent of its $45.2bn revenues in 2009 and as production increases the company expects it to reach 30 per cent of revenues at its peak.But the aircraft has struggled with delays and cost overruns in part because Lockheed has attempted to compress the testing and development cycles and accelerate production in order to achieve economies of scale earlier than would otherwise be possible.The progress of the F35 “has not been what it should, as a number of key goals and benchmarks were not met,” Mr Gates told reporters. “The taxpayer should not have to bear the entire burden of getting the JSF program back on track.”Mr Gates said that the department had to accept some responsibility for the failure and announced that he had decided to replace the top defence official in charge of the F35 programme with a more senior official.Still, the moves will heighten broader concerns that the terms of trade are set to deteriorate for the defence industry as the department prepares to spend less but demand more from their suppliers.As part of the reforms, Pentagon officials have expressed a desire to use more fixed-price contracts in order to cap the department’s risk on projects and has demonstrated a willingness to eliminate underperforming systems entirely.The new context is certainly sinking in among defence executives. In mid-January the Defence Business Board, which advises the Pentagon on industrial matters, presented a report highlighting that sustained budget pressures could lead to a substantial reorganisation of the US industrial base.Should spending drop between five and 10 per cent over the long term then companies will likely exit the industry, merge with rivals or scramble to develop adjacent markets, the board said. In turn the Pentagon will be left with fewer options, less competition and restricted access to important technologies.“We recognise that we and our customers are facing a new reality as they confront expanding mission requirements and greater fiscal pressure that is simply not going to go away in the near term,” Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed, told investors last week.“And as the industry leader we are working to contain costs, shorten cycle times and improve quality and meet the commitments we have made …with the recognition that we really should seize this moment to do a better job.”Mr Stevens recently told investors that he was close to an agreement to with the Pentagon to produce fewer F35s in 2010 than previously planned and was in discussions about the possibility of moving the F35 programme to a fixed-price incentive type contract a year earlier than planned.“There is no view in the Pentagon that one size fits all …[but] when a system or programme has the maturity where fixed price contracting can be applied I am all for that …bring the game into Lockheed, make that our responsibility,” Mr Stevens said.
379;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;US pledges more help for Mideast allies;;The US promised on Monday to do more to protect Middle Eastern states as it embraced plans to “hedge” against a nuclear Iran by boosting its allies’ military capabilities.Robert Gates, the defence secretary, set out budget and strategy plans that would focus US efforts on the war on Afghanistan and rely more on third countries to deal with other threats.Barack Obama, president, will ask Congress for a record $708bn (€508bn, £444bn) for the military in 2011, including a base budget of $549bn, which is a 1.8 per cent increase on 2010 after inflation. Last year the budget grew 2.1 per cent, after several years of 4 per cent annual growth.While the administration’s top priority is to prevail in current conflicts, for its second priority – preventing and deterring conflicts – it highlighted the importance of its partners, aided by technical assistance from Washington.The review also calls for boosted defences against the possible use of improvised explosive devices within the US and more steps to counter the US military’s “staggering” number of vulnerabilities against cyberattack.“The US will remain the most powerful actor but must increasingly work with key allies and partners if it is to sustain stability and peace,” said the Quadrennial Defence Review.In practice, the US is placing much of its hope of keeping Iran in check in bolstering the capabilities of other Gulf states, specifically in missile defence.The document highlights the importance of “new, tailored, regional deterrence” systems, including missile defence to deter US foes. In an apparent nod towards Iran’s progress towards viable nuclear weapons, it adds “even as we strive to prevent proliferation we must take steps to hedge against its possibility”.Publicly, US officials say the time to contain Iran has not arrived, as it may yet be stopped from acquiring nuclear weapons capability.However, the urgency with which the administration views Iran’s short and medium-range missile capability is laid bare in another report,which said its “hundreds of ballistic missiles [pose] a clear and present danger to US deployed forces, allies and partners”.It added that current defence “capabilities are modest when set against the rapidly expanding regional missile threat” and that “the demand for missile defence assets within each region over the next decade will exceed supply”.Over the past six months Washington has stepped up arms sales, notifying Congress of deals such as a $410m Patriot missile system upgrade for Kuwait, a $7.8bn Patriot deal with Turkey, and substantial sales to Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.In the medium term total defence budgets will level out at about $650bn as spending on Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan is expected to drop to $50bn a year from 2012 onwards.Mr Gates also announced a radical shake-up of the F-35 combat aircraft programme, the US military’s largest ever acquisition, which is struggling to hit budget and time targets.Mr Gates fired the defence department’s top official on the project and said he would withhold $614m in performance fees from Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor on the F-35.
380;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
381;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Beijing sanctions over arms sales could backfire;;Imposing trade sanctions on foreign arms contractors to punish them for supplying weapons to Taiwan could backfire on China, hurting domestic industry, putting it in contravention of international trade rules and undercutting its ability to buy equipment at competitive prices.Over the weekend China threatened to impose sanctions on US weapons suppliers, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, following the Obama administration’s announcement on Friday of its first arms package to Taiwan.China’s aviation industry is dominated by the state, and procurement has always been heavily tinged by politics. But imposing outright sanctions on Boeing would have a “massively detrimental effect on China’s existing fleet of commercial aircraft”, according to one industry insider.That would seem to be a large price to pay just to punish the company for selling 12 missiles to Taiwan.While Airbus has won slightly more orders from China than Boeing in recent years, Boeing aircraft still make up about 53 per cent of China’s total commercial fleet, compared with 36 per cent for Airbus.“I don’t think they’d discard Boeing completely because they want to have something to wield over the Europeans,” said Peter K.N. Lok, Hong Kong’s former director of civil aviation and a former board member of Air China and China Eastern, two of the country’s largest state-owned airlines. “What could happen is what they’ve done before – tilting the sales of aircraft slightly more in favour of Airbus.”Still, any windfall for Airbus could be shortlived, say analysts. The company was a target of Chinese anger when the French government sympathised with the Dalai Lama ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Pure-play defence companies involved with the Taiwan sale – including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – are less likely to worry about Beijing curbs as they have limited operations in China, according to a senior industry executive. Lockheed’s entire Beijing staff amounts to one part-time receptionist.More exposed is Sikorsky Aircraft, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp, which has a huge market in China for its Otis elevators and Carrier brand heating and air-conditioning systems. UTC also employs 16,000 people in China, says its website. Sikorsky plans to sell 60 Black Hawk helicopters to Taiwan under the deal presented to the US Congress on Friday.But trying to block those products from the Chinese market would quickly expose Beijing to a US legal challenge under World Trade Organisation rules, which forbid open discrimination against foreign suppliers of civilian equipment.If such a challenge succeeded, Beijing could face sanctions against its own exports that would be equivalent in value to the estimated loss of business to US companies.Boeing estimates China’s total commercial aviation market at about $400bn (€288bn, £251bn) over the next 20 years. However, trade experts say that Chinese officials are well aware of the WTO rules, and retain trade lawyers in Brussels and Washington to advise them. Ministers will therefore be aware that sanctions against Boeing or other companies could be risky and lead to a further deterioration in commercial relations with the US.Over the longer term, China has openly said it intends to replace both Boeing and Airbus by unveiling its own homegrown jumbo jet by 2020. Unfortunately for Beijing that ambition relies partly on support, co-operation and technology sharing from the world’s two big makers of jumbo jets – Boeing and Airbus.Most analysts agree China is unlikely to jeopardise its own interests by imposing meaningful sanctions on Boeing or other US arms suppliers.“They’ll probably rap [Boeing’s] knuckles for six months, order 20 Airbuses and then let it all die down,” said one aviation executive.Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer in New York
382;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Aerospace sector fears China sanctions;;Aerospace executives and the US government reacted with concern on Sunday to a Chinese threat to impose sanctions on American groups involved in a $6.4bn arms deal with Taiwan.Giovanni Bisignani, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, the global airline industry body, called for fresh talks between Beijing and Washington to avert a crisis over the arms package.“At a moment in which the world is in crisis [and] China is playing a very important role in overcoming and pushing for recovery it would be a very, very difficult and unhappy situation” for sanctions to be imposed, he said, as industry leaders gathered in Singapore for Asia’s biggest air show.The deal, to which the Obama administration gave the green light last week, includes 60 Black Hawk helicopters, 114 Patriot missiles and systems supplied by Boeing, United Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.The move implemented a pledge by George W. Bush, former US president, in 2001 – and omits some technologies sought by Taiwan, such as F16 fighters. But it comes after tension has risen between Washington and Beijing on issues such as the dispute over cyberattacks on Google, and a Chinese missile test.In comments quoted by the official Xinhua news service, Yang Jiechi, foreign minister, called on the US to “truly respect China’s core interest and major concerns, and immediately rescind the mistaken decision …to avoid damaging broader China-US relations”.The Chinese foreign ministry, which called in Jon Huntsman, the US ambassador, also said it would partially halt military exchange programmes and vice-ministerial talks on strategic security and arms control.“We regret that the Chinese side has curtailed military-to-military and other security-related exchanges,” said a US state department official.A senior aerospace executive with knowledge of the situation said China was clearly “ flexing its muscles” and that the sanctions threat would be felt most by Boeing, as the main overseas supplier of civil aircraft to China over the last decade. Beijing manages aircraft purchasing centrally and political factors have played a role in the past.Boeing, which warned on Friday that it expects revenue to fall this year, estimates China will need 3,770 new aircraft – worth up to $400bn – by 2028.Over the past three years Boeing has derived about 4 per cent of its total revenues from China.It declined to comment on Sunday, but is understood to be watching developments closely.Airbus, which has commercial aircraft operations in China but no defence business, also declined to comment.Chinese media and bloggers have recently opened debate about other avenues of retaliation against US arms sales to Taiwan. The latest package gives China an excuse to step up its own arms modernisation programme including missile tests, said Jin Canrong, an international relations expert at Renmin University in Beijing.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai, Jeremy Lemer in New York and Pilita Clark in London
383;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-01-31T12:11:45Z;Sanctions call worries aerospace execs;;Aerospace executives gathering in Singapore for Asia’s biggest air show expressed deep concern on Sunday at the prospect of Chinese sanctions on US companies involved in a major arms deal with Taiwan.Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport Association, the global airline industry body, called for fresh talks between Beijing and Washington to avert a crisis over the $6.4bn arms package, which includes systems supplied by Boeing, United Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.“We have so many problems today in the world I really hope they can find an agreement explaining the situation,” said Mr Bisignani.“At a moment in which the world is in [economic] crisis [and] China is playing a very important role in overcoming and pushing for recovery it would be a very very difficult and unhappy situation” for sanctions to be imposed.Other executives said the unprecedentedly tough reaction from Beijing appeared to reflect the China’s growing economic prowess.“Anyone who has followed [US-China] interaction over 20 years would not be altogether surprised, in view of the evolving relationship, that China would take such a strong line,” said Martin Craigs, president of the Aerospace Forum Asia, another industry association.A senior industry executive with close knowledge of the situation said China was clearly “flexing its muscles” and said the threat of sanctions would be felt most by Boeing, which has vied with Airbus as the main overseas supplier of civil aircraft to China over the last decade. Beijing centrally manages aircraft purchasing and political factors have played a role in the past.Boeing, the first US company to send its top executive to Beijing after President Richard Nixon opened ties with the communist state, is forecasting that China will need 3,770 new airplanes, worth a potential $400bn, by 2028. Boeing, which warned on Friday that it expects revenue to fall this year, declined to comment on the Chinese threat.The executive said that Lockheed and Raytheon were likely to be less affected because their existing business in China was small, in part as a result of Chinese anger over their involvement in earlier US arms sales to Taiwan.However, he said that Lockheed had been in negotiations for a contract to supply civil nuclear control equipment for China’s nuclear power station programme.The executive said China might have second thoughts about imposing sanctions, having made its irritation over the deal widely known.“In the longer term, this could be a problem for them as well as for the companies involved in this Taiwan deal,” he said. “The companies will argue that they are not selling arms to Taiwan at all. They sell them to the US government, which then passes them on to Taipei.“But this sends a very uncertain message for everyone who is doing business in China, or considering it. What happens to the next company whose government does something the Chinese don’t like? Do French companies get sanctioned because [President Nicolas] Sarkozy has a meeting with the Dalai Lama?”
384;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-01-27T20:55:28Z;Boeing and the Pentagon;;That rushing of air is a deep sigh of relief. Boeing shares bounced on Wednesday on reassuring fourth-quarter results. The aircraft-to-missile maker guided earnings this year below the $4.25 per share analysts had been expecting – a number less than half that predicted 18 months ago – but management does expect to produce operating cash flow in 2011. The downturn may be less bad than feared.Boeing receives the most attention for one-half of its business, civil aerospace. But in spite of it being the second-largest US defence contractor (behind Lockheed Martin), the group still trades on 15 times prospective earnings, versus about 10 times for the defence sector. And while the near term future seems assured – on Monday the Department of Defense is expected to ask for a 2-3 per cent real rise in its budget, and Boeing is well placed in programmes such as naval aircraft – the longer term outlook is much less certain.President Obama is unlikely to try shrinking the defence budget. An expected three-year freeze on discretionary spending specifically excludes the military. Indeed, the last president to win a Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter, did not cut it either. The only time defence spending shrinks is after a large-scale war, hot or cold, and Afghanistan remains the former.But the $200bn odd of government spending going to the defence industry annually is likely to grow only very slowly and the procurement and purchasing process is under review – note that margins on military outsourcing tend to be 1 or 2 percentage points higher than for other parts of government. In the similarly lean mid-1990s, defence stocks traded at up to a 50 per cent discount to the market, notes Credit Suisse.

385;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-01-19T19:44:18Z;Norway fund shuns tobacco companies;;Norway has dropped 17 tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, from its sovereign wealth fund, adding to a growing list of stocks blacklisted by Europe’s biggest equity investor.Imperial Tobacco, Altria, Reynolds American and Japan Tobacco were among others barred from the $455bn fund – which owns more than 1 per cent of all global stocks – after the Norwegian finance ministry ruled that the companies were in breach of the fund’s ethical guidelines.The tobacco companies join a list of about 50 stocks excluded from the Norwegian fund on ethical grounds, ranging from arms manufacturers, such as Boeing and BAE Systems, to companies accused of environmental and labour rights violations, including Rio Tinto and Wal-Mart.Norway has sought to make its sovereign wealth fund a role model for socially responsible investment since introducing ethical guidelines in 2003. Tobacco companies initially escaped exclusion but Sigbjørn Johnsen, finance minister, on Tuesday said it was time for them to be removed.“It is important that the ethical guidelines reflect at all times what can be considered to be commonly held values of the owners of the fund,” he said.The fund, in which Norway invests its oil wealth for future generations, is the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates.According to Reuters calculations, the fund’s holdings in the 17 excluded tobacco companies were worth NKr14.6bn ($2.6bn) at the end of 2008. Its stakes included 1.3 per cent of British American Tobacco, 0.5 per cent of Philip Morris International and 1.3 per cent of Imperial Tobacco.The finance ministry said all stocks had been sold in advance of Tuesday’s announcement. It added that other companies connected with the industry could be excluded in future.The fund has a Council of Ethics that recommends stocks for removal, with the final decision made by the finance ministry.Norway stirred controversy last September by excluding Elbit Systems, an Israeli company that supplies the surveillance system for the “separation barrier” under construction by Israel in the West Bank.Other blacklisted companies include Honeywell and Northrop Grumman for their role in making nuclear weapons and EADS, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for production of cluster munitions.
386;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2010-01-10T09:32:07Z;Industry eyes lawsuits over pension investment;;"The US mutual fund industry is keeping close tabs on the progress of more than 20 lawsuits that allege companies such as Wal-Mart, Lockheed Martin and Boeing breached their fiduciary duties to employees by choosing funds with unreasonable fees for their retirement plans.The plaintiffs generally claim their employers caused the retirement plans to pay too much for retail mutual funds and failed to take advantage of the large size of their plans to select institutional funds with much lower fees. At the heart of the cases is the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa), the 1974 law that establishes minimum standards for managing pension plans.The cases may be affecting the investment options that companies choose for their retirement plans – a big source of revenue for many fund groups.The lawsuits, many of which make additional claims of revenue-sharing or other conflicts of interest, may also be leading companies to push for lower fees and greater clarity regarding fee arrangements from the fund managers and service providers that run the retirement plans. Such plans are also known as 401(k) plans, drawing their name from a section of the Internal Revenue Code.Most of the cases were filed in 2006 and are just now percolating to the top levels of the legal system. Plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought against farm equipment manufacturer Deere & Co petitioned the Supreme Court for review in November, following a federal appeals court’s dismissal of the case earlier in 2009.“Each year, American employees lose hundreds of millions of dollars due to imprudent selection of investment options with unnecessary fees,” the plaintiffs’ petition says.But in its February decision to dismiss the Deere case, the appeals court ruled that nothing in the law “requires every fiduciary to scour the market to find and offer the cheapest possible fund”.Ken Golden, speaking for Deere & Co, gave no comment, saying: “We don’t provide any comments on litigation that is still active.”While many of the cases do not name as defendants the investment firms managing retirement plan assets, some do.The first of the 401(k) lawsuits to make it to trial claims the Swiss engineering group ABB Inc and two units of Fidelity Investments are fiduciaries of ABB’s employee retirement plans and therefore defendants. (The trial began last week in Kansas City.)Fidelity is arguing that it is not a fiduciary to the plan, according to court documents.“We believe the fees charged and the compensation collected by Fidelity for those services are reasonable,” says Fidelity regarding the case. “We disagree with the claims in the complaint and specifically disagree that the plan has overpaid or that Fidelity has violated any fiduciary duty.”An attorney for the plaintiffs in the case, Jerome Schlichter of Schlichter Bogard & Denton, says it is only the first of several similar cases expected to go to trial this year. Schlichter’s firm initiated the wave of 401(k) excessive-fee lawsuits in 2006; his firm represents plaintiffs in lawsuits brought against multiple companies, including Boeing, Deere & Co, International Paper, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and United Technologies.“Each case is unique on its own facts and has to be considered individually,” says Schlichter.His law firm also won what appears to be the first settlement of such a case when Caterpillar agreed to pay $16.5m (£10.3m, €11.4m) to its retirement plan participants (the tentative settlement must still be approved by district court in Illinois).The manufacturer of construction and mining equipment also agreed to no longer include retail funds as core investment options for a two-year period. The settlement would also require Caterpillar to put out requests for proposal if service contracts come up for renewal.Caterpillar made a “strategic decision to settle” because the litigation could have taken five to seven years, the company said when the tentative settlement was announced.Companies are trying to protect themselves against these lawsuits by increasing disclosure of fees and potential conflicts of interest, as well as gaining greater clarity regarding retirement plan products and services, says Marcia Wagner, founder and principal of the Wagner Law Group, which represents mostly plan sponsors.New lawsuits of this kind may not taper off, however. If more of the 401(k) excessive-fee cases are decided in plaintiffs’ favour, as with recent decisions involving Wal-Mart and Kraft Foods Global, then larger, more prominent law firms may start filing similar lawsuits against companies, says Ms Wagner.The Department of Labor is expected to finalise guidance this year for plan sponsors on additional disclosure requirements to be made to 401(k) participants, which could stem future litigation.“It would seem that once there’s clear guidance out there and plans are following it, it would be much harder to make a claim that Erisa required yet more disclosure on these issues,” says Gary Howell, partner at Katten Muchin.Beagan Wilcox Volz is associate editor at Ignites.com, a Financial Times publication."
387;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;China hits at US missile sales to Taiwan;;China on Thursday denounced the sale of advanced air defence missiles by the US to Taiwan, the first arms deal involving Taipei to be completed under Barack Obama, US president.The US Department of Defense awarded late on Wednesday a $968m (€670m, £605m) contract to Lockheed Martin for 253 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles and related hardware. The deal also included the upgrading of Taiwan’s existing Patriot missile defence system and the sale of spare parts.This came despite US frustration with Taipei’s move to overturn a recently signed trade deal and ­opposition to the sale from Beijing.Jiang Yu, an official at China’s foreign ministry, said Beijing had “already made stern representations to the US side, and we have urged [Washington] to clearly recognise the serious harm caused by arms sales to Taiwan”. Beijing cancelled some military exchanges with Washington last year after George W. Bush, former president, approved the sales as part of a $6.5bn arms package.China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan, has long threatened to use military force against the self-ruled island should it formally declare independence. Taiwan relies on the US for arm sales and as a guarantor of its defence.The Pentagon contract came just days after Taiwan’s parliament voted to block an agreement to further open the island’s market to US beef products. The deal had been reached between Taipei and Washington in October.The vote, which Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwanese president, said reflected public sentiment, provoked an angry response from the US. Demetrios Marantis, deputy US trade representative, said that “the decision by Taiwan authorities to place domestic politics over science raises serious concerns [and] …will also undermine Taiwan’s credibility as a responsible trading partner”. The US also suspended planned trade talks with Taiwan.An official at Taiwan’s defence ministry said the missile sale indicated the beef dispute had not had any impact on defence issues, despite some earlier worries.Cross-strait relations have improved dramatically since Mr Ma became president in 2008, although tensions remain.
388;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-12-11T21:44:36Z;US stocks rise after strong sales data;;US stocks edged higher on Friday after retail sales growth in November proved to have been twice as strong as expected.However, the positive data also sent the dollar higher and raised concerns over future interest rate hikes, containing Wall Street’s gains.After briefly dipping into the red, the S&P 500 regained momentum in the afternoon and closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,106.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 10,471.50 and the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 2,190.31.“The low-rate environment has been the reason to own stocks but people are starting to think twice,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.A stronger dollar and lingering concerns over the sovereign debt of Dubai, Greece and Spain weighed on the market at the beginning of the week.Disappointing sales results from corporate heavyweights also left investors concerned about the pace of economic recovery.Over the week, the S&P was unchanged, the Dow rose 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 0.2 per cent.After last week’s disappointing November sales results from retailers, investors had been nervously awaiting Friday’s reading on the sector.McDonald’s also heightened investor anxieties on Tuesday by reporting its second straight month of sales declines at its US restaurants. The announcement sent its shares down more than 2 per cent.The following day, CKE Restaurants, which owns the Carl’s Jr hamburger chain, lost 3.6 per cent after reporting lower third-quarter profit than had been expected.But Christopher & Banks, the women’s clothing chain, added to Wall Street’s optimism over consumer spending on Friday.Its shares soared 26.9 per cent to $7.64 after the retailer said it expected to make a profit in the third quarter and not a loss as it had previously forecast.Encouraging corporate announcements from manufacturers also buoyed the market.Boeing said it would finally test its 787 Dreamliner jet, which has been facing more than two years of delays. The group’s shares gained 1.1 per cent to $55.60.Meanwhile, Esterline Technologies, which manufactures jet engine parts, said profits had slumped more than 20 per cent in the fourth quarter. However, the results were still better than expected and the group said it expects sales to pick up through the year. Its shares climbed 4.2 per cent to $42.72.United Technologies rose 2.2 per cent to $69.40 after the diversified manufacturer said profit would rise 10 per cent next year.The group said it expected commercial construction to remain weak in the US and Europe but hoped that a year of aggressive cost-cutting would pay off.On Thursday, the company’s shares rose 0.8 per cent after it increased its stake in Clipper Windpower, the British wind turbine manufacturer.NCR, which is best known for its manufacture of ATMs, was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” by JPMorgan, lifting its shares 9.5 per cent to $10.72.Analysts said the group’s acquisition this week of Dvdplay, an operator of 1,300 film rental kiosks, would help the group increase revenues by 5 per cent next year.Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company climbed 1.1 per cent to $76.78 after winning a $318m contract to provide support services in Iraq and Afghanistan.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, bought Sara Lee’s air freshener business, including the Ambi Pur brand, for $470m.While Procter & Gamble edged 0.2 per cent higher to $62.34, Sara Lee also gained 0.2 per cent to $12.21.
389;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-12-10T23:30:41Z;Currencies buoy Ocean Power Technologies;;Currency movements in its favour helped Ocean Power Technologies, which is developing systems to harness wave movement to generate electricity, to cut its interim pre-tax losses from $10m to $7.3m (£4.5m).In October the company announced plans to work with Lockheed to develop wave power systems on a utility scale in the US and an agreement with Idemitsu Kosan, Mitsui and Japan Wind Development to investigate the potential off the coast of Japan.Last month, it added Australia to its potential clients after the government awarded a A$66m (£37m) grant to a partnership between OPT and Leighton to build a 19MW project off the coast of Victoria. The company is building its first 150KW PowerBuoy, which is expected to be deployed in the Orkney Islands.Revenues fell from $2.5m to $1.9m. The basic loss per share was 71 cents (98 cents). The shares rose 5p to 567½p.
390;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-17T19:56:49Z;Dubai air show deals starting to trickle in;;The third day of the Dubai air show ended on Tuesday much as the first two had, with just a handful of extra order announcements from the main aircraft manufacturers, which organisers said brought the total value of air-show deals to $8.3bn.This is a distant cry from the record $155bn in orders seen at the previous show in 2007, before the global recession hit, but better than some had feared given the gloomy sentiment at the Paris air show five months earlier.Boeing made its first aircraft announcement of the show with two Algerian customers: Air Algerie, which ordered seven Boeing B737-800 jets, worth up to $553m at list prices, and Algeria-based Tassili Airlines, which ordered four B737s in a $228m deal first announced earlier this year.Airbus, which announced two deals with Ethiopian Airlines and Yemenia on Monday, said Air Austral, a carrier based in the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion, had confirmed an order for two of its A380 superjumbos and taken an option for two more. The cost would be more than $1bn at list prices.Airbus also announced a memorandum of understanding with Nepal Airlines for a mid-range A320 and a long-haul A330 passenger jet.Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, meanwhile, said it was selling five mid-range E175 aircraft to Muscat-based Oman Air for $177m.Military contractors, however, were as optimistic as ever, hoping that the shift to government spending expected across the region as the private sector holds back amid a recession would be a boon for the defence sector.The ratcheting up of tensions across the Gulf in Iran is continuing to focus regional governments on adapting their military forces.“Iran is the driver,” said one defence contractor based in the region.Another contractor said that the perceived regional threat from the Islamic republic is encouraging a move towards air power and missile defence.The United Arab Emirates is one of only four countries, including Japan, Netherlands and Germany, that have ordered the PAC-3 missile, described by Lockheed Martin as the best defence against ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.Approved by US Congress, Lockheed has yet to deliver the missile defence system but says it is on schedule to meet the UAE’s requirements for setting up the hardware.As tensions increase, others are also talking to Lockheed and rival contractors about boosting their aerial defences. All users of the outdated Patriot system in the region, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, are interested in upgrading, Lockheed says.“There are requests to turn their fleets into smaller, more capable forces – rather than the fleets of big items that are only good for parading up and down the road during national day.”
391;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-16T04:33:18Z;Future technology: Sky is no limit for rapid travel;;Supersonic aircraft projects have generated more words than speed in recent years.There is a precedent – the British and French signed an agreement in 1962 to develop a supersonic airliner but the Mach 2 Concorde did not enter commercial service until 1976.However, a ban on supersonic flight over US territory, which industry insiders insist was prompted by protectionism and was a main reason why only the two flag-carriers operated Concorde, is still shaping the technology of rapid air travel today.Which is one reason why the route to bringing down intercontinental journey times may lie on the edge of the skies.It was two years ago, at the last Dubai airshow, that Aerion opened the order book for its supersonic business jet. Since then it has accumulated “almost 50 orders, valued at over $4bn”, says Brian Barents, vice-chairman of Aerion. “A third come from the Middle East and Asia,” he adds.Aerion, based in Reno, Nevada, is far advanced on a design for an $80m, 8–12 passenger jet capable of Mach 1.6, or twice the speed of most current business jets, and a range of 4,000 nautical miles.The original business plan envisaged building 300 aircraft over 10 years from 2015. But market research being done for the company is expected to say, according to Mr Barents, “that there will be a bigger market than we expected”.The aircraft is designed to be efficient both above and below the speed of sound – 661.5 kts, or 761.2 mph, or 1.225.1 km/h at sea level on a standard day – in order to navigate around existing speed rules. They include the supersonic ban above the US and a Mach 1.15 limit over most other land masses.However, despite orders that have held up during the downturn, and despite planning to use “proven, robust and available” technology,Aerion has still not found an aircraft maker to build it.Other projects, such as the Quiet Supersonic Transport designed by the Lockheed-Martin Skunk Works, concentrated on minimising the sound of the sonic boom.In Europe an EC-mandated €27m ($40m) project led by Dassault Aviation of France has, since 2005, been looking into the feasibility of an 8–16-passenger high-speed aircraft (Hisac) with a transatlantic-plus range, a Mach 1.8 capability and a reduced sonic boom. The aim is for the aircraft to cut journey times by 20 to 50 per cent over current aircraft, operate from small airports, and equal or better current standards on noise and emissions. The research programme is due to be completed by the end of this year.But by the time supersonic jets of this type finally get to the runway they may well have missed their take-off slot. An alternative may come from work done on travel to the edge of space.According to Will Whitehorn, president of Virgin Galactic which has signed up 300 people for its planned $200,000-a-ticket suborbital space flights, technology being developed to take tourists and payloads into space “could eventually be a transportation system to take people around the planet”.Earlier this year Reaction Engines, based in Oxfordshire in the UK, announced a £6m ($10m) research programme into its Sabre engine technology intended to power a reusable spaceship that would take off and land on ordinary runways. The project, which has won a €1m grant from the European Space Agency, will develop an engine that works both within and outside earth’s atmosphere, combining characteristics of jet and rocket engines.The engines hold the key to hypersonic flight, says Mr Whitehorn. “The theory is well understood. Engines could be coming off the stocks in 2014 to 2016.”Reaction Engines has laid down plans, as part of the EU “Lapcat” programme, for a 300-seat aircraft using a derivative of the Sabre engine that would cruise at Mach 5 at an altitude of 82,000 ft, or 25 km – either a half or a quarter of the way to space, depending on which definition you believe.An Aerion’s comparatively modest Mach 1.6 would cut the New York–London journey time from seven and a half hours by conventional jet to just four and a quarter. Hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 would zoom passengers to Sydney from Brussels in four and a half hours.“The output of the exhaust is just water,” says Mark Hempsell, future programmes director at Reaction Engines. “It’s much, much better on emissions than current airliners.”Proving the Sabre engine technology could also would also, if it is engineered to last the thousands of cycles that airliner use demands, open up the prospect of using suborbital trajectories for intercontinental passenger travel.“It is feasible to do suborbital,” says Mr Hempsell. “And it would be a whole lot more environmentally friendly.”Which could mean space moves from being the final frontier, to being a gateway to the other side of our own world.
392;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-11T02:20:52Z;Kewill on acquisition trail;;Kewill, which specialises in software used to track inventory in transit and in warehouses, has raised £7.2m ($12m) net through a placing in order to fund future acquisitions.The company also reported pre-tax profits adjusted for goodwill amortisation up from £2.8m to £3.5m in the first half to September 30.Paul Nichols, chief executive, said opportunities to make bolt-on acquisitions would be enhanced by the new funds.He was also “pretty pleased” with the interim performance of the company in the face of the worst economic recession he had experienced. He was confident that increasing regulation and lengthening supply chains would lead to more demand for its software.The placing was made at 92p a share. The shares, which have recovered from the low of 33½p earlier this year, closed on Tuesday up 6p at 98½p.New contracts won in the half included Nokia, Lockheed and Steinweg, the warehousing group. Total revenues rose 11 per cent to £27.2m, but would have been flat at constant currency rates. Almost two thirds of revenues derived from multi-year maintenance and services contracts.Earnings per share rose from 0.4p to 0.8p, and the interim dividend has been raised 17 per cent to 0.35p.
393;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-10T18:29:54Z;Pakistan in Chinese fighter jet deal;;China has agreed to sell Pakistan at least 36 advanced fighter jets in a deal worth as much as $1.4bn, according to Pakistani and western officials.Beijing will supply two squadrons of the J-10 fighter jet in a preliminary agreement that could lead to more sales, said a Pakistani official. The official said Pakistan might buy “larger numbers” of the multi-role aircraft in the future, but dismissed reports that Islamabad had signed a deal to purchase as many as 150 of the fighter jets.Defence experts described the agreement with China as a landmark event in Pakistan’s defence relationship with the military power. China’s transition from a manufacturer of low-fighters to more advanced jets comparable to some western models is seen as evidence of Beijing’s increasing strategic clout in Asia.“China is developing a real capacity to produce and export its arms. At one point, the Chinese were dependent on imported Russian technology, but obviously China has advanced significantly beyond those days,” said Marika Vicziany, Professor of Asian studies at Monash University in Melbourne.“This agreement should not simply be seen in the narrow context of Pakistan’s relations with China,” said Abdul Qayyum, a retired Pakistani general.“There is a wider dimension. By sharing its advanced technology with Pakistan, China is …also saying to the world that its defence capability is growing rapidly.”China has supplied Pakistan with fighter jets for more than three decades. But Beijing has seldom supplied Pakistan’s air force with advanced fighter aircraft. Islamabad turned to France for Mirage fighter jets in the 1970s and to the US for F-16s in the 1980s.Pakistan has a fleet of 45 F-16s built by Lockheed Martin. The Pakistani air force is using the fighter jet in its campaign against militants in South Waziristan.The US has agreed to sell Islamabad another 18 new F-16s and Pakistani officials also expected the US to supply about a dozen older versions of the aircraft.Over the past decade, China and Pakistan have collaborated on building their first jointly produced advanced fighter jet, known as the JF-17, or “Thunder”. Pakistan is expected to roll out the first domestically built version of the Thunder within weeks.Pakistan’s air force plans to purchase at least 250 of the Thunder fighters over the next four to five years.Experts see the new Pakistani focus on China as evidence that Beijing is trying to expand its military power.“Countries like Iran and possibly some of the Middle Eastern countries would be keen to deal with China if they can find technology which is comparable to the west,” said one western official in Islamabad.“Pakistan will work as the laboratory to try out Chinese aircraft. If they work well with the Pakistani air force, others will follow.”
394;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-09T10:24:27Z;GE scraps ambitious India target;;General Electric India is resetting its targets from the ambitious $8bn in revenue a year goal by 2010 it forecast three years ago as it juggles businesses affected by the global slowdown.Tejpreet Singh Chopra, president and chief executive of GE India, said the group had scaled back some of its businesses, such as unsecured consumer lending and was pushing ahead with others, such as healthcare and bids for government fighter jet and train contracts.“What we did was completely re-evaluate all of our projections,” Mr Chopra said at the World Economic Forum in New Delhi. “There’s been so much volatility.”While he did not provide the new targets, he said the group made $2.6bn in revenue last year and was still “very much growing”.This leaves it well short of the original targets, but the group’s domestic business could still surprise on the upside if several projects suddenly come through.The group is hoping to build a locomotive factory in India and is waiting for a government request for proposal.It is also bidding in the Indian air force’s proposed $10bn contract for a multi-role combat aircraft.The country is seeking to buy 126 of the jet fighters and has begun year-long trials of the aircraft.Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, France’s Dassault Rafale, Lockheed Martin’s F-16, Russia’s Mig-35, Sweden’s Saab JAS-39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon are all vying for the prize contract.GE will be providing engines for the Super Hornet.The group is also pushing into healthcare and expects to be a major provider of gas-fired power plant equipment once India’s new gas field, the KG Basin, hits full production.
395;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-08T18:33:38Z;BAE looks to fighter jets for growth;;At the BAE Systems combat jet production complex at Samlesbury, Lancashire, engineers busy themselves beneath a banner in the main workshed. “F-35 Joint Strike Fighter” it reads, “where our future comes together.”Europe’s biggest defence contractor has invested about £80m in the site, building offices and production sheds for the F-35, the next-generation fighter that it is making with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, the US defence groups.BAE plans to invest 10 times that amount as it works its way to the full production rate of one a day by 2016, gambling that demand for the jet will withstand the coming defence budget cuts and become the key driver of growth.The opportunities are huge. The US and its international partners intend to buy about 3,000 over the next several decades and BAE has 17 per cent of the work, making the aft fuselage and parts of the wing and tail in Samlesbury and key electronics at its plants in the US.The aircraft is moving from development to low-rate production, but until the full revenues filter through, BAE has a 33 per cent workshare on the Eurofighter Typhoon, the European collaborative combat jet, to keep it busy.At the moment, it is assembling about 20 aircraft a year to meet orders from Saudi Arabia and the UK. Analysts expect equipment and support contracts from the oil kingdom alone to bring in revenues of about £29bn up to 2030.Kevin Taylor, managing director of BAE’s Military Air Solutions business, says: “With the Typhoon and the F-35 we have the chance to dominate the sector in the short, medium and longer term.”Expectations within the company are certainly high. In the past year, growth at BAE’s flagship North American armoured vehicles unit has stalled and at its interim results, Ian King, BAE chief executive, said the F-35 and Eurofighter would pick up the slack.Outsiders are equally optimistic. Analysts expect the programmes & support division, which is home to BAE’s MAS unit, to overtake the land & armaments business as the company’s largest next year, earning revenues of about £6.3bn.As of October, the company had already eclipsed its 2008 order intake of £2.2bn, thanks to a contract for a third batch of Eurofighters and a number of long-term support contracts which make up a growing part of the business.Still, the focus on aircraft is not without its costs and risks.In September, BAE said it would cut about 1,100 jobs as it completes legacy aircraft and redeploys its resources. And BAE’s reputation took a blow last week when it was criticised heavily for failings that contributed to the fatal 2006 Nimrod surveillance aircraft disaster.Meanwhile, the US Government Accountability Office, a watchdog, has raised concerns about the plan to run F-35 testing in parallel with production. The fear is that a serious flaw will be found after producing hundreds of aircraft, necessitating an expensive retrofit.BAE’s Mr Taylor points out there are advantages to being a sub-contractor in that regard.His unit, he says, has a “build to print contract” and any changes would be beneficial to BAE at least in the short term.The GAO also notes that delays and technical problems have already caused the likely unit cost of the aircraft to spiral from $69m to $104m, raising questions about whether anyone but the US will be able to afford them.Indeed, there are widespread concerns that even the UK, which is the only level one partner on the project and has already invested heavily in development, may cut its order of 138 aircraft.Chris Addison, a project director on the F-35 programme, argues that the UK orders are marginal given the total US requirement and that BAE’s contract is firm but says that any cuts could weaken the company’s hand.With the US firmly committed, the key challenge for BAE, he says, is managing the production increase effectively. This year, the company will make components for 17 aircraft. Next year, the output will almost double to keep up with the schedule.“That creates a large element of risk but we are doing the most we can to mitigate it,” Mr Addison says. That means investing in plant in advance and improving processes continually. Workers say they have learnt 5,000 lessons from the first production model.Somewhat counter intuitively, Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities, argues that BAE’s current share price, which is down 17 per cent in the year to date, should give investors a degree of comfort.“Clearly there are some risks but the valuation of the shares means they are more than fully discounted already,” Mr Cunningham adds.
396;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-11-06T02:06:14Z;South Africa drops Airbus contract;;South Africa has become the first customer to cancel its order for the A400M military transport aircraft from Airbus, dealing yet another blow to the struggling pan-European aircraft programme.The government said it had no choice but to pull out because of the European aircraft maker’s failure to deliver the aircraft on time and to budget. Since 2005 when the contract was signed, costs have jumped from R17.6bn to over R30bn ($3.9bn).“The cost escalation would have placed an unaffordable burden on the taxpayer at a time when the national [purse] is under pressure due to the economic downturn,” a government spokesman said.“Cabinet believes that the interests of the South African taxpayer will be best served by not proceeding with the contract,” the spokesman said, noting that no penalty fees were expected and that Airbus would have to repay advances of R2.9bn.Airbus said that the decision had taken the company “completely by surprise”, adding that it was premature to comment further “at a time when the programme was really making progress towards the first flight at the end of the year.”Although the termination does not directly impact the core €20bn ($30bn) European collaborative defence procurement programme, it will raise further questions about its viability.The A400M has been in limbo since April when Airbus missed a key deadline to fly the aircraft for the first time, placing it in breach of contract. It is now running about four years late because of problems with the engine software and is costing Airbus €100m a month.Throughout the summer and autumn defence ministers from the original seven partner nations, which are waiting for 180 A400M aircraft in total, have met several times to find a way to rescue the project, without a definite result.The cancellation is also a setback to the company’s export ambitions. Airbus, part of European conglomerate EADS, had been relying on export orders to help the programme break even. It has made €2.3bn of provisions relating to the A400M.Outside of the original partner nations, Malaysia is the only export customer for the A400M, with a standing order for four aircraft. The Airbus spokesman said the company remained “confident the A400m is needed and has great export chances.”Lindiwe Sisulu, South Africa’s defence minister, said that the country was still committed to purchasing new strategic air transport assets, raising the possibility that it might turn to Airbus’s competitors.US companies offer the main alternatives to the A400M. Boeing produces the large but expensive C-17 air transport aircraft while Lockheed Martin makes the smaller C-130 aircraft.
397;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;India plans homegrown aviation sector;;India has strategic ambitions to develop self-reliance in military aviation manufacture as it seeks to modernise its air defence with a $10bn contract for jet fighters, the head of India’s air force said on Tuesday.Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik, the chief of staff of the Indian air force, said India had the intellectual prowess and industrial expertise to grow its own aircraft manufacturing sector. But he acknowledged that it would be a “Herculean task” to wean the country’s military establishment off a heavy reliance on foreign expertise in some of its core competencies.In the coming years, Chief Marshal Naik expected Indian metallurgy, turbine blades, communications, encryption technology and microchips to form a domestic industry that could supply the design, building and service of ­aircraft.India has traditionally turned to Russia for the needs of its air force. The country is seeking to buy 126 jet fighters and has begun year-long trials of the aircraft. Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, France’s Dassault Rafale, Lockheed Martin’s F-16, Russia’s Mig-35, Sweden’s Saab JAS-39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon are all vying for the prize contract.India, one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies, is also one of its biggest arms importers. The government plans to spend more than $30bn (€20bn, £18bn) over the next five years to overhaul its arsenal in the face of possible threats from Pakistan and China.The comments by the head of the air force echo those of senior officers in the navy, which aims to add almost 100 warships to its fleet over the next decade, and develop its own low-cost shipbuilding capabilities.Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, the director of the Centre for Air Power Studies, told the Financial Times that he foresaw Indian participation in the upgrading of existing aircraft rising rapidly over the next 15 years to between 50 per cent to 70 per cent, with greater Indian design and joint research and development.In 40 years, with the introduction of a new generation of aircraft, he said that could rise to 80 per cent.In the meantime, India faced the choice of joining the US and Europe as a partner in defence manufacture or teaming up in an eastern triumvirate with China and Russia, Air Commodore Singh said.Some analysts have been encouraged by the achievements of India’s space programme as evidence that it has the ability to develop a larger aviation industry. Last year India sent a rocket to orbit the moon and has developed considerable expertise in satellite launches.But some industry executives say the country is lagging far behind neighbouring China in its technological support for commercial and military aircraft in spite of sizeable orders from Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher for new fleets.“The [Indian] aerospace industry is not at all energised. It is a bit [active] in space, but it’s not energised in defence or commercial areas,” Arunakar Mishra, the chief executive of Bangalore-based Genser Aerospace and Information Technologies, said.“People coming out of the Indian air force help foreigners to sell equipment to India [and don’t develop local capacity].”
398;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-10-27T10:36:25Z;In praise of committees;;"In 1927, when Charles Kettering, then head of research at General Motors, was told that Charles Lindbergh had just flown across the Atlantic alone, he responded: “That’s nothing, let him try it with a committee.”Committees are often despised by business leaders, who can see them adding complexity, wasting time and diluting insight.Yet Cisco Systems, one the world’s most admired companies and once the most highly valued company on the planet, runs itself through multiple committees. CEO John Chambers recently said on CNBC that the company’s committee structure is the “model for business going forward”.How can this be: the dreaded committee, an effective leadership tool? As Mr Chambers told equity analysts, “These structures …allow speed, scale, flexibility, and rapid replications.”Of course, Cisco itself produces many of the technologies – such as videoconferencing – that make can make committees more effective, especially over long distances.The Economist noted in August that, “[Chambers] wants Cisco to become the main supplier of the essential elements of an increasingly connected economy, and to be a shining corporate example of how to use them. It should provide not only the tools of the company of the future, but also its organisational model”.Cisco’s committee system has been both lauded and ridiculed. Last year, Ellen McGirt wrote a supportive article in Fast Company, “How Cisco’s CEO John Chambers is Turning the Tech Giant Socialist”. The article asserted that Mr Chambers was empowering his staff. It missed the irony that the tendency to committee-led bureaucracy ultimately stifled socialism to death.Two weeks ago, Lex also wrote critically of Cisco: “The company is in the middle of a structural reorganisation that has created a proliferation of committees – not typically a form of management associated with clear thinking and swift movement.”The fiercest attack, however, came from former equity analyst Henry Blodget on his Silicon Alley Insider blog: “John [Chambers] says the new management structure is necessary if Cisco is to keep growing at an impressive rate (right now, it’s shrinking at 17%). This is also John’s justification for moving Cisco into wacky new business lines, like camcorders and giant TVs. We don’t mean to be rude, but these ideas sound awful. If this is what it takes to keep Cisco growing at an impressive rate, then the hell with growth. Here’s another idea: Instead of moving Cisco into crazy new consumer business lines and forcing all of its senior managers to waste a third of their time sitting on committees, just break the company up.”So why all the negativity about Cisco’s committees?According to Mycommittee.com: “A committee is a group of people trying to accomplish something (the purpose) that cannot be better accomplished otherwise.” It seems fairly simple.Defending the new structure on Cisco’s own blog pages, Randy Pond wrote: “As the EVP of Operations, Processes, and Systems, I spend time daily in both the Council & Board world as well as my traditional functional role. And that’s because it can’t be just one or the other. What we’re doing at Cisco is tapping the best of both management approaches …The Council & Board structure enables us to quickly bring together the functional teams to develop a solution …or go after a market.”Pond’s view is that the formal structure consisting of traditional functional roles only works in Cisco’s informal culture because of the additional layering of the committee structure.The Cisco system works in part because, as the Economist explained, “How well managers do in teams determines 30% of their bonuses. There have been casualties: whereas those who work well with others have been promoted, lone fighters have been pushed out.” As most business leaders know, you tend to get the behaviour you pay for.Perhaps Cisco’s mistake was to mislabel their organisational process. Maybe they should have given it a cooler name, like a “Skunk Works”. Then many of the apprehensions about their ability to drive innovation through small non-bureaucratic, cross-functional teams might disappear.In the book Organizing Genius, Warren Bennis and Patricia Biederman described the first skunk works set up by employees at Lockheed Martin to develop a fighter plane to take on the Luftwaffe during the second world war. “Arguing that it was the only way to get the job done and done quickly, [Kelly] Johnson persuaded his Lockheed bosses to let him create a top-secret department within the company staffed by a small group of handpicked engineers and mechanics …a hush-hush experimental operation that side-stepped the corporate bureaucracy and was beholden only to Lockheed’s top management and its customers,” they wrote.The skunk works concept was hugely successful and was later used to design the U2 spy plane and the stealth fighter. Today, Skunk Works can be created in any company to focus on innovation outside the formal structure. Lockheed’s original 1943 Skunk Works, named because of its proximity to a malodorous factory, does not sound so different from Cisco’s 2009 councils and committees.Innovation guru, Scott Anthony wrote on Harvard Business Review’s Innovation Insights blog: “Remember, when you are innovating the only thing you can be sure of is your first idea is wrong. Cisco’s innovative organisational approach is certainly wrong along some critical dimension. If the company learns how its approach is wrong and adjusts accordingly, it could turn the committee approach into a game-changing management innovation.”If John Chambers wants other companies to adopt his organisational model, and buy the Cisco products and services to support it, then he will need to develop new language to describe the model.

399;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-10-22T13:24:40Z;Raytheon bullish after strong earnings;;Raytheon, the US defence contractor, reported strong third-quarter earnings and made confident forecasts for growth in 2010, shrugging off concerns about slowing government spending.Next year, the company expects sales to grow by up to 6 per cent to as much as $26.4bn while full-year adjusted earnings per share could increase by up to 13 per cent to as much as $4.90 per share, just shy of analyst estimates.“Our technology and innovative solutions are well aligned with our US and international customers’ evolving priorities,” said William Swanson, Raytheon’s chairman and chief executive.The company has consistently argued that its large exposure to foreign markets– around 20 per cent of sales come from exports – and myriad of small programmes should insulate it from any drop off in US defence spending or programme cuts.“This was another high-quality quarter from a high-quality company,” said Rob Stallard of Macquarie Research.“Looking at the company’s backlog, the company’s diversified defence portfolio seems to be holding up relatively better than expected despite the numerous programme cancellations.”Earlier in the week, Lockheed Martin posted estimate-beating third-quarter results but said earnings could decline in 2010 after the government decided to cut several key programmes including the VH-71 presidential helicopter.The world’s biggest missile maker by revenues said that net income rose 15 per cent to $490m over the three months to the end of September 2009 on revenues up 6 per cent to $6.2bn.Those numbers, and a further $300m of share buy backs helped Raytheon earn $1.25 per share in the third quarter compared to $1.01 in the same period last year, well above analyst expectations for $1.16 a share.In its underlying business, the technical services unit was the stand-out performer. Third-quarter sales rose 16 per cent to $797m thanks to strong growth in its training and air traffic control contracts, while operating income soared 33 per cent to $60m.Integrated Defense Systems also performed well, generating third-quarter revenues of $1.4bn, up 9 per cent compared to 2008, largely due to strong sales of Patriot missiles in the international market.During the quarter, Raytheon, like its peers, made substantial contributions to its pension schemes to reduce unfunded liabilities. The cash injections bring the total top-ups to $1.1bn this financial year but Raytheon remains in a net cash position.Raytheon also raised it full-year guidance and now expects 2009 sales growth of around 6 per cent to 8 per cent and earnings per share growth of between 16 per cent and 19 per cent, compared to 2008.In pre-market trading, Raytheon shares, which have added about 10 per cent over the last six months, rose 0.8 per cent to $45.55.
400;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-10-20T20:48:06Z;Weak economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities fell on Tuesday, with indices pulling back from their highest levels in more than a year as traders focused on weak economic data rather than higher-than-expected earnings, including impressive figures from Apple and Caterpillar.Optimism that equities would post a second day of gains this week on strong earnings fizzled out when data on new residential construction showed a smaller- than-expected rise in September and the producer price index unexpectedly dropped during the month.The S&P 500 lost 0.6 per cent to 1,091.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.5 per cent lower at 10,041.48 and Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent at 2,163.47. On Monday, all three indices touched their highest levels in a year and the S&P traded above 1,100.The weaker-than-expected data weighed on homebuilders’ stocks and fuelled uncertainty about the lingering effects of the financial crisis and economic recession. “Housing is the epicentre of this whole crisis,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “So, anything to do with housing matters.”Mr Stone said that, after the rally in stocks over the past few weeks in anticipation of a strong earnings season, Tuesday’s declines also represent a pause for the results to catch up with those rosy expectations.Nonetheless, many earnings reports have provided evidence to support an economic rebound.“All the key bellwethers – Google, Intel, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and now Apple – have been really strong,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “That is what we were hoping to see. That is what will give us some confidence that the cycle is turning.”After the close of trading on Monday, Apple saw profit jump to a record $1.67bn, or $1.82 a share, from $1.14bn or $1.26 a share, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.42. Its shares rose 4.7 per cent to $198.76 and had traded near the all-time high of $202.96 hit in December of 2007. Caterpillar, maker of construction and farming equipment, on Tuesday announced third-quarter earnings of 64 cents per share, down from the third quarter of 2008, but a massive jump on analysts’ forecast of just 6 cents a share.Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive, offered an upbeat outlook. “We believe the third quarter marked the low point for Caterpillar sales and revenues in what has been the toughest recession since the 1930s. We are seeing encouraging signs that indicate a recovery may be under way.”Caterpillar shares ended up 3 per cent to $59.61.Pfizer said third-quarter revenue fell 3 per cent to $11.6bn versus the same quarter a year ago, but it still beat consensus estimates of $11.4bn, and its profit rose. Shares rose 0.3 per cent at $17.93, paring earlier gains. Lexmark, which makes printers, rose 16 per cent to $26.16 after better than expected revenue and profit.Shares in Lockheed Martin were down 6.5 per cent to $71.99. The world’s largest defence contractor, said that its third-quarter profit rose by 1.9 per cent as it enjoyed stronger sales of electronics and aeronautics, but it projected that earnings would drop next year.Net income at Lockheed rose to $797m, or $2.07 a share, from $782m, or $1.92 a share, in the same quarter a year ago, beating expectations of $1.82 a share.Coca-Cola was off 1.3 per cent at $54.07 after its quarterly revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations and the soft drinks maker warned that economic conditions would continue to weigh on consumers. Net revenues fell 4 per cent to $8.04bn versus analysts’ forecasts for $8.11bn. Coca-Cola reported earnings of $1.9bn or 81 cents a diluted share, unchanged from the same quarter last year.Boeing dropped 2.9 per cent to $51.89 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underperform from equal weight and cut the target price to $43 from $50 on concerns about further delays on the 787, negative 2010 cash flow and poor aircraft order demand.Boston Scientific lowered its guidance for full-year net sales, prompting a 15.7 per cent drop in its shares to $8.57. After the close, Yahoo! reported a strong increase in third-quarter profit. Shares rose 1 per cent in after hours trade.
401;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed Martin quarterly profits up 1.9%;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, said on Tuesday that its third quarter profits rose by 1.9 per cent as it saw stronger sales of electronics and aeronautics, but the company projected that earnings would slump next year.Net income at Lockheed rose to $797m, or $2.07 a share, from $782m, or $1.92 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. The results beat analysts’ expectations that the Maryland-based company would earn $1.82 a share.Revenues at Lockheed also surpassed expectations, rising by 4.53 per cent to $11.6bn. Sales were up in its electronics, aeronautics and space systems divisions.”Our third quarter results keep the corporation on track to achieve full year 2009 operational and financial commitments,” Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin’s chief executive, said in a statement. ”Our diverse portfolio of programs is well positioned to provide critical, global security solutions to our customers as we support their changing programme priorities and generate shareholder value.”Lockheed has been under pressure due to uncertainty over the how the US defence budget will fare in the future after the US pulls out of recession. However, in September, Robert Gates, US defence secretary, said that Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet was a “major leadership priority” for the military.The company projected earnings per share of between $7.15 and $7.35 for this year but offered a lower estimate of $7.05 to $7.25 for its 2010 outlook.Shares of Lockheed rose by 6.49 per cent to $71.91 on Tuesday.
402;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-10-13T17:06:27Z;Ocean Power Technologies in Lockheed deal;;"Ocean Power Technologies has taken a step towards volume production of its PowerBuoys by signing an engineering agreement with Lockheed Martin.The announcement is the third this month from the Aim-quoted company, which is developing systems that harness wave movement through offshore buoys in order to generate electricity. It will work with Lock heed to develop wave power systems on a utility scale. It envisages a 10MW power station covering 30 acres off the US west coast.Lockheed will provide expertise in systems integration, lean manufacturing, and analysis. Mark Draper, OPT chief executive, said Lockheed would “add significant value to OPT’s overall delivery capability”, while Rich Lockwood of Lockheed said working with OPT’s “impressive technology” would help the US achieve energy independence through renewable resources.Last week OPT signed an agreement to investigate the potential for wave power generation off the coast of Japan. It will look for suitable sites in conjunction with Idemitsu Kosan, the energy company; Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding; and Japan Wind Development.A fortnight ago it announced a $2.4m contract with the US Navy, which is developing systems powered by buoys in order to enhance the protection of US ports from terrorist attack. The contract marks the start of a proposed $15m four-year project, and follows an earlier deal with the US Navy to develop deep water data gathering systems.The shares rose 12½p to close at 342½p on Tuesday."
403;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-10-11T21:40:31Z;Gilead tops list for best investor value;;"In a volatile decade for the corporate world and its investors, Gilead Sciences, Apple and British American Tobacco stood out for their performances, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.The three companies top the list for creating the most value for their shareholders relative to peers that trade on the same home stock market.Gilead, the US medical device company, posted a total return more than 36 per cent better than the average listing, BCG said.Something that was more remarkable was that the company outperformed the market every year from 1999-2008.Apple, maker of the ubiquitous iPod music device and other consumer electronics, produced a total return 25 per cent better than that of the average company.BAT, a consumer goods company, boasted a return of almost 18 per cent above its local market average, according to BCG.There were four mining and materials companies, including Brazil’s Vale and BHP Billiton of Australia, and four medical technology manufacturers within the top 25.Although some of the top performers clearly benefited from some of the decade’s sweeping trends – for example, globalisation and rising commodity prices – the list’s overall diversity suggest there is more than one way to generate consistently good returns for investors.“When you get to top ranks, the secular trends don’t matter as much,” said Eric Olsen, a senior partner at BCG and one of the study’s authors.“It’s what you do with your company’s strategy, your capital deployment and your management agenda,” Mr Olsen added.Utilities such as Exelon of the US and Germany’s Eon found spots on the Top 25 list, as did mature industrial companies, including Lockheed Martin, Schlumberger and United Technologies.McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble also made the list.Mr Olsen and his co-authors’ study will be released on Tuesday.They observed that the decade’s most successful companies often took one of four pathways.They each delivered sales growth well above their home country’s gross domestic product; they churned out enough cash to appease investors; they transformed their portfolio of businesses through a series of timely acquisitions and divestitures; or they simply found a combination of ways to exceed shareholders’ expectations consistently.Gilead and Apple benefited from surging demand for their products, while the renewed focus of McDonald’s on boosting margins even as growth slowed rewarded investors with a total return of 7.9 per cent above the market average, Mr Olsen said.Of course, the Top 25 companies now have more in common than just an impressive 10-year total return: they face the daunting task of remaining at the head of the ranking for the next decade, he said.“It’s a matter of being able to beat expectations continuously,” Mr Olsen said.“That’s hard to do.”"
404;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-09-15T17:12:01Z;BAE to axe 1,116 as key work runs out;;BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, plans to close one site and cut 1,116 jobs as key aircraft manufacturing and upgrade contracts run down over the next few years.BAE will begin consultations to shut its site in Woodford, Cheshire, which is set to complete its major contract, the MRA4 replacement for the current Nimrod maritime reconnaissance fleet, at the end of 2012. Some 630 staff will lose their jobs.The Nimrod programme initially envisaged making 21 aircraft but the order was cut to 12, shortening the production run, after crippling technical problems caused almost £800m of budget overruns and eight years of delays.A further 486 jobs will be lost at Samlesbury, Warton and Farnborough as BAE finishes off manufacturing and upgrade contracts on the Tornado and Harrier jets and concludes orders for Spirit AeroSystems.Kevin Taylor, managing director of military air solutions at BAE, said the company had “to ensure we are the right size and shape to remain competitive and meet our customers’ requirements in the future”.Bernie Hamilton, a national officer with Unite union, which represents many of the affected workers, said he was “disappointed” but not surprised by the cuts, which have been on the table since 2003.He added that compulsory redundancies might be avoided by transferring staff within BAE. The company is ramping up production capacity in some parts of its Samlesbury site, where it will help produce the F-35 combat jet, built in partnership with Lockheed Martin, which has 3,000 orders.Mr Hamilton said the union would also press the government to extend production at Woodford by awarding BAE a contract to replace the Royal Air Force fleet of R1 reconnaissance aircraft.The news from the defence sector was not all bad. In a surprise move, the government abandoned plans to cut 125 jobs at missile ranges in the Outer Hebrides, operated by the defence research company Qinetiq, as part of a modernisation programme targeting £40m in cost savings.Jim Murphy, the Scottish secretary, said the government had reversed course because of the devastating impact the job losses were likely to have on the fragile communities of South Uist and Benbecula.For the most part, defence manufacturers have weathered the economic downturn better than their commercial peers, but delays in the letting of key contracts by the Ministry of Defence and pressure on public budgets have taken their toll. In April, BAE Systems said it would close three sites and cut 500 jobs.
405;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;Lockheed Martin: The move from reactive to predictive;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence contractor, looks well-placed to play a lucrative role in countering the escalating threat of cybercrime, cyber terror and cyber warfare.As the leading IT provider to the US federal government for the past 15 years, the company has been to the fore, as the need for sophisticated security systems has become more urgent.The company employs 144,000 people on some of the most sensitive government projects around the world and protecting its own computer networks means the problem is not just one for customers.“We’ve been looking at this a long time, before it was called cyber security,” says Charlie Croom, a former head of the US government’s Defense Information Systems Agency who joined Lockheed last year to shape its cyber strategy. “IT security has been a way of life for us. We need to keep our own programmes sound and it is embedded in the work we do for our customers.”The threat has reached such a pitch that Barack Obama, the US president, has made it a policy priority. McAfee, the IT security specialist, estimates that 8,000 variants of malicious software are created every day, double the rate seen last year.Market estimates of how much the US plans to spend in this area vary widely, though the highest predicts it could reach $55bn in the next six years.Lockheed has been increasing its research and development spending to deal with the threat.In May last year, it set up a Security Intelligence Center to defend the company’s internal infrastructure. And a year ago, at the same time as Mr Croom’s arrival, it created a Center for Cyber Security Innovation to co-ordinate internal development. The company wants knowledge to be shared across the business, with the protection of information systems equally critical for weapons programmes, such as F35 and F22 fighter jets, its military satellites and to safeguard supply chains.In November, the company will launch a cyber innovation and technology centre to work closely with customers. This will include a ”cyber range” to test various scenarios of coming under attack. The company has a contract for the initial development phase to help build a separate range for the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.Mr Croom says the biggest problem is finding a way to predict attacks, rather than reacting to them. This is crucial as data banks grow ever more vast and the scale and variation of assaults increases exponentially.“There is a tremendous burden on the defender,” he says. “We are thinking about how to deal with unknown things: how do you defend against the unknown threat, how do you go from reactive to predictive?”New systems will need to rely on artificial intelligence to seek out automatically the most subtle changes in data patterns and “take the human out of the loop”.The company has been providing cyber security support to a number of UK organisations, including GCHQ, the British government’s listening station.In the US, Lockheed is also involved in what it calls cyber security “offence”, an important area, as state actors such as China and Russia develop advanced cyber warfare techniques – though the company is unable to talk about its classified work.It also works for US security agencies, as well as on IT systems for the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration. Mr Croom says the company’s expertise in defending large and sensitive networks leaves it well-placed to seek opportunities in non-government areas such as protecting power grids for energy companies or healthcare databases.Lockheed is working with other technology companies such as Cisco, McAfee and EMC on ways of stopping cyber criminals from targeting the vulnerable “gaps” between home desktops, computer networks and data centres. It describes the approach as providing the “secret glue”, an approach in keeping with its “systems integrator” business model.

407;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;Unmanned ground vehicles: Robots sidle into the limelight;;Last week the US army base at Fort Hood, Texas hosted its first Robotics Rodeo. Fifty companies signed up for the mechanical equivalent of a beauty pageant. They handed their contraptions over to the troops to crash them through obstacle courses, all to win the approving eye of the US military.The aim was to encourage researchers to get their products out of the laboratory and on to the proving grounds. As Lieutenant General Lynch, commander of III Armored Corps and the organiser of the event, said at a recent conference: “If you are not fielding you are failing.”That transition is now happening. While unmanned aerial vehicles have stolen the limelight in Iraq and Afghanistan, their terrestrial equivalents have played an increasingly important role. Since operations began, more than 6,000 unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been bought and deployed.So far the major role of the UGV has been in helping to detect and respond to roadside bombs. According to the US Department of Defense, as of the end of 2008, bomb disposal robots had conducted more than 30,000 missions, and detected or neutralised over 15,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs).This activity has brought welcome funding and attention to the industry, benefiting niche companies such as iRobot and Foster-Miller. The US plans to spend around $1.3bn on buying, operating and improving UGVs this year although that will drop to about $800m next year.Qinetiq, the defence research company that purchased Foster-Miller in 2004, has sold more than 2,800 of its Talon robots to the US military, which uses them for explosive ordnance disposal and reconnaissance.The company is particularly proud of one robot that has been hit, repaired and sent back to the frontlines 19 times and remains in service. “Every time a bomb damages a robot, that is a life saved,” says Simon Christoforato, business group manager for robotic systems at Qinetiq.The success of bomb disposal robots has encouraged industry to look at other “dirty, dull and dangerous” tasks where UGVs could play a role. Qinetiq for example, is pioneering the commercial use of robots. This year it signed a deal with Network Rail, the UK government-owned operator, to provide a team of robots to respond to fires.Within the military, plans for UGVs are ambitious. A DoD roadmap, released in 2009, sketched out a number of areas where robots could be used. Examples include robots to survey the battlefield, small trucks to carry soldier’s rucksacks and equipment and, potentially, armed robots.Moreover the Pentagon remains committed to a 2001 target, set by Congress, for unmanned vehicles to make up about one-third of the total fleet by 2015. The DoD is unlikely to meet those goals, but it is far closer than anyone could have predicted says Kyle Snyder, of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International.“It’s been said that UGVs are roughly where UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were 15 years ago,” he says. “But it won’t take 15 years for UGVs to catch up. The success of UAVs shows the markets are there. And there are more commercial opportunities for ground vehicles because they can be integrated with daily life. Everyone owns a car.”The biggest challenge is to design platforms that are autonomous and capable of seeing, understanding and interacting instinctively with a complex environment, says Mr Snyder. At present, the value of UGVs is limited because bomb disposal robots, for example, require an operator to guide and control their movements, which uses up scarce manpower.Building a vehicle that can drive itself and perform tasks without a “man in the loop” however, poses considerable difficulties. While the air environment is relatively uncluttered, on the ground, the terrain is varied and the interactions with people and objects are complex and hard to model.When the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency organised its first “Grand Challenge”, a 150- mile course for UGVs through the Mojave Desert, in 2003, not one of the entries finished. Subsequent contests have produced better results, but obstacles remain.These include insufficient computing power, inadequate algorithms and the shortness of battery life, says Mark Oldham, an engineering manager at Marshall, the aerospace and defence company, which won the UK’s “Grand Challenge” in 2008 as part of Team Stellar.Since the contest, Team Stellar has won two follow-on contracts to develop its platform, which combines UAVs and UGVs and clever software to automatically independently identify threats including roadside bombs. Peter Callaghan, chief executive of Marshall’s land systems division, says a system could be ready for testing in theatre by the end of the year.But in the short term, military and industry are focusing on more modest, intermediate steps. That means semi-autonomous vehicles able to follow soldiers and carry their heavy kit. BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and Marshall, are all developing similar systems.“Robots will not bring about an age of ‘bloodless’ solutions to every challenge the army will face in future,” the US Army’s leading robot researchers wrote in March. “But they can offer US forces operational advantages in contemporary and future environments.”
408;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-09-08T02:10:23Z;Industry redraws its battleplan for a new era;;Over the past year defence stocks have taken a beating. In the US, Lockheed Martin shares are down 40 per cent while Northrop Grumman has lost almost 30 per cent of its value. In Europe, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica shares have fallen by similar amounts.Valuations have been hit even harder with forward price-to-earnings multiples, a measure of investor appetite for a stock, dropping to just under nine times 2010 earnings, their lowest levels since the early 1990s.Back then the falls presaged a brutal period for the defence industry. With the cold war at an end, US spending on defence fell by more than half leading to a wave of consolidation and savage cuts in employment.Investors fear a repeat performance and some analysts say, with good reason. In the UK, where the equipment programme is already widely regarded as underfunded, spending is likely to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent according to some estimates as the Treasury seeks to address huge public deficits.The government has promised a foreign policy led defence review next year, but when it arrives drastic equipment cuts are likely to steal the limelight. Two aircraft carriers could be reduced to one while an upgrade to the Trident nuclear deterrent could be postponed.“It is clear that there is a black hole in the defence budget,” a recent report led by two prominent British politicians concluded. “[The government] should explore all viable options for capability downgrading and quantity reductions as well as for complete cancellation of some equipment programmes.”But while damaging for the UK defence capability, any cuts may in fact have only a limited impact on UK defence companies, says Sandy Morris, an aerospace and defence analyst with RBS and a long-time observer of the sector.“Industry by and large has long since decided that we have a Mickey Mouse defence policy and has fled [to the US]. Even fairly significant cuts in the UK are barely going to have a material impact on BAE Systems, Cobham and Ultra Electronics.”The picture in the US also looks challenging though. The core US defence budget will edge towards $600bn a year but the supplemental budgets, which fund current operations, will decline sharply as the US winds down in Iraq and wages a more limited campaign in Afghanistan.As a result the total US spend on research and new procurement will fall about $45bn from its 2008 peak by 2010, equivalent to more than two times the entire Navy shipbuilding budget, according to Marty Bollinger, head of the defence practice at Booz & Company. He believes total investment spending could drop by 40 per cent in real terms over the next three years. That could lead to a radical shake-up of the sector.In the 1990s, the industry reduced capacity through a wave of mergers, but with so few players left that is no longer an option. Instead, traditional contractors will lose market share to “disruptive companies” that offer good-enough but not “exquisite” products.Mr Bollinger expects companies such as Eurocopter, the helicopter group owned by EADS, to do well by taking advantage of its global scale and ability to adapt commercial products to military uses at good prices.Defence companies are also likely to focus on providing support services, such as repairs and training, for the military as US spending on operations and maintenance overtakes the investment budget for the first time.Not everyone expects such a dramatic change. Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities, sees the recent share price movements as yet another example of investors looking to profit from an upturn in the economy by buying cyclical stocks.Underlying trading, he argues, has remained strong. In the first half most defence companies produced solid results, generating cash and building order books. A constant refrain was that programme cuts in some areas had resulted in gains in other areas.At BAE Systems, for example, Ian King, chief executive, noted that a slowdown in demand for its heavily armoured vehicles would probably be offset by a pick-up in combat aircraft sales as production of the F-35, America’s newest combat jet, ramps up.Certain areas of the budget will grow even as total spending declines.The quadrennial review, due shortly, will probably confirm the US administration’s intention to shift funds from expensive platforms such as the F-22 stealth fighter jet to support “irregular” warfare and current operations.In preparation for the emerging trends, global defence companies have been scooping up midsized suppliers with products aimed at defence electronics, unmanned aerial vehicles and cybersecurity.In one of the larger deals this year, General Dynamics, best known for its armoured vehicles, bought Axsys Technologies, a maker of sensors and cameras for the military, for $643m.Foreign sales are another potential bright spot. According to Frost & Sullivan, the consultancy, in the next 10 years India will spend $100bn on equipment while Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries are increasing their spending on defence.For all the talk of budget cuts, Alberto De Benedictis, chief executive of Finmeccanica UK, argues that countervailing pressures will make it hard for governments to reduce defence spending, regardless of their financial position.“In the 1990s there was a clear change in the global strategic scenario, but this time round there is no such change. The threats remain the same. What we do have is a period of budget constraint.”Afghanistan for example, could flare up at any time, requiring greater expenditures. In recent days Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted the situation was “serious and it is deteriorating” adding to the clamour for more troops.Still, Mr Bollinger worries that the fat years and the inevitable time lag between cuts at the policy level and the impact on the industrial base have made executives slow to recognise the scale of the challenges ahead.“The scale of the downturn is going to be of the same magnitude as in the 1990s, so why would you expect to see a different outcome?” he asks.
409;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-06-14T23:47:15Z;US plays for fighter domination;;Outside the imagination of small children, the world’s most advanced fighter aircraft rarely face off against one another. But some of the leading jets are doing just that in a battle as brutal as anything seen on the front lines – the competition to be selected as the next generation of combat aircraft.From Brazil to Switzerland, governments are pitting US, European and Russian jets against one another and the stakes are high – nothing less than survival for their makers.At present there are eight fighter production lines in Europe and America. By 2020, experts suggest that only one will remain and famous names such as Dassault, Saab and Boeing could be out of the market altogether.The winners will gain access to orders for as many as 3,345 fighter aircraft, worth more than $164bn by 2017, according to Forecast International, a research company.Ageing fleets of aircraft designed and bought during the Cold War are reaching the limits of their endurance. At the same time, next-generation fighters are finally reaching maturity, leading to a ready supply.Then too the rise of the Bric countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – has given a new set of nations the ambition to upgrade their fleets and the spending power to do so. Two of the most hotly followed contests are taking place in Brazil and India, where the governments intend to purchase 36 and 126 aircraft respectively.The $300bn gorilla in the room, however, is the US’s F-35. Its three variants are set to be the mainstay of the US air force, navy and marines. The US plans to order almost 2,500 over the next 25 years, giving its maker Lockheed Martin massive advantages of scale. The F-35 was designed with exports in mind. It is being built in partnership with eight nations and Lockheed eventually expects countries including Italy, Australia and Turkey to order about 730 aircraft. Japan, Israel and Singapore are also likely to adopt it.Still, concerns about dependence on the US for technical know-how and spares have opened up some breathing space for rivals.Saab of Sweden is pitching its single-engine Gripen as a short term, low-cost option for countries such as Switzerland and Romania, while offering a more advanced Next Generation model to Brazil and Norway – nations with a bit more in their wallet.Waiting in the wings is Boeing with its tried and tested F-15E Strike Eagle and its F/A18 E/F Super Hornet. David Schweppe, who leads business development for Boeing’s global strike systems unit, argues that the jets’ long years of service, huge installed base and high levels of customer satisfaction give it an edge.Should the F-35 scoop up all the export orders it is negotiating however, the result would be striking, says Bill Sweetman, editor of Defense Technology International.“The US, with the F-35, is playing for world domination,” Mr Sweetman says. “By 2020, only the winner of the Indian deal will likely still be in production.”The Rafale, a twin-engine multi-role fighter made by Dassault of France, was booted from the Indian competition in April. It has since clawed its way back into contention thanks to some careful diplomatic pressure.That is all too common in the labyrinthine process of fighter selection, where politics often trumps price and performance says Andrew Brookes, an aerospace analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Indeed, the consortium behind the Eurofighter Typhoon, Europe’s collaborative fighter effort, believes its trump card in India, Japan and elsewhere is its willingness to let local companies participate in the development and assembly of any aircraft.“If we’re lucky, we’ll get the Indians to take maybe 40 Eurofighters,” one senior German official told the FT. The remaining order is expected to go to the US.In Brazil, on the other hand, politics could give the edge to France’s Rafale over the F/A-18 and the Gripen. The French government agreed to help Brazil build a nuclear submarine and its Rafale is suitably high-status.But, with the F-35 in the middle of flight testing, time may be running out for some of its competitors.The Eurofighter is reasonably secure, with about 620 orders already booked, giving it a solid production base until 2018.Dassault and Saab are in a more precarious position. The Rafale has yet to make a single foreign sale, while the Gripen has only a limited domestic market in Sweden to rely on Worse still, as doubts about their future grows, potential buyers become even more reluctant.
410;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-06-11T21:44:39Z;Sarkozy and Merkel call for further six months on A400M project;;Partner nations involved in the fraught A400M military transport plane project need a further six months to agree how to rescue it, according to the leaders of France and Germany.Nicholas Sarkozy, French president, said that he and Angela Merkel, German chancellor, had “decided that it would be good to give ourselves about six more months to continue discussions to find the best solution possible”.Ms Merkel echoed the remarks, telling reporters “we are in complete agreement. We will give ourselves a few months and then we’ll see.”The original contract for the A400M, which is being built by Airbus, a division of EADS, was signed in 2003 and envisaged the delivery of 180 aircraft to seven partner nations starting in 2009.But the €20bn ($28bn) project is running three years late and billions of euros over budget. It has been marred by technical problems and a fixed-price contract that shifts responsibility for delays to EADS.In April, the partner nations and Occar, the European procurement agency, agreed to a three-month moratorium in order to renegotiate the project.Should the governments fail to reach agreement and cancel the project, EADS could be forced to return €5.7bn in pre-payments.Even with a longer period of discussion, analysts believe that aligning customer requirements will be challenging.“It is hard to see why all the nations would agree to pay more money for a less capable plane [than initially proposed],” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities. “And the British, with their current budget pressure, might say ‘no’ altogether.”An MoD spokesperson said the UK government was committed to the original timeline and that “a decision is expected to be reached before the end of the current moratorium on the future of the A400M programme” at the end of June.Decisions to extend any grace period require the consent of all parties.For EADS, the Franco-German proposal holds out the potential of giving it more time to provide detail on time frames and costings to the partners.To date the company has committed to undertaking a first flight around the end of the year and beginning deliveries three years later.“This is a matter for Occar in discussions with both the UK government and the other A400M customer nations,” a company spokesman said.The A400M is Europe’s biggest collaborative defence programme.As the timeline for deliveries has been pushed back, the UK and France have looked at measures to fill the capability gap. Options include buying or leasing the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules or the Boeing C-17.In addition to Germany, France and the UK, the A400M project’s participants are Spain, Turkey, Belgium and Luxembourg.
411;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-05-27T21:12:17Z;Defence industry looks to cross borders;;Mark Elliott is an experienced executive who has spent more than 30 years running businesses all over the world for IBM. He is also a US citizen. Last week he was appointed to the board of Qinetiq, a FTSE 250 company, and earmarked to take over as chairman next year.For a bank or an energy company in today’s globalised world, the move would not be surprising.But for a member of the defence industry, whose stock in trade is state secrets and national pride and prestige, it is unusual.“Qinetiq’s ambition is to be an international, know­ledge-based company and the appointment reflects that,” says Neil Hampson, who heads PwC’s global aero­space and defence team.“It is something the rest of the industry will have to mirror in the next 20 years.”Traditionally the defence sector has been a resolutely national. Tied to domestic governments for most of their revenues and often largely government-owned, weapons manufacturers have often been inward-looking.That is changing. China, India and the countries of the Middle East are now among the largest importers of weapons and companies have chased lucrative export deals there. At the start of May, EADS became the latest defence company to develop a joint venture with a local Indian partner.The likes of BAE Systems have, through acquisition and organic growth, already moved abroad. In 2008 the ­company had more customers abroad than at home and less than 20 per cent of its revenues came from the UK.Research and development has also become globalised under pressure from complex and costly weapons platforms, too challenging for one country to attempt alone. America’s flagship Joint Strike Fighter project, for example, has enlisted contributions from the UK, Italy and the Netherlands.In turn the corporate shape of defence companies has evolved. BAE operates through six “home markets” and has a US, an Italian and an Indian citizen on its board. Other companies also talk up the international experience of their board.Still, in Mr Hampson’s estimation there is more to do. It could take decades for the industry to develop an international footprint and team, plus the necessary secondment processes – which are second nature to oil and gas companies.Of course, the process will be difficult. Given the sensitive material and information they handle, several companies have by-laws limiting the number of foreigners on the board and giving governments a say in appointments.Moreover, big US firms such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman inevitably remain more closely focused on their enormous domestic market, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of total ­global spending on arms.But even that is changing. “Yes, the US makes up half of all spending on defence, but it is not going to offer much in the way of percentage growth in the future,” says Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Evolution Securities. That means defence companies will have to adapt further.“International directors give you the appearance of diversity, useful connections and contacts and also explain how foreign markets operate,” says Mr Cunningham. Senior civil servants and ex-military men “are simply not going to open up India”.
412;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-21T20:39:42Z;Financials rise as Geithner calms bank fears;;US stocks rebounded on Tuesday as Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, allayed fears over the health of the banking industry.Mr Geithner told a congressional panel that “the vast majority” of banks had more capital than needed, which encouraged buyers to enter the market after Monday’s bruising sell-off, during which the financial sector dropped 11 per cent.Citigroup picked up 10.2 per cent to $3.24, helped by comments from its chief executive Vikram Pandit that it would “repay every dollar” of bail-out money. Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
413;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-21T20:04:16Z;Lockheed raises full-year forecast;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, on Tuesday reported first-quarter profit down 8.8 per cent as rising pension costs offset higher sales of defence electronics and computer services.The company nevertheless raised its full-year profit forecast for 2009, saying it would be higher than predicted in January because of share buy-backs.Its shares rose 1.84 per cent to $77.12 in morning trading in New York.Net income for the first quarter fell to $666m, or $1.68 a share, from $730m, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier.Sales over the period rose 4 per cent to $10.37bn.Its information systems and global services division, which includes capabilities in areas such as biometrics, cyber security and secure communications, was the top performer during the quarter, seeing sales rise 10 per cent to $2.76bn.Lockheed said a pension accounting adjustment had resulted in an expense of $114m, which reduced net income by $74m. A year earlier, this adjustment boosted net income by $21m.It said it expected profit of $7.15-$7.35 a share for the full year, compared with a forecast in January of $7.05-$7.25 a share.Bruce Tanner, chief financial officer, said that in spite of proposed cuts to some of Lockheed’s programmes by US defence secretary Robert Gates this month, including capping production of the F-22 fighter jet, the company saw no change to its 2009 guidance.“We continue to believe we’ll have year-over-year growth going forward,” he said.He added he expected the F-35 Lightning II programme to develop a new fighter jet to grow faster than the overall defence department budget.He said the company had “no knowledge” that there had ever been “a classified information breach” on the $300bn F-35 programme.The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that hackers had managed to break into the project, which includes eight other nations as well as the UK.The paper said hackers had been able to copy and siphon data related to design and electronics systems.The leak could make it easier to defend against the aircraft, although the spies were unable to access the most sensitive material, which is kept on computers not connected to the internet.According to the report, former US officials said the attacks appeared to have originated in China, but there was little concrete evidence.The Chinese embassy in Washington said China opposes all forms of cyber crimes, according to the WSJ.
414;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-09T21:34:03Z;Textron soars on acquisition hopes;;Shares of Textron soared by 49 per cent amid speculation the industrial conglomerate could be broken up and sold to a consortium of Middle East and US investors.Al-Watan, a Kuwaiti newspaper, reported on Thursday that a United Arab Emirates group was close to a deal to acquire Textron, whose businesses range from Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters to E-Z-Go golf carts, for $21 a share, or more than $5bn. The buyers would then find a US company to take over Textron’s defence division, the paper said, citing unnamed sources.The report captured the imagination of many investors who had pining for this very scenario since the credit crisis began to take its toll on Textron’s finance unit, which has originated loans for everything from Bell aircraft to vacation homes.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on “market rumours.”Textron rejected the NYSE’s request to issue a public statement ”indicating whether there are any corporate developments which may explain the unusual activity,” adding more weight to speculation that deal talks are underway - even if the would-be buyers are far from the Middle East.“Textron is probably having exploratory discussions with a lot of parties,” one banker said.Textron shares surged $4.45 to $13.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.Facing mounting losses, Textron unveiled a plan in December to sell or liquidate most of the finance businesses unrelated to its own products, or roughly $7.9bn the division’s $11.4bn portfolio of managed receivables.The company has also said they would not rule out selling some of its core businesses to help weather both a credit crisis, which has punished its finance arm, and a deepening recession that has sapped demand for its aircraft and industrial gear.“While it’s hard to call, a takeout here would not be shocking, given the liquidity needs and management credibility issues at present,” Stephen Tusa, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients.Mr Tusa also said the $21-per-share price “looks expensive,” noting he valued the industrial businesses at $12 a share. The finance division, he wrote, “could be worth negative $1.5-2bn.”Industrial bankers have long held the view that there is no single buyer for Textron because of its incongruous mix of aerospace and defence assets, the struggling financial division and an industrial business that builds products including golf carts and tools.”It’s not really a sensible strategic collection,” said one dealmaker.Nevertheless some bankers wondered why Textron would want to hand itself to a consortium, rather than to retain control of its own destiny. While Textron is struggling against slowing demand for many of its products and posted a loss in the fourth quarter, it recently sold assets to raise $365m and has drawn down $3bn in credit lines to boost liquidity.The also noted that any bid from a non-US entity could draw scrutiny from Washington, especially if a domestic partner does not step with a simultaneous bid to acquire Textron’s defence operations.Rather than selling the whole company, bankers said Textron might be better-served to sell its industrial or defence units - or even just one key asset that could extract a decent price, such as Bell - allowing the rest of the company to survive as a better-capitalised entity.Bell could attract broad interest from companies including Boeing, United Technologies’ Sikorsky, or Lockheed Martin, industry experts said.Textron has been viewed as a potential private equity target for the past decade because of its disparate assets, but it would have difficulty drawing buy-out bids in this credit-strained climate.Smaller pieces of the company could still draw interest, however, including the industrial unit that includes its golf-cart manufacturing operation, whose links to Augusta National Golf Club, host of the Masters tournament, could serve as icing on the cake for some private buyers. Its main rival, Club Car, was once owned by private equity.
415;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-07T18:59:55Z;US defence review hits big-ticket programmes;;Four years ago workers at the UK and Italian plants of AgustaWestland, the Anglo-Italian helicopter maker, were celebrating after winning a share of a lucrative contract to design and build a new helicopter to carry the US president.The decision in January 2005 to choose a consortium of Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica, the parent of AgustaWestland, to build a fleet of VH-71 helicopters, known as Marine One when carrying the US president, was hailed as a breakthrough for a European defence contractor in the US.Tony Blair, then UK prime minister, had personally lobbied George W. Bush, the then president, on behalf of AgustaWestland.On Monday, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, reversed the landmark decision. Amid a sweeping overhaul of the Pentagon’s weapons procurement and cuts to several big-ticket programmes, he recommended terminating the VH-71 programme, citing soaring costs, which had doubled from $6.5bn to more than $13bn.The programme, for a total of 27 helicopters, had “fallen six years behind schedule and runs the risk of not delivering the requested capability,” Mr Gates said on Tuesday. The first instalment of helicopters ordered under the initial $3.7bn contract “do not meet requirements and are estimated to have only a five- to 10-year useful life”, he added.The news, although expected after Bush’s successor Barack Obama recently described the programme as “gone amok”, is a blow to both Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica.The companies have already delivered eight of the nine helicopters ordered under the contract, but confusion remains over whether they will ever fly with the US Marine Corps, which operates the US presidential fleet.Finmeccanica has come out fighting, saying that the possible cancellation will not have an impact on the group’s earnings because it never included the second phase of the programme. It added that the potential cancellation would entitle it to receive a penalty payment for breaching the contract.Nevertheless, the news is still a setback for the Italian group, both in terms of prestige and longer-term, as it could hold back its ambitions to expand in the lucrative US defence market.Mr Gates’ proposals still need to pass through Congress, but if implemented will have far-reaching consequences for most US and several European contractors. His plans to boost spending on unmanned aerial vehicles, for example, will be a boon for General Atomics, the company that makes the Reaper and Predator UAVs currently in service in Afghanistan.In Europe, shares in the sector rallied as analysts noted that most of the proposed cuts had already been priced into share prices.The biggest beneficiaries were companies involved in the F-35 Lightning II programme. BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence contractor which provides almost 20 per cent of the value on the aircraft, saw its shares jump 6 per cent yesterday to 347½p, making it the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100.Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Evolution Securities who has a “buy” rating on the stock says: “This is very good for BAE as they have about 20 per cent of the unit value of the F-35”.Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, is also a beneficiary because of its 40 per cent share on the engine for the F-35.Cobham, which provides electronics equipment to the F-35, was anther winner, with its share up 4 per cent.The boost to the F-35 is also good news for Lockheed Martin, in spite of the setback on the VH-71 programme. In afternoon trading in the US, Lockheed Martin shares were holding on to Monday’s gains, up 14 cents at $73.42.Shares in rival contractor Northrop Grumman were down 3 per cent at $46.39. Boeing traded lower also, down 3.5 per cent at $36.82.Analysts said Boeing was suffering from Mr Gates’ proposal to end production of its C-17 military transport aircraft and to scale back the army’s Future Combat Systems programme, on which it is prime contractor.
416;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-07T18:56:29Z;Decision to scrap helicopter order will test good faith;;The recommendation of US defence secretary Robert Gates that the programme for the new presidential helicopter be scrapped is, in some ways, no big surprise.The aircraft that shuttle the president and his staff from the White House lawn and go under the call sign Marine One are iconic elements of the broader US defence budget that the president himself has said must be reined in. Were Mr Obama to proceed with the acquisition of 23 new VH-71 helicopters to bus the first family and its entourage around, his moral authority to clamp down on others would certainly be undermined.All the same it is awkward to have to pull the plug on a programme no one doubts the need for given that the existing Marine One fleet is well beyond its “use by” date. The current Sikorsky helicopters are up to 40 years old and reportedly even have trouble clearing the ground, so weighed down are they with new-fangled kit to protect the US commander-in-chief.The fact that eight of the original order of 9 VH-71s have already been delivered is also tricky. On budget, these have already set the US taxpayer back some $3.8bn so it is hard to believe they will simply be tucked away in a hangar.The programme originally ran into image problems when the US Navy, responsible for specifying the contract, asked for significant upgrades to the remaining 18 aircraft. This resulted in the budget ballooning to an embarrassing $13bn, double the original estimate.Although Lockheed Martin and Anglo-Italian partners AgustaWestland pointed out that the agreed budget for the original specification could still be delivered, the US Navy insisted on the changes to ensure, among other things, that the VH-71 could perform even in the event of a nuclear attack. But then the Navy was never that keen on the European solution. If they ultimately selected the European helicopter it was largely because Sikorsky, which has traditionally supplied the White House helicopters, did not have at the time a competitive product to challenge the Europeans.Sure, both Italy and the UK lobbied hard – in particular Tony Blair, the then British prime minister. Indeed, the Italians, who had recently taken over Westland, had warned that unless the group secured the US presidential contract the future of Westland’s Yeovil plant and some 4,000 UK jobs would be at risk. Opponents of the original deal also claimed the Bush administration awarded the contract to the Anglo-Italian group to thank their respective governments for their support in the Iraqi war.By recommending a cancellation of the programme because of his new budget constraints, Mr Gates, who was also George W. Bush’s defence secretary, raises the prospect of having to pay significant penalties on the first nine helicopters. Ironically, that could in turn increase the value of the contract for its suppliers.Indeed, the capability of the helicopter to fulfil the role has never been questioned. That raises the question of whether, to avoid additional embarrassment, the Department of Defense will suddenly discover reasons why the VH-71 does not fit the bill. This would set a dangerous precedent. Cutting budgets is one thing. Reneging on contracts is quite another.Mr Obama has a carefully nurtured reputation as a leader who encourages his countrymen to understand that with actions come responsibilities. In forgoing his Marine One upgrade he is leading by example. However, the positive impact of his sacrifice would clearly risk being compromised if his government were to try to wriggle out of the contractual consequences of its budget decision.Talk like an EgyptianSome of Europe’s largest telecom operators have become addicted to emerging markets. This week, French Telecom strengthened its hold on the lucrative Egyptian market. The ruling of the arbitration court of the International Chamber of Commerce that Nagib Sawiris, the head of Orascom Telecom, must sell his shares in Mobinil – the holding company controlling Egypt’s largest mobile operator – to his partner France Telecom, is a bitter pill.Orascom has been doing its best to put a positive gloss on a decision that brought to a close a two year legal face-off with their French partners.Their assertion the transaction will land them $1.7bn assumes France Telecom will pay the same price for a second stake Orascom holds in the operator as it is paying for the shares in the unlisted holding company.While the French may well make an offer for all outstanding shares, they are likely to push for this to be based on the recent market price of the listed shares rather than on the arbitration price.For France Telecom, the decision gives it full control over one of the fastest growing mobile businesses in the region.european.view@ft.com
417;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-06T22:19:51Z;Gates unveils sweeping defence cuts;;Robert Gates, US defence secretary, unveiled a sweeping overhaul of defence priorities on Monday, taking an axe to several high-profile weapons programmes as part of his spending proposals.Mr Gates said the Pentagon would place more emphasis on “irregular” warfare as he outlined a series of cuts and changes as part of President Barack Obama’s $534bn defence budget.“We must rebalance this department’s programmes in order to institutionalise and finance our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face,” he said.While Congress will try to alter some of the plans, Mr Gates proposed dramatic changes, including cancelling a deal to build a presidential helicopter. Lockheed’s VH-71 helicopter programme, based on a design by AgustaWestland, the UK subsidiary of Italy’s Finmeccanica, has seen its costs soar since the companies won an initial contract in January 2005.The initial contract, worth $3.8bn, was for nine helicopters, of which seven have already been delivered. Mr Obama signalled this year that the contract was in danger when he said it had “gone amok”.Mr Gates also proposed ending production of the F-22 Raptor fighter jet at 187 aircraft. While that would affect Lockheed Martin, the company would benefit from a separate proposal to increase production next year of the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet, which will also be bought by US allies, including the UK.The Pentagon chief also ordered major cuts in missile defence systems, while restructuring the overall programme to focus on missile threats posed by “rogue” states such as North Korea. Pyongyang this weekend fired a long-range rocket over Japan in a failed satellite launch.Shares in the major defence contractors gained after the announcement. Analysts said investors saw the news as positive because it had put an end to months of uncertainty. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both saw gains of about nine per cent.
418;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-04-06T20:41:54Z;Bank stocks drag Wall Street lower;;"Sun Microsystems tumbled on Monday, as its planned takeover bid by IBM ran into trouble.IBM withdrew its offer for Sun, leaving the talks suspended, but insiders say it remains to be determined whether the talks have fully collapsed or whether they’ll restart. This triggered a 22.7 per cent fall in Sun’s shares to $6.56.Banking stocks also suffered after Mike Mayo, an analyst at Calyon Securities, began coverage on 11 leading banks, giving them all an “underperform” or “sell” rating. Mr Mayo, one of the earliest analysts to turn bearish on banks, warned loan losses might exceed those seen during the great depression.Billionaire investor George Soros added his doubts about banks’ health later in the day, saying: “The banking system as a whole is basically insolvent.”Wells Fargo fell 6.7 per cent to $15.25, while Citigrouplost 4.6 per cent to $2.72 and JPMorgan dropped 3.7 per cent to $28.20.Investors are relying on banks to pull markets out of their slump more than any time in the past 60 years, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg, and worries over their profitability weighed heavily on the markets as a whole.After a very late rally, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent down at 835.48 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 7,975.85 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,606.71 points.“This was a dramatic run up and as we approach earnings season investors are being cautious and taking profits off the table at any opportunity,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford,But George Feiger, chief executive of Contango Capital Advisers warned the slide is a sign of more fundamental problems. “The big problems with the economy are still there,” he said. “We are still only at the beginning of this problem.”Commodities companies also declined on the back of falling materials prices. Steel makers suffered particularly badly after Deutsche Bank warned demand for steel in North America could fall 25 per cent this year. US Steel fell 2.7 per cent to $25.16 and AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $8.82.The defence sector received a late shot in the arm as Robert Gates,
the defence secretary, announced an overhaul of government spending. Lockheed Martin gained 8.9 per cent to $73.28 after Mr Gates said the government would double the budget for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter plane.Northrop Grumman also stood to benefit from increased spending, and its shares lifted 9 per cent to $47.94.Lockheed was also involved in another of the day’s big stories, as speculation mounted that it might look at acquiring Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft. Textron’s share rose 11.3 to a two-month high of $8.26.Cisco added to the pressure already weighing on the technology sector because of the withdrawal of IBM’s offer for Sun. Cisco was downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “conviction buy” right back to “neutral”, with the bank saying recent gains in the company’s stock meant future growth was now priced in. The technology company fell 3.5 per cent to $17.53.Credit Suisse meanwhile said: “We believe Cisco has seen further incremental weakness in its enterprise business, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of total revenues.”General Motors was one of the session’s few risers, lifting 8.1 per cent to $2.27 after Fritz Henderson, its new chief executive, said bankruptcy was not inevitable for the company.Ford also gained ground after it was able to reduce its debt by $9.9bn after swapping much of it for cash and equity. Shares in the carmaker advanced 16 per cent to $3.77.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, performed well after it renegotiated a licensing agreement with Japan’s Otsuka Pharmaceutical to sell the Abilify schizophrenia drug for an extra 29 months. It s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $20.51. The healthcare sector was also bolstered by insurers, which rebounded after falling on Wachovia’s prediction that government proposals to cut their subsidies could cost them as much as 20 per cent of their earnings.Humana gained 3.3 per cent to $26.31 and UnitedHealth picked up 6.8 per cent to $21.93."
419;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-03-19T00:33:07Z;MoD orders three test fighter aircraft;;The UK signalled its commitment to the US-led Joint Strike Fighter programme on Wednesday with the purchase of three test aircraft for about $700m.The decision guarantees the UK continued influence over the development of the new fighter jets, which will replace the Harrier and fly off the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers.There had been speculation that strained finances and the collapse in sterling against the US dollar would force the Ministry of Defence to delay or opt out of buying the test aircraft in an effort to save costs. But the MoD confirmed that the cost of the three jets will be accounted for under this year’s financial planning round, suggesting that the programme has been spared in the budget squeeze. The jets are due to be delivered to the UK in 2011 or 2012.Announcing the agreement during a visit to Washington, John Hutton, defence secretary, said: “By purchasing three aircraft for testing, we will secure access to the development of the programme …This is a vital programme for UK defence both for the military and for industry, with over 100 UK companies involved.”At an estimated cost of $300bn (£211bn) the programme, also called the F-35 Lightning II, is the most expensive in military history. The UK, which is investing £2bn, is the sole “level one” partner which gives it direct influence over the make-up of the jet.The MoD has refused to confirm how many aircraft it will buy, although an original number of 150 no longer seems likely. Mr Hutton was expected to raise issues of affordability in a meeting yesterday with Robert Gates, the US defence secretary.Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor, said the average estimated unit cost in 2002 dollars for the F-35 was between $49m and $65m, depending on the variant. A report by the General Accounting Office, the spending watchdog in the US, put the unit cost as high as $122m through 2014, when testing is scheduled to end.Lockheed said it does not agree with all the assumptions used, pointing out that 2014 was early in the production cycle and that unit cost falls steeply from there.
420;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-03-12T22:45:01Z;New trajectories for drones;;In a comfortable, air-conditioned room at a base in southern Afghanistan two men use computer screens to track a convoy of soldiers making their way along a dusty road 30km away.Steering a camera on an unmanned aircraft high in the sky, the men reconnoitre the way ahead, searching for threats that could harm the convoy. Suddenly the camera swoops on several explosive devices laid out in a daisy-chain formation and picks out a handful of insurgents lying in wait. It does not take long for the men at the base to warn the convoy and scramble a Harrier jet to attack the enemy.Welcome to a recent day in the life of soldiers at Camp Bastion, the main British military base in Helmand province in Afghanistan. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, are among the success stories of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and have been used extensively by US and British troops to carry out what are often dull, dirty and dangerous missions.The UK ministry of defence has spent about £340m ($470m) on acquiring and supporting UAVs over the past two years, of which some £130m was spent on so-called urgent operational requirements for troops active in Iraq and Afghanistan.It was once a tool primarily for military intelligence, but there are now several different types, from smaller models used for surveillance and reconnaissance, such as the Hermes 450, to the Reaper, which carries weapons and can be deployed from thousands of miles away by pilots in the Nevada desert in the US.This innovation in warfare has led to explosive growth for the defence companies involved, such as Britain’s BAE Systems, Thales UK, Israel’s Elbit Systems and America’s Lockheed Martin and General Atomics, the company behind the Reaper. A recent report by the Teal Group estimates that UAV spending – on research and development and procurement – will almost double over the next decade from current worldwide expenditures of $4.4bn annually to $8.7bn, and total just over $62bn in the next 10 years.Demand from the military and countries’ national ambitions is the main driver of the market’s growth and the innovations coming out of company laboratories. But many industry executives believe the real prize lies in civil applications.“We think we can capitalise on opportunities in the sector,” says David Kershaw, business development director of autonomous systems and future capability at BAE Systems. The company set up a global Unmanned Aircraft Systems team 12 months ago to provide a “one-stop” service for customers and estimates the total accessible global market, both for military and civil applications, will be worth £5bn over the next five to 10 years. “We believe the way to go is to build from the military market, then go into the security market and finally capitalise on the civil market,” says Mr Kershaw.BAE has begun a development project, called the South Coast Partnership, with police forces in Kent and Essex to make UAVs part of their arsenals.Other medium-term opportunities in the security area include using unmanned systems to help with border control and coastguard monitoring. The US Navy, for example, is using Boeing’s ScanEagle to help monitor pirate activity off the coast of Africa. Crowd surveillance during events such as the Olympic Games is another opportunity, as is environmental monitoring. UAVs have a big advantage over traditional helicopter surveillance as they can stay in the air for up to 24 hours, depending on the equipment carried, rather than just two or three hours. They are also much cheaper.Qinetiq, the UK defence research group, recently completed the UK’s first flight of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle for agricultural monitoring. Japan, meanwhile, has been using small rotor-wing UAVs for crop-spraying since the early 1990s, while a government-industry funded alliance that includes Fuji and Yamaha is working on fixed-wing concepts.But the biggest hurdle the technology faces is getting approval to use civilian airspace. In the UK a consortium of industry, government and academics has set up a £32m programme, called Astraea, to find ways to overcome this obstacle. Astraea is working with the Civil Aviation Authority to see how regulations for manned flights can be interpreted for auto­nomous ones and find out what else is needed to demonstrate a thorough safety case.Nick Miller, vice-chairman of Astraea and business director of UAV systems at Thales UK, says “the civil market is there already – we just can’t play in it yet”. He predicts it will be 10-15 years before UAVs will obtain full routine access to the “manned” airspace. The main challenges include developing “sense and avoid” technology to simulate a pilot’s eyes and ears and making the systems more durable and fuel efficient.Analysts at the Teal Group believe UAVs today are in a situation analogous to aircraft at the end of the first world war or helicopters at the end of the second. Helicopters were largely confined to military roles well into the 1950s. They entered the civil market in substantial numbers only in the 1960s.A substantial civil market may not yet exist but Thales’s Mr Miller predicts people should not be surprised if within a decade or so aircraft carrying freight no longer have a pilot in the ­cockpit.
421;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-03-12T02:17:01Z;Finmeccanica signals cautious outlook;;Finmeccanica, Italy’s defence-dominated conglomerate one third owned by the Italian government, reported on Wednesday strong profit growth in 2008 but its cautious projections for 2009 disappointed investors.“The deteriorating economic and financial outlook lowers visibility and increases uncertainty,” Alessandro Pansa, chief financial officer, told analysts in London as the company forecast revenues of €17.1bn to €17.6bn ($21.8bn-$22.5bn) for 2009 and €17.4bn to €18.6bn for 2010.However Finmeccanica stressed that its backlog of orders covered 85 per cent of revenues for this year, 60 per cent in 2010 and 42 per cent in 2011.Dividends would rise in line with profits, it said, giving a 11 per cent higher payout for 2008.Debt payments were “totally manageable” and no refinancing was needed in 2009, Mr Pansa said. Debt at end-2008 stood at €3.38bn ($4.33bn), up from €1.15bn at the end of 2007, largely because of its acquisition last year of DRS Technologies, the US defence electronics group.Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, chief executive, and Mr Pansa said defence budgets of their three main customers – Italy, the UK and the US – were “substantially stable” in spite of the global crisis. Military related orders account for 51 per cent of Finmeccanica’s backlog.The controversial US presidential helicopter contract – which Barack Obama has cited as an example of the procurement process “gone amok” – would probably be maintained but frozen at current levels without the add-ons requested by the US Navy, Mr Guarguaglini predicted. The contract was awarded by the then Bush administration to Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica in 2005.Governments’ expenditure outside the defence budget on domestic security were expected to increase, Mr Guarguaglini said, mentioning US Homeland Security, border control systems in the Middle East and security for Russia’s 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi.He also stressed the diversification of markets and the growing importance of Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.In the current environment, Finmeccanica would focus on efficiency, profitability, cash generation and streamlining, Mr Guarguaglini said. Net debt reduction was the main goal, he added.Finmeccanica continued to backtrack on its intended flotation of Ansaldo, its energy unit.Mr Pansa said Ansaldo Energia would not be floated “at any cost” and spoke of the possibility of a sale of a “significant stake” to a single shareholder by the end of this year. Total disposals this year were expected to amount to €500m to €1bn, he said, but gave no details.Ansaldo Energia was also expected to benefit from the decision of Italy’s centre-right government to relaunch the civilian nuclear generation industry after a 22-year moratorium.Finmeccanica’s net profit rose almost 19 per cent to €571m in 2008.Citigroup maintained Finmeccanica as a “buy”, saying its guidance for 2009 revenues appeared conservative. A Cassa Lombarda analyst thought the guidance ambitious.Shares in the group closed down 4.5 per cent at €9.37. Over the past year they have fallen by nearly a half.
422;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-02-25T21:49:22Z;BofA stages turnround amid the gloom;;Banking stocks swung violently between spectacular losses and gains on Wednesday as traders scrambled to assess where the Obama administration’s rescue plans leave shareholders.The KBW bank index lurched from losses of as much as 7.6 per cent to gains of 7.1 per cent. The index finished 2.4 per cent higher on hopes that existing equity would at least not be wiped out altogether under further intervention from Washington.The wider market had a downbeat start to the wild session after National Association of Realtors data showed an unexpectedly steep fall in sales of previously owned homes as low prices failed to attract buyers.Yet stocks later rallied after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, again sought to calm nerves that a leading bank would be nationalised. “He has reinforced the message,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The government wants to take preference shares rather than common shares because it wants to give banks an easy way out if the worst doesn’t happen.”However, a strong afternoon rally gave way to a significant sell-off in the last half hour of trading and the wider market finished in the red.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “The bottom line is that we are still lacking any confidence and there is a fear factor the markets can’t seem to get rid of. On top of that, the market just isn’t buying the message coming out of President Obama’s White House at the moment.”At the end of the wild session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index all closed 1.1 per cent lower at 764.90 points, 7,270.89 points and 1,425.43 points, respectively.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “People are buying on a rumour and selling on the subsequent news.”Among the volatile performers, Bank of Americaat one point was down 11.2 per cent after Merrill Lynch disclosed that ineffective internal controls had caused the bank to understate losses last year by $500m.The shares closed up 9.1 per cent at $5.16, as investors focused on the pledge from its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, that the lender would pass the government’s so-called stress test.Citigroup lost 16.9 per cent in the morning session, but rallied to stand 3.1 per cent lower at $2.52.The energy sector – down as much as 2.7 per cent in the morning session – later rallied to close 0.7 per cent lower.Although banking stocks finished higher, the financial sector overall lost ground, weighed down by insurers.Lincoln National reported its first loss in six years and slashed its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 1 cent. The shares sank 14 per cent to $11.21.The news had a knock-on effect on the rest of the life assurance sector.Prudential fell 2.7 per cent to $19.86, while MetLife lost 5.4 per cent to $22.05.Allstate shed 5.7 per cent to $17.57 after the home and car insurer also slashed its dividend by more than half, after two consecutive quarterly losses.But even though the market fell, the Vix – an index of anxiety – also eased 1.9 per cent to 44.6.Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Would lower equity index prices be synonymous with a higher degree of investor fear? The answer turned out to be a resounding ‘no’.”Earlier in the session, the market had sold off heavily after investors overlooked the speech by President Obama the previous evening and focused on data that showed home purchases fell by 5.3 per cent to an annual rate of 4.49m, the fewest since 1997. The S&P fell 1.2 per cent in the 10 minutes after the figures were issued.Homebuilders shed 0.8 per cent overall in choppy trade.Industrials was the worst performing sector of the day, off 2.9 per cent overall. Boeing lost 4.3 per cent at $33.91 and Lockheed Martin 5.4 per cent at $70.46.Telecommunications was the only sector to find positive territory after JPMorgan analysts upgraded their view of AT&T to “overweight”.“Wireline guidance assumptions are conservative,” they wrote. The shares bucked the downward trend, up 2 per cent to $23.71.
423;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-02-17T20:30:41Z;Marine One contract faces costs review;;A prestigious contract to replace the US presidential helicopter that was won by a consortium of Lockheed Martin and Italy’s Finmeccanica could be scrapped following a review prompted by its mounting costs.Shares in Finmeccanica fell as much as 9 per cent on Tuesday morning on concerns Washington might cancel the contract awarded three years ago to Lockheed Martin and its Italian subcontractor.The programme’s original $6.1bn price tag for as many as 28 new helicopters has soared to $11.2bn, potentially making it the most expensive helicopter ever. Under the Nunn-McCurdy Act, because the cost overrun has exceeded a statutory limit placed on defence budgets, the Pentagon is required to review whether the programme is vital to national security and should proceed.The review is standard practice and very few such reviews have ever resulted in cancelled programmes.However, it could put at risk one of the most high-profile defence contracts awarded in recent years. When the initial $1.7bn contract was won in January 2005 the decision to chose an Anglo-Italian design for the president’s personal helicopter was seen as a breakthrough for European defence contractors in the US. Tony Blair, then UK prime minister, had personally lobbied then President Bush on behalf of AgustaWestland, the UK subsidiary of Finmeccanica.The decision was a huge blow to America’s Sikorsky which had been providing the fleet, known as Marine One, since 1957. The new Marine One helicopters, dubbed US101s, are to be modified versions of the EH101 helicopter in service with the Royal Navy and other navies around the world.A decision to cancel the contract could spark fears over protectionism by the new administration during the economic downturn.Giorgio Zappa, Finmeccanica’s chief operating officer, stressed the review was standard practice and that it would be concluded by June.Mr Zappa said the cost increase was almost entirely due to a review in the requirements of the helicopters, mainly ones relating to security such as sensors, the speed of the helicopters and the power of the engine.He also emphasised that between 70-80 per cent of the helicopters would be produced in the US.“The product therefore responds to even the most conservative requirements and so this is all just a storm in a teacup. We are waiting to hear the decision of the Pentagon, which has already carried out an initial audit and confirmed the choice of the US101,” he added.The programme is divided into two increments: a batch of five new helicopters with the same or better equipment as the current fleet and 23 operational helicopters with much better specifications. Lockheed Martin has so far built four test models and three of the helicopters that will eventually be used.Although a cancellation would be a blow, it would not have a material impact on Finmeccanica’s order book, according to analysts. Shares in the company dropped as much as 9.5 per cent on Tuesday before regaining some ground in early afternoon trading to close down 4.4 per cent to €11.35. Shares in Lockheed Martin were down more than 3 per cent in New York.
424;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-02-17T19:38:59Z;Japan says sayonara to activist investors;;"The global recession has spared few businesses, but champions of Japanese-style management will be toasting the financial crisis that started it.Companies from Brother Industries, purveyor of sewing machines, to Glico, which makes chocolate and caramel goodies, have seen Steel Partners beat a retreat as redemption demands back home have forced the activist investor to cash in saleable holdings in Japan.On Tuesday, Steel Partners said it would withdraw its proposal to raise its stake in Sapporo, the Japanese brewer, from 18.6 per cent to 33.3 per cent.Steel Partners, which has been one of the most publicly visible foreign investors in Japan in recent years, has sold a substantial part of its investments, reducing the number of companies it invests in from about 30 to about 20.Other Japanese companies have been similarly relieved of their once-feared, troublesome shareholders.The Children’s Investment Fund, another activist fund which made a big bet on Japan with its investment in J-Power, the electricity wholesaler, sold its entire stake back to the company last year.Perry Capital, which in 2007 had offered to buy 25 per cent of NEC Electronics at Y5,000 a share, has also reduced its stake in the semiconductor group from 6 per cent to less than 5 per cent.But now that they are freer to pursue their own strategies, Japanese managements face the more difficult task of proving they were right.Meanwhile, for hedge funds which dabbled at transforming Japan Inc but largely failed to build up their stakes in target companies, management recalcitrance now looks like a blessing in disguise.Sapporo’s shares are trading at less than half what Steel was offering, while NEC Electronics’ share price is now one-tenth the level of Perry’s offer.Sabotage attemptWhen Lockheed Martin and Agusta-Westland, its European partner, won the $6bn contract to supply the White House with its new fleet of Marine One helicopters, it marked a breakthrough for the Italian Finmeccanica-owned helicopter group and a severe setback for Sikorsky, its US rival . But the traditional American supplier of presidential helicopters is now engaged in fierce lobbying to halt the deal and re-enter the picture.At least, that is what Giorgio Zappa, Finmeccanica’s chief operating officer, thinks after reports that Barack Obama, US president, was reviewing the contract following a near doubling in costs.Mr Zappa claims these increases relate to all the additional security systems the Pentagon and the Navy subsequently requested to make the helicopter safe.He insists his group’s helicopters are by far the best suited for the purpose. Nor does the “Buy American” argument apply, since 80 per cent of the work will be in the US, with Lockheed as prime contractor working alongside Bell.Mr Obama will clearly have the final say. It may all ultimately boil down to whether he thinks the electorate will want to pay for all the costly extra security systems the Pentagon thinks he needs.When Lockheed Martin and its European partner Agusta-Westland won the $6bn contract to supply the White House with its new fleet of Marine One helicopters, it marked a breakthrough for the Italian Finmeccanica-owned helicopter group and a major setback for its US rival Sikorsky.But the traditional American supplier of presidential helicopters is now engaged in fierce lobbying to halt the deal and re-enter the picture.At least, that is what Finmeccanica’s chief operating officer Giorgio Zappa thinks, after reports that President Barack Obama was reviewing the contract following a near doubling in costs.Mr Zappa claims these increases relate to all the additional security systems subsequently requested by the Pentagon and the Navy to make the helicopter super safe.He insists his group’s helicopters remain by far the best suited for the purpose.

It may all boil down to whether he thinks the electorate will want to pay for all the costly extra security systems the Pentagon thinks he needs to fly safely.City watchdog bitesFinally, the UK’s City watchdog has won a victory in court.The Financial Services Authority on Tuesday won an appeal against a ruling by the independent Financial Services and Markets Tribunal, a body that has inflicted some highly embarrassing verdicts on the regulator over the years.These include the FSA’s battle with Legal & General, when the tribunal halved the fine L&G was to pay for pensions mis-selling and attacked the watchdog, deservedly, for its processes.This case is not such a headline grabber. Fox Hayes, a law firm based in Leeds in northern England, used its FSA-authorised status to approve financial promotions that allowed overseas “boiler room” fraudsters to target UK investors with small illiquid overseas stocks. Those investors have collectively lost $21m.But the importance of Tuesday’s victory is twofold. One issue is simply the fact the FSA won its first challenge against the tribunal, which should encourage it to challenge again in the future.The other, of interest to anyone with dealings in London, is the size of the fine – £750,000 ($1.06m) – that the appeals court deemed should be the floor for cases like this.The original FSA fine was just £150,000. The watchdog is already fining more heavily than it did back then, although not this heavily. But for anyone caught in the FSA’s clutches, the message is clear; appeal, and the penalty could go up.world.view@ft.com"
425;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-02-17T17:58:47Z;Slump helps BBVA step out of Santander’s shadow;;The collapse of the Spanish residential property market and the increasing problems of the commercial sector are turning the country’s leading banks into landlords.Spain’s three largest real estate companies – Martina-Fadesa, Colonial, and Metrovacesa – have all been taken over by banks, and at the latest count the Spanish banking system is now sitting on more than €45bn ($56.5bn) of property assets.Santander and BBVA, the country’s two biggest banking groups, have not escaped the general slump – far from it. Both have been busily trying to sharpen their skills in their new role as estate agents. But there is a huge difference in their respective approaches to their troubled but rapidly expanding property businesses.Indeed, if the property crash has dealt another body blow to Santander’s once glittering image, it could prove a blessing in disguise for BBVA.Santander has always been considered as Spain’s sharpest, most aggressive bank, successfully embarking on a whole series of cross-border acquisitions to turn it into one of Europe’s biggest and most profitable banking groups.The far more conservative BBVA has, thus, inevitably had to live in the shadow of its arch-rival. It too tried to expand in Europe, particularly in Italy, and failed. But times have now changed.In the last few months, Santander and Emilio Botín, its chairman, have fallen off their pedestal. Clients of Banif, its private banking subsidiary, were not too happy to have been sold structured products in the now defunct Lehman Brothers.Many of its more affluent clients have also lost a bundle – €2.3bn ($2.9bn) in total – after investing in the bank’s Optimal funds, which were heavily exposed to the Bernard Madoff scandal.Santander is now proposing to repay thousands of its wealthiest private clients stung by the scandal via preference shares in the bank, paying an annual coupon of 2 per cent.Some of these private investors are still unhappy and consider the repayment offer pretty stingy. They are suing, and so are institutional investors who have been excluded from the offer.This week Santander sought regulatory permission to freeze payouts from Banif Inmobiliario, its main real estate fund, and the country’s largest. Investors had sought to withdraw 80 per cent, or €2.6bn, of the fund’s capital all at once.Lacking the liquidity to meet these hefty redemption demands, Santander wants to suspend full reimbursement for two years while it attempts to dispose of the property assets held by the fund. Investors are furious, all the more so given BBVA’s radically different approach to a similar problem.Rather than freeze payouts of its own BBVA Propriedad fund, Santander’s rival decided to reimburse investors out of its own pocket to the tune of €1.6bn and take the fund’s property assets onto its own books.The bank claims this will give it more time and flexibility to dispose of these assets when market conditions improve. Unlike Santander, it would not face the same pressure to sell assets to raise money to repay investors over the next two years.The fact that Santander is now offering low interest loans to its employees to acquire the property it owns at a discount may seem a creative idea, but it also seems a sign of desperation. And should it not perhaps keep the affairs of employees separate from the future of the bank?This staff scheme again shows the more aggressive way Santander conducts its business. Yet in these risk-averse days, investors, shareholders and depositors all seem to consider that boring is better.And BBVA appears to be banking on its far more conservative culture to help it finally step out of the shadow of its arch-rival.Sabotage attemptWhen Lockheed Martin and Agusta-Westland, its European partner, won the $6bn contract to supply the White House with its new fleet of Marine One helicopters, it marked a breakthrough for the Italian Finmeccanica-owned helicopter group and a severe setback for Sikorsky, its US rival .

426;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-02-03T21:39:33Z;US stocks rally on pharmaceuticals;;US stocks advanced for the first time in four sessions on Tuesday as strong performances among consumer and health care stocks helped offset more selling in the financial sector.A batch of better-than-expected results reassured investors that the performances of at least some companies during the recession may not be quite as bad as feared.Well received figures from Merck and Schering Plough sent shares in the pharmaceutical group and drugmaker up 6.4 per cent to $30.24 and 8.2 per cent to $18.91, respectively.That helped lift the health care sector 2.4 per cent overall.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.6 per cent to 838.51, paring its loss for the year so far to 7.2 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.8 per cent higher at 8,078.36 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.5 per cent stronger at 1,516.30.The market drifted between positive and negative territory early in the day, but found momentum in early afternoon.The battered shares of US housebuilders were among the biggest winners after the National Association of Realtors reported a 6.3 per cent rise in its gauage of pending home sales in December, albeit helped by lower prices.The sector rallied 11.8 per cent overall. DR Horton, however, escaped the gains after disclosing another quarterly loss that was at least not as bad as feared. Still, the shares dipped 2.2 per cent to $4.04.The market rally was wide-ranging and took in all sectors other than financials.Even UPS – whose results are often considered a proxy for the broader US economy – found positive territory despite results that missed Wall Street estimates. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $45 as traders welcomed nevertheless welcomed a return to profitability.Bucking the generally positive momentum in the telecoms sector, Motorola shed 11 per cent to $4.04 after the group disclosed a fourth-quarter loss and said it would suspend its quarterly dividend.Motorola reported the quarterly loss versus a year-ago profit on weaker sales, although both earnings and sales results topped analysts’ expectations.The share price falls came as the telecoms company also warned that it would post a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss, that it is suspending its dividend and that it is in search of a chief financial officer.SanDisk, off 23.2 per cent at $8.66, escaped the gains in the technology sector on a disappointing outlook.Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, eased 5.3 per cent at 43.1.Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets, said: “All eyes are still firmly focused on the non-farm payrolls for later this week and until then we may see the major US indices struggle for direction.”Energy stocks, up 1.9 per cent, tracked the oil price slightly higher, while materials rose 2 per cent.Dow Chemical rallied 2.7 per cent to $11.35 despite downbeat figures.Plunging car sales, however, hurt sentiment. Ford nevertheless rallied 4.3 per cent to $1.96, while General Motors dipped 1.4 per cent to $2.85.Despite the gains elsewhere, financials lost 2.5 per cent overall amid concerns over Washington’s plans to shore up the sector. Regional banks came under particular pressure, down 7.7 per cent overall.Citigroup issued its first progress report on how it was spending the $45bn it received in government funds.

427;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-02-02T22:37:54Z;Tough review of US weapons budget;;"America’s defence industry is bracing itself for cuts to the government’s weapons budget after early signals from President Barack Obama’s administration of “hard choices” ahead.“One thing we have known for many months is that the spigot of defence spending opened by 9/11 is closing,” Robert Gates, US defence secretary, warned Congress recently. “With two major campaigns ongoing, the economic crisis and resulting budget pressures will force hard choices on this department.”The message is an early warning for an industry that is traditionally defensive during recessions but whose calls for more investment as part of the proposed $884bn economic stimulus package have so far gone unanswered.One of the most closely watched procurement decisions coming up is what Mr Obama will do with the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. A letter from members of the House and the Senate last month warned the president he needed to decide by March 1 whether to plough more money into the programme or let the F-22 production line be at risk.The US air force has enough funding to buy 183 of the world’s most advanced jets and materials for another four, which the letter warned was “insufficient to meet potential threats”.More than 25,000 Americans work for the 1,000-plus suppliers in 44 states that make parts for the F-22, according to the letter.What Mr Obama does regarding the F-22 is will be scrutinised not only by its manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, but also by the rest of the defence establishment. There is a lot at stake.Mr Gates and the administration are to review all US acquisition programmes as they prepare to finalise the 2010 Pentagon budget request. He is expected to present an adjusted budget for 2010 in the spring.Jane’s, the defence industry information group, forecasts that the budget will fall $90bn in real terms to $625bn by 2011 as supplemental spending on current operations declines.“Given the state of the US military, the baseline budget won’t change that much,” says Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group in Washington DC. “However, much of the defence industry’s growth over the past five years has come from lavish supplemental spending packages that have boosted procurement and operations budgets by up to 35 per cent. These supplemental packages will decline along with operational use of US forces in Iraq.”The most industry can expect, he adds, is “a reluctance to kill programmes or production lines when jobs are at stake”.He cites the $300bn Lockheed Martin-led F-35 programme to build a next-
generation fighter jet as among those that ought to be safe, and Boeing’s C-17 cargo aircraft project, which should be buoyed by international orders.Apart from the F-22, programmes that analysts think could be at risk include
the Future Combat System, a $160bn project to build a new generation of armoured vehicles.Among the “hard choices” Mr Gates said last month the Pentagon would have to make are compromises on weapons systems. He also suggested Congress needed to do more to make sure Pentagon decisions about programmes were not reversed later.“It is one thing to speak broadly about the need for budget discipline and acquisition reform. It is quite another to make tough choices about specific weapons systems and defence priorities based solely on national interests. And then to stick to those decisions.”"

Lockheed said it was facing $470m in pension accounting adjustments, up from its October forecast of $60m.Northrop, the US’s third-biggest defence group, said the fall in the stock market had prompted it to take a $3bn-$3.4bn charge in the fourth quarter as it writes down the book value of businesses it took over in 2001 and 2002, which are now part of its shipbuilding and space units. It is due to report earnings on February 3.Analysts said Northrop could face pension charges. “Management is being cautious in regards to the writedown,” Rob Stallard of Macquarie Securities said in a research note. “We remain more concerned about pension obligations going forward than writedowns attributed to goodwill.”There is concern within the defence industry that President Barack Obama may seek to cut military spending. Lockheed has begun an advertising campaign to promote the F-22 Raptor, suggesting it is worried that the fighter-aircraft programme may be axed.The Obama administration has put out a statement reaffirming Mr Obama’s pledge to invest in defence. Mr Obama said the US needed to keep its “unparalleled airpower capabilities”, which may suggest that he intends to maintain Lockheed’s F-22 and F-35 programmes.Lockheed reported fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations, with profits of $823m or $2.05 per share, up from $799m or $1.89 per share, in the same period a year earlier.Analysts had been expecting about $1.91 per share.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chairman, president and chief executive, said the results reflected “excellent operational and financial performance across all business areas, despite the difficult economic environment”.Lockheed shares were up 3.1 per cent at $82.47 by late morning in New York.Northrop was down 0.6 per cent at $47.70.

Analysts had been expecting about $1.91 per share.Sales for the quarter totalled $11.1bn, up from $10.8bn for the same period in 2007, as weaker performance in Lockheed’s aeronautics and space systems divisions was offset by good results for the company’s electronic systems and information systems units.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chairman, president and chief executive, said he expected “topline agency numbers” for the 2010 military budget to be released around February 13 and warned they may be lower than the $581bn the Bush administration had projected.“It’s just fair game to ask and permit the incoming administration to take a look at that and see what they want to do in sculpting that top line,” said Mr Stevens. “It may not be $581bn. It may well be something less than that.”Lockheed shares closed up 6.31 per cent at $85.08 on Thursday. Northrop was up 0.21 per cent at $48.08.
430;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-01-07T18:11:39Z;Washington finds ‘natural ally’ in New Delhi;;For decades, relations between Washington and New Delhi were shaped through the prism of the cold war, when India was viewed as a client state of the Soviet Union, its largest arms supplier and one of its biggest trading partners. Even after the Soviet collapse, relations remained prickly, because of accumulated mistrust and New Delhi’s resentment over US sanctions of its nuclear weapons programme.But in recent years Indo-US ties have undergone a dramatic transformation. George W. Bush, the US president, saw India, with its democratic tradition, as a “natural ally”, and was determined to bury the past.In 2005 Washington and New Delhi signed a 10-year defence co-operation agreement outlining their vision for strategic mutual support. In October, as the US financial system was crumbling and elections loomed, the Bush administration finally ended India’s nuclear pariah status, pushing a civil nuclear co-operation deal through the US Congress.With the “festering sore” over Indian nuclear weapons lanced, the two countries are now redefining their relationship – a process likely to take years and be fraught with difficulty.“As far as the US is concerned, they would hope that countries like ours would be part of the process of policing the international system – they cannot do it alone,” said retired Lt Gen Satish Nambiar, a defence analyst.However, he added: “It’s not in our interests to be acting on behalf of, or as a proxy for, the US in the region. It will have to be cautiously played and, hopefully, the Americans will understand the position and play it that way too.”Analysts say Washington and New Delhi share many interests – from fighting radical Islamism to safeguarding cargo ships in the Malacca Strait. Both are preoccupied with Pakistan – which Stephen Hadley, a Bush administration adviser, has called the biggest security challenge facing Barack Obama, the president-elect, outside the Middle East.New Delhi and Washington also share anxieties about the real intent of China’s military modernisation drive, despite protests to the contrary. “India and the US are developing joint capabilities that have the net effect of circumscribing the latitude and propensity of China for unilateral action,” said Anupam Srivastava, Asia director of the University of Georgia’s Centre for International Trade and Security.New Delhi is looking to the US as it seeks to modernise its military equipment. This week India announced the $2.1bn (€1.5bn, £1.4bn) acquisition of eight Boeing surveillance aircraft to patrol its coastline, its largest purchase of military hardware from a US company.India is shopping for 126 new fighter aircraft to replace its ageing Soviet era fleet – and two US companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are among the six companies bidding for a contract worth more than $10bn. “We are hopeful that India is seeing us as a reliable partner and an attractive alternative to our competitors out there,” a US embassy official said on Wednesday.Indian defence experts have also been holding quiet talks with their US counterparts about co-operation on missile defence systems to guard against nuclear threat, including possible acquisition of US technology, though they remain preliminary and mainly among technical experts.Yet even as the nations grow closer, defence analysts say India will be a far from docile ally for the US.“Even when India was weak, it was not willing to play a subordinate role, so why should it be a junior partner to the US now,” said C. Raja Mohan, a professor of international studies at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. “But if India can grow strong with US co-operation, why should we deny ourselves that?”
431;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
432;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2009-01-05T17:08:49Z;New Delhi signs $2.1bn Boeing deal;;"The Indian government has signed a $2.1bn deal to buy eight long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft from Boeing, its largest ever acquisition of military hardware from the US, its old cold war nemesis.New Delhi’s purchase of the P-8I Poseidon aircraft highlights India’s rapidly deepening defence ties with the US, a process facilitated by last year’s civil nuclear deal which buried the biggest bone of contention between the two countries.The urgent need for India to enhance its maritime security capacity was exposed during the November terror assault on Mumbai, mounted by attackers who commandeered a small fishing boat and landed it on the waterfront in the heart of India’s financial capital.The deal comes as Boeing is vying with five other companies – including Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-16; France’s Dassault; a European defence consortium led by EADS; and Russia’s Mikoyan Design Bureau – to supply 126 fighter jets in a $10bn (€7.3bn, £6.8bn) deal that would modernise India’s decrepit Soviet-era strike force.The Boeing P-8Is – which will replace the 25-year-old patrol aircraft – have the capacity to detect submarines moving deep into India’s territorial waters and also possess advanced missile systems that could be used to destroy hostile submarines.Defence analysts argue that the aircraft – based on the platform of a Boeing 737 – are badly needed to plug the massive gap in India’s ability to patrol and defend its 7,500km coastline. The first aircraft are due to be delivered in four years, and Indian defence analysts say India may eventually acquire up to 20 of them.“This is something that should have been done years ago,” said C. Uday Bhaskar, former head of India’s Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses. “It was very long required for India as far as maritime surveillance. But the general mood in the country post-Mumbai has allowed this to go ahead.”The Poseidon deal is not the first arms purchase from the US by India, which is now in the process of trying to modernise and upgrade its military.New Delhi spent $1bn last year to acquire six Super Hercules C-130J transport aircraft from Lockheed Martin. In 2002 – against the backdrop of high tensions between India and Pakistan, India bought 12 ThalesRaytheonSystems radars capable of locating long-range mortars, artillery and rocket launchers.However, the Poseidon deal represents the largest and most sophisticated acquisition from a US company, and reflects the rapidly warming ties between Washington and New Delhi after many decades of prickly relations.During the cold war India – with its socialist-leaning economic policies – was seen as firmly in the camp of the Soviet Union, which was its primary supplier of arms and armaments.After India’s 1974 nuclear weapons test, the US imposed sanctions on New Delhi, denying it access to any US technology that Washington deemed to have military potential.But the relationship between the countries has undergone what Mr Bhaskar describes as a “tectonic shift” during the presidency of George W. Bush, who identified India as a potentially important strategic partner for the US."
433;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Tanks for the memories amid MoD delays;;More than 90 years after unveiling the world’s first tank in 1916, Britain could be about to lose the capability to manufacture them.A decision by the Ministry of Defence this month to revamp and delay elements of the Army’s biggest equipment procurement programme, to build a new generation of armoured vehicles, has raised questions over the long-term future of Britain’s indigenous manufacturing capability. The £16bn ($23bn) programme, the Future Rapid Effects System, was described recently as “the most disastrously managed” project in the history of defence by the chairman of the parliamentary defence committee.BAE Systems, the country’s only tank manufacturer, has warned it will have to consider “the size and shape” of its business in light of the decision. Over the years the company has swallowed up the entire domestic industry, including Alvis, Vickers, Marconi and Royal Ordnance and this industrial legacy means it maintains nearly all the armoured vehicles in the army’s current fleet. It urgently needs new orders for manufacturing work to keep its factories busy and sustain key engineering skills as older vehicles are retired.Others in the UK, including General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin of the US, and the state-owned Defence Support Group, are also waiting to see whether further investment will pay off.“We need transparency and visibility as a minimum,” says one industry executive. “The MoD needs to have a holistic view of what sort of capabilities it wants to retain in the UK. It needs the capability through-life to repair and upgrade.”Jobs and factory sites could be affected. BAE’s weapons and vehicles business, part of its Land Systems division, employs about 2,000 people globally but most are based in the UK. Its main sites here are Newcastle, Barrow, Leicester, Telford and Wolverhampton. The company announced in November it was laying off 200 people because of a work shortage.BAE declined to comment but at the time of the Fres announcement it said: “We will clearly have to consider what this means for the size and shape of the Land Systems business in the near term …The key will be to achieve an agreed understanding with MoD about a coherent strategy for the sector.”The news was also a blow for General Dynamics. As part of the MoD’s announcement it was changing its priorities on Fres it also said it would abandon long-running talks with the company over the supply of its design for the utility vehicle. The company has had to let go all its contractors that had worked on Fres but it has already spent millions of pounds on the programme. “It will be difficult to keep armoured vehicle manufacturing and integrating capability in the UK because there isn’t anything for them to do,” says Nick Cunningham, analyst at Evolution Securities.He notes that while for BAE the news on Fres might have been a blow, investors should recognise the UK business is “a bit of a side-show” in the context of its overall land systems business, which has been buoyed by large US orders for mine-resistant vehicles. He forecasts Alvis and Royal Ordnance will together generate revenues of £670m in 2008, about 10 per cent of his estimate of revenues of £6.7bn for the group’s land systems division as a whole. In terms of profits, this share is even smaller: he estimates the two will generate profits of £30m out of total land systems profits of £567m.Defence sources stress that contractors are for now being kept busy, as there is some work coming out of the MoD. Lockheed Martin, for example, is already competing with BAE on a programme to update the Warrior tank and was awarded a contract in October to undertake a turret study contract for the scout reconnaissance vehicle version of Fres.In addition, BAE, along with GD, Thales UK and others, are already undertaking assessment phase work on the Fres scout reconnaissance vehicle. Both BAE and GD have potential contenders for the scout vehicle.For the MoD, however, the key issue will be to decide just what sort of capabilities it wants to retain in the UK. The department says it will publish its new strategy on armoured fighting vehicles in the new year. Quentin Davies, the procurement minister, recently suggested the government was more focused on Britain retaining the ability to design, maintain and upgrade the platforms, rather than being focused on where armoured vehicles for future requirements were built.“The government needs to decide whether it is an important indigenous capability for the UK,” says Mr Cunningham. “The impact on BAE as a company is material but small. The impact on employment and politically would probably be disproportionately large, which might give the UK government second thoughts about allowing this capability just to fold.”
434;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-12-19T02:59:29Z;Sale puts atomic weapons plant in US hands;;"The UK Atomic Weapons Establishment, which makes and maintains the warheads for Britain’s nuclear missiles, has come under the control of US companies after the government sold its one-third stake.Ministers were accused Thursday night of trying to conceal the change in ownership after failing to make an announcement to parliament.Jacobs, an engineering company with headquarters in Pasadena, California, announced late on Wednesday in the US that it had bought the government’s holding in AWE. The stake was put up for sale last year after ministers decided to break up BNFL, the state-owned group, which included AWE.The sale of the Aldermaston facility to Jacobs is likely to reignite controversy over the independence of the UK’s deterrent.The US already supplies the technology for the weapons but it was the recognition that the UK needed an independent nuclear deterrent after the second world war which prompted the government to develop the facility.However, there was no announcement from the government, which was accused of turning the matter into “a farce”.BNFL only put up a short statement on its website Thursday afternoon confirming the sale. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had no official comment.Gerald Howarth, shadow defence minister, described the decision not to announce the sale to parliament as “unacceptable”.“It is consistent with the government’s unwillingness to share matters nuclear with parliament.“It is not an issue about which we can be cavalier. We need to know what the implications are of this.”Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: “The government appears guilty of concealing all this from parliament and the public. There has been a huge degree of suspicion over what has been going on at Aldermaston, particularly over recruitment and how this fits with our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty.“None of this has been properly explained. Why are we bothering with the fiction of being independent and separate from the US when this is clearly not the case? It sounds to me like this is turning into a farce.”AWE is jointly owned by the government, through its stake in BNFL; Serco, the British support services group; and Lockheed Martin, the US defence company.Jacobs had been competing against another US engineer, Fluor Corporation, for the stake since January. The US company did not disclose the purchase price but estimates in January valued it at £100m ($150m).Bob King, officer of the Prospect union for AWE, said Jacobs was well-known to staff and he hoped the company would provide some financial stability.But politically he admitted it was “a sad day” that Britain’s nuclear deterrent was now majority US controlled."
435;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-12-02T00:27:46Z;Affordability is a key asset for JSF;;The mission statement for the F-35 Lightning II or Joint Strike Fighter has not changed since the programme’s inception in the mid-1990s.It reads: “Be the model acquisition programme for joint service and international co-operation. Deliver to our war fighters an affordable and effective next-generation fighter weapon and sustain it worldwide.”The key word in this military-management speak is “affordable”. The main driver when the programme was first conceived was to manage what no one had ever managed to do before, to build a highly capable fighter at a relatively low price.The current cost range for an F-35 is between $49m and $65m, depending on the variant. This compares with an estimated cost of $135m for the F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin’s most recent fighter jet, and about £60m ($90m) for the Eurofighter Typhoon.Pentagon planners wanted to build an economical, low-cost next-generation fighter jet that would replace many of the different fighters operated by the US air force, navy and marines. Commonality across the services would save costs.But the plan was even more ambitious: to sign up as many of the US’s allies as possible, notably those nations already flying the ubiquitous F-16, to help cut the purchase price even further, as well as the eventual in-service costs, including maintenance.“It was seen as a way of getting economies of scale,” says Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin vice-president and general manager of the programme.In practice, the F-35 is a family of three fighter jets, all assembled on the same production line by Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, with at least 70 per cent component commonality.The first variant, which will be bought by the US Air Force and most allies, is a conventional fighter designed for standard airstrips.The second version, bigger and sturdier, is for the US Navy and is designed to operate from aircraft carriers.The third and most complicated version is a “jump jet”, designed to replace the Harrier aircraft operated by the US marines and the UK’s Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.In the US, once in service, the F-35 will be the main combat aircraft for the navy, the air force and the marine corps, replacing the F-16, the Harrier and the older versions of the F/A-18 Hornet.Apart from costs, keeping the programme’s international partners happy has been a challenge from the start.The UK is the only “level one” partner on the programme, which gives it direct influence on the make-up of the aircraft. The UK’s BAE Systems, along with America’s Northrop Grumman, are the two industrial partners on the programme with Lockheed Martin.While the UK has no complaints about the work it has won on the programme – the value of the work to the UK supplier base is estimated to be as high as $30bn – there have been persistent concerns that US arms export controls will prevent it from gaining access to some of the technology on the aircraft to allow its armed forces to operate it independently.Negotiations between the UK and the US on this point have been protracted, with the UK at one point threatening to pull out if its concerns were not met.Mr Burbage insists that issues over this transfer of technology have now been resolved.“The UK can have the operational solution,” he says, adding that “team JSF will provide the through-life support” for the aircraft.John Osborn, US general manager of the F-35 for BAE Systems, says: “We know we have affordability problems. The biggest challenge is managing this transition through to production. Next year is the first year that more money will be spent on production rather than development.”Another nation, Norway, which last month agreed to buy the F-35, at one point expressed concerns and looked at alternative aircraft when Norwegian companies did not get the share of work that the government had expected.………….Lockheed Martin veteran and former test pilot remains in controlManagement continuity on high-risk, complex defence programmes is rare but Tom Burbage, a Lockheed Martin veteran, joined the F-35 Lightning II programme about a year before the company was selected as the prime contractor in 2000 and has been there ever since.The 61-year-old began his career not in the corporate sector but as a naval aviator following in the steps of his father. All Burbage junior ever wanted to do, he says, was fly.He accumulated thousands of hours flying different aircraft as a US navy test pilot, but in 1980, with a young family to look after, he decided it was time for a change.The corporate world beckoned and he joined Lockheed Martin, becoming manager of business development for US government programmes in Burbank.He was later appointed vice-president for operations in Washington DC, a move he describes as “his one big break”.The position brought him vital experience of the corridors of power in Washington DC, experience that helped him when he launched the F-22 fighter jet in the late 1990s and now the F-35.Until 2004, Mr Burbage was the sole programme manager but it became so big, he says, “it was hard to keep it positioned in the outside world and run the day-to-day details”.The company hired a co-manager to run the daily operations, leaving Mr Burbage free to “concentrate on getting international customers over the line, working the congressional and the budgetary issues”.He is acutely aware of the challenge he faces, not least because his job entails keeping two parties happy: his bosses at Lockheed Martin and the US government, notably US Air Force Major General Charles Davis, the programme executive officer for the F-35.Mr Burbage says the only way to do the job is “one day at a time …I don’t know where the years go”.What keeps him sane during his globetrotting is rowing. His ambition is to row in each of the partner nations on the F-35 programme.A highlight so far has been a session rowing with the Australian men’s national masters team.
436;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-12-01T22:49:20Z;F-35’s first battle will be over sales;;"At Lockheed Martin’s mile-long manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, the world’s newest fighter aircraft is taking shape.The F-35 Lightning II – or Joint Strike Fighter as it was known at its inception – is the defence company’s most ambitious project yet and at an estimated cost of $300bn the programme is the most expensive in military history (download graphic).It could also take on another historical significance: this supersonic, fifth-generation stealth fighter is widely expected to be the last manned fighter aircraft ever built – among the western powers, at least.For Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor, the stakes are high. The company hopes to replicate the success of the F-16, the most successful export jet fighter programme. But for the programme to succeed on that level, it needs to ensure the US’s eight partner nations on the F-35 commit to buying the aircraft.The man charged with the mission is Tom Burbage, a vice-president at Lockheed Martin and in charge of the programme since its launch eight years ago.Next spring, he and his team plan to present the partner nations with what they hope will be a contract they cannot refuse. In a departure from the norm, they will “lock in” their purchase of the first five years’ production of the aircraft, from 2014 at a fixed price.For the partner nations, the proposal would provide some predictability on cost and protection from exchange-rate fluctuations. For the company, it would help stabilise its production planning given the variability in orders and delivery times. Lockheed Martin hopes to present a plan to the partner nations in April or May so the next few months are critical.One big challenge remains cost. In the early days, in the mid-1990s, estimates put the cost of the programme at $200bn; since then that estimate has risen to $300bn.Few complex military procurement programmes escape without sizeable cost overruns. With new aircraft, weight increases are often the biggest challenge.Four years ago, problems with the weight of the most complex of the three aircraft variants – short take-off and vertical landing – forced the Pentagon to delay the entire programme by a year and add $7bn to its budget.Today, with government defence budgets already tight given the billions spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan combined with the credit crunch, Lockheed is facing an even stiffer challenge to convince its potential customers the F-35 is worth the money.In September, the US government approved the $6.3bn funding requested for next year, but the bulk of the funding is for continued development, including a second engine (see below), and only covers delivery of 14 early-stage aircraft.The first big test is in January when the UK is meant to commit to buying its first two aircraft, to be used in evaulation and training.The UK is the only foreign country to gain “level one” partner status, in large part due to the close relationship of the armed forces and because it was prepared to invest $2bn in the programme from the start. Speculation is rife the UK will decide to cut the number of aircraft it has indicated it will order.The Netherlands, another close ally, is also expected to decide whether to buy one aircraft for testing. But in a sign of just how tight budgets are, another partner nation, Italy, in October decided against joining this phase of the programme.Mr Burbage says he is confident the F-35 will prove a success but admits “it won’t be easy” getting everyone on board.Industrially, the aircraft programme is entering its most challenging phase. Delays along the way have meant the STOVL version will now be the first to enter service with the US Marines by 2012.At Forth Worth, the company has completed four test aircraft – the first one made its maiden flight in December 2006 – and another 19 test and production-model aircraft are being assembled.The company is at the point of rolling out roughly one aircraft every month on the way to a peak of one per working day by around 2015 – close to the one-time peak of 30 aircraft per month achieved with the F-16.To help the process, Lockheed Martin has radically changed production methods. Unlike the F-22 Raptor – the world’s most advanced fighter – the F-35 will be built on a moving line.The supply base also needs to be firmly in place before production ramps up.“Ramping up to one aircraft a day will be a challenge,” says Patrick McDowell, vice-president of sales and business development at Goodrich, which among other parts is supplying the landing gear. “This is tough stuff.”"
437;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-11-16T22:40:19Z;MoD orders spending clampdown;;"The general in charge of the country’s £16bn-a-year defence equipment and support budget has ordered an unprecedented crackdown on spending in a sign of the cash crisis at the Ministry of Defence.In an internal memo sent to MoD officials earlier this month, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, chief of defence materiel, says that with immediate effect “the default position is that no business cases are to be put to the approving authorities for approval”.“Projects that have already received approval are not to incur financial commitment,” he adds.The stark message is the latest reminder of the severe budget strains at the department. It has an estimated deficit of £2bn in 2008-09. John Hutton, the defence secretary, indicated earlier this month it was unlikely the department would receive any additional funds in the government’s coming pre-Budget report.In the spring, Des Browne, Mr Hutton’s predecessor, launched an “equipment examination” in a bid to reprioritise the MoD’s spending commitments.The department said it wanted to move away from purchasing equipment for the long term – equipment that could be out of date by the time it comes into service – and concentrate on supporting its troops in the near to medium term. The examination was intended to be finalised before the summer but it has yet to be concluded. Mr Hutton has, however, indicated the conclusions are expected to be published before Christmas.In the memo, Sir Kevin says the MoD should have a “clearer view of the implications of the examination soon”. “While the examination continues, and for the foreseeable future, it is important that we strengthen and broaden the existing . . . regime to ensure adequate control is maintained on expenditure.”Sir Kevin goes on to list a number of exceptions to his edict. These include: proposals that support current operations of Britain’s armed forces over the next three years; proposals that support the future deterrent programme; ones that are necessary to satisfy contractual or international obligations; and ones where the MoD has already signed a production contract.While the list of exceptions means two new £4bn aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy are safe, they do not, for example, cover the aircraft that are destined to fly off the ships. Britain has so far not signed a contract to buy the F-35 Lightning II or Joint Strike Fighter aircraft from Lockheed Martin of the US. A £16bn programme to buy a new generation of armoured vehicles for the army which has stalled in recent months also remains under threat.Even if no programmes are cut or curtailed, they will face delays as decisions are pushed to the right, something Sir Kevin admits in the memo. “These measures will inevitably have an impact on the delivery timescales for some of our outputs,” he says. “I recognise this, but as it happens we must ensure that we continue to provide the best possible support to current operations.”The MoD said on Sunday: “Spending has not stopped. We are rightly prioritising spending for operations and that continues – we announced £700m for new vehicles recently. The examination of our equipment programme is about reprioritising spending towards support for operations and driving down costs. While this continues, no decisions have been taken but we hope to conclude the exercise shortly. In the meantime we need to keep a tight control on any new commitments.”"
438;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-11-11T15:55:12Z;Aerospace: Innovation in space and on the ground;;While few could place the tiny Isle of Man on earth, it is already becoming a big name in space. There are 16 aerospace companies on the island and the sector is second only to banking in economic importance.Some £9m ($14m) has been invested in the past four years, much of it from the government, with output increasing 30 per cent, and the cluster supplies the likes of Rolls-Royce, Boeing and the US space programme.GE Aviation has a centre of excellence on the island and Manx technology reached Mars, with Nasa’s probe that detected snow on the red planet using optics made on the island by CVI, a US company.The Manx government plans legislation to ensure compatibility with existing international space law and aims to be part of the development of space tourism and possibly mineral extraction.Not many small countries have a director of space commerce. Having established the International Institute of Space Commerce – a joint venture between the Manx Government and the International Space University in Strasbourg – Tim Craine’s latest project is to get a teleport, for relaying signals to and from satellites. It would be a popular location because there is little interference, unlike in big urban areas. “There is no problem with capacity. The simple block has been the cost of moving these signals to the island,” he says, because of low volumes through the five fibre-optic cables feeding the island.The unit cost is falling rapidly as e-gaming companies and data centres build up traffic. Capacity is 0.02 per cent utilised.Much of the Manx space programme is the brainchild of Chris Stott, a Manxman who joined Lockheed Martin and was then seconded to Nasa. He saw the opportunity and like many an emigré, wanted to put something back into his homeland.Mr Stott, who is married to US astronaut Nicole Stott, set up ManSat, an umbrella company of legal and banking interests hoping to exploit the industry. Ian Jarrit, finance director, says commercial space travel is not far away.“The space industry is still very young. We are at the beginning and that is the time to get ourselves established. All these things will happen,” he says.ManSat helps companies register frequencies and provides financing to build satellites and insurance.The Isle of Man defeated an attempt by Bermuda, another growing commercial space power, to rule that its orbit slots were too close to its own.Mr Craine cites a report by KPMG, the consultants, showing that space activities brought £25m to the exchequer in the last three years. That could be dwarfed if it reaches its full potential.Back on earth, more revolutionary technology is being created on the island. Bladon Jets, founded by brothers Paul and Chris Bladon, believes it can become the first to put a miniature jet engine in a car, by reducing a gas turbine to the size of a shoebox. It weighs 2kg compared with the standard combustion engine’s 100kg.The breakthrough is a series of small bladed discs that enables compression to take place in a far smaller chamber, says Paul Barrett, chairman of Bladon Jets.Since Sir Frank Whittle invented the jet engine engineers have believed it would surpass the inefficient combustion engine. “It was obvious gas turbines would replace the piston engine. The question was when,” says Mr Barrett.While Rover had a larger jet in a prototype in the 1960s, it took too long to get going to be practical for everyday driving. Mr Barrett says the rise of electric vehicles has solved this. The gas turbine will charge the battery, which will drive the car.“You could get about 80 miles to the gallon in the average car. We are already working with a German car manufacturer. We think the potential for this is very, very big.” The first production models could be in showrooms by 2011, he says.There are several reasons for moving from Shropshire to the Isle of Man for the testing and commercialisation phase, says Mr Barrett. One is that he had already moved to the island after selling his business for family and tax reasons. Another is that the three are all motorbike mad and regulars at the TT and Manx Grand Prix. Then there are the tax breaks, local expertise and a greenfield site by the airport to build a manufacturing facility.It also helps that there are other companies in the same field, providing a wide skills base and available workforce. There are few components to ship in.Most of all is the welcome they have received. “The government and department of trade and industry have taken a personal interest in what is going on here,” he says. Perhaps the tiny island could even beat Israel to building the world’s first all-electric vehicle network.……………………………………………………………Profile: CVI Technical OpticsSpace travel appears to be light years away from a housing estate in the Douglas suburb of Onchan. Yet from an unprepossessing building at the end of a cul de sac came the lighting system that helped cameras film snow on Mars on the recent Nasa mission.CVI Technical Optics, the provider, is doing pretty well on earth too. It more than doubled worldwide exports of its laser optics and coatings between 2004-6, winning it a Queen’s Award for Enterprise this year.Helmut Kessler, the general manager, says the strategy is simple. “We concentrate on high value work. Certain products are unique to this company in the entire world,” he says. That means that there is little price pressure since clients cannot go elsewhere.The operation is part of the US-based CVI Melles Griot and its products are used in everything from laser machining such as cutting, marking and welding, to medical equipment and aerospace.“We are able to produce profitably in the Isle of Man and as cheaply as our Asian competitors do,” says Mr Kessler. The lack of a corporation tax helps but he says the location suits a research-intensive niche manufacturer. Finished components are small and high value and the raw materials are specialist metals and glass that can be shipped in relatively cheaply. And the company is likely to get more state support in a smaller country where it is more valued.Remaining at the cutting edge of any engineering sector means constantly updating machinery. When a single piece can cost £100,000, government support is useful. “The Isle of Man government is being very helpful with capital grants. We got 40 per cent towards the purchase of some optical equipment,” Mr Kessler says.Most of the 50 employees, which include the European salesforce as well as factory workers, are local hires. “It is amazing that there is a good workforce available on the Isle of Man,” says Mr Kessler. For more senior jobs it is relatively easy to bring workers from abroad. Mr Kessler himself is German but says he and his wife love life on the island.A further advantage is that there are other high-technology Manx manufacturers – US-owned GE Aviation, which makes parts for Boeing, is just next door and the government has brought 16 companies together in the Isle of Man Aerospace Cluster to share ideas and expertise.That in turn is linked to the Northwest Aerospace Alliance across the water, which boasts members such as BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. Around a third of UK aerospace industry is in the region, with almost 1,000 companies employing more than 50,000 people.Still, much of what CVI does is so specialist that the bulk of training takes place in-house, says Mr Kessler. He himself designs many of the products and likens the process to furniture designer Thomas Chippendale, who wedded eyecatching design with practical products.“It is about craftsmanship – like Thomas Chippendale, a good designer and craftsman who can turn his designs into a piece of furniture that functions,” he says. “We are in the same business.”
439;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-11-03T04:26:24Z;Delays hit MoD armoured vehicle plans;;The Ministry of Defence may revamp a £16bn ($26bn) programme to buy a new generation of armoured vehicles for the Army after mounting delays to the project.Six months after selecting General Dynamics to provide the design for the first variant of the new vehicles, the MoD has been unable to agree final contractual terms with the US group. A contract needs to be in place before the department can kick off the next phase.The project is for the Future Rapid Effects System (Fres), a medium-weight armoured vehicle set to replace a myriad different vehicles operated by the army, including the Saxon 430. A fleet of up to 3,000 vehicles could be built under contracts totalling as much as £16bn.Sources close to the process confirmed the MoD was discussing revisiting the acquisition process. They stressed Fres was unlikely to be scrapped as the capability is required by the army, but elements of it could be delayed or the acquisition process revamped entirely.“This has been the worst procurement programme ever,” admitted one source. “The entire procurement strategy has been bonkers,” said another source.The lack of clarity on the programme, coupled with the delays, has led to increased concern in the industry. Some fear the MoD’s chronic shortage of cash and last week’s announcement it was buying new vehicles for forces in Afghanistan mean it is unlikely Fres will remain in its present form.The MoD has split Fres into four industrial roles: it appointed a team from Boeing and Thales to oversee management of the programme last year as “system of systems” integrator.In May, it selected General Dynamics as the “provisional preferred bidder” to provide the vehicle design for the utility vehicle, but the two parties have been unable to agree certain elements of the final contract.The protracted negotiations have also delayed the competition for the vehicle integrator, the job of assembling the vehicle, fitting it out and making sure it can work with all the other high-tech systems in the forces. BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Finmeccanica are all in the running for the role.The MoD said it remained “committed to the Fres ­programme”.
440;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-10-29T18:00:57Z;Defence groups enter green zone;;"When a Scottish farmer applied for planning permission to build four wind turbines in a field this year, his plans were almost derailed by Aberdeen airport. The turbines were in line of sight of the airport’s radar and could interfere with it, potentially hampering air traffic, the airport said.The farmer turned to an unlikely source for help: Qinetiq, the defence and research technology group that developed radar in its formative years during the second world war.Today, it has found a new use for its expertise, adapting its computer modelling techniques to help airports, developers and energy companies analyse the impact of a new wind farm on the performance of radars. The group is also developing the world’s first “stealthy” composite wind turbine blade that will not interfere with radar systems.The farmer’s approach to Qinetiq paid off. The company proved the turbines would have only a negligible impact on the radar and Aberdeen airport withdrew its objection.It was a small victory but a significant example of how some of the world’s leading defence companies are applying their military technologies to one of the fastest-growing markets: energy and renewable energy and climate change, in particular.“Energy and environment is emerging as a key strategic focus for Qinetiq alongside security and defence,” says Mark Roberts, energy and environment director at Qinetiq.Many defence companies already use their engineering skills to provide energy-efficient solutions to the armed forces (the US army has launched an initiative to cut down on the logistical cost of transporting fuel across large battle areas), while their satellite technology has for decades been used by the military to provide weather forecasts.Until now, though, there has been little evidence of a “holistic approach” to the energy sector, said Nick Cook, founder of Dynamixx, a consultancy focused on opportunities in the energy and environmental market for the aerospace and defence industry.With government defence budgets under pressure, more industry executives are waking up to the fact that their skills, including system integration expertise and the ability to model large amounts of data, can be used to help combat climate change, the ultimate system of systems.“Action needs to be taken now and the defence industry is the best placed sector on the planet to deal with the threat,” says Mr Cook.Even Lockheed Martin is going green. The world’s largest defence company, better known as the maker of fighter jets such as the F-16, is already one of the largest providers of energy efficient programmes for utilities and federal agencies in the US but is now using its engineering expertise – it employs about 70,000 engineers and scientists – to pursue other opportunities in the energy sector.It has teamed up with Starwood Energy Group, an affiliate of private equity investment group Starwood Capital, to investigate commercial-scale concentrated solar energy generation facilities in North America.Dr Ray Johnson, chief technical officer, believes the energy market is a “good fit” with defence. “Lockheed is a national security company and we see energy as a growing national security concern of the US and our allies,” he says. Its scientists are doing cutting-edge research in areas such as renewable energy and alternative sources of power.In January, Lockheed signed a licence agreement to integrate and market so-called Electrical Energy Storage Units from Texas-based EEStor for military and homeland security applications. EEStor is developing a ceramic battery chemistry that can provide 10 times the energy density of lead acid batteries at one tenth the weight and volume.This month Lockheed was granted $1.2m (£769m, €961m) by the Department of Energy to demonstrate that ocean thermal energy conversion is possible. Although oceans do not always feel warm, the difference in temperature between the surface and the cold depths below is great enough to be transformed into electrical energy.Given the changes in weather that are taking place, in part due to climate change, predicting these changes accurately both for the military and business is another increasingly lucrative area.Raytheon, for example, has for decades supplied weather-monitoring sensors on ground-based radars, on aircraft and even space craft.The information it processes is invaluable not just for weather forecasters but also for the military, which can use it to help influence tactical decisions during a conflict. But other markets such as agriculture can increasingly profit from accurate information: farmers can use the data, for instance, to decide when to harvest.“Detailed information on weather and climate trends can be critical to improve the effectiveness of alternative forms of energy such as wind and solar power,” says Thomas Culligan, executive vice-president of business development at Raytheon.Saab, the Swedish aerospace and defence group, also supplies weather stations to the country’s transport authorities, helping them plan when to remove snow and ice from the roads.At the end of last year the company took its first step into the waste management business, investing in a company called Usitall, which specialises in waste management and energy recovery. According to Ake Svensson, chief executive of Saab, the move will allow it to export this knowledge and offer it to customers as an “offset potential” against harmful carbon emissions.“[Defence companies] can manage big programmes,” he adds. “Some of these cases are huge integration tasks, we can also provide command and control systems that have been developed for military purposes.”As defence companies identify more opportunities in the sector, there are likely to be significant partnerships with energy companies; most already admit to holding early-stage talks. But they are unlikely to start selling wind turbines in your local supermarket. The consumer market is one area that will remain out of reach.“It is difficult for us as the defence industry to approach the consumer market,” says Mr Svensson. “We are good when you have bigger customers, like authorities or major industries that need your expertise.”"
441;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed Martin expects higher pension costs;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company, on Tuesday forecast lower than expected earnings for next year due to higher pension costs in the wake of the recent stock market turmoil.Shares in the company, the first major defence ­contractor to report third-quarter earnings, dropped 7.4 per cent to $86.29 in morning trading in New York after it predicted that earnings for 2009 would be between $7.65 and $7.90 per share, well below analysts’ consensus of $8.40 a share.The company said it expected its pension scheme to lose 25 per cent of its value this year after sharp falls in the equity markets, meaning it would have to pay about $100m into its defined benefit pension fund next year.“Given the recent market activity, it should not come as a surprise to investors that pension returns have been hit, though 25 per cent down is still a sobering ­numbering,” said analysts at Macquarie Securities.Despite the weaker than expected guidance for next year, Lockheed posted healthy earnings for the third quarter, with net earnings of $782m, or $1.92 a share, which were up from $766m, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier.Net sales fell 5 per cent to $10.6bn after the company had less work on the F-16 fighter jet, which is being phased out as the F-35 Lightning II takes shape.The company also ­delivered no commercial ­satellites. For the full year, Lockheed raised its earnings per share forecast by 10 cents to a range of between $7.55 and $7.70.Lockheed also garnered some significant contract wins during the quarter, including a contract from the UK’s Office for National Statistics for support work on its 2011 census.The company said that sales in its information systems division rose 8.7 per cent to $2.95bn in the ­quarter.The company’s space systems division posted a 14 per cent drop in sales to $1.91bn due to the absence of commercial satellite deliveries.Sales at the aeronautics business fell 13 per cent to $2.92bn in the quarter, as production of F-16 jets declined. Lockheed’s electronic systems group posted a less than 1 per cent decline in sales to $2.8bn.
442;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-10-21T20:59:11Z;Poor earnings reports unsettle Wall Street;;A glut of poor corporate earnings and warnings of reduced profitability next year overshadowed a further improvement in money markets and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent at 955.05 on what was nevertheless a relatively calm day following last week’s near-unprecedented volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.1 per cent lower at 1,696.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5 per cent at 9,033.66.Downbeat figures from corporations in the industrial and technology as well as financial sectors demonstrated the toll that the credit crisis had already taken on profitability. Still, traders were more concerned by the generally downbeat mood among companies for the coming year.The technology sector was the biggest drag on the market, down 5.6 per cent overall. Texas Instruments fell 6.3 per cent to $16.85 after it disclosed worse-than-expected results after the bell on Monday.Sun Microsystems and Logitech sustained some of the heaviest losses, down 17.5 per cent to $4.77 and 15 per cent to $15.53, respectively, after updates indicated a downbeat outlook.Apple and Yahoolost 7.1 per cent to $91.49 and 6.1 per cent to $12.07 ahead of results due after the bell.Oracle was one of the few bright spots on plans for an $8bn share buyback but later fell back to stand 2.6 per cent lower at $17.69.A drop in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold profit, which lost 10.8 per cent at $32.74, also put downward pressure on materials, which stood 5.7 lower overall. AK Steel retreated 7.6 per cent to $13.96 after the group said prices would be down about 10 per cent towards the end of the year.DuPont lost 8 per cent to $33.28 after the chemicals company cut its full-year forecast.Lockheed Martin fell 9.7 per cent to $84.19 after the defence group reduced its guidance for next year on concerns of reduced military spending by the new administration.Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $38.87 after the manufacturer reiterated its 2008 forecast but predicted no rise in revenues next year.However, some in the market downplayed the significance of earnings and argued developments in credit markets would remain centre stage“Earnings are going to be some what meaningless [this quarter],” said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial, who added that some signs in the credit markets were relatively reassuring.The Federal Reserve yesterday launched a new facility to restore liquidity for money market mutual funds and rates for inter-bank lending eased further.The regional banking sector, which stood 0.7 per cent higher, overcame a slew of grim results and was lifted into positive territory by plans to join the government’s $250bn recapitalisation scheme.For example, Regions Financial gained 6.1 per cent to $11.29 even though its earnings from continuing operations fell 76 per cent in the third quarter missing analyst forecasts.On the downside, Western Union sank 17.8 per cent to $16.75 after the group warned undershot Wall Street expectations and warned it could no longer forecast long-term profits.American Express, after the closing bell on Monday, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that nonetheless beat analyst forecasts. The shares rallied 8.4 per cent to $26.39 yesterday.Also bucking the downward trend, Pfizer was flat at $17.34 after the drug group’s results beat Wall Street’s expectations. 3M rose 4.4 per cent to $60.04, also on the back of well received figures.Energy stocks were also hit as crude fell on fears of a global recession. The sector overall stood 4.3 per cent lower.Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s cut the expected 2008 dividend payment for the S&P 500 from $28.85 to $28.05, the lowest growth rate since 2001.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s ”fear gauge”, rose 1.1 per cent. At 53.253, it continued to indicate heightened distress.The fresh market decline came as it emerged that investor confidence plummeted last month, according to State Street research.
443;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-10-21T03:24:05Z;Why defence should prove to be defensive;;Shares in defence and aerospace companies are traditionally seen as a defensive investment – especially in times of market turmoil – but in recent months, even the giants of the industry have been unable to buck the downward trend.Shares in BAE Systems, Europe’s biggest defence contractor, have fallen 33 per cent over the past 12 months, although they still have outperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 5 per cent.Shares in Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, have suffered a 49 per cent fall over the year as investors fret over the group’s exposure to a downturn in the civil aerospace market.Meanwhile shares in mid-cap stocks such as Meggitt, which is also seen as exposed to the civil aerospace cycle, have been hit even harder, down 60 per cent over the period.The picture is similar across the Atlantic, where Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, has seen its shares drop 13.6 per cent over the past 12 months – although they have outperformed the S&P 500 composite index by 35 per cent.The downturn in the wider equity market has also hit some companies’ corporate pension schemes.BAE, for example, which has one of Britain’s biggest schemes, has seen the equity-related value of its pension assets drop at least 15 per cent in the past month. The defence contractor holds a large proportion of its pension scheme assets in equities – about 64 per cent at the end of last year, compared with the average holding across the FTSE 100 of about 53 per cent.Analysis by Lane Clark & Peacock, the actuarial consultants, estimate that based on overall pension assets of about £15.2bn ($26.1bn) at the end of December, equity-related losses since then would be of the order of some £3.7bn, with about £2.3bn of those losses suffered in the past month alone.However, BAE’s balance sheet will have been somewhat protected as pension accounting standards require liabilities to be measured using yields on corporate bonds, which have soared over recent months.LCP estimates that on an accounting basis, the pension deficit at the end of last year may therefore only have increased by several hundred million pounds.In spite of the market volatility and the absence of buyers right now, analysts predict that the sector’s defensive qualities – predictable earning streams, blue-chip customers such as governments and strong cash flow – will tempt investors back in the not-too distant future.A recent analysis of the UK industry by Numis Securities makes clear that both commercial and defence companies are well financed, with little or no debt rolling over in the next year or even two years.The average leverage in the sector is just two times, according to the analysis, ranging from the lowest, Ultra Electronics, at 0.5 times to Aero Inventory, at 3.7 times. Rolls-Royce is actually sitting on net cash.All companies are also operating well within their covenants, which average 3.2 times net debt/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and 3.5 times interest cover. In addition, relatively few have facilities that mature or part mature before 2010.“This is a cash-generative sector with low risk to the ability of any of these companies to service their debt obligations,” said Numis.However, the one unknown on the horizon is what happens with government defence spending.In the UK, the Ministry of Defence is battling with a budget deficit estimated at £2bn and concerns are rife that it will have to cancel or defer some equipment procurement programmes.Nevertheless, contractors have generally remained cautious and not included any future programmes in their financial forecasts.Given the stock market volatility, it might take time for share prices to be re-rated, said another analyst. However, any further downside should be limited by increasingly attractive yields.
444;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-10-04T03:22:59Z;US defence industry attacks delay to UK pact;;Big US weapons companies have attacked the Senate foreign relations committee for its decision to delay a treaty designed to bolster Anglo-American defence co-operation until the next Congress.In a letter to Joe Biden, the committee chairman, who is also the Democratic candidate for the vice-presidency, the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) said failure to approve the treaty this year “would be an unfortunate setback in ongoing efforts to shape an export control regime that will serve America’s interests in the 21st century”.The letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Financial Times and which was co-signed by Robert Stevens, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin and vice-chairman of the AIA, said final ratification of the treaty “will enhance US national security, promote high-technology American jobs and help maintain America’s continued technological leadership in aerospace and defence”.The delay is a blow to the defence industry on both sides of the Atlantic.When the treaty was signed by Tony Blair, who was then the British prime minister, and President George W. Bush in June last year, it was heralded as an agreement to help industry support joint British and US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Washington currently reviews export licence re-quests on a case-by-case basis, and industry executives in the US and in the UK have in the past complained that it can take weeks for approval.The treaty provides for a list of approved defence contractors and would allow for more flexible collaboration.In its letter, the AIA said “this type of caseload management reform is essential to effectively address the ever-expanding licensing caseload at the State Department, now nearing 85,000 cases annually”.The committee said last month that it took the decision to defer the treaty after the Bush administration failed to address concerns that it might conflict with existing US arms export laws.One disagreement centred on whether the treaty required Congress to amend the Arms Control Export Act.The administration wants to avoid legislation, which requires approval in the House of Representatives, where there has traditionally been greater opposition to providing a special exception for the UK.
445;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-09-28T18:08:08Z;EADS chief wades into dispute over delays;;Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, has stepped in to resolve an escalating row with one of the Franco-German aerospace group’s suppliers over costly delays to the A400M military transport aircraft programme.The EADS boss is understood to have rung Jena-Paul Herteman, his counterpart at engine manufacturer Safran, to call for an end to hostilities over who is to blame for fresh setbacks to Europe’s largest military project.Tensions are mounting as EADS faces the prospect of huge penalty payouts to the seven European nations that ordered 180 aircraft. The aerospace group is adamant that it will not shoulder all the costs.“It is a question of money now. It has become political,” said one person from EADS.Safran, a leading member of the Europrop International consortium that is developing the A400M prop engines, was outraged when EADS on Thursday blamed “the unavailability of the propulsion system” for the new delay to its first flight.The French engine-maker, saying it spoke on behalf the consortium, responded by laying the blame firmly on Airbus Military, the EADS subsidiary.“It is a set-up,” a Safran executive told the Financial Times. “There have been repeated delays on the A380 [superjumbo aircraft] and A400M so the situation is not comfortable for EADS management. It is easy for them to point the finger at others and make sure everybody looks somewhere else. We delivered our eight engines to Airbus Military on time.”Safran argues that the real problems lie in the integration of the engine into a converted Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules, the model the A400m is designed to replace, at Marshall Aerospace in Britain. This is the responsibility of Airbus, according to Safran.EADS and Airbus insist that the problems are with the engine control systems software being supplied by Safran and MTU, a German member of the consortium.The row is the first public sign of growing dissension among the partners building the aircraft, while costs soar on the €20bn ($29bn, £16bn) programme.At issue is the fixed-price nature of the contract that EADS signed with seven countries in 2003. Under the contract, EADS will incur financial penalties if it fails to meet delivery deadlines.Fixed-price contracts have become notorious in the defence industry since BAE Systems, Britain’s largest defence contractor, was forced to issue a profit warning in 2002 on two procurement programmes for the UK Ministry of Defence. BAE insisted on new terms of trade and the MoD finally agreed to share the risk and rewards of programmes.
446;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-09-10T19:40:26Z;Scary sovereign funds;;"With some $2,500bn under management, sovereign wealth funds are often viewed with fear (although few run in terror from the Pacific islands’ Kiribati Reserve Fund, the oldest SWF of them all).The funds’ investment track record, however, is nothing to be scared of. Since the start of last year, for example, SWFs have pumped some $60bn into Western banks, or about a sixth of the total bank capital raised since the subprime crisis erupted. None of these investments has done well. China Development Bank’s investment in Barclays has halved, while the value of Temasek’s stake in Merrill Lynch has fallen by 57 per cent. With that kind of form, it is no wonder that Korea Development Bank backed away from Lehman, or that CDC was ordered away from buying Germany’s Dresdner.If propping up the banking system is not a socially useful role, what is? Norway’s SWF, with some $350bn under management, has an even deeper conscience. This week, it said it had sold its $850m stake in Rio Tinto on ethical grounds. Other firms it has censured include Lockheed, BAE Systems and Wal-Mart.Of course, different SWFs have different ethical and investment ambitions. Russia wants to maximise its leverage on the world, especially in oil and gas. China seems more interested in accumulating intellectual and technological nous. Meanwhile, Norway and Singapore’s Temasek simply seek solid returns. Since 1997, for example, Norway’s global pension fund has earned annualised returns of 5 per cent, before fees; OK but not stellar. Increasingly, though, SWFs are raising their equity weightings to try and boost returns. Russia, for example, plans to invest half of its National Wellbeing Fund into stocks – a level comparable to a balanced western portfolio – while Norway aims for 60 per cent. Brazil, one Bric country that few western governments fear, is the exception: it plans to invest solely in bonds, and pay down public debt. Nothing scary about that.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here"
447;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-08-08T21:16:32Z;US stocks surge on ‘watershed’ dollar jump;;"US stocks soared on Friday as the dollar saw its biggest one-day jump against the euro in eight years and oil prices plunged.The moves marked a key reversal of a trend that many investors had followed profitably for months – betting that high commodity prices would keep the dollar weak.The dollar reached its highest in five months against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, while oil fell more than $5 to $114.87, 22 per cent below its record high of $147.27 last month. The S&P 500 closed 2.4 per cent higher in New York.The shift in sentiment was triggered by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, who warned on Thursday that third-quarter eurozone growth would be “particularly weak”. This sparked talk that the ECB would be forced to abandon its hawkish policy stance and start cutting interest rates, thereby weakening the euro.“This is the watershed week for the US dollar,” said Marc Chandler, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “The magnitude of the dollar’s moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook towards the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted.” Other analysts described the widespread buying of dollars as “capitulation”.The dollar hit a five-month high of $1.5055 against the euro and climbed 1.3 per cent to $1.9189 against the pound – its strongest since November 2006.Traders said the violence of the move was testimony to the extent to which the market had been surprised by economic weakness outside the US.“Mr Trichet was unable to convince the public that the ECB had not been surprised by the eurozone’s economic downturn,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank. “Therefore, the last remaining rate hike expectations were taken off the table.”UK economic data has shown increasing weakness this week; officials in Japan warned that the economy was headed for a recession; and the Reserve Bank of Australia said it was planning to start cutting interest rates to head off an impending economic slowdown."
448;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-08-03T17:18:25Z;Qinetiq in talks to buy US intelligence adviser;;Qinetiq, the UK defence technology group, is in talks to buy a privately held company that provides top-level advice to US intelligence services, in a move that will give it access to the heart of the lucrative US defence market.The company is expected to confirm early this week that it is buying Dominion Technology Resources (DTRI) for about $100m. DTRI provides a range of consulting services and technology expertise to a number of government intelligence services and other classified customers.Under the proposal, DTRI’s founders are expected to remain with Qinetiq in an advisory role, enabling the British company to capitalise on their contacts among the US intelligence community. The American market is typically difficult to enter for foreign contractors.At the end of last year, DTRI had an order backlog of $397m until 2016. Pre-tax profit for the year ended December 2007 was $5.6m.The company, whose headquarters are in Reston, Virginia, has exploited the growth in outsourcing among US government departments. Situated just across the river from Washington, the Greater Reston area has in recent years become a hub for defence and technology companies.It boasts one of the highest-educated populations in the country and is projected to become the largest employment centre in Virginia within the next five years, according to the Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce. Aside from a cluster of small- to medium-sized companies, big employers in the area include defence groups Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, as well as Britain’s BAE Systems.For Qinetiq, the acquisition marks another step in its expansion across the Atlantic. The North American market now accounts for 40 per cent of its business, thanks in part to five US acquisitions last year. The company said in May that it had up to £200m ($395m) to spend on further acquisitions this year.Since being privatised in 2006, the former UK government research group has deliberately tried to reduce its dependency on work from the British Ministry of Defence. London still retains an 18.9 per cent stake in Qinetiq but has made no secret of its desire to sell its investment. One of the hurdles to a sale remains Qinetiq’s share price, which for much of the time has remained under the original offer price of 200p. It closed at 200.25p on Friday. The government is unlikely to want to sell its stake at anything below that level.
449;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Northrop earnings boosted by new orders;;Northrop Grumman, the Los Angeles-based defence group, on Tuesday said profit in its second quarter rose 8 per cent on the back of new orders for its military equipment and electronics, as well as one-off tax benefits.America’s third-largest defence contractor said net profit in the three months to June 30 was $495m, or $1.44 per share, up from $460m or $1.31 per share in the same period last year. New business awards won during the quarter totalled $7.5bn.Earnings from continuing operations increased to $483m, from $472m. Sales for the quarter rose 10 per cent to $8.63bn.Ron Sugar, Northrop chairman and chief executive, said based on this quarter’s solid numbers and a total backlog of $67bn, the company remained on track to achieve its guidance for 2008. “The long-term outlook for Northrop Grumman remains outstanding,” he said in a statement.Despite the strong inflow of new orders, Northrop is still waiting for the final outcome on two key programmes.In February, the company, together with European partner, EADS, beat a rival bid from Boeing to win a $35bn contract to provide the US Air Force with refuelling tankers. Boeing’s subsequent appeal against the award was upheld and the competition has been re-opened with a new contract award expected by the end of this year.During the second quarter, Northrop was also awarded a $1.16bn contract from the US Navy for the development of a new maritime surveillance unmanned aircraft system, BAMS. Rival Lockheed Martin is contesting the award. A decision on whether to uphold the protest is expected next month.Last week, the company said it was increasing its quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share, from $0.37 per share. Shares in Northrop were up marginally from their previous day’s close of $68.67 in pre-market trading in New York.
450;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
451;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-22T20:02:14Z;Lockheed Martin raises profit forecasts;;"Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company, on Tuesday lifted its profit outlook for the year after reporting strong second quarter earnings boosted by increased sales of computer services to the US government.The company said second quarter earnings were up 13 per cent to $882m compared with the same period last year, on sales of $11bn, a
4 per cent increase.A new contract to develop the Orion spacecraft for Nasa to replace the space shuttle, starting in 2010, also helped Lockheed balance a projected decline in aircraft sales this year due to lower deliveries of F-16 fighter jets.Lockheed had “a strong quarter, strategically, operationally and financially”, said Robert Stevens, Lockheed chairman and chief executive.The company said it was now forecasting 2008 earnings per share of $7.45 to $7.60, higher than its previous prediction of $7.15 to $7.35 a share in April. Lockheed also raised its sales forecast by $100m to a new range of $41.9bn to $42.9bn.Shares in the company rose more than 2 per cent to $103.91 in morning trading in New York.Lockheed, best known for making fighter jets, has in recent years focused on winning contracts outside of the Pentagon, and today is the largest supplier of computer services and support to the US government.Sales and operating profit rose at three of its four business units, dropping only at the aircraft division."
452;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-16T18:09:22Z;America’s air force misses the target;;Say what you like about the F-22, the world’s most advanced and expensive fighter jet, it is obviously fun to fly. One of these $350m aircraft dipped and fluttered around the sky above the Farnborough air show this week in a bravura show of agility.The F-22 is a supersonic stealth aircraft dreamt up at the end of the cold war to impose American air superiority over Soviet fighters. In recent exercises, its invisibility and advanced radar and avionics allowed it to shoot down 80 aircraft for every time that it was hit itself.The F-22’s party trick is to be able to pivot horizontally in mid-air as it sniffs around for a target. “The sensation is not: ‘Oh, my gosh, the nose is slipping out of control. It is ‘Oh, my gosh, I can get the nose to do what I want,’ ” said Al Norman, the F-22’s senior test pilot.What impresses the US air force, however, is not what pleases the US government. The F-22 has become a symbol of what Robert Gates, the defence secretary, has dubbed “ ‘next-war-itis’ – the propensity of much of the defence establishment to be in favour of what might be needed in a future conflict”.Mr Gates wants the US military instead to focus on the “war on terror” and asymmetric conflicts in which it has to work with allies to combat suicide bombers and insurgents in hot, dusty countries. The kind of air support that such campaigns require is helicopters and cargo aircraft, not a 21st-century stealth fighter jet.As a result, he has stood firm against the USAF’s wish to have 381 F-22s to replace its ageing fleet of F-15s, a Vietnam-era fighter that has been repeatedly patched and upgraded. The US will buy only 183 and intends to make do instead with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a forthcoming stealth aircraft that is cheaper and more versatile.Mr Gates may be right that the F-22 will prove an unnecessary precaution in the world as we know it and that five squadrons is “a reasonable buy”. But there are two difficulties with his obstinate position, one military and the second financial.The military problem is that air superiority is something the US takes for granted but is not inevitable. Mr Gates clearly believes the USAF is stuck in the past but he could equally be accused of being stuck in the present. While terrorism is the immediate threat, China’s military rise and Russia’s military resurgence are worries for the future.If it came to a “peer” battle with another military power, the US would have sheer numbers on its side. But Russian-built Sukhoi Su-27s, which have been acquired by countries including China, could match the US’s “fourth generation” aircraft – F-15s and the like – in a fight.It would require a “fifth generation” stealth fighter – either an F-22 or an F-35 – to see them off. The US should have plenty of Joint Strike Fighters: it has ordered about 2,400 for its air force, marines and navy, which are due to enter service in 2011.But the Joint Strike Fighter, which is being developed and shared with allies including the UK, Italy and Canada, was not primarily designed as an “air superiority” fighter. It is a fighter-bomber intended to be shielded by F-22s in any big battle.The second problem is that Mr Gates’ F-22 stance is financially crazy. Unlike the JSF programme, the US will not share the F-22 with its allies because it wants to keep hold of the technology. But it does not want to buy many of them either.This has made each F-22 absurdly expensive. The General Accountability Office has put the cost of each one at $345m (€218m, £173m) if the programme is limited to 183 aircraft. The marginal cost of building each F-22 is about $140m, while the Joint Strike Fighter should cost about half that sum.If the US really does not want to buy any more F-22s, the next step is obvious: it should allow its allies to buy them instead (Australia and Japan have already shown interest). This would have the dual benefit of getting more F-22s in the sky and lowering the unit price.It would also fit with the trend – especially in air force procurement – of the US sharing technology and development costs with others. The reality for contractors such as Lockheed Martin, which is the main company behind the F-22 and the Joint Strike Fighter, is that making aircraft purely for the US air force is becoming less attractive.The USAF does not hand out a lot of new contracts. Mr Gates’ stance on the F-22 is part of a shift towards giving priority to the army, navy and marines. The fierceness of the current battle between Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS over the $35bn contract to replace US air tankers is an indication of their scarcity.Even when the US does buys a new or upgraded aircraft, it is less risky and more profitable for a contractor if it is allowed to sell versions of it overseas. Not only can it produce more of the same thing but it can defray development costs.It is also, as the F-22 fiasco shows, becoming harder to trust the USAF. Even when it chooses an aircraft and wants to order plenty of them, it is liable to be overruled by the US government. It may not be the USAF’s fault but its grip on procurement is clearly a bit precarious.So, if I were a manufacturer, I would try to ensure that future air contracts were shared between the USAF and other countries. And, if I were Mr Gates, I would either buy more F-22s or allow US allies to buy and fly them instead. Otherwise, the F-22, astounding though it is, will have been a costly mistake.john.gapper@ft.comRead and post comments at John Gapper’s Business Blog
453;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-16T03:15:30Z;Lockheed seeks JSF sales ‘lock-in’;;Lockheed Martin is preparing to offer the international partners on its new F-35 fighter jet a one-size fits all, long-term contract in an effort to stabilise production of the $300bn programme.The proposal would bring together eight international partner governments, including the UK, which would sign up to a “consortium buy” whereby all the partners would pay an upfrontfee for the aircraft for the first few years of production.The F-35 Lightning II, or Joint Strike Fighter, is the Pentagon’s most expensive military procurement programme and is expected to transform military aviation. In addition to the US, eight partner nations have provided upfront funding and support, but none has yet contracted to buy a specific number of aircraft.One of the key challenges facing the programme’s lead contractor Lockheed Martin has therefore been stabilising the production numbers of the aircraft given the variability in potential orders and delivery times.Under the proposal, the programme’s export partners would “lock in” their purchase of the first five years of production of the aircraft – from 2014 to 2018 – for an upfront fee. This would cover the first 368 aircraft of the programme.Unlike the US, the programme’s export partners are not restricted to annual funding budgets and so could agree to a multi-year deal.Some partner nations, concerned that buying the aircraft on an annual basis could create price differentials, have been looking for predictability on cost. A long-term contract could provide the right kind of stability. The fluctuating US dollar is an added complication.According to Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin executive vice-president and head of the programme at the company, “the driving reason behind the plan is to stabilise our production planning and our production supply chain”.He said he believed there would also be additional economic benefits for the programme’s partners, although it was too early to quantify these.“Long-term contracts for a substantial portion of the early production buy should enhance [the governments’] investment decision processes,” he added.Getting the suppliers signed up is critical to the programme’s success. Lockheed Martin executives have been carefully watching the supply chain problems experienced by Boeing in the development and production of its new 787 Dreamliner.On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin said it hoped to put forward a firm proposal in March next year. Asked whether all export nations would have to sign up to the proposal for it to work, Mr Burbage said those details would be finalised over the next few months.In practice, the F-35 is not one but three similar fighters. The first, to be bought by the US Air Force and most allies, is a conventional fighter designed for standard airstrips. The second is for the US navy, while the third is the Stovl version, modelled on the Harrier. This third version will be used by the US marines and the UK’s Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.The US marines are due to be the first to receive the aircraft in 2012.
454;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-14T21:51:22Z;Warning of ‘capability gap’ in defence;;A spending gap on defence procurement between US and European governments is threatening to create “a transatlantic capabilities gap”, the head of the world’s largest defence company has warned.Speaking on the eve of the Farnborough International Airshow, Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said that although the spending gap was not a new concern, “my worry is that the cumulative effect of this differential, year after year, is creating a transatlantic capabilities gap that threatens to become unbridgeable”.The US has long outstripped Europe in terms of its defence spending: 80 per cent of Europe’s defence spending comes from just six countries.The UK spends just over 2 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence and most European countries spend less than that. In contrast, US defence spending is approaching 4 per cent of the country’s GDP.Washington also devotes “twice as much as our European partners to procurement and approximately six times as much to defence research and development”, Mr Stevens said.The spending gap would ultimately make transatlantic partnerships in the industry more difficult.“If there is not a common body of technological knowledge and practice among us, if there is a continuing disparity among the community of industrial partners such that one continues to advance and one does not, there can be no meaningful collaboration,” Mr Stevens added. If that were to occur, he said, “the prospect for a viable transatlantic defence industrial base would be lost”.Lockheed is involved in several major transatlantic programmes, including acting as prime contractor and systems integrator for the UK Royal Navy’s Merlin helicopter.It is also the lead contractor on the F-35 Lightning II, or Joint Strike Fighter Programme, to develop a next generation fighter jet. Apart from the US, the programme includes eight partner nations, including the UK, where the jets will fly off the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers. Mr Stevens said the programme will secure more than 8,400 jobs with £27bn of work for British companies.Despite his fears over the spending differential, Mr Stevens said there were some positive trends on the horizon. The US market, he said, is open to European products and interests, and US industry is willing to partner for the long-term with industry in Nato countries.He also welcomed the European Commission’s recent draft directive on defence procurement, which would open up the EU’s €80bn ($127.4bn) a year defence market to more cross-border competition.“As the commission’s directive is reviewed and ultimately implemented by the European parliament and the council, it will be important to keep the focus on openness and competitiveness,” he said. “Protectionism is not now, and has never been, a substitute for competitive strength.”Lockheed’s F-22 Raptor fighter, the world’s only operational fifth-generation fighter aircraft, made its debut at Farnborough on Monday.Lockheed is due to deliver the last F-22 to the US Air Force in 2011. Mr Stevens said he supported the position of the US government that a decision about whether any more would be built is one for the new administration.The fighter is so advanced that at the moment, under law, not even US allies are allowed to buy it.
455;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-14T09:59:47Z;UAVs: Killer drones turn benign;;Over the past year, the US Army and Air Force have been pushing to send more pilotless aircraft to patrol the skies above Iraq and Afghanistan.Once a tool primarily for military intelligence, drones have quietly transformed into offensive weapons. The US Army recently sent Sky Warriors, armed variants of the well-known Predator, to Iraq, and the USAF has the Reaper, a larger version of the Predator that carries more armament.The aircraft have become so central to military operations that the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, recently scolded Air Force leaders for not sending them quickly enough to the field.Still, the US, which operates more than 5,000 such aircraft, holds the lead in unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs in military-speak. Other countries, however, are catching up. Israel, which also has an active UAV industry, has been using armed drones in its controversial policy of targeted killings. The UK recently confirmed it had fired weapons in combat for the first time from its Reaper UAV, and BAE Systems this year unveiled its appropriately named “Fury” drone.But do not expect companies soon to play up the image of armed drones patrolling the battlefield. At this year’s Farnborough International Airshow, companies say they will push unmanned systems of many types, but very little on the armed side. Tom Cassidy, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and maker of the Predator, confirms his company will highlight the MQ-9 Reaper, but foreign sales are limited. “That’s the way it is and probably the way it’s going to stay,” says Mr Cassidy. “The US is very concerned, exporting this capability.”In general, companies are hesitant to market armed UAVs. “It’s a sensitive issue,” agrees Daryl Davidson, executive director of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), a trade group. “People also don’t want to draw the ire of protesters.”What people will see at Farnborough, according to Mr Davidson, is a number of unmanned aircraft of different shapes and sizes. The variety of drones is having a significant impact on the commercial market.“Eight to 10 years ago, a lot of people in the business were thinking that what was going to emerge were large airplanes at high altitudes,” Mr Davidson says. “It’s just the opposite, with the proliferation of very small, portable, small-footprint UAVs that can be transported in a backpack or the inside of a small truck or Humvee.”In fact, some of the biggest companies will have limited offerings on display at Farnborough. For instance, Lockheed Martin, which debuted its Polecat UAV at Farnborough two years ago, has been relatively quiet about its unmanned efforts since the aircraft crashed in testing. A spokesperson confirmed Lockheed will not be displaying unmanned systems this year. Boeing is showing off ScanEagle, used by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan. Raytheon will market an unmanned ground-control system.The push now is to move UAVs into more areas, from maritime surveillance to local law enforcement. Police departments are looking at UAVs to monitor traffic. In California, they have been used track wildfires.The military is also thinking about expanding the uses of drones. Mark Lewis, the USAF chief scientist, says: “In the broadest operational sense, trends will take us further on the path of using UAVs in ways, and for applications, that inhabited systems could not fill.”Northrop, which builds the US Air Force’s high-flying Global Hawk UAV, is similarly looking at the commercial sector. The market, according to Ed Walby, a business development director at Northrop Grumman, is similar to the satellite market of the 1960s and 1970s, when only the government could afford to build. Now, with UAVs there is “this explosion of commercial applications,” he says.For their part, companies are eager to demonstrate the softer side of UAVs, says Mr Davidson of the AUVSI. That in turn, is spurring others to get into the market, and to look for commercial applications. “The growing commercial market,” Mr Davidson predicts, “will dwarf the defence and civil markets.”………………………………………………………………In the driving seat of historyHe flew it in. And he was flying it out again. David Thomas was the RAF display pilot who flew Avro Vulcan bomber XH558 into its Bruntingthorpe hibernation in 1993. And he was in the right-hand seat when the cold war warrior returned to the air last October at the end of a unique, £7m ($13.8m) restoration, writes Rohit Jaggi.Visitors to Farnborough should on Wednesday be treated to a show by a type that first displayed at the event in 1957. They will see an aircraft whose dramatic delta wing belies the fact that it came into service just 11 years after second world war stalwart the Avro Lancaster. And they will see an aircraft that not only carried nuclear weapons, but also delivered bombs to the other side of the world during the Falklands war.Mr Thomas was at the helm of the Vulcan when I saw it take to the skies above Leicestershire last month on its last test flight in support of its permit to fly. I needed a torch to peer into the vast bomb bay, empty of everything except the ghosts of the 20,000lb nuclear weapons it was built to carry. By contrast, the area for the crew of five is tiny.Mr Thomas is bubbling with enthusiasm. “She handles like a fighter,” he says. “You don’t so much fly one as strap it on.”The Vulcan does about two gallons to the mile, not so bad given that it is a 200,000lb-plus behemoth, but the restoration team cannot hide the fact that it has relatively dirty engines. Still, the fuel it will use for a season of display flights is equivalent to just one return flight by a 747 from London to San Francisco. And the Vulcan to the Sky Trust plans to buy 558 trees to offset carbon used.If this piece of history can be kept in the air it will be used as inspiration for the next generation to carry on the UK’s tradition of engineering innovation. But the cost will run to £1.6m a year – and while Aerobytes, a software supplier, has stepped in to underwrite costs until the end of July, the future is uncertain.
456;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
457;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-07T23:12:58Z;InBev seeks to replace Anheuser board;;"Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev is turning up the heat on its unsolicited $46bn takeover bid to buy US rival Anheuser-Busch.InBev will file a consent solicitation with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to remove Anheuser’s entire 13-member board of directors and replace it with its own hand-picked slate.InBev made a formal offer to buy Anheuser, the brewer of Budweiser beer, in mid-June. Anheuser’s board has rejected the offer as financially inadequate.Within the past two weeks, InBev has identified a full slate of nominees, which includes a range of high-profile former US chief executives and other corporate officers, as well as a member of the family that has controlled Anheuser since its inception.The slate will include several former heads of healthcare giants: Ron Dollens, the former chief executive of Guidant, Dr Ernest Mario, former chief executive of Glaxo, Hank McKinnell, former chief executive of Pfizer, and Paul Meister, the former chief financial officer of Fisher Scientific.InBev’s nominees also include former Nabisco chief financial officer Jim Healey; former Trane chief financial officer Peter D’Aloia; former Pillsbury chief executive John Lilly; former Dun & Bradstreet chief executive and chairman Allan Loren; former Lockheed general counsel William Vinson; former ArvinMeritor chief executive Larry Yost; Houlihan Lokey managing director Marjorie Bowen; and Lawrence Wimbush, a law school professor and retired Korn Ferry senior partner.Adolphus Busch IV, a member of Anheuser’s Busch family who has publicly agitated for Anheuser’s current board to consider InBev’s $65 a share offer, will also be nominated, potentially rubbing salt in Anheuser’s wounds.InBev has repeatedly requested that Anheuser sit down for negotiations over a potential merger, which would create a global beer powerhouse.Anheuser has so far refused to negotiate, instead accelerating and expanding an existing cost-cutting programme that it says will boost the value of its shares.The US brewer’s attempts to make itself more cost-efficient may be aimed at convincing InBev to raise its bid, according to some insiders.But InBev, in going for Anheuser’s jugular by attempting to remove the board, may be signalling an unwillingness to raise its bid without sitting down with Anheuser executives.Carlos Brito, Inbev chief executive, said in a statement: “Our strong preference remains to enter into a constructive dialogue with Anheuser-Busch to achieve a friendly combination that comprehensively addresses the interests of all constituents.”There was no immediate response from Anheuser.Several of the nominees who will be floated by InBev stepped forward on their own, while others were approached, one insider said.If InBev’s bold move does not draw Anheuser to the negotiating table, the development may give Anheuser’s shareholders a chance to determine the company’s fate on their own."
458;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-07-02T02:13:01Z;Defence options put Romania in the hot seat;;Romania is reconsidering a planned €4.5bn ($7.11bn) jet fighter order to secure funds for other defence needs and please both the US and its European strategic partners.The former communist country, which belongs to the European Union and Nato and hosts a small US base, is under pressure to choose between US and European defence companies for the fighter contract – and to find money for helicopters and other equipment needed to support its contingents in Iraq and Afghanistan.Last year, the country’s National Defence Council authorised spending up to €4.5bn ($7bn, £3.5bn) on 48 fighters to replace its ageing fleet of Mig-21s, which will no longer be airworthy after 2011. Officials say three companies – Lockheed Martin of the US, Sweden’s Gripen and the Eurofighter consortium – will be invited to place bids later this year, with a final decision not expected until after general elections, which are likely to take place in November.But some defence officials say Romania no longer needs four squadrons of fighters. Officials are now looking at spending half the money on equipment such as helicopters, armoured personnel carriers and drones.“We aren’t so rich as to be able to buy everything our armed forces might need,” Corneliu Dobritoiu, Romania’s secretary of state for defence policy, said. There was a need to be selective, he said, adding that approximately half the budget available for fighter procurement could be spent on equipment to provide greater protection to soldiers in the field.At the heart of the debate is a division between the country’s government and Traian Basescu, the president, over Romania’s strategic needs. Mr Basescu, an Atlanticist by temperament, is believed to favour the US contractor, while the government, led by Calin Popescu Tariceanu, is inclined towards Europe.Sorin Ionita, research director at the Romanian Academic Society, a think-tank, said: “The president leans further in one direction, while the prime minister leans in the other direction. It’s partly the result of their job descriptions: the president is responsible for foreign policy and security, where the government is in charge of domestic policy, 75 per cent of which is about European issues.”Mr Dobritoiu agreed that keeping both Romania’s strategic partners happy would be a priority when the decision is taken. “We need to open ourselves in a balanced way to the two major markets …to cover the modernisation needs of the Romanian armed forces in a way to maximise its operational returns at the most cost-effective prices in a way that pleases everybody.”“We need to make sure we can interoperate both with Nato and the EU.”Interoperability and training costs are a concern for the Romanian defence establishment, which would like to upgrade to the US-made Joint Strike Fighter. Similarities between the F-16 and JSF would mean less money would need to be spent on retraining and new weapons systems, while opting for the cheaper option of refurbished F-16s now would make it easier for the armed forces to secure a budget to upgrade to a more up-to-date aircraft later.Lockheed Martin appears confident of its chances. Romanian law requires that military contractors offer industrial offsets of 80 per cent. In spite of this, when the US Department of Defense in April notified Congress of the possible sale of 48 F-16s to Romania for $4.5bn, it stated that the deal made no provision for offsets.Gripen, which would charge less than €3bn for 48 fighters, is prepared to offer 100 per cent industrial offset. Eurofighter is also understood to be prepared to offer offsets for the refurbished Italian air force Eurofighters it proposes to provide.Officials at the defence ministry are working on a proposal to buy two squadrons of refurbished Lockheed Martin F-16s. That would leave slightly more than €2bn for other battlefield support equipment that would be more useful in theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan. These contracts could be awarded to European contractors.
459;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-05-28T21:41:26Z;Energy investor presses tax credit extension;;A leading US private equity group is turning up the heat on Congress to extend a tax incentive for solar energy that spurred its plans to invest in the sector last year.Starwood Energy, a unit of Starwood Capital, which is run by Barry Sternlicht, the real-estate and buy-out investor, said last November that it would team up with Lockheed Martin, the defence company, to develop solar energy fields in the southwestern US.The two calculated that the solar power market could be worth $30bn (€19.2bn, £15.1bn) within 10 years, but their deal hinges on the extension of a 30 per cent tax credit for solar investments.The tax break, which will cost the US government $1.4bn, has been mired in congressional gridlock for six months, and a Starwood official told the Financial Times that unless the credit was extended, investments in solar power could dry up.“We are really on the cusp of the utility solar energy industry moving to become a business sector of substantial scale and not a lab experiment,” said Madison Grose, senior managing director of Starwood Energy.“Folks like us are ready to do the hard work and provide the elbow grease to make this happen, and it is frustrating that Congress and the administration cannot get it passed.”As prices of traditional energy sources such as oil have soared, so has the demand for renewable sources such as solar, wind and biofuels. This has encouraged large investors to plough money into renewable energy, which was traditionally the role of smaller venture capital companies. For example, Boone Pickens, the veteran Texas-based investor, is planning a $2bn move into wind energy.However, solar technology has not advanced enough for buy-out groups to expect a rate of return in excess of 15 or 20 per cent – the typical rate expected by private equity groups – without the preferential tax treatment. “Without the tax credit the costs are prohibitive,” said Grose. “With it, these projects can deliver energy at a price that is competitive at a time when costs of conventional fuels are rising.”Although tax breaks for renewable energy have widespread bipartisan support in Congress, wrangling over how to pay for them has held up progress.Last week the House Ways and Means committee voted to approve a six-year extension of the solar energy tax credit, but is paying for it and other measures by ending the ability of hedge fund managers to defer US taxation from offshore earnings. While the White House supports incentives for renewable energy, it opposes the overall package. One lobbyist said there remained a slim chance that the solar tax breaks might be included in the housing bill expected to be signed by President George W. Bush by July 4.Apart from Starwood, Riverstone Holdings, which raises funds jointly with Carlyle, recently committed to large-scale solar energy investments, though the projects will initially occur outside the US, according to one person familiar with the matter. Riverstone declined to comment. And First Reserve, a Connecticut-based private equity group, recently bought a large Spanish solar energy company.
460;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-05-15T03:20:23Z;Diversification: Search for other ways to kick the oil habit;;Abu Dhabi’s combination of energy and capital has always made industry an attractive option for an economy that wants to find the means to diversify and create a pool of quality jobs for its growing population.Industry – from traditional heavy industry such as steel, aluminium and petrochemicals to modern light industry such as aerospace, and even experimental sectors such as renewable energy – has taken centre stage on the planning table over the past few years as the government seeks to diversify the oil-dependent economy.“Industries which are capital- and energy-intensive are big pluses for us,” says Hussein Nowais, chief executive of government-owned Abu Dhabi Basic Industries Corporation, or Adbic. “We’re going into aluminum, petrochemicals, steel – these industries are highly automated and don’t need a lot of labour, so we can train our own people for them,” he says.Mubadala’s joint venture with Dubai Aluminium Company, Emal, will start producing aluminium in April 2010. The first phase is scheduled for completion in 2011 with a capacity of 750,000 metric tons. Adbic has already committed $2bn to plans to multiply the capacity of the emirate’s steel smelter over the next four years from 700,000 tons a year to 5m tons a year.That Abu Dhabi has the financial muscle to back – and get reasonable spreads on – its debt in notoriously difficult times for credit markets is uncontested, but the main challenge remains access to gas.Abu Dhabi may straddle the world’s fifth-largest gas reserves, but the costs and delays in turning its large reservoirs of dangerous sour gas, which is expensive to process, threaten to undermine broader industrial strategy.Mr Nowais concedes that the rapid development of real estate, tourism and industrial projects, along with the need for gas to re-inject into oil fields to maintain production, has created a potential shortage, which could take years to rectify. But he insists that the government is working hard to solve this, pointing to the expected award of a $10bn sour gas contract to ConocoPhillips. “We should streamline the execution of industrial projects and exploit gas reserves in parallel,” he says.To extract as much value from this capital-intensive production, the government is rolling out a “cluster concept”, encouraging manufacturers to congregate near main areas of production. It has already pushed the concept for basic industries, aviation, logistics and tourism.Polymers Park in Musaffah, on the outskirts of the capital, will encourage manufacturers processing basic petrochemicals products from Abu Dhabi and the wider Gulf to go into manufactured plastics. Even before its launch later this month, officials said a large number of plots had already been booked. The anchor investment is a joint venture, between Adbic and Low & Bonar of the UK, to produce artificial grass yarn.Extending the cluster concept into aluminium and steel, Adbic is also promoting Metals Park in the Khalifa Port Industrial Zone, the second pillar of industrial strategy, at Taweelah near the Abu Dhabi-Dubai border.Chemicals Industrial City will form a petrochemicals-related cluster at Taweelah, where two state entities have teamed up with Borealis to build the world’s largest green-field chemicals production facility by 2013.Looking ahead, Adbic says it is also considering building clusters around construction materials to help reduce the large amounts of specialised materials – such as pipes, ceramics and fibreglass – that the emirate is importing for its ongoing real estate boom.The strategy goes beyond heavy industry and related manufacturing. (Mubadala’s Masdar) includes plans to build manufacturing facilities for solar panels at the Taweelah zone. It is also looking closely at aerospace, competing with and at times jointly investing with neighbouring Dubai.Abu Dhabi pushed forward last year with deals with Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin that will see the emirate build its air-services business for both military and commercial aircraft.Mubadala’s Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies is seeking to expand its maintenance and repair business beyond its contract with Abu Dhabi’s national carrier, Etihad.Boeing is setting up a research and development centre in Abu Dhabi, while Mubadala’s 35 per cent stake in Italy’s Piaggio Aero Industries could lead to the manufacture of business aircraft in the emirate, opening the door to higher-end industry that Abu Dhabi wants to develop as part of the strategy of creating jobs.“And that all brings us back to aluminium,” one official says.
461;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-04-22T21:34:30Z;EADS military project faces tough timetable;;"EADS, Europe´s largest defence group, on Tuesday refused to rule out further delays and cost increases to the A400M military transport programme.Carlos Suarez, president of EADS Casa and chief executive of the group’s military transporter aircraft division, said the company was still targeting first flight of the aircraft “in the summer” but admitted that “clearly there are a lot of milestones to be achieved”.The A400M, Airbus’ biggest military aircraft development programme, is already running up to twelve months late. In November, EADS announced it would take a €1.37bn charge in the third quarter for the rising cost of the programme of which €1.1bn was at the Airbus division.“I cannot say today there will be no more provisions, but we are still comfortable with the level of provision we have already booked,” Mr Suarez told journalists in Seville where the A400M will be assembled.The programme has been hit by slow progress in engine development, schedule overruns in the systems development and the flight test programme. On Tuesday, Mr Suarez said the company still expected to roll out the first aircraft on June 26, with first flight due to take place shortly afterwards.He said the engines were “probably the most challenging part”.Above all, the programme has been hit by delays at its engine supplier, Europrop International, a consortium led by France´s Snecma and Rolls-Royce of the UK. Mr Suarez revealed the company will not be able to start the flight test programme with the final production engines; the final engine configuration will in fact not be ready until next year.The A400M was designed as Europe´s answer to the ageing Lockheed C-130J Hercules, a powerful workhorse made to take equipment and troops to some of the world’s hotspots. France is providing the nose and cockpit, the UK the wings, Germany the fuselage and Spain the tail fin and final assembly line.The sale of 180 aircraft to a block of seven European nations in 2003 was the continent’s biggest ever single arms order. In total, the company has orders for 192 orders from nine nations. The first delivery will be to the French air force in spring 2010.The company has a fixed price contract with the European governments and is expected to incur significant financial penalties for failing to meet its delivery deadlines.Mr Suarez, an Airbus veteran who was parachuted in to sort out the programme last year, declined to comment on possible negotiations between EADS and its customers about improving the financial terms of the contract, citing confidentiality reasons. However, he said the company would never again attempt a programme “of this scale and magnitude”. He added fixed price contracts is not how “military contracts are done in the US”.“It was probably not wise to launch such a large scale programme with a new engine development,” he said.Despite the risks, he said the aircraft was ”one of its kind” and said the company would consider targeting the US market. In total, the company believes it could sell between 200 to 400 of the aircraft in the next 15 to 20 years."
462;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-04-22T12:55:56Z;Lockheed beats forecasts;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, on Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings ahead of expectations and raised its full-year outlook.Improved sales of space equipment and weapons offset weaker revenues from the company’s fighter jet unit.Lockheed said it earned $730m, or $1.75 a share, up from $690m, or $1.60 in the first quarter of last year. Revenue was $9.98bn for the quarter, up from $9.27bn last year.Analysts had been expecting earnings per share of about $1.63 on sales of $9.69bn.The company also raised its outlook for 2008 by 10 cents, saying it expected to earn between $7.15 and $7.35 a share for the full year on revenue of $41.8bn to $42.8bn, with much of the improvement to come in its space division.Lockheed’s aeronautics business is seeing a slowdown in US sales of the F-16, an older fighter jet. However, the company is benefiting from international F-16 sales and US Air Force orders for the F-22 Raptor.Lockheed is also lead contractor on the Pentagon’s $300bn F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, one of the most expensive weapons programmes in US history.
463;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-03-28T15:54:10Z;A good time to build exposure to the US large-caps;;"News from across the pond has been rather depressing in recent weeks. More strife is likely on Wall Street following the proposed takeover of the stricken bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase.The confidence of American consumers is low, and falling house prices indicate that the US property market outlook will be bleak for months to come.But contrarian equity fund managers are less
pessimistic about the state of the US economy.They say UK investors can find value in certain sectors, particularly if they focus on buying large-cap companies with a broad international reach, which are seeing a boost in exports because of the weakness of the dollar.Indeed valuation multiples between the best and worst large-cap stocks are tight, so quality stocks are “illogically” cheap by comparison, managers say. And the price to earnings ratios for large companies are more attractive than they are for US small caps.“The performance of large-cap stocks has perked up, and we are now seeing
institutions and wealthy individuals, not to mention foreign investors, reallocate some of their assets into US large-cap funds,” says Mark Donovan, manager of Collins Stewart’s $43.5bn US Equity Focus fund.“Lower-quality/higher-risk companies have been re-rated in the past four years and now are expensive. This has allowed us to accumulate positions in larger, more consistently profitable companies that are trading at attractive prices,” he adds.Donovan favours US technology, healthcare and certain consumer goods groups. His holdings include Loews, Exxon Mobil, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Lockheed Martin, IBM, Altria, Merrill Lynch, Wellpoint
and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.David Forsyth, co-manager of Martin Currie’s North America fund, takes a similar view to Donovan’s. He has opted to buy into US and Canadian large-caps that generate at least 50 per cent of their revenues from outside the US.“The bears will tell you that the US economy is in recession and it’s deep,” Forsyth says. “You’re right to be cautious. But I was out in the states a couple of weeks ago and met with the managers of a raft of companies. The balance sheets of many of them are still sound,” he says.“We still expect good earnings growth in the first quarter from these companies – perhaps even double-digit growth. The export data are still very strong and the job data are reasonable.”Three picks of Forsyth’s are: Potash, the Canadian fertiliser producer, which is trading at 17 times 2009 earnings; Assurant, a niche company that specialises in homeowner insurance; and Bucyrus, a coal mining equipment manufacturer.“We believe in coal pretty strongly and China is one of the main drivers for coal demand. There has been a huge underinvestment in capital equipment for the mines. And Bucyrus is one of only two companies that supplies equipment,” Forsyth says.In addition to blue-chips, Andy Holliman, co-manager of Threadneedle’s American fund, reports finding value in small and mid-sized comapnies de-rated in the downturn.Two stocks Holliman likes are Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, which is now trading at twelve times forward earnings, and Republic Services, the waste management company.Advisers recommend phasing some money into the US while the market is weak.Tim Cockerill, an adviser with Rowan, suggests that investors looking for exposure consider three funds: Neptune US Opportunities, M&G American and Martin Currie North American.“These have been among the best in recent times and Martin Currie is doing particularly well at present. All three funds are flexible and not constrained by benchmarks, so they have been able to avoid the worst- performing sectors such as financials,” he says."
464;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-03-25T01:59:10Z;Fighter aircraft to miss the boat;;Early next month, ministers in Britain are expected to give the final go-ahead for two new £4bn ($7.9bn) aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. The 65,000 tonne ships will be the most powerful ever to sail in the navy but there is growing concern that delays to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme in the US mean they will be setting out to sea without their intended aircraft.The first of the navy’s two new carriers is due to enter service in 2014. The government had planned to operate the JSF from the ships. However, it emerged this year the navy would initially have to operate the latest version of the Harrier jump jet, developed decades ago.“We actually do plan to use the (Harrier) GR9 on the first of the carriers. The idea that we will have a carrier’s worth of fully equipped JSFs in 2014 is not going to happen,” said David Gould, chief operating officer for equipment and support at the Ministry of Defence.The $299bn (£150bn) JSF programme, recently re-named the F-35 Lightning II, is the most expensive armaments programme ever. Midway through development, however, it still needs to clear important hurdles.This month, congressional auditors in the US warned the programme was “over cost and behind schedule”. In its report, the Government Accountability Office warned that procurement costs were up to $38bn over budget and the development schedule likely to slip from 12 to 27 months.The JSF is billed as an aircraft that will transform military aviation. Once in service, it will become the primary fighter for the navy, the air force and the Marine Corps, replacing the F/A-18 Hornet, the F-16 and Harrier respectively.In practice it is three similar fighters. First, to be bought by the US air force and most allies, is a conventional fighter designed for standard airstrips. The second is for the US navy, while the third is a “jump jet”, modelled on the Harrier. This third version – known as “Stovl”, for Short Take-Off, Vertical Landing – will be used by the US marines and the UK’s RAF and Royal Navy.But given its size and complexity, there have been persistent concerns as to whether Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the programme, will be able to deliver on time and on budget. In the UK, defence analysts have in the past suggested a naval version of the Eurofighter Typhoon as an alternative to the JSF on the carriers.Lockheed Martin insists a US Department of Defense study due to be published next month will provide a more accurate picture of the state of the programme than the recent GAO report.The company says the first Stovl aircraft will fly this summer as planned, despite recent problems with the engine. “There will be no significant delay,” it said.Giving testimony to Congress this month, John Young, the top Pentagon acquisitions official, said: “We are trying very hard to deliver the Joint Strike Fighter within the budget. We have had some challenges. The company has not met schedules in the past. We have made choices and continue to manage.”Senior industry executives in the UK say privately they are concerned the project is still less than 10 per cent through its test flight programme.The number of test aircraft has also recently been reduced by two.Lockheed Martin says it is conducting “one of the most robust flight test programmes in history”.It will have seven aircraft flying next year: “When you have seven or so flying all at the same time, you are really knocking off test points.”In the UK, the MoD’s budget pressures, combined with concerns unit costs of the aircraft will increase, has led to speculation Britain will not buy the full complement of 150 first intended.This year, General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, chief of defence materiel, admitted the eventual number would depend on the final price, yet to be decided.Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis, said: “This is the first in the cuts in the JSF offtake. We will see more in the next three years.”…………………………………………….Harriers still jumping to it after almost 50 yearsAlmost half a century after first taking to the air, the Harriers are still pulling their weight for Britain’s armed forces – their capability upgraded repeatedly over the years.The latest version, the GR9A, is being flown on missions in Afghanistan and, if recent history is any guide, it could be flying for some years to come.What marks the Harrier jump jet out from other aircraft is that it is the only truly operational aircraft capable of short take-off and vertical landing. The first flight of the Hawker P1127, the forerunner of the Harrier family, was in 1960.The Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine is at the heart of the jet. Four nozzles direct the exhaust gases, which bypass the air downwards or backwards.Six countries operate Harriers: in addition to the UK and the US, the jet is used by Spain, Italy, India and Thailand.According to John Farley, a former test pilot on the Harrier programme, since the 1950s there have been 45 different attempts around the world to come up with an aircraft that can land and take off vertically yet fly at the speed of a conventional jet.All of them were built and funded to some degree but only three entered service: the Harrier, the Russian Yak-38 Forger and the American Osprey.
465;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US fighter project behind schedule;;The Pentagon’s most expensive procurement programme for a new generation of combat aircraft for the US and its allies is running more than 15 per cent over budget and more than two years behind schedule, congressional auditors have warned.The Government Accountability Office said the F-35 Lightning II, formerly the Joint Strike Fighter project, which is midway through development, is “over cost and behind schedule”. It warned that the procurement costs were up to $38bn over budget and that the development schedule was likely to slip from 12 to 27 months.Close to $300bn is needed to acquire 2,458 aircraft for the US marine corps, air force and navy. The GAO said $650bn would be needed to operate and maintain the fighters over their 30-year life – almost double the original estimate. The 12-year development of the jet, whose partners include the UK and Italy, is in its most challenging phase, which includes test flights and completing the software.The GAO said: “Difficulties in stabilising aircraft designs and the inefficient manufacturing of test aircraft have forced the programme to spend management reserves much faster than anticipated”.Costs have gone up by $23bn since last year alone, it said. Operating costs, projected at $346bn a few years ago, had increased because of changes in repair plans, higher fuel costs and fuel consumption.Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor on the programme, said it did not know the basis of the GAO estimates and could not comment until it had received and analysed the data.The company added that the programme remained on schedule to deliver the first aircraft to US forces in 2010.Three versions of the aircraft are to be built, including a short take-off and vertical-landing model for use on amphibious warfare vessels and aircraft carriers.
466;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Gates cool on Tokyo request to buy F-22s;;The Pentagon has not seriously considered the possibility of selling the F-22 stealth fighter to Japan despite a high-level request from Tokyo last year, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, said on Sunday.Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese prime minister, last year told President George W. Bush that Tokyo was interested in buying the sophisticated fighter, also known as the Raptor. Japanese officials were hoping the Pentagon would take the lead in urging Congress to overturn a law that bars sales of the aircraft to foreign countries.However, speaking to reporters in Australia, Mr Gates conceded that the Pentagon had not been proactive in considering the Japanese request.The Japanese government is expected to choose a replacement fighter for its ageing fleet of F-4 Phantoms this year. The air force favours Lockheed’s F-22 but Tokyo is also considering the Lockheed-led Joint Strike Fighter, Boeing’s F-15 and F-18, and BAE’s Eurofighter Typhoon.On Saturday Joel Fitzgibbon, the Australian defence minister, said Canberra was also interested in buying the Raptor. Mr Gates said he would look into the issue when he returned to Washington, but added he was not optimistic.Mr Gates is the most senior US official to visit Australia since the new Labor government of Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, took office in November. One senior defence official said his trip to Asia, which will include Indonesia and India, was partly aimed at reaffirming US commitment to the region at a time when Washington’s allies in Asia believe it has “lost focus”.At a press conference with Mr Gates on Saturday, Stephen Smith, the Australian foreign minister, urged Washington to have a constructive relationship with Beijing. He rejected suggestions that Australia’s growing economic ties with China would complicate its security relationship with the US.“We can have a very good economic relationship with China which doesn’t adversely impact on our relationship with the US,” he said. “On the contrary, we encourage the US to have a positive and constructive relationship with China.”The US-Australia bilateral talks come as Canberra strengthens its economic ties with China, its largest trading partner, and ahead of a visit by Mr Rudd to Beijing to discuss both countries’ long-term strategic goals.Allan Gyngell of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank, pointed out that, for the first time in Australian history, its big economic partner was not also its strategic ally.“It is much more complicated for Australia. We have taken a different view from the US in some circumstances,” he said, adding that Canberra and Washington differed on the need for China to devalue its currency, while Australia had also declared it would not favour proposed quadrilateral talks between the US, Japan, India and Australia.
467;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-01-25T22:06:13Z;Wall St stocks return to negative territory;;Wall Street endured one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, and closed out the period having just escaped a brief encounter with a bear market.Although the broad benchmarks closed in negative territory on Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to record their first weekly gain in 2008, and break a string of four weekly declines.The S&P fell 1.6 per cent to close at 1,330.61 points, a gain of 0.4 per cent on the week, clipping its overall loss this month to 9.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.5 per cent to 2,326.20, for a loss of 0.6 per cent since Tuesday, pulling it down by 12.3 per cent this month. The Dow slid 1.4 per cent to 12,3207.17, that left bluechips up 0.9 per cent this week, a loss of 8 per cent in 2008.At the worst moment for stocks early on Tuesday, the S&P futures contract was 21 per cent below its October peak, meeting the definition of a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite also briefly traded more than 20 per cent below its 2007 high and on Friday was down just over 18 per cent.All this came after the Federal Reserve had sliced its Fed funds rate to 3.50 per cent, a 75 basis point cut nearly a week before its scheduled January meeting. Another cut of at least 25bp is expected.Market volatility surged to levels seen last August as stocks continued to slide, and sectors exposed to the global economy, such as energy, industrials and technology, were hit hard.The Vix index, which measures S&P 500 option volatility surged past last August’s intra-day peak of 37.50 on Wednesday, before it sharply subsided below 30. Late on Friday, Vix was at 29.08.On a closing price level, the Vix has now settled above 30 three times since August. This type of pattern suggests that the market has established a strong ceiling that should hold unless there is a major shock traders say.Then, came the news of a move to help monoline bond insurers that, in conjunction with what traders said, was an extremely over-sold market, helped stem the waves of selling. A proposal to inject capital into the insurers, and thus potentially avert further writedowns among financials, who had purchased insurance, propelled the market sharply into positive territory late on Wednesday.The mood then improved as details of a $150bn fiscal stimulus package from Washington to stave off a recession emerged. The cream on the rebound came in the form of an upbeat earnings report and outlook from Microsoft on Thursday. The tech giant beat fiscal second quarter earnings estimates and raised guidance. The stock, however faded after making a high of $35 in early trade and closed down 0.9 per cent at $32.94.As the mood turned bearish on Frieday, traders said the market may not have escaped the clutches of a classic bear market. “The next two weeks are very critical and will set the tone for the rest of the quarter and a good part of the second quarter,” William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said.He said short covering rather than solid buying had pushed the market higher this week. The cautious tone on Friday also suggested that investors were reserving judgment until next week’s meeting of the Fed and the release of January’s employment report.Mr Strazzullo said that, if the major benchmarks fail to sustain their recent gains, it would mean the market was in the process of moving to much lower levels.He identified 1,150 to 1,350 on the S&P, 10,500 to 12,500 for the Dow and a floor of 1,950 for the Nasdaq as likely new ranges. “If we do not hold in here, there is a risk we see another 10 to 15 per cent washout in the major averages,” he said. This week, Citi lowered its year end target for the S&P to 1,550 from 1,675, and trimmed its outlook for the Dow to 13,950 from 15,100.Among the main S&P sectors, financials led with a rise of 7 per cent this week, and in spite of a 2.5 per cent fall on Friday. The Fed rate cut, with another looming next week, boosted JPMorgan 10.2 per cent to $43.64, while Citi rose 9 per cent to $26.64.Bear Stearns jumped 20 per cent to $87.03. Bank of America said fourth-quarter net income fell to $268m as it reported trading losses of $5.44bn due in part to writedowns of collateralised debt obligations. The stock rose 10.8 per cent to $39.48 this week.Among the bond insurers, MBIA rose 66 per cent to $14.20. Ambac reported a loss of $3.26bn after taking a $5.21bn writedown, but the stock jumped 86 per cent to $11.54, boosted on Friday by talk that investor Wilbur Ross may buy the company.Friday saw the debut of RiskMetrics Group. The provider of risk management and corporate governance products priced at $17.50 and after trading at a high of $24.45, closed at $23.75.In contrast with Microsoft, results from eBay and Apple disappointed investors. Shares in eBay fell 5.3 per cent to $26.83 this week as its 53 per cent rise in profits was accompanied by a 2008 forecast below some estimates.Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but lowered its outlook and fell 19.4 per cent to $130.01.Caterpillar rose 5 per cent this week to $65.93 On Friday the heavy equipment maker said quarterly income rose 11 per cent, buoyed by international growth. But the company expects “recessionary conditions” in parts of the US to persist.Honeywell reported 18 per cent growth in net income, and warned that the global economy would soften. The stock rose 5.3 per cent to $58.25 on the week.In other earnings this week, Hershey said quarterly profit fell almost 65 per cent and the confectionary maker predicted a drop in earnings in 2008. The stock tumbled 7.3 per cent to $34.04.Lockheed Martin said quarterly profits rose 10 per cent and the defence contractor raised its forecast for 2008 earnings. The stock rose 3.5 per cent to $105.49.Ford Motor announced a fourth quarter loss of $2.7bn and a loss of $2.8bn for 2007, as weak US operations overwhelmed stronger international growth. The stock rallied 11.1 per cent to $6.58.Xerox reported a rise in quarterly profit of 79 per cent. While its outlook for the first quarter was partly below Wall Street estimates and the stock rose 9 per cent to $14.46 this week.
468;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-01-25T16:44:35Z;Boeing, Lockheed in bomber link-up;;Boeing and Lockheed Martin said on Friday they would collaborate on developing a next-generation bomber for the US Air Force that is thought likely to carry nuclear missiles. The two companies said they were confident they could deliver the aircraft by 2018.There had been speculation within the industry that the two defence giants would compete for the contract. Their proposed collaboration echoes their joint production of the F-22 fighter jet, a programme led by Lockheed but in which Boeing has about a one-third stake.The Air Force is committed to putting the first aircraft in the air by 2018 and says it is working on the requirements needed for the programme and expects to open the bidding process next year. However, officials said this month that there will be no funding for a next-generation bomber in its 2009 spending plan, which President George W. Bush is expected to deliver to Congress early next month.Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Advanced Systems, said he expected the Air Force to start the programme in 2010. “That means it will have to start no sooner than the last quarter of 2009,” he said. He added that in order to deliver the aircraft by 2018, production would have to begin no later than 2016, with first flights probably beginning in 2015.Mr Davis said the shortened time available meant developing a brand new engine “is probably a bridge too far”. He said in order to deliver the aircraft in 2018, “the technology has to be extremely ready”.The companies would not be drawn on budgets and specifics yesterday, saying they are waiting to see the Pentagon’s requirements. However, Michael Wynne, Air Force Secretary, has said he wants the next-generation bomber to be used to launch nuclear weapons, a requirement that is likely to raise the cost of the programme significantly.Frank Cappuccio, executive vice-president and general manager of Lockheed’s Advanced Development Programs, defended the need for a new bomber programme. Pointing out that the current bomber programmes had begun in the 1970s, he said: “It’s like holding on to a 1975 Chevy. Would you want to hold on to that for another 20 years?”The nuclear requirement means that at least the first version of the aircraft is likely to be manned, since Congress is thought unlikely to approve a nuclear-armed pilotless bomber. That will limit the aircraft’s ability to loiter behind enemy lines, since pilots can only operate for about 12 hours at a time. But Mr Wynne has floated the idea that an unmanned version of the bomber could be developed. Boeing and Lockheed said yesterday they were “agnostic” about the issue.Although the lack of funding in 2009 leaves the Pentagon working to a tighter timetable than was first touted, the Air Force has also lowered expectations for the project. Having originally said it was looking for a supersonic long-range bomber, officials are now talking about a subsonic aircraft with a range of 2,500 nautical miles.The Air Force is thought to want to take at least two contractors through a preliminary design review before choosing a winner, to try to minimise cost overruns and technology problems. Mr Davis said on Friday he expected that Northrop Grumman could put forward a rival bid for the programme.Mr Cappuccio said his company had first approached Boeing and had also talked to Northrop Grumman about a possible colllaboration.
469;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-01-25T00:15:41Z;Lockheed produces fighting fourth quarter;;Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, two of the US defence industry’s leading companies, gave a boost to corporate America on Thursday by announcing healthy quarterly earnings.Defence contractors have been experiencing a boom in recent years thanks to higher weapons spending at the Pentagon. While there are concerns the sector could struggle should the US begin to withdraw from Iraq, Lockheed, the world’s largest defence contractor, is thought to be insulated, given its focus on fighter jets and long-term projects.Northrop, the US’s third-largest defence contractor, is hoping to secure future earnings by beating Boeing in a contest for a $40bn contract to build the US Air Force’s next generation of in-flight refuelling aircraft, the results of which are expected next month.On Thursday, Lockheed reported fourth-quarter profits well ahead of analysts’ expectations and raised its forecast for 2008, while profits at Northrop came in just above expectations.Lockheed said net profit in the quarter reached $799m, or $1.89 per share, up from $729m, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier, on flat sales of $10.84bn. For the full year, net profit was $3bn, up from $2.5bn in 2006, while sales were up 6 per cent to $41.9bn from $39.6bn a year earlier.The company also revised its forecast for 2008 and said it expected earnings per share of between $7.05 and $7.25, up from $6.95-$7.15. It raised its projection slightly for net sales for 2008 to $41.8bn-$42.8bn, citing strength in the aeronautics business for the changed outlook.Bob Stevens, Lockheed chairman, president and chief executive, said the results showed “our programme execution was solid, we won important new business and we continued to shape a balanced business portfolio”.Northrop reported fourth-quarter net income of $454m, or $1.31 per share, up from $453m, or $1.28 per share, in the same quarter of 2006, on a 10 per cent increase in sales to $8.8bn from $8bn. Sales for 2007 increased 6 per cent to $32bn from $30.1bn in 2006. Northrop expects earnings from ongoing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.75 per share on sales of about $33bn.
470;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-01-24T22:50:00Z;Lockheed expects funding extension for F-22;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, on Thursday expressed confidence that the US Congress would grant additional funding to its F-22 fighter jet programme, postponing the scheduled closure of the company’s production line in 2011.This month, the FT reported that the Pentagon would ask Congress to approve $500m funding for four additional F-22s.Gordon England, deputy defence secretary, had opposed extending the programme beyond the purchase of a planned 183 jets, while the Air Force has been pressing for a total of 381 F-22s.“This concept is looking more likely rather than less likely,” said Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chairman and chief executive. “There’s a fairly compelling dialogue that’s occurring in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill,” he said.Mr Stevens said the efficiency of the production line and the ageing F-15 fleet gave him the sense that “the operational tempo is not likely to diminish in the foreseeable future”.He said he would be reluctant to “shut down a line that has taken a good deal of time to bring to this configuration … There will never be a less expensive F-22 than the one we can buy off an active line”. His comments came as Lockheed Martin reported fourth-quarter profits well ahead of analysts’ expectations and raised its forecast for 2008, while profits at Northrop Grumman, the US’s third biggest defence contractor, came in just above expectations.Defence contractors have been experiencing a boom in recent years on the back of higher weapons spending at the Pentagon.Lockheed said net profit in the quarter reached $799m, or $1.89 per share, up from $729m, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier, on flat sales of $10.84bn. For the full year, net profit was $3bn, up from $2.5bn in 2006, while sales were up 6 per cent to $41.9bn from $39.6bn a year earlier.Northrop Grumman reported fourth-quarter net income of $454m, or $1.31 per share, up from $453m, or $1.28 per share, in the same quarter of 2006, on a 10 per cent increase in sales to $8.8bn from $8bn. For 2007 as a whole, sales increased by 6 per cent to $32bn.
471;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-01-24T21:31:14Z;Wall St rises in choppy trading;;US stocks rose in choppy trade on Thursday as investors digested an array of mixed earnings and renewed weakness among bond insurers after a ratings downgrade.The S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 1,352.07. The benchmark traded in a range between 1,334.31 (down 0.3 per cent) and 1,355.15 (up 1.2 per cent).Equity volatility as measured by the Vix index fell 4.9 per cent, after a tumble of 7 per cent on Wednesday.Among the leading S&P sectors, the energy sector rose 3.2 per cent, followed by gains of 3 per cent for technology and 2.9 per cent for materials. Utilities, a classic defensive sector, fell 2.8 per cent.The financials sector rose 0.6 per cent, after rising 1.5 per cent in early trade and following a jump of 6.8 per cent on Wednesday.The sector was buffeted by news that a plan to bail out bond insurers would take some time. Meanwhile, a steady rise in Treasury yields and a paring of rate cut expectations when the Federal Reserve meets next week, also took some of the steam out of the rebound.“Financials are the biggest beneficiaries of rate cuts,” said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman.While investors are hopeful that the broad benchmarks and financials have reached a bottom in price for the time being, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the plan to aid monoline insurers, said traders.Matters were not helped when Fitch Ratings cut the rating of Security Capital Assurance to A from AAA on Thursday and the stock fell 30.6 per cent, to $2.63. Ambac fell 17.3 per cent, to $11.33 and MBIA lost 13.3 per cent to $14.40 as the sector reversed some of Wednesday’s gains.As the broad market rose modestly after its sharp rebound on Wednesday, analysts warned that the worst may not be over for stocks.“Bear market rallies are characteristically brief,” said Mr Peta.The persistent slump in housing that has aroused fears of dragging the broad economy into a recession this year was highlighted on Thursday when existing home sales during December fell more than expected. The median single family home price fell 1.8 per cent in 2007, the first annual decline in four decades of data.The importance of housing prices for the economy and financial markets cannot be understated, said analysts.“As policymakers continue to confront ongoing crises, commercial paper in August, year-end liquidity in November and December, and now the prospects for bond insurers, the core threat to much of the leverage – the housing depression – continues to worsen,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.9 per cent at 2,360.92.In after-hours trade, sentiment for technology was boosted after the latest earnings from Microsoft. The tech giant beat earnings estimates and raised guidance, boosting the stock by 8 per cent in after-hours action after it rose 4.1 per cent to $33.25 in regular trade.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5 per cent at 12,378.61, after setting a high of 12,399.18 in early trade.A slew of fourth-quarter earnings results on Thursday provided a mixed read.AT&T said quarterly earnings rose nearly 62 per cent, buoyed by the addition of a net 2.7m mobile customers. It also reaffirmed its forecast for further strong growth in 2008. The stock fell 2.6 per cent to $35.75 after trading up at $37.24 in early trade.Hershey said quarterly profit fell almost 65 per cent and the confectionery maker predicted a drop in earnings in 2008. The stock declined 2 per cent to $35.68.Lockheed Martin said quarterly profits rose 10 per cent and the defence contractor raised its forecast for 2008 earnings. The stock rose 4.1 per cent to $105.90.Ford Motor announced a fourth-quarter loss of $2.7bn and a loss of $2.8bn for 2007, as weak US operations overwhelmed stronger international growth. The stock fell 0.6 per cent to $6.26.Xerox reported a rise in quarterly profit of 79 per cent. Although its outlook for the first quarter was partly below Wall Street estimates, the stock gained 8.2 per cent at $14.33.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Ebay reported a 53 per cent rise in profits, but its 2008 forecast disappointed some analysts. Its shares declined 6.1 per cent to $27.18. Meg Whitman, the company’s chief executive, will step down at the end of March.Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research said they “expect incoming CEO John Donahoe to focus on the customer experience and shareholder value”. At its current stock price, ebay “trades at about 16 time our 2008 earnings per share forecast, a notable discount to historical levels” and he said the company’s valuation is “extremely attractive.”
472;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2008-01-10T02:14:28Z;Atomic body set for US control;;The UK Atomic Weapons Establishment, which manages the Aldermaston weapons site on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, is set to come under the control of US companies.Fluor and Jacobs, two US engineering groups, have emerged as the only remaining bidders for the government’s one-third stake in AWE, which it put up for sale last summer.AWE is jointly owned by the government, through its stake in British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), Serco, the British support services group, and Lockheed Martin, the US defence group. If either Fluor or Jacobs emerges as victorious, AWE will be two-thirds owned by US companies.AWE is responsible for designing, manufacturing and decommissioning nuclear warheads for Trident, the fleet of nuclear submarines that is the UK’s sole nuclear deterrent.Although the US already supplies the technology for the weapons, the prospect that the deterrent may end up majority-controlled by Americans is likely to prove controversial.The recognition that the UK needed an independent nuclear deterrent after the second world war prompted the government to develop the facility. In 1946 Ernest Bevin, then foreign secretary, declared: “We have got to have this thing over here whatever it costs …we have got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.”Under a 25-year contract awarded to the AWE consortium in 2000, if one of the three parties wants to sell, the other two have pre-emption rights to acquire the stake at market rate.Both Serco and Lockheed have said they are keen to pick up the stake, but it is understood that the MoD would prefer it to go to a third party in order to inject more knowhow into the business. Latest estimates value the stake at about £100m ($195m, €133m).Serco said: “We are in discussions with the MoD about how best to achieve the sale of the BNFL shareholding and how to continue to successfully deliver the AWE programme.”The sale of AWE is part of the government’s plan to privatise all nuclear assets that were in public ownership. So far, foreign companies have been among the most successful in snapping up assets, sparking fears that Britain could lose valuable industry skills in the longer-term.Toshiba, the Japanese company, bought Westinghouse, BNFL’s nuclear reactor manufacturing arm, in 2006. America’s Energy Solutions won the contract to run and decommission the UK’s 10 Magnox reactors.A government spokesman declined to comment on the identity of the shortlisted bidders but said: “Any bidder would need to satisfy MoD stringent security performance requirements.”BNFL said: “We can’t comment on market speculation.”Investment bank NM Rothschild is handling the sale of the AWE stake on behalf of BNFL. A final decision on the disposal is expected in March.
473;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-12-23T18:35:05Z;Eurofighter drops Norway and Denmark tenders;;The Eurofighter consortium has pulled out of tenders in Norway and Denmark for more than 100 fighter jets, complaining that it is “ill at ease” with changes in the procurement process.Eurofighter’s “suspension” of its participation is an embarrassment for Norway and Denmark, but it also reflects the fact that it was losing ground in both tenders, which have become a dogfight between Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and Saab’s Gripen.Norway is due to issue a request for binding information early next month for its next generation of fighters and aims to choose a winner at the end of the year, while Denmark should decide in 2009.Eurofighter’s failure in its European home market comes as the UK and Italy, both consortium members, are considering cutting their orders. Eurofighter, a consortium of Britain’s BAE Systems, EADS (the Franco-German-Spanish aerospace and defence company) and Finmeccanica of Italy, has so far won contracts only for the Typhoon in Austria and Saudia Arabia outside its members’ home countries.Eurofighter’s withdrawal is believed to reflect fears that the Norwegian tender has been skewed in Lockheed’s favour because the US company will not have to make the same industrial offset commitments as its European rivals.These pledges to invest in the purchasing country are a key factor in many arms deals and have often been a trump card for European bidders in their home market.Lockheed has long been the favourite in the Norwegian and Danish tenders because both countries already fly its F-16 fighter and are part of the company’s JSF development project.But Norway insists that it has tried to open up the tender process to replace the F-16s by allocating funds for small-scale industrial co-operation ventures with both Saab and the Eurofighter consortium that could be developed into offset projects. “We have been trying to level the playing field,” said Espen Barth Eide, Norway’s deputy defence minister.Yet Norway has also informed Saab and Eurofighter that Lockheed will not have to provide the same offset commitments, because any purchase from the US company would be a government-to-government deal, making company investment pledges problematic.Mr Eide insisted that, whichever it chose, Norway would still demand investments, whether through offsets or the JSF development programme. “We will look for real industrial participation in each programme, regardless of its name,” he said.
474;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-11-28T19:31:08Z;Former defence aide held in Japan inquiry;;Japanese prosecutors on Wednesday arrested a former top defence bureaucrat as part of a widening investigation into alleged collusion between defence contractors and the ministry.The investigation, reminiscent of the inquiry into the Lockheed scandal that destroyed the reputation of Kakuei Tanaka, former prime minister in the mid-1970s, came to a head on Wednesday when Takemasa Moriya, who was vice-minister of defence until August, was shown on television being driven away by prosecutors.In parliamentary testimony in October, Mr Moriya had admitted to being treated to hundreds of rounds of golf by Motonobu Miyazaki, a former executive with a trading house specialising in defence, in breach of his ministry’s entertainment guidelines. But he denied that he had extended preferential treatment to Yamada, the company for which Mr Miyazaki worked.Mr Miyazaki was arrested this month for alleged embezzlement of more than $1m.Allegations of corruption have cast a shadow over the defence ministry, which was upgraded from an agency only last year. Yasuo Fukuda, prime minister, on Wednesday said the ministry would have to “work hard to regain public trust” as the scandal threatened to scale the reaches of the ruling party.The upper house – controlled by the opposition Democratic party – has summoned Fukushiro Nukaga, currently finance minister but previously director of the Defence Agency, to answer questions on the alleged collusion with contractors.The investigation into Mr Moriya has centred on contracts to supply engines for the Japanese air force. The defence ministry is well known for paying inflated prices for equipment, though that is partly because Tokyo insists that a high proportion is manufactured in Japan.The probe has further emboldened the DPJ, which in October stymied a bill to extend Japan’s six-year mission to the Indian Ocean, the country’s contribution to anti-terror operations in Afghanistan.The opposition has also threatened to veto a new bill aimed at restarting the operations under a more limited mandate. Its objections have led some political analysts to speculate that the Mr Fukuda will be forced to dissolve parliament in search of a clear mandate. In an interview with the Financial Times this month, Mr Fukuda hinted that he would delay an election as long as possible.
475;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Saudi oil protection force deployed;;The first trained members of a security force dedicated to the protection of Saudi oil installations has started deploying, as the government pursues its counter-terrorism campaign despite a marked improvement in security.Fear of terrorist attack on oil facilities led Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, to announce earlier this year the formation of a 35,000-strong security force to protect oil infrastructure.According to General Mansour al-Turki, a spokesman for the interior ministry, 9,000 members of the force are now either deployed or trained and another 8,000 will be added every year, to reach full strength.The new force is now working with other existing forces, including the military and the national guard, but will gradually replace these as its numbers increase.“You cannot rely on supportive forces to protect oil facilities,” Gen Turki told the Financial Times. “You need a permanent force.”The force is part of a new security system that includes surveillance equipment and crisis management, and is said to be run by Lockheed Martin, the US defence group. Gen Turki would not directly comment on the involvement of the American company but said that outside assistance was focused on the provision of new technology.The actual military training, he said, was being done by Saudis in the holy city of Mecca, taking advantage of the use of facilities for the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage, that are not needed throughout the year.After a period of denial following the September 11 attacks, which involved a group of Saudis, the kingdom stepped up its anti-terrorism campaign, recognising that one of al-Qaeda’s key objective was to bring down the al-Saud royal ­family.The Saudis mobilised further after al-Qaeda leaders called for attacks on oil installations. The most serious assault on the industry came in February 2006, when two cars laden with explosives tried to ram the gates of the Abqaiq facility, the world’s largest oil-processing plant. The attack sent oil prices up by $2 and highlighted the sector’s vulnerability. In April, the Saudi authorities said they had arrested 170 suspects, including trainee pilots planning suicide attacks, in what was described as a threat to oil installations and military bases.“There is a calming down of activity but you don’t know if it’s the real result of [government] efforts or al-Qaeda’s decision to lie low,” Gen Turki said.
476;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-11-13T13:04:57Z;VT closes in on contract wins;;VT Group is closing in on two significant military service contracts and hopes to become preferred bidder on a waste management private finance bid in Wakefield that it said on Tuesday could double its order book by the end of the financial year in March.By the end of September, the group, which is focused on shipbuilding and defence services group, had lifted its order book by £200m to £3.7bn compared with the interim period last year, thanks to a £150m shipbuilding deal for Trinidad and Tobago and regular contracts of up to £50m.Mike Murphy, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the two military deals – covering flight training and air tanker services – would take the group’s order book to at least £5bn by the end of the year.“We hope to close the MFTS [military flying training] contract in partnership with Lockheed Martin by Christmas,” said Paul Lester, VT chief executive. “That would be worth £3bn over 20 years but would generate £500m immediately.”“We hope to close the FSTS [air tanker] deal that would be worth £1.5bn to us over 20 years by the year-end and expect to hear whether we have been named preferred bidder on the [Wakefield contract] before Christmas,” he added.In the six months to the end of September, pre-tax profits including intangibles rose 31 per cent to £34.2m on revenue that rose 23 per cent to £573.1m.Organic revenue growth improved to 14.2 per cent in the period, of which just under half was from shipbuilding. The group plans to spin off its shipbuilding business into a joint venture with BAE Systems, subject to UK government approval.Following the spin-off, the group plans to focus exclusively on higher margin engineering-based services. Mr Lester said that stripping out shipbuilding, organic growth would be in excess of 10 per cent but this would be augmented by acquisitions.“We are looking at an engineering logistics support company in the US with revenues of $70m that would help move us up the value chain there,” he said, “and we are still doing due dilligence on BNFL [the state owned nuclear agency] that represents an opportunity to enter the nuclear market in the UK.”Basic earnings per share rose 40 per cent to 16p (11.4p) and the interim dividend was up 9 per cent to 3.55p (3.25p).VT Group shares rose 28p or 4.8 per cent to 613½p.
477;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-11-13T06:21:04Z;PDMS: Small, with big ideas;;PDMS is the Manx company that has helped provide a solution to the modern British conundrum of never being able to find a police officer when you want one.The software developer built “Ask the Police”, a website that is intended to reduce the number of non-emergency calls to police forces by providing the public with answers to frequent questions.The website builds on a contract already won by PDMS to supply content management and database software for the UK’s Police National Legal Database (PNLD). This gives up-to-date legal information, case law and standard offence wordings to British police forces.UK police forces are part of an impressive client roster for PDMS, which started in 1993 and now employs about 40 people.It also works for the UK’s National Health Service, while a key corporate client is Black & Decker.PDMS also develops the Isle of Man government’s internet sites.Chris Gledhill, managing director, sets great store by his view that the company works in a different way from many IT providers, which, he says, too often use the latest tools and lots of tinkering to give customers products that do not work well.The logical view espoused by PDMS is that most business systems have common requirements, which it can easily address with its core product. This cuts project risk and leaves its developers free to tailor the remaining parts to a customer’s needs.“We have drawn inspiration from the way people do things in other more mature parts of engineering – seeing which bits can be commoditised and which require skilled people,” Mr Gledhill says.“Our framework for building software works. There is no room for failure if you go through the process properly.”A big coup for the small but confident company was to be included as one of 15 companies accredited last year to develop applications for a range of UK public sector organisations, listed in an online procurement catalogue run by an agency of the UK’s Office of Government Commerce.PDMS takes its place on the list alongside the likes of BT, Lockheed Martin, Deloitte, Hewlett-Packard and Capgemini.“It was a tough examination of capability and I am incredibly proud of getting on to that list,” Mr Gledhill says. “A lot of big organisations failed. We are the smallest on the list by a factor of five and the next smallest is 10 times smaller than any of the remaining 13. We gain access to a part of the market we would otherwise get nowhere near.”With a turnover of £3m ($6.2m), PDMS still has “a way to go until we have achieved what we want”, says Mr Gledhill, who dismisses the idea of selling out.PDMS this year opened a London office to be close to customers and to draw on a wider pool of talented IT professionals.The goal remains to manage research, development and relationships from the island, where – aside from grumbles over energy costs – Mr Gledhill sees plenty of advantages.

479;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-10-17T20:36:00Z;Takeover spotters set sights on VT Group;;With a bid approach for Scottish & Newcastle, up 18.8 per cent to 756p, finally flushed out, traders were looking Wednesday for the next takeover target.Many of them alighted on defence company VT Group.Shares in VT rose 6 per cent to 616p on volumes two-and-a-half times the daily average amid rumours it had attracted the attention of a predator prepared to pay over 700p a share.Sector watchers said Serco, up 3 per cent to 434¾p, would definitely be interested but a bid from a defence company such as Lockheed Martin or BAE Systems, steady at 510p, could not be ruled out.VT has been radically reshaped under the leadership of Paul Lester, its chief executive.The company is merging its shipbuilding business with BAE so it can focus on its fast-growing defence services business.In the wider market, leading shares bounced back from two days of losses.Energised by the approach for S&N from Carlsberg and Heineken and a bright opening on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 closed 63.4 points, or 1 per cent, higher at 6,677.7.The FTSE 250 climbed 171.8 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 11,538.0.Tate & Lyle was among the biggest FTSE 100 risers. Its shares rallied 7.6 per cent to 455p on news that the European Union was minded to approve the import of four genetically modified crops that could help the price of Tate’s corn gluten.One of the reasons for Tate’s recent profits warning was weak corn gluten feed prices.In the same sector, Cadbury Schweppes rose 2 per cent to 617½p after Goldman Sachs highlighted the potential cost savings from a merger with US rival Hershey.“Our analysis, using industry average ratios, suggests that a combination of Hershey and Cadbury could create pre-tax cost savings of £319m,” said Goldman.Cadbury is understood to have been approached last month by the trust that controls Hershey.Remaining on the speculative tack, Icap, the inter-dealer broker, added 5.6 per cent to 548p on rumours that a sovereign wealth fund was quietly amassing a stake.Man Group, the hedge fund manager, rose 3.1 per cent to 550½p as the market had its first chance to react to Tuesday’s late news that the value of its flagship AHL fund had risen almost 2.5 per cent last week.Experian added 2.8 per cent to 489¾p on further takeover talk. The credit-checking company is rumoured to be a takeover target for Lombard, the consumer finance arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, up 3.4 per cent to 532p.Barratt Developments rose 2.7 per cent to 694p after three directors, including Mark Clare, chief executive, bought a total of 60,000 shares.Barratt said the purchases underlined its “belief in the potential acquisition of Wilson Bowden and their commitment to the business”.That comment was viewed as a riposte to Dresdner Kleinwort, the broker, which on Friday published an aggressive “sell” note on Barratt. In it, Dresdner said Barratt had been “an accident waiting to happen ever since the Wilson Bowden deal”.Sports Direct International, the sportswear retailer, topped the FTSE 250 leaderboard. Its shares rose 11 per cent to 156½p as a block of 10.1m shares changed hands at 144½p.Rumours of stake building by Baugur, the Iceland investment group, were played down by traders. They said Wednesday’s purchases were by Sports Direct and part of its aggressive share buyback programme.Premier Farnell, the electronics distributor, firmed 1.8 per cent to 159¾p as three directors bought stock.Cenkos Securities also turned positive on the group.Upgrading it to “buy” from “sell”, analyst David Greenall noted that Premier Farnell’s dividend yield was 5.5 per cent and backed by a free cashflow yield of 8.9 per cent.Mondi, the paper producer, rose 6.1 per cent to 450p after Merrill Lynch advised clients to “buy”.The broker noted that Mondi had underperformed its peers since it was demerged from Anglo American, off 0.3 per cent at £33.10, in July and said demand for the company’s products remained strong.
480;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-10-06T02:11:05Z;BAE misses out on army contract;;A contract for overseeing the management of the British army’s biggest equipment project was awarded on Friday to the UK subsidiaries of French and US companies, pushing aside bidders that included BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence manufacturer.The project is for the so-called Future Rapid Effects System (Fres), a medium-weight armoured fighting vehicle set to replace a myriad of different vehicles now operated by the army. Lord Drayson, defence procurement minister, said the vehicles were the army’s top equipment priority.Up to 3,000 vehicles could be built under contracts worth together as much as £16bn, increasing to up to £60bn if the costs of maintaining and upgrading the vehicles throughout their lives are included.The Ministry of Defence contract awarded on Friday to Thales UK with Boeing Defence UK was for the role of “system of systems integrator”, which is responsible for the oversight of the whole programme and ensuring the vehicles can communicate with other military assets.BAE had bid for the contract with a group led by Finmeccanica of Italy. Other losers included groups led by Lockheed Martin of the US and Qinetiq of the UK.BAE has already been eliminated from the contract to manufacture the proposed utility vehicle, the most common Fres variant for which about 2,000 vehicles are expected to be required. The announcement on the winners of that contract – between General Dynamics UK, the Dutch-German Artec consortium and France’s Nexter – is expected next month.BAE remains a bidder for other contracts, including for the vehicle integrator, responsible for integrating communications, weapons and other equipment into the vehicles. The size of the contracts also means that many other companies will be involved in the vehicles’ manufacture.General Sir Richard Dannatt, the army chief, said Fres was the army’s highest priority after support to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.In a speech in June, he said the army would be operating sub-optimally until Fres was introduced – which will not be until 2012 at the earliest.

482;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:29Z;Uncertain times ahead for missile sales;;The global guided weapons market, estimated by European multinational missile house (MBDA), to be worth some €12bn annually, has seen spectacular changes since the end of the Cold War. And there is likely to be more significant changes over the next five or so years.The impact of operations around the world has meant that US guided weapons manufacturers – Raytheon is the largest, with turnover of $4.5bn (€3.3bn), but both Lockheed Martin and Boeing also have significant guided weapons business units – have seen boom days.As the pace of operations in the 1990s was gentle, so the requirement for large missile and guided weapon production runs had fallen away. As one example, production of Paveway bomb guidance kits had ceased in 2000-01.But operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have changed this picture. Close to 6,000 TOW anti-tank missiles have been fired in Iraq since 2003, as well as over 700 Javelin anti-tank missiles. At the same time, thousands of Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) satellite guided bombs and thousands of Paveways.The result has been that US military production, and arsenal sizes have risen to rates not seen during the Cold War. JDAM kit production rose inexorably from tens per month to thousands by 2006, the same for Paveway kits. At the same time, weapons that were not in as heavy use, such as sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, and its air-launched equivalents, also kept guided weapon production rates up.The picture is not quite as rosy when one looks to Europe. The end of the Cold War saw a big reassessment of the necessity of a wide range of guided weapons programmes. In the UK, for example, the early-to-mid 1990s saw over two dozen anti-tank guided weapons programme being rationalised into three. This was not uncommon in other European countries.Although a variety of guided weapons programmes did continue in Europe, they were generally far more limited in scope than previously envisaged, resulting in lower turnover for European missile makers.The slump in guided weapons activity in Europe has continued into this decade. The UK’s Defence Industrial Strategy of December 2005 acknowledged that spending on guided weapons would decline by close to 40 per cent in the five years from 2006, as equipment projects such as the MBDA Storm Shadow and Brimstone air-launched weapons came to an end. At the same time, Italy’s guided weapons spend will half on the back of a chronically weak budget. And even France’s guided weapons spend will shrink. Forecasts say that by around early next decade, the guided weapons business environment will improve: but no-one seems to be holding their breath.However, all may not be so well in US either. Most observers are waiting to see when any reduction in operational activity in Iraq and Afghanistan will bleed into funding lines. Talk is of the “Budget Cliff”, off which the US budget may well fall. The former head of BAE Systems North America, Mark Ronald, said last year: “In 2005, I said it would be in 2006. We’re in 2006, so perhaps I should bet on 2008.” But certainly, if US forces are not involved in as intensive operations, it becomes difficult to justify extremely high production levels.Budget declines in Europe, and potential budget cutbacks in the US will drive export markets, and both MBDA and Raytheon see the Middle East and Asia as the vital terrain.Asian fears about an outward-looking, expansionist China, and a resurgent Russia, ought to act as a catalyst in several markets, primarily air defence, but also land and sea missile defence, and air-to-air weaponry.This latter market has been out of favour for some time. But the sight of a growing Chinese air force, operating advanced and long range Russia Sukhoi aircraft, as well as the reappearance of long range Russian bombers in the Atlantic and Pacific may well see a return to the modernisation of a variety of air-to-air missiles. Raytheon will be keeping its dominant AMRAAM missile upgraded, while MBDA will have high hopes for its advanced Meteor missile, due to enter service early next decade.The Gulf states also see growing Iranian military forces, again equipping with new Russian aircraft, as a threat. The potential, too, for ballistic missile attacks on oil facilities has started to drive requirements for advanced anti-tactical ballistic missiles, such as Raytheon’s current Patriot, future Medium Extended Air Defence System (a Lockheed Martin collaboration with MBDA Germany and Italy), or MBDA’s Aster Block 2/PAAMS.At the same time, growing Chinese naval ambitions, a possible reversal of Russia’s naval decline, and the growth of India as a naval power is also likely to cause a boost to the naval weapons market. MBDA especially, will be hoping that the Aster Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS), will be able to break into the naval market, which has often been dominated by Raytheon, selling the shorter range Evolved Sea Sparrow, and longer ranged Standard SAM systems.The concern for many western nations, even the seemingly resource-unlimited US, has to be what happens if operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, or even elsewhere, continue at a high tempo, and the demands of new threats arise? Could the extra hundreds of millions of euros be found in European countries, where budgets are, at best, roughly stable? And could the USA continue to fund both demanding requirements for ground equipment, as well as trying to cover all capability areas of guided weaponry?
483;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:29Z;Armoured vehicle revamp offers serious business;;Senior executives from big US defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Dynamics (GD), will be out in force at the Defence Systems & Equipment International show in London’s Docklands this week.But unlike the usual combination of glad-handing, schmoozing and tourism that characterises many international arms fairs, this time serious business is on the agenda.The British government is in what it hopes are the the final stages of deciding the future shape of its £16bn Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme, an ambitious plan to overhaul the UK army’s increasingly decrepit fleet of armoured vehicles, beginning in 2012.Across its 40-year life, the 3,000-vehicle programme – Britain’s biggest ever land systems project – could be worth as much as £60bn to contractors. When such serious sums are involved, even US companies, usually buffered by the Pentagon’s vast equipment budgets, sit up and take notice.“I don’t think some people realise that this is massive,” says Iain Burgess, head of aerospace and defence at Ernst & Young in London. “The impact of this programme will far outshadow that of the new aircraft carriers [ordered by the Ministry of Defence this year].”The new carriers have laid the groundwork for the transformation of the British naval ship-building industry, through the merger of BAE Systems’ and VT Group’s yards in Portsmouth and Glasgow. The FRES programme could have an equally profound effect on the armoured vehicle business, Mr Burgess says.As with the carriers, the future role of BAE, Britain’s biggest arms manufacturer, on the armoured vehicle fleet, will be central to the FRES procurement debate in coming months.BAE managed to establish dominance on the carrier project over Thales, its French rival, and saw off a challenge from KBR of the US. But this time it faces an arguably more serious threat from the big guns of the US industry.The MoD has split the FRES industrial roles into four. First, it is seeking a “system of systems” integrator (SOSI) to help provide the government with the expertise to run such a complex project and also determine how the armoured vehicles will plug in electronically with other battlefield “assets”, such as command and control systems, fighter jets and unmanned aircraft.Boeing, with its mixed experience of running the giant US Future Combat Systems programme, has teamed up with Thales to pursue this role, while Lockheed has joined with Ultra Electronics, a local UK supplier.Alison Wood, BAE’s strategy director, has argued that the company needs to play some part in the SOSI role to maintain its leadership in British armoured vehicles, and is thought to be considering an alliance with Italy’s Finmeccanica and possibly GD.The SOSI role has caused concern among interested companies because it remains unclear how wide the responsibilities run or the financial value of the contracts. Regardless, it will be fiercely contested because the winner would be in the box seat for any expanded role leading the entire development of the UK’s battlefield communications effort.Of even greater concern to BAE is the second role, the “vehicle integrator”. This appears to be the most lucrative position on the project, and the one where BAE could wield most power. However, rivals for the role – including GD, unless it teams with BAE, and possibly Lockheed – argue BAE may not possess the right skills to bring together all of the advanced electronic architecture on the vehicle, the key responsibility of the vehicle integrator.BAE rejects such claims and wheels out a familiar “British jobs and skills” lobbying tactic, arguing that failure to secure the role could sound the eventual death knell for its UK armoured vehicle business, also responsible for maintaining the rest of the British land fleet.The British manufacturer has already lost out on the third FRES role, the vehicle’s “design authority”. Its proposed vehicle failed to make a final cut, which will see the Dutch-German Boxer, an updated Piranha from GD and Nexter of France’s VBCI face off in a so-called “trial of truth”.BAE is confident it could still win the fourth and final role on FRES, manufacturing the vehicle at its Newcastle plant under licence from the successful vehicle designer. This “metal-bashing” role would, however, be little comfort if it lost out on the vehicle integration role.This is what makes the keen interest of the Americans so critical. Faced with the possibility of a decline in the mammoth US defence budget towards the end of the decade, Lockheed, Boeing and GD are eager to expand internationally.The UK is one of the most open markets in the world, despite BAE’s dominance, but of even greater interest to US contractors is that an armoured vehicle built in Britain would have excellent access to export opportunities.US companies looking to export are often hamstrung by the country’s draconian technology transfer legislation. A British-built product would offer a neat solution and the potential to sell thousands more FRES vehicles around the world.“As well as potentially opening up a lucrative part of the UK market, this a big reason why you have a lot of Americans queuing up to get involved,” Mr Burgess concludes. This week’s show should be testament to that.
484;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:28Z;Emerging markets to outbid Pentagon;;In the coming years, the global defence market is expected to continue to expand. While the US, the largest defence market, is predicted to remain strong in the short-term, emerging powers such as India are looking to provide new opportunities for the large defence companies.When emergency spending for the Iraq and Afghanistan missions is included, the Pentagon budget for 2008 runs neck and neck with the Dutch economy in terms of size.The top US companies – includingLockheed Martin Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, and, increasingly, European companies, such as BAE Systems and EADS – are still focusing on the American marketplace where the largest contracts are concentrated.But while spending for the “war on terror” should remain high in the years to come, defence companies are expecting tighter budgets overall when the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns start winding down. There is also likely to be a shift in priorities away from weapons procurement as the Pentagon sets aside money to build up the army and the Marines.There is a growing sense inside and outside the Pentagon that the spiralling cost of weapons programmes cannot continue at the current pace. Some companies also believe John McCain, the Arizona senator who has been a fierce critic of the growing cost of procurement, may return to bang the drum if his presidential campaign is not reinvigorated. For all of these reasons, the large companies paying more attention to newer markets – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Dassault and Saab – are among those eyeing the opportunity of supplying India with a new fleet of fighter jets to replace its ageing fleet of Russian-built MiG-21s.While India has traditionally bought from Russia and France, US companies may benefit from the recent warming in US-India relations. The US manufacturers in the fighter jet market – in addition to BAE and possibly Dassault – are also lining up for the battle to provide Japan with new aircraft to replace its ailing fleet of F-4s and F-15s.China’s emergence as a significant military power of the future however, will provide more limited possibilities for American and European defence companies because of restrictions, and concerns, about exporting there.For Europe’s biggest defence company, BAE Systems, its strategic decision to focus on the US, taken at the end of the 1990s, has appeared inspired of late, as the company profits from its position as the Pentagon’s biggest supplier after the big five of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon. At the same time, the potential pitfalls of an essentially “foreign-headquartered” defence manufacturer being too reliant on the US have been highlighted by the US Department of Justice’s decision to pick up the baton on a corruption probe into BAE’s Saudi arms deals.Many in the industry were surprised when the Department of Justice flexed its independent muscles and pushed ahead with the probe (which had been abandoned by the British), given the political cost of the US upsetting two of its key allies in the UK and Saudi Arabia.BAE has done a good job of putting an American face on its US business, which by some measures now accounts for about half of its sales – most notably under the leadership of Mark Ronald, the former head of the US business who maintains a figurehead role at the group. But it is still a British company, with a London headquarters, which may leave it vulnerable if US rivals raise the issue of national security.The strong historic performance of BAE’s US business went some way towards easing congressional or Pentagon doubts about its recent $4.1bn purchase of Armor Holdings, establishing the company as the world’s leading land systems group. Some had thought the Saudi controversy would scupper the deal, though it passed without trouble.Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, uses the deal to prove that it is “business as usual” for his company in the US. But BAE outbid all other parties in the Armor auction and the target company was not deemed strategically important by the US government. And BAE’s Saudi issues could still be used by rival lobbyists on future deals, if it comes into direct conflict with any of its bigger US competitors.BAE’s ambitions to break into the US top-five appear on hold for now, but not particularly because of the Department of Justice probe. As Mr Turner says, there is little appetite at the Pentagon for further consolidation among the top players, though this could change if the defence budget falls back from its record run.Suggestions that private equity buyers could be interested in cash-rich defence companies, which always appeared slightly fanciful given the political concerns, are also off the table as a result of the global credit squeeze.It will be interesting to see how BAE fares in the US if a troop withdrawal takes place from Iraq. It has benefited more than most through its ownership of the Bradley fighting vehicle. Lockheed and Boeing are less conflict reliant.Regardless of BAE’s travails, its European rivals would gladly swap places with the British group, though they lack the advantages of the “special relationship” between the US and UK.Italy’s Finmeccanica has seen some success in selling presidential helicopters and cargo aircraft, but is finding it difficult to secure defence electronic acquisitions.Similarly, EADS has had some helicopter success and is in the running to supply air refuelling tankers, though most experts still believe it will lose out to Boeing.It looks unlikely that continental Europeans will be able to move beyond being mere platform providers to dominant local companies such as Lockheed and Northrop, although the work will still be welcome and offers some evidence that the US is becoming slightly more open to international partnerships.Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, has used this argument to berate the European Defence Agency for looking to establish a unified European defence industry to challenge the US, though the chances of the Europeans getting their act together look as remote as ever.With the industrial crisis at its Airbus passenger jet subsidiary, a heavily weakened and cash-strapped EADS is no longer in a position to pursue its French rival, Thales.Instead, Thales is in the driving seat. It is considering bidding for parts of Safran, the French aeroengines, aerospace parts and telecoms group, and could also pursue Dassault – making Denis Ranque, the Thales chief executive, a surprise French defence industry consolidator-in-waiting.A tie-up between Thales and Finmeccanica on defence electronics appears more distant than ever, as Thales no longer needs the protection to ward off unwanted advances from EADS.The political implications of protecting Italian and French high-technology jobs also make this look like a non-starter. However, in the UK, the most important western defence market after the US, Thales appears to be facing a serious challenge.Finmeccanica has recently emerged as BAE’s biggest rival in the UK through its ownership of Westland Helicopters and an avionics business.Thales’ previous position as the natural counterweight against BAE dominance in the UK is no longer taken for granted.
485;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-08-05T20:24:04Z;Reform needed for acquisition, Payton says;;When Sue Payton became head of air force acquisitions 10 months ago, the air force was still reeling from the tanker fiasco, the largest procurement scandal in Pentagon history.In taking the job, she said she understood that the air force needed to quickly restore its image and become the “very best acquisition core in all government”. Aside from having to deal with the aftermath of the tanker scandal, Ms Payton has had to tackle the spiralling costs of weapons programmes.“One of the reasons we are overrun in cost is because we undercosted it to begin with,” Ms Payton told the FT in an interview. “We did not put all of the factors into the cost equation, or if we did, we chose to fund at a lower level … you really need to be realistic in the cost.”Ms Payton says the entire acquisition process needed reform. She says she has ramped up training for her acquisition personnel, and instituted changes to ensure project managers stay for entire phases of the programmes they manage. She has also implemented a new approach where programme managers pay more consideration to life-cycle costs, rather than just initial acquisition costs. She stresses that while this may appear to boost cost initially, it will provide a more realistic long-term estimate.“I go for that higher number now, because I don’t want the person who comes in and takes this chair after I leave to inherit the kinds of unrealistically costed weapons systems that I have inherited.”While Ms Payton wants to overhaul the acquisition process, she recognises a new irony: that losing bidders are increasingly challenging air force contract awards. In recent months, the losers of contracts for the Joint Cargo Aircraft, the CSAR-X search and rescue helicopter, the small diameter bomb and the C-130J aircraft, have all appealed the decision.One of the reasons, she says, is that consolidation in the defence industry coupled with the fewer number of available contracts, means companies that lose are increasingly in jeopardy of going out of business.She adds that the Pentagon also has less leverage to respond to frivolous protests. In the past, the air force could simply say: “Hey, you’re out of the pool, I’m going somewhere else, I don’t need this from my industry partners.”“You could blow the whistle and say we’ll see you again in three decades…Well I don’t have the luxury to do that because there is a lot of consolidation,” she explains.But while Ms Payton she says she “very concerned” about the increased consolidation, she says she cannot start awarding contracts in order to reverse the trend.“When I look at my mission, it is to deliver war fighting capability and my primary driver cannot be to manipulate or create industries,” says Ms Payton.Ms Payton says another reason for the rising number of protests is that the air force has not always clearly communicated its requirements to the defence companies. She adds that her office also intends to provide much more detailed debriefings to losing bidders in the future.While the air force has faced less scrutiny over the tanker deal this time around, other programmes are now attracting increased attention, especially from John McCain, the Arizona senator and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination who has led a campaign for acquisition reform.In recent months, the Arizona senator who investigated the tanker deal, has increasingly focused on the fifth-generation F-22 fighter jet. The air force last week concluded a multi-year purchase of up to 60 of the Lockheed Martin jets over the next three years, locking in cost savings of over $400m, or about 4 per cent.The Arizona senator has questioned whether the air force has obtained the “substantial savings” required by legislation permitting multi-year purchases.In a letter sent last week to Robert Gates, defence secretary, obtained by the FT, Mr McCain raised doubts about the cost estimates, and called for “remedial legislation” for multi-year procurement policy. Mr McCain has also sponsored legislative measures that would require 10 per cent cost savings for most multi-year procurements.But Ms Payton argues that the savings already amount to a “boat load”, saying the air force is paying $6-6.5m less per fighter than under single-year contracts. She also argues that the air force savings appear lower because the multi-year procurement deal was reached after some cost savings had already been obtained.“You have to look at the point at which you do a multi-year. We have waited until the very end of the maturity of the system so a lot of the cost had already been decreased. If we had done a multi-year earlier, I think our percentages would have been higher in savings potentially,” said Ms Payton.Ms Payton argues that the multi-year purchase will not eliminate congressional oversight, and says she intends to maintain transparency with Congress.“I want to go on the Hill and discuss with them how the savings have come to fruition…at any time, they can still intervene in any way they see fit,” says Ms Payton.The air force is also having to deal with added pressure over the C-17 Globemaster, a transport aircraft being built by Boeing. Mr McCain has questioned why Boeing has asked suppliers to switch back on their lines despite there being no new orders, or requirements, from the air force.His concerns were magnified after obtaining an air force briefing to some lawmakers which outlined that Boeing wanted the air force to give Congress a “firm indication” by June of the need for an additional 30 of the aircraft.Ms Payton says the air force was simply responding to a request from certain senators to provide a “what-if sensitivity” analysis, to consider other possibilities. But she added that there was “absolutely not a new requirement” for an additional 30 C-17s.“Should those requirements change, then the acquisition strategy changes and we are locked and loaded to get after that as fast as we can within the cost constraints and requirements, but right now, from my acquisition point of view, there are no new requirements,” said Ms Payton.
486;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-08-05T20:24:04Z;Pentagon refuses to split deal for tankers;;The Pentagon will not split a lucrative contract to supply the US Air Force with refuelling tankers between Boeing and EADS, the European defence consortium, according to a senior US defence official.Sue Payton, head of air force acquisitions, said splitting the deal for an initial 80 tankers would prove too costly at a time when the air force is grappling to fund several other expensive weapons programmes.“Because we are trying to do so much, we don’t have the money upfront that it would take to carry two or three [tankers] through development and then into procurement,” she said.Randy Belote, spokesman for Northrop, said his consortium was not disappointed. He said it understood that the air force wanted a single supplier, adding ”we are in this competition to win”.Richard Aboulafia, aerospace expert at the Teal Group consultancy, said the decision would be a blow for EADS, which is attempting to build up its presence in the US market. “Given the odds against them, a split buy would have been very welcome news. It’s better to get half of a sure thing than to be on the wrong side of 3-1 odds,” he said.“Losing the tanker bid would follow the Joint Cargo Aircraft loss. That would leave the Light Utility Helicopter and Coastguard patrol planes as their flagship programmes, with few US opportunities on the horizon.”The Pentagon was forced to cancel a previous deal with Boeing to buy and lease 100 tankers following a procurement scandal that sent a top Boeing executive and a senior air force official to prison. Later this year, it will announce whether Boeing or EADS has won a new contract worth an estimated $40bn to supply the initial 80 tankers.The air force will buy another 99 tankers from the winner at a later date as part of its plan to replace its fleet of Eisenhower-era refuelling aircraft.“We would need billions and billions and billions more dollars,” Ms Payton said.“It is a balancing act of the entire portfolio of warfighting capabilities that we need because we are catching up on the peace dividend. And we can’t afford to put all the money in tankers that it would take to do something like that.”Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said EADS had always assumed that the air force would not pursue a split purchase. But he said the company was lobbying Congress to urge the air force to consider giving it a portion of the contract.Reuters reported last week that Jacques Gansler, a former Clinton-era Pentagon acquisitions chief, had concluded in a study funded by one of the bidders that the air force could save 30 per cent by splitting the 80 tankers between the two companies.Mr Thompson said the study, which was funded by EADS, only considered the acquisition costs, and not the entire cost throughout the programme’s lifecycle.Other procurement programmes are now attracting increased attention, especially from the Republican presidential contender John McCain, the Arizona senator who has led a campaign for acquisition reform.
487;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-07-24T20:53:56Z;Foreign earnings save US blue chips;;"Foreign earnings came to the rescue of a slew of US multinationals on Tuesday, offsetting weakness in the domestic economy and highlighting their growing reliance on the rest of the world.Several blue chips that reported second-quarter earnings said their international business had outshone their US operations. They included UPS, the logistics group; DuPont, the chemical maker; PepsiCo, the soft-drinks maker; and United Airlines.The one sector that bucked the trend was defence, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, among the biggest suppliers of aircraft, missiles and information systems to the Pentagon, beating Wall Street estimates.But the results season has been characterised by the increased importance of US companies’ international operations, which have been helped by the weakness in the dollar and rapid growth in emerging markets.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, derives about half its sales from overseas and Caterpillar and IBM have both shown strong growth in international sales.UPS, often cited as a bellwether for the US economy, reported better-than-expected profits, lifted by strong performance in its international business. The 4.6 per cent rise in the daily number of packages it delivered internationally helped compensate for a decline of 0.2 per cent in the US.Rival FedEx has also been buoyed by growth abroad.DuPont cited weakness in the US housing and car markets as factors in second-quarter earnings missing analysts’ expectations. Its shares fell 6.4 per cent in late afternoon trading.The second-biggest US chemical company, which sells insulation and paints to the housing and motor industries, suffered a 2 per cent decrease in sales domestically while its overseas volumes grew by 4 per cent.PepsiCo profits beat analysts’ expectations thanks to growing demand for soft drinks in China and Europe and potato chips in Russia and Mexico.An increase in international revenues helped United Airlines shrug off concerns about over-capacity and lower domestic demand to report bullish second-quarter earnings. While passenger revenues in the Americas declined slightly, transatlantic and transpacific flights generated 25.5 per cent and 12.2 per cent more revenue respectively."
488;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-07-24T19:13:40Z;US defence firms bullish on outlook;;US defence contractors continue to reap the benefit of rising Pentagon spending as the US military remains engaged in high-intensity operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Both Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, and Northrop Grumman, the third largest supplier, reported second quarter profits which easily beat Wall Street expectations.However, the sharp rise in US military spending - currently running at more than $600bn, including supplementals - in recent years is not expected to continue amid increasing doubts about the Iraq deployment as a growing number of US politicians look for an exit from the conflict.Despite the better-than-expected performances of both companies, Bank of America analysts retained a neutral rating on the outlook for the industry, citing “the likely slowdown in defence spending as the US withdraws from Iraq, and uncertainty concerning the presidential elections next year.”Defence companies are looking to deal with the uncertain future by raising profit margins, targeting more foreign deals and diversifying. Lockheed has made strides in this direction by becoming the biggest provider of IT services to the US government.Lockheed, best known for building fighter jets for armed forces around the world, saw its earnings in the quarter jump 34 per cent to $778m, as sales rose 7 per cent to $10.7bn. Earnings per share were $1.82, beating analysts’ average forecasts of $1.52, according to Reuters.Lockheed’s share price was up 4 per cent at $103.48 in mid-afternoon trading in New York.Lockheed’s results were lifted by continued deliveries of the F-22 Raptor, the US Air Force’s latest air superiority fighter, and F-16s. It also benefited from the continued development of the $276bn F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, with first deliveries of the aircraft expected next year.Northrop, which makes nuclear submarines and warships, saw earnings rise 7 per cent to $460m, and sales reach $7.9bn. Earnings per share were $1.31, beating forecasts of $1.23 a share. Its shares were down 1.3 per cent at $77.82 in mid-afternoon trading, as sales missed expectations and volumes in its ships and aerospace divisions fell.Fresh orders for Northrop in the quarter included a $2.4bn contract from the US navy to design and build an amphibious assault ship, as well as a $191m contract to develop a new communications system for the US air force’s Stealth bomber.Lockheed raised its predictions of profit for the year, and Northrop raised the bottom end of its forecast.
489;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-07-19T03:45:24Z;Sale of stake in nuclear body under consideration;;The multi-billion pound sell-off of the government’s nuclear power interests is picking up speed as ministers consider a possible sale of a stake in the UK Atomic Energy Authority – the nuclear research and decommissioning body.A spokeswoman for UKAEA on Wednesday said that ministers were considering whether to sell part of the state-owned group.The sale of state-owned British Nuclear Fuel’s assets will continue over the next few months with the group expected to be wound up next year as part of the government’s decision to exit the nuclear business.Westinghouse, BNFL’s nuclear reactor manufacturing arm, was sold last year to Toshiba of Japan for $5.4bn (£2.6bn) and Energy­Solutions of the US last month paid £72m for the contract to run and decommission the UK’s 10 Magnox reactors.BNFL is in the process of selling its Projects Services consultancy business, with the successful bidder due to be announced in the autumn.It is understood that there has been lots of interest from potential bidders, including private equity groups as well as nuclear industry interests.This week the group said it was selling its one-third stake in Atomic Weapons Establishment, the body that maintains the UK’s arsenal of nuclear weaponsThe ownership of AWE, based at Aldermaston in Berkshire, is equally split between BNFL, Serco, the UK support services group and US defence specialist Lockheed Martin.Serco and Lockheed Martin have pre-emption rights on AWE that give them the right to match any bid that is made for BNFL’s one-third stake, and both groups said this week they were interested in exercising these rights.BNFL reported healthy financial results on Wednesday, with operating profits for the year ending March 31 rising to £164m from £148m in the previous year.Pre-tax profit was £2.3bn, compared to £240m last time, but this included exceptional gains from the Westinghouse sale.BNFL’s main activity is running the Sellafield complex in Cumbria, the UK’s biggest nuclear site.The government-appointed Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is in the process of selling off the contract to run Sellafield to a private sector bidder, with a decision expected next year.The remaining part of BNFL, the Nexia Solutions research division, is expected to form the foundation of the UK’s planned National Nuclear Laboratory.
490;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-07-10T01:21:22Z;SimiGon shares fly on Lockheed Martin deal;;Shares in SimiGon, which designs flight simulation software for the military, soared after the company announced its technology had been selected for a new Lockheed Martin training computer program.The aerospace manufacturer and defence contractor will use SimiGon’s SIMbox application to run its F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter training programme. The F-35 is a supersonic, multi-role stealth fighter designed to replace a wide range of existing aircraft.Ami Vizer, chief executive, said: “SIMbox is going to be the complete backbone of the F-35 training system.”The software will also allow F-35 pilots to use personal computers or laptops to learn and practise skills ranging from pre-flight checks to weapons handling, cutting down on time they would otherwise spend in standalone flight simulators.Lockheed Martin expects the program to be used over the whole life of the fighter jet project.Mr Vizer, a former Israeli Air Force instructor, said the deal provided “yet another affirmation of the viability of our training solutions”.“Using SIMbox’s technology extends the long-term productive relationship enjoyed between Lockheed Martin and SimiGon,” he added.SimiGon listed on Aim late last year, raising just more than half of a hoped-for £10m, at an offer price of 88p.In June, the shares hit a low of 55p after the company warned full-year revenue growth would be “significantly below market expectations” at about 15 per cent, due to delays in expected orders and weak sales of its AirTrack products to commercial airlines.But Mr Vizer was optimistic about long-term prospects. “The level of certainty we have in our forecasts for 2008 and onward has gone up significantly,” he said. “We are confident in our revenue stream going forward. This contract alone is worth more than previous annual revenues.”The shares rose 19p to 77½p.
491;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-06-15T23:05:53Z;BAE faces fresh congressional scrutiny;;Congress is renewing its scrutiny of BAE Systems in the wake of allegations that the British defence company bribed a former Saudi ambas­sador to Washington to secure valuable defence contracts.The department of justice is also considering whether it should open a full-blown inquiry into whether BAE has violated US anti-bribery laws in relation to its international arms deals.A congressional committee involved with defence trade has raised concerns about BAE after reviewing US government documents that show officials expressing serious concern at BAE-related bribery allegations.The move follows allegations that Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the former Saudi Arabian ambassador, receiv­ed bribes out of £1bn that BAE allegedly paid Saudi officials in connection with a lucrative fighter jet deal. Prince Bandar has denied the allegations.The committee wants the administration to hand over documentation BAE presented surrounding its 2000 acquisition of Lockheed Martin Control Systems as it sought approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment. The government panel vets acquisitions by non-US companies for national security concerns.In 2002, a state department memo noted that when BAE was seeking Cfius approval to acquire the Lockheed subsidiary, it had assured the Pentagon that it would adopt rigorous controls to prevent bribery. Two years after the deal, the memo continued, the US was looking more closely at BAE’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The same memo added that “this volume of allegations about one company would have triggered a DoJ criminal division investigation long ago”.BAE has come under intense scrutiny since the UK Serious Fraud Office last year prematurely halted an investigation into the Saudi deal on national security grounds. That move prom­pted the Bush administration to make a rare diplomatic protest to its close ally.The pressure comes as BAE seeks approval for its acquisition of Armor Holdings, the US maker of armour for Humvees. Cfius is close to concluding a 30-day review. The committee could extend its investigation, although that would be unprecedented since BAE has traditionally sailed through Cfius reviews.Experts say the minimal scrutiny reflects the Pentagon’s high regard for BAE, and the fact that its assets are held by a separate subsidiary with only American board members. Many ex­perts do not expect the allegations to affect the Armor deal because Cfius is charged with investigating specific national security-related issues, not alleged bribery.But the committee’s vetting process has become more rigorous since the Dubai Ports debacle. Most experts agree that Cfius would extend its review into BAE only if lawmakers began showing more interest in the bribery allegations.
492;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Japan is urged to consider F-35 jets;;Japan should consider buying the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter instead of the more advanced F-22 Raptor if Tokyo wants a fleet of next-generation fighter jets, says the top Pentagon acquisitions official.“[The F-22] was never considered for export when it was designed, developed and built,” Kenneth Krieg, the under-secretary of defence for acquisition, technology and logistics, told the Financial Times.The Raptor is the most advanced of the latest family of fighters, known as fifth generation, in production for the US Air Force. “I have supported the position that says the fifth-generation aircraft for an export market…is the Joint Strike Fighter and not the F-22.”The comments from the head of procurement at the Pentagon follows heavy lobbying of the Bush administration by Japan for the Raptor last month. Japan is expected to choose a replacement fighter for its ageing fleet of F-4 Phantoms next year. Its air force favours the F-22, which is built by a Lockheed Martin-led consortium.But Tokyo is also considering Lockheed’s F-35, which is already on order with a number of foreign air forces, including the UK and Italy. Tokyo will also assess Boeing’s F-15 and F-18 and the Eurofighter Typhoon.Current US law prohibits export of the F-22 and the US has previously rebuffed an approach by Australia, another strong US ally, for the aircraft.While some administration officials support providing the close US ally with the F-22, others, including Mr Krieg, are concerned about sharing sensitive technology. But he acknowledges he is only one part of the decision-making process. “The extent to which there is a debate and a discussion happening above me, that discussion happens,” he said. Some officials are also wary about antagonising China by selling Japan the F-22, by far the most capable fighter.Fumio Kyuma, the Japanese defence minister, raised the F-22 issue during recent meetings in Washington with Robert Gates, the US defence secretary. Thomas Schieffer, US ambassador to Tokyo, recently said he hoped Japan would end up with a new fleet that combined the JSF and the F-22.
493;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-05-14T21:53:48Z;Pentagon defends weapons-buying strategy;;Critics of ballooning defence acquisition costs are increasingly taking aim at the Lead Systems Integrator contracting model. But the top Pentagon acquisitions official says those concerns are overstated.The LSI model, under which one large company is given responsibility for managing and overseeing a complex acquisition, was introduced in the 1990s partly because the Pentagon had cut employees with the technical expertise to oversee acquisitions projects.In an interview, Kenneth Krieg, under-secretary of defence for acquisition, technology and logistics, dismisses concerns that the LSI concept – which includes programmes such as the Army’s projected $161bn Future Combat Systems and the Coast Guard’s Deepwater programme – itself has resulted resulting in cost increases.“As the most important issue on cost, I think that is far from being the most important issue on cost,” said Mr Krieg. “As far as LSIs, we only have a couple of them. Everyone is focused on the FCS programme, and it gets lots of heat and light, and there are lots of issues to worry about in terms of cost and capability in FCS, only some of which are related to LSIs.”Congress has questioned whether the Pentagon has outsourced too much acquisitions responsibility to contractors. The LSI model came under renewed scrutiny recently when the Coast Guard removed Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman as LSIs for the Deep-water programme to replace its ships and aircraft.Mr Krieg said LSI was an “experimental approach” that was still being evaluated, and suggested that many contracts were not that different from more traditional contracts where a prime contractor managed an acquisitions programme.“My point is that there are not a lot of them that are done that way. It was a trendy brand idea, and a lot of prime contractors suddenly branded themselves as LSIs.”Donald Winter, secretary of the Navy, recently criticised the LSI concept in arguing that the Navy should “reassert” itself over acquisition. But Mr Krieg says he was arguing that “we need to be a better buyer and a better manager of the things we buy”.“That is irrespective of contract types,” said Mr Krieg. “So that is back to really managing and overseeing the programmes, and I agree with Secretary Winter on that.”Mr Krieg also dismissed suggestions that the LSI model was the main reason for the burgeoning costs of programmes such as FCS and Deepwater. “The discipline to make an informed choice upfront, and then the discipline to manage the systems correctly over time is more a place where cost growth takes place, more root cause for cost growth than the contracting vehicle like an LSI.”He said an area where the Pentagon has received “well-founded” criticism was for not linking contract awards and incentives to performance, which is another factor that has allowed acquisitions costs to increase.With the annual Pentagon budget running well over half a trillion dollars, and the acquisitions budget growing to over $100bn, some members of Congress have started to advocate fixed-price contracts, which they argue would put more pressure on defence companies to control costs. But Mr Krieg says fixed-price contracts are not always appropriate.“Fixed-price contracts are good when you have started to fix risk. If you have unbounded risk and fixed price that is not a good environment. When you have bounded risk and bounded price that is a good environment,” said Mr Krieg. “And so my general view on it has been to relate the amount of risk you have in the programme and who bears it with the contract type.”He says another reason for rising acquisitions costs is that the Pentagon has often “been willing to enter a programme with technology that was immature, and an optimistic schedule about how we were going to close on that, and then underfunding it”.Some experts have questioned whether the Pentagon will retain the emphasis Donald Rumsfeld, the ousted defence secretary, placed on transformation. Mr Krieg says Robert Gates “has the same view” about the need to transform the military.“The asymmetric world in which we are operating, whether it is asymmetric low or asymmetric high, is the challenge to the historical structure of the department and the capabilities of the department,” said Mr Krieg. “And how we shift that mix over time is just as important to Sec Gates as it is to Rumsfeld.”Defence industry executives believe Mr Krieg is preparing to step down later this year. But his successor – expected to be John Young who recently became his principle deputy – may have to deal with tighter acquisition budgets as the Pentagon comes under increasing pressure because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
494;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-05-14T16:25:49Z;A military jet that is a bit like Christmas;;Planning a military campaign is notoriously complex. But, as Lockheed Martin, the biggest military contractor, has discovered, the task pales by comparison with the challenge of preparing for the Christmas rush.Lockheed is studying the business models of FedEx, Wal-Mart and Caterpillar to help it provide parts and spares on the $300bn, 11-nation joint strike fighter project, the costliest and logistically the most complex weapons programme in history.“The military thinks in terms of wars and they need to be ready for a dramatic increase in demand and movement,” says Don Searles, a Lockheed director working on the JSF logistics programme. “But when we think of the big demand created by war in the Middle East, for example, that is just a small increase in activity compared with Christmas time for commercial shippers.”Lockheed’s decision to seek new role models aims to design a cost-effective plan to support, maintain and upgrade as many as 4,000 JSFs over 47 years.It costs at least twice as much to maintain a fighter jet as to build it. Lockheed wants to drive this sum down so that only half the JSF budget will be spent on future repair and overhaul work.The company has built and supported 4,000 F-16 fighter jets since 1973, sometimes in collaboration with foreign governments as part of export deals. But the JSF, which has involved as many as 10 other nations from the outset and three varieties of aircraft, is an order of magnitude more complex.Dan Crowley, JSF general manager, says: “When I first took this job, the then president of the company said, ‘I just want you to know if you need any help thinking about how to implement this worldwide, multinational programme, I can’t help you because no one’s ever done it before’.”Fighter jets need overhauling regularly and the Lockheed-led team building the JSF must be able to make the right spares and equipment quickly available, especially when any of the customer nations are at war.As well as taking lessons from FedEx on coping with seasonal demand surges and implementing rules-based software systems to manage the logistics chain, Lockheed decided it made sense to use commercial shippers to transport many parts rather than re-inventing the process.Wal-Mart, the supermarket retailer, has received regular visits from Lockheed’s JSF team. “Wal-Mart moves an incredible inventory round the world,” says Mr Searles. Lockheed was interested in copying Wal-Mart’s tracking system, which uses radio-frequency tagging to locate its merchandise and divert it if demand suddenly spikes.However, while Wal-Mart has the purchasing power to impose a standard approach on its supply base, Lockheed decided radio frequencies were a step too far for the JSF. “There is no market standard yet for the software, the devices and even the frequencies, when you need to reach across different nations all controlling their own electro-magnetic spectrum,” Mr Searles says.Instead, Lockheed has adopted a three-dimensional barcode system for tracking parts internationally. The 3-D approach carries more information than a standard barcode, giving a unique identity code for each part, which is then scanned when shipped, when in the transport system, when received and when fitted to an aircraft.Caterpillar, a manufacturer of earth diggers, provided a more direct inspiration. Because of the heavy demands on the company’s products, Caterpillar has built prognostic systems into the equipment that determine when a part is about to fail or maintenance is required.“Caterpillar runs a worldwide supply network based on predictions supplied by their equipment, preventing it from going out of service,” says Mr Searles. “That’s the same concept we are designing into the JSF.”Constant monitoring is crucial as the military adopts a new contracting approach, paying suppliers such as Lockheed to make fighter jets available rather than a fixed maintenance fee, a concept pioneered by jet engine makers on commercial aircraft.Mr Searles describes the JSF’s automated logistics system, which he believes could cut support costs on the JSF by at least 20 per cent, as similar to a human nervous system. “When you run or work hard, you don’t have to think about your heart running faster or veins opening – it just happens. That’s the lesson we learned from Caterpillar, FedEx and Wal-Mart, among others, to have the routine things running in the background.”
495;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-05-11T18:24:46Z;A tough defender;;Mike Turner’s favourite film is The Sound of Music. This may seem odd for the chief executive of Europe’s biggest arms maker, BAE Systems, but it highlights some of the contradictions inherent in the man.Mr Turner has a well-earned reputation for tough-mindedness after years of doing battle with Britain’s Ministry of Defence. A leading defence industry executive, who has worked closely with him, says the fiercely proud Manchester native is “someone you could describe as a stereotypical northerner who knows he is right and has something to prove, though there is obviously more to him than that. He is very bright and, while he can take against people quickly, he is loyal to his own people”.Beyond easy caricatures, however, it is clear that Mr Turner is also highly emotional, even sentimental, as hinted at by his fondness for The Sound of Music’s tale of singing nuns and love triumphing against the odds.This aspect has come to the fore recently as BAE’s reputation has been hit by the UK’s decision to abandon a corruption probe into the Al Yamamah arms deals with Saudi Arabia.Mr Turner seems hurt by the reluctance of many in the media to believe him when he says BAE has committed no crimes. “I do not tell lies,” he told the Financial Times after BAE’s stormy annual meeting this week.This personal sense of grievance is made more acute by the fact that Mr Turner has transformed the fortunes of BAE during his five years in charge, cannily identifying the Pentagon as the key to rapid growth and winning his fight with the MoD to establish acceptable terms of trade in the UK.As a result, he is well liked by institutional investors. After hitting a low of about £1 in late 2002, with the company in danger of going out of existence, BAE’s shares closed this week at £4.42 as it unveiled its latest multibillion dollar US deal. The $4.1bn Armor Holdings acquisition will establish it as the leading manufacturer of armoured vehicles, an industry sweet spot.Marcus Agius, Barclays chairman, who knows Mr Turner well, says: “If you know what a strange collection of businesses BAE was, to make sense of it all is a real managerial achievement.”Mr Agius adds that the BAE boss has shown the toughness and stamina needed in a “big boys’ industry”, but also credits him for diplomacy, an accolade that will surprise industry rivals and the MoD.Two things keep the BAE chief awake at night. First, his company’s reputation. Second, the prospect that the ongoing furore over the Saudi case could scupper the sale of 72 Eurofighter Typhoons to the kingdom, a deal that extends Britain’s biggest ever export agreement and could be worth as much as £40bn. In addition, he is concerned about whether US investigators could pick up the baton on the Saudi probe, threatening his transatlantic ambitions for BAE.Mr Turner’s personal investment in the US runs deep. He persuaded reluctant executives that BAE’s future lay across the Atlantic, arguing that the European defence market was moribund. The strategy led to the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Airbus.BAE had to tighten up its anti-bribery regulations to meet the stricter requirements of the US defence market. The company admits making “support services” payments to the Saudis, but argues this was standard practice in Europe at the time, did not break any rules and that the ethical environment is an order of magnitude different now. As well as the Saudi controversy, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office has six other ongoing investigations into BAE arms export deals.Mr Turner rose through a variety of sales and marketing positions. From 1996, he took charge of all defence exports at British Aerospace, as it was then known, to add to his responsibility for commercial aerospace.The 58-year-old is from a solid working to lower middle-class family. He joined Hawker Siddeley, the legendary aircraft company that became part of British Aerospace, in 1966 as a commercial apprentice while also starting a degree at Manchester Polytechnic. He joined the British Aerospace board in 1994.The 40-year company man “lives for BAE”, although his support of Manchester United football club comes a close second. For such a forthright character, however, it is interesting that he follows the team on television because he finds the stadium atmosphere coarse. He is on his second marriage and has four childrenMr Turner remains close to his mentor Sir Richard Evans, the former BAE chief executive and chairman, with the two regularly playing golf together. As a result of this closeness, many were surprised when John Weston was appointed as chief executive in 1998. Mr Turner eventually took the post in 2002 after a boardroom coup against Mr Weston.Robin Cook, the former foreign secretary, famously described Sir Richard as “having the keys to Downing Street”. Mr Turner is not as regular a visitor, but BAE’s lobbying campaign over the Saudi probe shows he retains clout, on exports at least.Ironically, a prime reason for the coup against Mr Weston was his fractious relationship with the MoD. Mr Turner has hardly eased relations, with a public dispute over cost over-runs on weapons programmes in 2003 and 2004. His style is compared unfavourably to rivals in the US such as Bob Stevens at Lockheed Martin, who try not to ruffle feathers with the military customer.The tendency to shoot from the hip has led to disquiet from fellow board members on occasion and sometimes created tensions with his chairman, Dick Olver.A former senior MoD official, who crossed swords with Mr Turner, says: “There are few businessmen that have articulated a strategy so clearly and then delivered on it. So if you are asking whether he has done a lot for the BAE shareholders, it is indisputably clear that he has. Where it becomes tricky is in his tendency to air provocative views in public when dealing with the government. BAE’s reputation with the government has declined during his time. It is seen as less of a natural ally.”In fairness, Mr Turner’s hand was forced by the poor business terms under which BAE operated in the UK. The company recently appointed an MoD-friendly board member in an effort at rapprochement. Whether or not even Julie Andrews would have the charm to deal with an often difficult MoD is open to debate.
496;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Sarkozy must cut Gordian knot that is EADS;;Nicolas Sarkozy is taking a well-earned rest this week to gather strength before his inauguration as French president on May 16.On the industrial and business fronts, the most pressing issue to resolve is the French government’s attitude towards EADS, the Franco-German aerospace and defence group, and Airbus, its civil aircraft affiliate.This has long been a flagship policy for France, demonstrating that in crucial areas of industrial high technology, European governments and companies can work together to produce world champions.Yet over the past 18 months, the consistent failure of the French government to understand what needs to be done to the complex structure of EADS and Airbus has left a poisoned chalice.The immediate issue is to restructure Airbus, slash its cost base, fix the problems that have bedevilled its A380 jumbo project, and develop a rival to Boeing’s new 787 airliner. The leadership of EADS and Airbus has made matters worse in recent days.First, Airbus hardly helped its case for sweeping job cuts and plant closures in France by initially offering its French employees a bonus of a few euros instead of the €1,500 they received last year. This was taken as another slap in the face, and strengthened unions’ resolve to continue their strikes at two Airbus facilities.Second, the group’s governance crisis was further exposed on Friday at the EADS annual meeting, when shareholders voted by a narrow margin to return last year’s dismal profit of €99m to shareholders by paying a 12 cents dividend. The French state and Lagardère opposed the payment of the dividend, but the Germans voted in favour. The French camp also said it would forfeit this dividend in solidarity with the hard-pressed workforce.Last, the EADS board could not agree over a capital increase that many consider necessary to fund current and future Airbus programmes.The underlying problem is that EADS was a misconceived project from the start. The original concept was the misguided idea of creating a European civil and defence aeronautical champion, when experience has shown that this does not work, or at least can only work in the case of a company such as Boeing with a cohesive internal corporate structure.Destroying valueLockheed tried to do both and failed, and is now a defence company. So did McDonnell Douglas, which has since been absorbed by Boeing. The UK’s BAE Systems has followed the same route as Lockheed, turning itself into a pure defence player now that it has sold its 20 per cent stake in Airbus.EADS’ Franco-German structure has, if anything, destroyed rather than created value for its constituent parts.Airbus was doing well before being absorbed by EADS and is now doing worse. Eurocopter was also doing well before becoming part of EADS and, to be fair, is still doing well. Both the missiles and the space business are still struggling.It is no surprise that EADS’ private partners Lagardère and DaimlerChrysler want to pull out. As for the French and German governments, neither want to see Airbus job cuts in their respective backyards.All this as an ever-weakening US dollar continues to undermine Airbus sales.What is likely to happen now that Mr Sarkozy has been elected president?The bets are on Louis Gallois, the Airbus boss and French EADS co-chief executive, losing his job.Philippe Camus, the former EADS co-chief executive, who lost out in a French power struggle to the now disgraced Noël Forgeard, could come back. Before resigning, he had warned repeatedly of the looming problems facing EADS and Airbus.It could trigger a wider industrial shake-up in France. Arnaud Lagardère, a close friend of Mr Sarkozy, could pull out of EADS, allowing him to concentrate on his media empire. The French government could also disengage itself, maintaining, as the UK did with BAE Systems, a golden share.Martin Bouygues, another friend of the new president, could move in and sell off his TF1 television network either to Mr Lagardère or to Vincent Bolloré, the corporate raider keen to expand in media. In case he is buying a dummy, Mr Bouygues could also be given a share of Areva, the state nuclear group that is likely to be broken up and whose boss, Anne Lauvergeon, is tipped for an important ministerial portfolio.The last thing Mr Sarkozy wants is criticism that he is helping out his friends in big business. But he is likely to face a far bigger political risk if he does not move quickly to fix Airbus, where the situation is deteriorating by the day.EADS does not and never has made industrial sense, and needs to be broken up again into its constituent parts.Vodafone makes wavesThe finance minister may have signed off on it but a recent debate over whether Vodafone violated India’s foreign ownership limits with its acquisition of 67 per cent of Hutchison Essar is still making waves.Vodafone’s local partner in the venture, India’s Essar group, holds two-thirds of its 33 per cent stake offshore. To satisfy a 74 per cent foreign ownership limit on telcos, Vodafone’s interest in the company has therefore been divided into a 52 per cent direct stake with options over a further 15 per cent controlled by three local investors.By letting the deal go through, the government acted to reassure foreign investors. But if anything, the saga has only deepened the uncertainty surrounding the norms governing foreign holdings. There is already talk the government may try to close loopholes commonly used by foreign investors to get around ownership limits.These include interest-free loans made by a foreign partner to locals to buy shares in a joint venture, or fully convertible preference shares issued to the foreign partner in a venture. Bankers argue that a clearer ownership limit would be 100 per cent rather than 74 per cent.The same applies across other industries, such as insurance. But such clarity will be some time coming. Until then, good luck to foreign companies such as Vodafone trying to explain such deals back home to investors used to more transparent ownership structures. Joe.Leahy@ft.com
497;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;New weapons strategy correct says Lockheed;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor, insisted it was still capable of running large projects outside its usual area of expertise, after high-profile problems in building a new type of warship.Cost overruns on its first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) prototype have raised doubts about Lockheed’s “adjacent market” strategy, where the company best known for fighter jets and spacecraft has moved aggressively into non-traditional areas such as shipbuilding and helicopters.“I remain convinced the adjacent market approach makes sense to all our stake-holders. We will continue to pursue new lines of business,” said Chris Kubasik, Lockheed’s chief financial officer.His comments came as Lockheed reported a 19 per cent rise in net profits to $690m for the first three months of the year, as higher margins across the business, notably in the F-22 fighter jet programme, offset a flattening in sales.As a result of the LCS overruns, the US Navy tried to force Lockheed to accept a fixed price contract for a second ship, shifting financial risk to the company – an offer declined by Lockheed. The US military usually takes on the risk of developing new weapons, with contractors guaranteed a good return.Mr Kubasik said: “We do not think fixed price contracts are appropriate for development activity because they do not encourage the kind of direct, responsive and collaborative behaviour necessary for success.”Lockheed also defended its performance on the Deepwater programme to modernise the US Coast Guard’s fleet of ships and aircraft, from which Lockheed and Northrop Grumman were recently removed as joint managers. Lockheed argued that its part of the venture, modifying aircraft and implementing information systems, had performed well.Some Pentagon officials want to wrest back control of large weapons programmes from contractors. But Mr Kubasik said it would take at least 10 years for the Pentagon to re-acquire the necessary system integration skills, which were lost when the department slimmed in the 1990s.
498;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-04-23T22:17:57Z;Winter calls for more control;;Donald Winter, US Navy Secretary, is well placed to judge the defence industry as a former Northrop Grumman executive.His recent assessment has been harsh.In a blunt speech to a packed audience of naval officers, Pentagon officials and industry executives in Washington this month, Mr Winter berated companies for not investing enough in shipyards and called on his department to re-establish control over shipbuilding programmes.General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin are the biggest companies involved in warship-building.The department had developed a bad habit of relying too blindly on its contractors, he said.Though he was happy for companies to make profit margins above 15 per cent, his comments put the navy at the forefront of a trend to wrest back more control of complex weapons projects from the large defence contractors, who dominate the US military landscape.
499;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-04-23T22:10:18Z;Financial risk could shift to US defence contractors;;US defence companies are expected to report strong first-quarter profit this week, starting with Lockheed Martin today as the Pentagon budget scales new peaks and contract terms remain more favourable than most people can remember.In recent weeks, though, a cloud has appeared on the horizon.High-profile problems on two large maritime projects, the US Navy’s $12bn Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and the US Coast Guard’s $24bn Deepwater modernisation programme, have sparked speculation about whether the profitability of US defence contractors is under threat.“In an otherwise very bullish outlook for defence spending,” says Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, “one of the potential weaknesses is sloppy performance leading to a backlash in the Pentagon and on the Hill.”Defence contractors are still benefiting from lenient financial terms put in place at the end of the Cold War when a far bigger number of companies fought over a shrinking budget and the government’s aim was to allow the industry to survive.At a recent lunch in London, Jim McNerney, chief executive at Boeing, the biggest military contractor after Lockheed, said: “There is always a need to strike a balance. You want to keep your defence contracting industry healthy . . . I also appreciate the argument that says windfall returns should be looked at, though I have not heard such discussions myself.”The immediate worry is a push by some in the Pentagon and Congress – including Ken Krieg, the chief Pentagon weapons buyer, and Republican senator John McCain – towards more fixed-price contracts on complex weapons development, shifting financial risk to contractors. Currently, the US government takes on almost all of the risk. The UK, the biggest Western weapons spender after the US, abandoned fixed-price contracts for new weapons recently after over-optimistic pricing led to cost overruns that nearly killed off BAE Systems, the country’s dominant arms manufacturer.US companies suffered a disastrous period of fixed-price contracting in the late 1980s, which was abandoned as the Cold War unwound.“I think a sudden move back into fixed-price contracts would present issues for all US defence contractors,” Mr McNerney said. “But I don’t see that happening.”Instead, the government will look at fixed pricing on a programme-by-programme basis as attempted on the LCS project, a $12bn programme to provide up to 60 vessels designed to fight close to enemy coastlines.After large cost overruns on Lockheed’s first prototype LCS, the navy tried to force it to accept a fixed-price contract for a second ship.Lockheed declined, a move welcomed by investors as showing the industry would not accept onerous contract terms. In fairness to Lockheed, which has built a reputation for project delivery, some of the LCS overruns were caused by the navy changing requirements.This is another factor mitigating against fixed-price contracting, with responsibility for cost overruns often descending into a “blame game” between the contractor and customer. The $200bn Boeing-led Future Combat Systems (FCS) programme – to supply US combat troops with futuristic battlefield technology and sophisticated armoured vehicles – is another example of how costs can rise sharply even though the contractor appears to have met all price and schedule milestones.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein estimate the programme’s price-tag has risen 79 per cent, even though Boeing has met its targets.Such issues on the FCS project and on Deepwater, where the Coast Guard last week seized back management control from Lockheed and Northrop Grumman, have led to questions about the vogue for large defence contractors running big-ticket programmes.
500;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-04-22T21:10:44Z;Stealth debate precedes Abe US visit;;"The Japanese air force is urging Shinzo Abe, during his first visit to Washington as Jap­anese prime minister, to ask George W. Bush, US president, to sell Japan the F-22 Raptor stealth jet.US law prohibits foreign sales of the fifth-generation fighter. But several officials and experts said the Japanese air force wanted Mr Abe to raise the issue this week to provoke a serious debate in Washington.Japan is expected to choose a replacement fighter for its ageing fleet of F-4 Phantoms next year. Its air force favours the F-22, whose prime contractor is Lockheed Martin. Other contenders are the Joint Strike Fighter, another fifth-generation jet made by Lockheed; Boeing’s F-15 and F-18; and BAE’s Eurofighter Typhoon.“Within the defence ministry and the prime minister’s office . . . there is a very strong feeling . . . that Japan needs the best fighter available to defend [against] the Chinese SU-27 and SU-30s,” said Michael Green, a former senior White House official.“They know that one F-22 can take out five times as many enemy fighters. What is interesting is the degree to which they are judging their requirements in terms of the threat and not just industrial interests.”Some experts believe the US Congress would revise the Obey amendment, which prohibits foreign sales of the fighter, to help Japan defend its airspace from the growing threat from China, which is developing its own fifth-generation fighter jet.“Abe would be asking for the administration . . . to work with committees on the Hill to change the Obey amendment and allow exports for national security reasons,” said Mr Green. “It would be a test of the administration’s support for building up the alliance versus concerns about Chinese response,” Mr Green said.While some US officials believe Mr Abe may raise the issue, a senior Japanese government official privy to Mr Abe’s agenda in Washington said he doubted it would be discussed.Elements of Japanese industry want to keep building fighter jets under licence from a US manufacturer, but a US defence official said it was “far beyond the pale” to consider licensing the Raptor for production outside the US, because of its highly classified technology.Fumio Kyuma, Japanese defence minister, is expected to raise the subject with defence officials in Washington next week. “We believe we should study every model that exists before making the purchase, so I have requested them to share with us information on F-22,” Mr Kyuma told the Financial Times.“I personally feel: why can’t you sell [the F-22] to us? We are your best ally.”Michael Pillsbury, expert on China’s military, said the Japanese air force needed access to F-22 technical data to see if it met their requirements. But some US military officials are concerned about sharing stealth technology, even with a trusted ally. One former senior official said the US air force had decided for now against selling the F-22 to Japan.But Loren Thompson, a defence analyst at the Lexington Institute, said officials were looking at ways to resolve their security ­concerns.”Air Force secretary Michael Wynne reportedly has concerns with [Lockheed’s] ability to protect the technology, but if those can be addressed he has no objection to such a sale,” said an industry source.While Boeing also participates in the F-22 programme, it would benefit more from licensing production of the F-15 or F-18. The company is hoping that the Japanese requirements prioritise capabilities, such as air-to-sea, possessed by their earlier generation fighters.The F-22, in contrast, is optimised for air superiority, which is one reason that some quarters of the Bush administration are concerned that selling the Raptor to Japan would antagonise China. “There is a bit of a split. Those who want Chinese help on North Korea and don’t want to complicate the situation are unenthusiastic . . . [about] pushing Congress to let Japan have F-22s,” a former official said.“Those who are worried about China’s growing military advantage in the cross-straits balance are on the other side.”Officials and industry sources say the Bush administration would need to make a decision over the next few months to give Japan time to study the F-22 in order to meet its deadline to choose a platform next year. The administration would also have to work with Congress to revise the Obey amendment.Officials said there was no consensus in the US government over whether to permit F-22 sales to Japan, partly because the issue had not yet been raised at a sufficiently high level to prompt serious consideration.The Pentagon is also conducting a joint air capabilities assessment with Japan to determine what threats will emerge in the Asia-Pacific region in the coming decades. But the defence official said it was not specifically linked to the F-22 question. He said it was intended as ”a net assessment of what their requirements should be for that 2015-2050 time frame to fulfil their obligations to their own defence and to fulfil their obligations as an equal alliance partner”.Thomas Schieffer, US ambassador to Tokyo, said: “Is it going to be an F-22 or a new [Joint Strike Fighter]? We hope it’s going to be some combination of the two.”"
501;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-04-19T17:35:40Z;Embraer mulls entry into military transport;;Embraer, the world’s leading maker of regional passenger jets, is studying the possible development of a medium-sized military transport jet aircraft, the C-390.If approved, the Embraer C-390 would be the heaviest aircraft ever produced by the Brazilian group, and would take it into a new segment of the aerospace and defence market.Embraer is best known for its development of commercial jets up to 120 seats, a market in which it has overtaken Canada’s Bombardier to become the global market leader. It is also seeking to expand its presence in corporate aviation with the development of several new business jets.The C-390 project would mark its first effort to develop a jet-engined military transport aircraft, which would be designed to transport up to 19 tons of cargo.Embraer believes there is a gap in the market between Lockheed Martin’s long-lived C130 Hercules and the C27J transport aircraft supplied by Alenia Aeronautica, part of Italy’s Finmeccanica.Luiz Carlos Aguiar, Embraer executive vice president for the defence and government market, said the group’s analyses had shown there was a potential market, in particular to substitute older models due for replacement during the next decade.Embraer had decided to expand its studies and was discussing with other aerospace groups a possible joint development effort. The aircraft would use some technology, including fly-by-wire controls, developed for its successful 170-190 family of commercial jets.The twin engined C-390 would have a rear loading ramp to enable it to transport a wide range of cargo, including wheeled armoured vehicles. It would be capable of being refuelled in flight or used to refuel other aircraft and could also be equipped for medical evacuation missions.Embraer said the planned aircraft would be capable of operating on short and unpaved runways without the need for ground support.
502;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Lockheed stripped of US navy contract;;Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, has been stripped of a contract to build a prototype warship for the US navy after heavy cost overruns on the project.The company had been selected to build two prototypes of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), a vessel designed to operate close to enemy coastlines, but costs on the first ship have spiralled to $350m-$375m from an expected $220m.As a result, work on the second boat was halted while Lockheed and the navy attempted to rework the financial risk-sharing arrangements on construction of the vessel.Some analysts have said the navy’s desire to shift more of the risk on development costs to the contractor could herald a wider change in weapons buying policy at the Pentagon.On Thursday, the navy said that the two sides had failed to reach agreement and that it was cancelling construction of the second ship.Bob Stevens, Lockheed’s chief executive, said the company was “greatly disappointed” by the cost growth and the failure to reach a compromise on the second ship.He said: “We committed to a course of action that was intended to break the long-standing cycle of first-in-class ship cost growth and, while achieving several important programme objectives, did not meet that goal.”The navy did not criticise the company’s performance on the first ship, which has been delivered on time, and said it would be allowed to compete for contracts to build four more ships next year.The navy wanted to shift to a fixed price contract on the second ship, to reduce its own risk, superseding the existing standard arrangement where Lockheed would have been reimbursed for its costs and been paid a fee.Donald Winter, the navy secretary, said: “While this is a difficult decision, we recognise that active oversight and strict cost controls in the early years are necessary to ensure we can deliver these ships to the fleet over the long term.”While Lockheed has a reputation for good project delivery, the navy’s decision will be a blow. The company, best known for its fighter jet and space businesses, is branching out into non-traditional areas such as ship-building by establishing itself as a “lead systems integrator”, bringing together all of the various components that make up a weapon platform.General Dynamics, another US defence contractor with long-standing naval interests, is building two rival LCS prototypes.
503;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-03-11T15:50:35Z;Man of arms explores new areas of combat;;For a man who claims to be inspired by an increasingly networked world, the reluctance of Robert Stevens to talk up his central role as chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest military contractor, is understandable.Fortunately, Bob Coutts, head of Lockheed’s electronics division, is happy to appraise his boss’s management credentials.“I don’t think you are going to meet another chief executive out there who can say at the age of 18 they were carrying an M-16 in the swamps of Vietnam, and so know effectively what our front-line customer is doing today, only on the streets of Baghdad,” he says. “And yet also someone who has done all the course work for a PhD in business administration at an Ivy League university.”On meeting Mr Stevens, the description appears fitting. He has the polite, straightforward demeanour of someone who worked his way up from modest beginnings in a steelworking family and a spell in the US marines.His comments on the need for a strong ethical code in the defence business, a hot topic following Britain’s recent decision to drop a fraud inquiry into Saudi arms deals, bear out the importance he places on individual character.Though not claiming any knowledge of the UK case, he says: “My opinion is you need rigid adherence to a solid set of ethical principles. I don’t want to sound corny with you. It guides my personal life. It is true north.”Yet there is also a hint of the academic about him. He is more at ease when discussing the company than himself, and brightens visibly, for instance, when the conversation moves on to abstract notions such as the effect of information networks on the evolution of organisations.After leaving the marines, Mr Stevens took two degrees, the first in behavioural science from Slippery Rock University, Pennsylvania, the second a masters in engineering and management from Polytechnic University in New York. He later earned an MBA at Columbia, where he completed his PhD coursework but spurned academia in favour of business.He worked his way up in the defence and aerospace sector through a series of management roles, often on the financial side. He joined Lockheed in 1996 when it bought Loral, where he was general manager, during the US industry’s phase of consolidation. His appointment as chief executive in 2004 followed a period as chief financial officer in which he slashed company debt, winning respect from Wall Street.In common with defence industry peers, Lockheed has prospered from rapid growth in US defence budgets following the “war on terror”. Mr Stevens has reinforced the upturn by instilling strong financial discipline at the group, leading to a return on invested capital of 19.2 per cent last year, up from 14.5 per cent the year before.Such high returns bring their own worries. Industry analysts, fearful that defence budgets will eventually flatten, have voiced concerns that growth may be unsustainable in the long term. Mr Stevens contends the opposite, regardless of whether the White House is occupied by a Democrat or a Republican.“There is the global war on terrorism. There are obviously the circumstances in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are discussions about the intent of the Iranian government and maybe even interest in the behaviour of China and other countries around the globe,” he says. “So our long-term view is that there will likely be more rather than less funding.”To draw such conclusions, he maintains a high-level team that analyses the factors affecting future demand. “We examine international economics, international business dynamics, geopolitical circumstances and the climate in Washington, including the political climate,” says Mr Stevens. “So we try to assemble that global view with as much sensitivity as we can.”Expenditure will also continue to expand beyond the Pentagon, he contends, particularly in homeland security and ports and borders, an area where Lockheed is pursuing contracts and acquisitions. Betraying his academic leanings, Mr Stevens argues that the nature of security in the information age is evolving into something more personal, not just the domain of government.For this reason, as well as to hedge against any future defence budget cuts, Lockheed is buying companies in the $1,000bn-a-year healthcare market, where its experience as the leading IT supplier to the US federal government could prove useful.“Individuals have a security need, and part of that need is to protect the privacy of their information,” he says. “We have been very good at protecting the security of information for a long time, and we think there is a huge opportunity to contribute in a meaningful and valuable way to streamlining the healthcare system.”Recent acquisitions have pointed to other strategic areas of interest, not immediately obvious for a company still best known for building fighter jets such as the F-16, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor.The purchase of Savi, a company that supplies electronic devices to track the location and cargo of shipping containers, gives Lockheed access to a market for technology already used by the military and which has obvious uses in homeland security and logistics. It could also push the company beyond traditional government customers into commercial supply chain management.“To optimise the flow in a customer’s supply chain is absolutely an aspirational goal for our company,” says Mr Stevens.Another recent acquisition, Pacific Architects and Engineers, pushes Lockheed into a support role for overseas peace-keeping missions, often alongside the US State Department.The biggest immediate challenge for Mr Stevens is a push by the newly Democratic Congress to establish far more stringent financial oversight over the vast weapons programmes managed by Lockheed and its ilk, with some politicians seeing the military’s relationship with contractors as too cosy.In view of this, embarrassing cost overruns on the first of a new generation of US warships, known as the Littoral Combat Ship, are poorly timed and raise questions about Lockheed’s reputation for managing large weapons projects.“I appreciate the discussion that says we’re not happy with the costs,” Mr Stevens concedes. “I’m not either.” However, he insists his company’s stellar returns are justified by the value the company delivers to the customer.Like Mr Stevens, other executives at Lockheedhave an approachable, homespun style. It is easy to forget they make deadly weapons, are ruthlessly competitive on contracts and, like the rest of the defence industry, are fearsome lobbyists.Nevertheless, he has succeeded in creating a culture where the customer comes first – something that has not always prevailed in defence companies viewed by some as quasi-government agencies with little incentive to overperform.“Our answer here, my personal answer philosophically, and I think our corporate response almost natively now is we have a set of values. You do what’s right. You perform with excellence. You do the very best you can, and you respect others.”‘Horizontal integration’ is keyExecutives at Lockheed Martin intone the mantra of “horizontal integration”, a philosophy espoused by Robert Stevens, its chief executive.A sprawling company, with interests running from Mars spacecraft to digitising FBI fingerprints and processing social security cheques, horizontal integration aims to maintain common purpose among the 140,000 workers.The concept – described by Mr Stevens as “aligning the parts of this company so it doesn’t matter where you come from” – emerged in 1999 as Lockheed struggled to integrate a series of mergers and acquisitions.“If you are a mosaic where you have the appearance of a corporate entity, but inside there are many insulated compartments, you can’t aggregate 65,000 engineers and turn them to a customer’s challenge in a meaningful way.”For a company that makes much of its profit from complex network systems, it would also be awkward if its internal organisation did not match up to its products.Implementing the policy took time, says Mr Stevens. “I went into a room full of people and said, ‘We really have to get best practice here.’ Everyone was was so accommodating and positive, I thought, ‘This was going to be hard but that was easy.’“Six months later, nothing had happened because when I said best practice, they all thought: ‘Everybody else is going to do it the way I do it.’ ”The new competition to replace the US army’s Humvee shows how things have moved on. The vehicle is vulnerable to attack from sophisticated roadside bombs, which create a hypersonic shock wave. Lockheed’s aeronautics and space divisions have both worked in the hypersonic area so are jointly contributing expertise.“It almost doesn’t matter what problem or challenge one part of the company might be facing with a particular customer,” Mr Stevens says. “We have another part that has seen it before.”
504;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-03-09T02:54:15Z;Boeing chief confident of USAF order;;A $15bn Boeing contract to supply search and rescue helicopters to the US Air Force is unlikely to be resubmitted for competition in spite of the concerns of the main US spending watchdog, the chief executive of the aerospace group has claimed.The comments from Jim McNerney at a lunch in London put Boeing at odds with the Government Accountability Office, which last week said other companies should be allowed to compete for the $15bn deal for 141 helicopters.“I do not think there will be a full-blown re-compete on the helicopter competition,” Mr McNerney said.A new competition could delay the contract by 19 months and lead the USAF to update its requirements, he added.The GAO, an influential voice in Washington, said the way that the USAF had evaluated the life-cycle costs of the helicopters was inconsistent with the approach required under the terms of the competition.It said Boeing’s contract, based on a variant of its CH-47 Chinook helicopter, should be cancelled if it no longer represented the best value to the government.Boeing won the contract late last year against competition from Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky, the helicopter group owned by United Technologies.Lockheed and Sikorsky had both protested against the Boeing award and welcomed the GAO’s findings. On Thursday, Lockheed expressed surprise at Boeing’s comments. “The GAO has recommended the contract be re-competed,” it said.But Douglas Harned, analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a note to clients that he expected the USAF would stick with Boeing’s Chinook.He said: “Although the procurement process may have been flawed, we believe that the air force ordered the helicopter it wanted, seeing the Chinook as the lowest risk approach.”The controversy comes at a sensitive time for Boeing and the USAF, with their relationship still under scrutiny following a procurement scandal related to air refuelling tankers.A contract for the tankers was cancelled and competition for a new deal, which could be worth more than $100bn, has been started, pitting Boeing against US defence rival, Northrop Grumman, and EADS, the Franco-German aerospace group.Separately, Mr McNerney expected talks to recommence this month between the US and Europe over a dispute related to alleged subsidies at Airbus and Boeing.
505;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
506;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-02-20T16:49:53Z;US defence companies court India;;US defence company Lockheed Martin could not have asked for better publicity when Indian business tycoon Ratan Tata flew its F-16 jet at India’s biggest aerospace show this month.Mr Tata, who recently closed a $12bn (€9bn, £6bn) deal for Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, helped a Lockheed pilot fly the F-16 at speeds exceeding 1,200km per hour. The 70-year-old amateur pilot liked the experience so much that he also flew Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet jet the following day.Such high-flying publicity stunts highlighted the strongest ever presence of US defence companies at India’s biennial Aero India show in Bangalore. The groups are eagerly courting India, which has plans to expand and upgrade its large arsenal of ageing, predominantly Russian-made equipment.“India is gearing up to play a more dominant role in the 21st century not only in Asia, but also in the world,” said SK Antony, India’s defence minister, in a speech at the Aero India show. “We are in the process of acquiring fresh capabilities for all three wings of our armed forces.”India’s military budget was about $20bn in the last fiscal year and is expected to grow about 7 per cent annually over the next five years. Its military spending amounts to roughly 2 per cent of GDP.The Indian government is expected to open tenders for a variety of weapons and equipment, including helicopters, missiles, cargo planes and radar, worth tens of billions of dollars over the next few years. A highly coveted contract for 126 fighter jets will alone be worth $6bn-$11bn, Boeing estimates. New Russian MiGs and jets from Dassault of France, Gripen of Sweden, Boeing Eurofighter and Lockheed are all vying for position.US defence heavyweights face stiff competition from Europe, Israel, and, most of all, Russia. To reinforce his country’s long-standing military ties with India, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced plans for joint collaboration on development of a stealth jet and transport aircraft for India’s military and the construction of four new nuclear power plants during his high-profile visit to New Delhi last month.The thaw in Indo-US relations has quickened following the signing of a bilateral civilian nuclear treaty by US President George W. Bush in December. The historic pact allows the US to sell nuclear resources, equipment and technology to India and endorses broader collaboration in defence, energy and other sensitive areas.India represents “one of best new market opportunities for American industry”, said Robert Trice, vice-president at Lockheed Martin.In their courtship of India, companies including GE Aviation, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon, a maker of missiles and radars, all are expressing enthusiasm about forming long-term relationships and partnerships with local component suppliers, technology companies and launching research initiatives.It is a message they must embrace as India ambitiously attempts to evolve into not just a buyer of defence equipment but eventually a stronger developer and manufacturer. To enable such a shift, India has been making efforts to open defence to the private sector, allowing manufacturing of defence equipment under license, and permitting foreign direct investment with a cap of 26 per cent.India has an “offset policy” that requires foreign defence companies to re-invest 30 per cent of sales above $70m in components and services from India. The policy is designed to boost smaller companies and cultivate local industry.Big defence companies are already planting seeds for future partnerships. Raytheon this month unveiled a preliminary agreement to work with Tata Power’s strategic electronics division on defence-related technologies. Boeing has teamed up with Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest construction and engineering company.“We are learning about the requirements for India,” said Wes Motooka, vice-president of international business at Raytheon. The company has only three full-time staff in India but is “gearing up and putting people in place”.Boeing said it is laying an “investment roadmap” and insists its wants to tap India to expand its global network of 6,000 suppliers of electronics, avionics, engineering services and other businesses. “Everything that Boeing does is capable of being sourced in India,” said Dan Korte, vice-president at Boeing.Pratt & Whitney said favourable credits from India’s offset policy would smooth the path for its parent company, United Technologies Corp, to expand in India and bring in other business lines including Sikorsky helicopters and Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace systems.The Indo-US nuclear deal is a “necessary but not sufficient condition” for US defence companies gaining a foothold in India after missing out on the market during almost a decade of US sanctions imposed over India’s testing of nuclear weapons. Russian defence suppliers entrenched their position in India further during the interlude.“Defence deals are not like going to the market when you can pick up a few things,” said Ajey Lele, research fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi. “For so long, India has been taking technology from Russia. They know how to deal with Russians.”The fighter-jet tender is seen to be a political bargaining chip. “It’s between the US and Russia,” said Andrew Brookes, aerospace analyst for the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “Sweden and France can deliver nothing New Delhi wants politically.“At the end of the day this is politics. The decision will be made as much as on politics as on which is a better airplane.”Mr Trice acknowledged stiff competition in India. “There are entrenched competitors with good technologies,” he said. “We understand we are new to this market. It’s going to be an uphill climb. We’re going to have to show patience.”
507;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-01-25T22:30:13Z;Wall Street slumps on higher rates;;"US stocks slumped on Thursday, as concern about rising Treasury bond yields offset better than expected earnings from a number of companies.Interest rates have reached their highest levels since mid-August, and sparked an uneasy mood in stocks after their rally on Wednesday.“The main threat to the bulls appears to be the continuing rise in interest rates,” said Ken Tower, the chief market strategist at CyberTrader.The S&P 500 slumped 1.1 per cent to close at 1,423.90. All 10 industry groups in the index were in negative territory, with energy and financial stocks leading weakness. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to close at 12,502.56, after the blue-chip barometer set a record close on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to finish at 2,434.24, despite a solid rise in Ebay. The online auctioneer rose 8.2 per cent to $32.45 after it beat estimates and raised guidance for the first quarter and 2007 above current forecasts. The stock is up 7.9 per cent so far this year, having lost 30 per cent last year.Shares in Microsoft were down 2.1 per cent at $30.45, as investors awaited its earnings due after the market closed on Thursday. The company beat estimates and had pared most of its losses in after-hours trade.Another big earnings story on Thursday was Ford, which delivered a loss of $5.8bn, or $3.05 a share, for the fourth quarter, increasing its loss for 2006 to $12.7bn; the largest annual loss in its history.Shares in Ford rose 0.2 per cent to $8.22. The stock price had fallen 2.5 per cent in the previous two days. Traders noted results outside North America were better than expected and Ford’s cash burn rate was less than expected as it continued to restructure operations.In deal news, Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 a share in cash, raising the proposed buy-out of the office-property landlord to $38.3bn from an original offer of $48.50 a share. The move came in response to a recent $52-a-share offer from a group led by Vornado Realty Trust. Shares in Equity Office were 4.2 per cent higher at $54.90.AT&T was among a handful of gainers in the Dow after it reported a 17 per cent rise in net income from better revenue growth of its wireless and internet units. Shares had pared an earlier rise to $37.70, its highest level since May 2002, and closed up 0.4 per cent at $36.79.Lockheed Martin rose 0.3 per cent to $97.44 after its fourth quarter net income rose 28 per cent. Shares in rival defence contractor Northrop Grumman fell 0.7 per cent to $71.30, as a 37 per cent rise in quarterly profit missed estimates.Dow Chemical fell 0.3 per cent to $41.94, and revesred an earlier rise to $42.68. The company’s 11 per cent drop in fourth quarter net income to 98 cents a share beat estimates."
508;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2007-01-25T22:22:27Z;Lockheed bullish on defence spending;;Lockheed Martin on Thursday predicted that the new Democratic-controlled Congress would approve increased US defence spending as the world responded to the “uncertain security market” from events such as the recent Chinese anti-satellite test.The world’s largest defence contractor by sales provided the industry’s most bullish assessment to date of future spending trends ahead of the White House budget and supplemental requests being prepared by the Pentagon.“In our judgement, with a $14.2 trillion economy, the nation has a lot to protect, and we might see even more funds flow in,” said Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin’s chairman and chief executive.Mr Stevens declined to be drawn on whether the recent Chinese destruction of a satellite with a ground-launched rocket would temper the opposition among some Democrats to maintaining spending levels on missiles and space systems, one of his company’s largest businesses.However, he noted that Congress had never failed to provide funding to address what he called “the complexity in the world”, either in the budget or through approving supplemental requests.Some industry executives expect the Pentagon budget to flatten or decline in real terms over the next few years, with companies looking to compensate by improving margins, expanding internationally and diversifying. Lockheed, for example, is the biggest provider of IT services to the US government.Mr Stevens’ remarks came as Lockheed raised its 2007 earnings’ forecast and announced plans to boost margins and raise operating earnings by $1bn by the end of the decade. He pointed to an increased focus on homeland security and law enforcement work in addition to its core aircraft, ship and missiles business, but ruled out any move into commercial aerospace.The company said international sales would start to displace the dominant position of its largest customer, the US defense department. This could include “selective” additions to the eight countries currently in the Joint Strike Fighter programme, now known as the F-35 Lightning II, as well as winning contracts for its fast-growing IT and outsourcing unit.Defence companies are benefiting from record military spending, supplemental budgets for conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the outsourcing of government services. Shares in Lockheed and Northrop Grumman, which reported a 16 per cent rise in full-year earnings on Thursday, hit all-time highs this week.Lockheed’s earnings per share in 2006 were $5.80, up from $4.10 in the previous year. Yearly operating profit was $3.95bn, up from $3bn.In the fourth quarter, net profit rose to $729m from $568m the year before, with the aeronautics business posting a 32 per cent rise in profits. In November, Lockheed received a $1bn order for an extra 24 F-22s, bringing to 131 the total of the new fighter jets under contract.Yearly sales in aeronautics declined slightly, though earnings rose 18 per cent as sales of the F-22 and the development of the JSF offset fewer deliveries of C-130 military transport aircraft and reduced volume on the F-16.More than half of Lockheed’s revenues and profits now come from its information technology and government services businesses. In the past year, profits in the division rose by 17 per cent on the back of higher sales of naval systems and sensors, air defence programmes and a sharp rise in service revenues.The space systems business, which makes military and commercial satellites, also saw sales and profits rise sharply.At the end of last year, Lockheed and Boeing, the next biggest defence contractor, finalised a joint venture of their space launch businesses, which make expendable rockets to launch satellites. The venture is expected to lead to yearly cost savings of $150m for the two companies.Northrop, which makes warships, nuclear submarines, unmanned aircraft and advanced electronics for fighter jets and other weapons, reported quarterly profit of $453m, up from $331m the year before.Improved margins in information, electronics and ship-building were offset partially by a charge on a radar programme.Earnings for 2006 rose 16 per cent to $4.44 per share, up from $3.83 per share in 2005. Operating profit rose 13 per cent to $1.6bn.
509;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Global defence outlook;;At a Pentagon dinner in 1993, US defence industry executives were warned to consolidate or die ahead of budget cuts. That “last supper”, as the event became known, seems a long way off now. Since September 11 2001, the FTSE global aerospace and defence industry index has returned almost 90 per cent in dollar terms, beating global equities’ rise of about 60 per cent. From its traditional hefty discount to the market, the global sector now commands a 15 per cent premium on multiples of both earnings and book value.Despite recent outperformance and earnings upgrades, investors should be getting nervous. First, profit levels are becoming punchy. Return on equity for the global sector has risen to 16 per cent, compared with an average since 1993 of 12 per cent. For the biggest stocks, such as Lockheed Martin and the UK’s BAE Systems, return on equity is running at well over 20 per cent. Unlike the stock market as a whole, it is easy to see how high returns might normalise for the defence industry. Most contracts are supposed to be priced at a small premium to cost. Sooner or later, customers – usually companies’ respective governments – may ask questions about value for money.Second, demand could slow if the US, accounting for half of global defence spending, becomes more isolationist after the Bush presidency. Last March, the Department of Defense forecast an 8 per cent real fall in its budget to $463bn for the year to October 2007. But include the huge “supplemental” budgets used to fund Iraq and Afghanistan, and total spending could rise by up to 17 per cent year-on-year to $652bn, says the International Institute for Strategic Studies.The lesson of Vietnam and Korea is that when wars end, spending falls sharply. Today, trophy projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter are hard to abandon. But the size of companies’ secure order books should not be overstated. In December 2005, Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon had a combined backlog equal to 24 months of sales. Without a new US war, defence stocks look vulnerable.
510;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-12-13T00:50:10Z;Pentagon to share jet fighter technology;;Britain’s threat to pull out of the $276bn (£141bn) Joint Strike Fighter programme appeared to have been lifted on Tuesday after the Pentagon agreed to give the UK sensitive defence technology.Lord Drayson, the UK minister for defence procurement, reached a deal with the Pentagon that he said overcame disputes about sharing JSF technology and guaranteed that the UK would have “operational sovereignty”.The UK previously signalled it would give up on the deal if the Pentagon did not agree to share key technology, including the source code needed to update the stealth fighter. After meeting Gordon England, US deputy defence secretary, on Tuesday, Lord Drayson said he had the “necessary assurances”.Lord Drayson said the agreement meant the British military would have an “unbroken chain of command of UK citizens”, ensuring operational sovereignty. He said the UK would receive all the source code needed to maintain and update the stealth technology, adding that the deal would “deliver the necessary technology to industry”.But some industry experts said Lord Drayson had glossed over some difficulties and further negotiations would be necessary. One industry expert said there was “no way that Lockheed Martin were going to give away proprietary technology and intellectual property”.Pierre Chao, a defence industry expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, welcomed the deal. He said it underscored the need for a process that would allow the two allies to share defence technology more easily. Mr Chao added that Lord Drayson’s comments about an “unbroken chain” of UK citizens “deliberately left open” the possibility that they could be British employees of Lockheed Martin. The British embassy said that was not the case.Tom Jurkowsky, spokesman for Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor for the JSF, said: “The necessary issues have been resolved that will allow the British to operate the JSF.”Lord Drayson told a US congressional committee this year that Britain would consider a “Plan B” if the Pentagon did not agree to provide the technology. Experts speculated that this might involve buying French Rafale jets or Eurofighter Typhoons. The Commons defence committee last week urged the Ministry of Defence to move towards buying a different fighter jet if agreement could not be reached this year. Lord Drayson said yesterday it was still “important” to have a “Plan B”.BAE described the agreement as “further positive progress on JSF, a programme we fully support and endorse”.The UK plans on buying 150 of the vertical take-off version of the fighter jet. Under the agreement – which the MoD said paved the way for UK companies to receive $29bn in defence contracts – the UK will invest £34m on top of the $2bn it has already committed to the JSF.Additional reporting by Stephen Fidler
511;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-12-12T18:26:41Z;JPMorgan recruits SEC expertise;;JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday named Steve Cutler, former head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, to head its legal and compliance departments worldwide.Mr Cutler, currently a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, worked at the SEC from 1999 to 2005 and headed the 1,100-person enforcement division during one of the most active periods in its history. He replaces Joan Guggenheimer, who died earlier this year.Under Mr Cutler, the SEC and state regulators forced 12 banks, including JPMorgan, to pay $1.5bn to settle allegations that they issued biased research.His team also took on after-hours mutual fund trading, mutual funds that secretly paid brokers to steer them business, and improper trading by specialists at the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Cutler’s hiring adds JPMorgan to the list of US public companies who have picked general counsels from the ranks of former regulators and prosecutors since the corporate scandals of 2001-02.The shift reflects the growing importance that businesses place on their general counsels and the stricter regulatory environment that Mr Cutler helped create.“I am very pleased that Steve Cutler will be joining JPMorgan Chase in this critically important role. He will be an excellent General Counsel and a key member of our senior management team,” said Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive.“Steve is a strong leader, noted for his integrity, distinguished service in the public and private sectors, and outstanding reputation in the legal and regulatory communities.”Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Pepsico have all hired general counsels with Justice Department experience, and the Willis Group opted for a former member of the New York Attorney General’s office. On Wall Street, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley all have former SEC enforcement directors as their top legal officers.Mr Cutler, who earned both his bachelor’s and law degree from Yale, said in a statement: “This is an exciting opportunity for me to join a wonderful group of people, and I’m looking forward to working closely with Jamie and his team.” His compensation was not disclosed.JPMorgan has faced is a tough regulatory period. In addition to paying $80m as part of the research settlement, it also paid $135m to settle allegations it helped Enron mislead investors.
512;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-11-27T22:42:41Z;In-house lawyers no longer Cinderellas;;Becoming a corporate general counsel used to be something leading American lawyers did to slow down.The jobs were considered relatively low-key, low-profile and low-paid, at least in comparison to a partner at a big law firm, and lawyers who went in-house often held their jobs until they retired or got bored.Not any more. In the wake of the 2002-03 corporate scandals and the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate accountability law, general counsels are now central figures at most US companies, often reporting directly to the board and often appearing on the list of the five highest paid corporate officers.The post has also become a much riskier assignment. In the past six months, 12 public companies have changed chief legal officers amid investigations into whether the firms illegally backdated stock options grants to pump up executive compensation.Hewlett-Packard is also in the market for a lawyer to replace general counsel Ann Baskins, who resigned after the company’s use of “pretexting” during an investigation of board leaks came to light.“These positions are not for the faint-hearted,” says Catherine Nathan, head of general counsel practice for search firm Spencer Stuart. “The whole environment has changed. Corporations are under a microscope. CEOs are under intense scrutiny and they rely heavily on their general counsels.”Between the departures over stock options and ordinary turnover, the American market for in-house lawyers is hopping, search firm executives say. In-demand candidates are fielding multiple inquiries and compensation packages are rising.The average bonus for the nation’s 100 highest-paid general counsels was $906,820 last year, up 16 per cent, and the average restricted stock grant was nearly $1m, up 35 per cent, according to a study of Securities and Exchange Commission filings by Corporate Counsel magazine.When salaries were included, the total average package reached nearly $2.5m.“I’m seeing a bit of sticker shock [at the size of the wage bills],” says June Eichbaum, senior partner at the search firm Heidrick & Struggles, which has been hired to fill at least four of the positions vacated in the options scandal.“Historically, the general counsel was not thought of as a profit centre,” she says, adding that the job had now become a critical business function.Worried boards are asking for candidates with a different set of skills than they did 15 years ago. Back then, companies wanted merger-and-acquisition experience and investment banking ties.Now even companies not facing immediate regulatory problems want former prosecutors and SEC enforcement lawyers.Search firms date the shift to the Enron and WorldCom scandals, which put corporate fraud on the public radar. Since then, Fortune 500 companies PepsiCo, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Estée Lauder have all turned to lawyers with Justice Department experience.“The board wants someone who can walk into the offices of the SEC and the justice department and know people there . . . someone who understands what the regulators care about today, not what they cared about 10 years ago,” Ms Eichbaum says.Today’s boards are equally clear about what they do not want – anyone with ties to options backdating. With 160 companies enmeshed in the scandal, boards have become insistent that candidates are scandal-free.“They have to have clean hands,” says Martha Fay Africa, managing director of legal search firm Major, Lindsey & Africa. She says boards are asking: “How can we know that this person wasn’t implicated?”The new focus on regulatory issues dovetails with the on-the-job experience of in-house lawyers.For the second year in a row, “keeping apprised of company activities that may have legal implications” has replaced “reducing outside legal spending” as the main concern of American in-house lawyers, with 86 per cent mentioning it in a survey for the Association of Corporate Counsel.“With all of the international operations, they are really on call 24/7,” says James Wilber, a leader of services to corporate law departments at Altman Weil, a consulting firm. “The pressure has increased significantly.”
513;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-11-10T21:30:54Z;Wall St edges higher helped by deals, earnings;;US stocks were caught in several cross-currents during the week as earnings, deals and likely repercussions from the mid-term Congressional elections were digested by investors.The main indices rose modestly, led by the Nasdaq Composite, which was helped by a surge in earnings from technology giant Cisco, up 12.5 per cent over the week at $26.74.With the Democrats claiming control of the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994 and narrowly gaining a majority in the Senate, equity investors focused on the likely winners and losers under a new Congress.“It’s uncertain just how much specific regulation or actions will be imposed by the Democrats,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “While investor concern is well founded, congressional gridlock will likely hold sweeping changes at bay.”Early indications were that losers could include companies in the pharmaceutical and defence sectors, while labour conditions at Wal-Mart, down 2.2 per cent at $46.47, and a rise in the minimum wage are also likely to attract the attention of lawmakers.The winners are expected to include alternative energy and stem cell research companies along with the Government housing agencies that made gains over the week. Fannie Mae, up 3.6 per cent at $60.38, and Freddie Mac, up 2.2 per cent at $69.48, capitalised on expectations of less onerous regulation.In contrast, investors sold down the healthcare sector and big defence companies this week. The New York Stock Exchange Healthcare index rose 1.7 per cent early in the week ahead of the elections but tumbled after the election results. The index was down 2.1 per cent for the week at 6,742.80.“There is some concern for healthcare, with the Democrats talking about Medicare and [with] an eye toward lowering prescription drug prices,” said Mr Ablin.Big pharmaceutical groups Merck and Pfizer fell 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent to $43.12 and $25.71 respectively during the week. Johnson & Johnson was off 2.2 per cent at $66.29.Among managed health care providers, Humana fell 8.4 per cent to $52, in spite of reiterating its 2006 and 2007 earnings targets earlier in the week. UnitedHealth was down 3.6 per cent at $46.11, and WellCare fell 5.2 per cent to $56.WellPoint and Aetna were lower by 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent at $72.89 and $40.24 respectively. Watson-Pharma slid 5.2 per cent to $24.84 after disappointing earnings and legal woes. Bausch & Lomb fell 6.6 per cent for the week to $49.50 after it lowered 2006 and 2007 forecasts following the recall of its ReNu contact lens solution.Defence shares pared some of their post-election losses but on Friday were still down on the week. Lockheed Martin was 1.4 per cent lower at $85.75, Northrop Grumman was down 1.9 per cent at $64.70 and Raytheon had eased 0.2 per cent to $48.90.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 index had gained 1.2 per cent to 1,364.30 for the week and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,389.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent firmer at 12,108.43 after making a record close of 12,176.54 on Wednesday.The small-cap Russell 2000 index was up 2 per cent for the week at 768.07.Dominating earnings releases this week was Cisco, which has risen by about 60 per cent this year. Juniper, rose 15.8 per cent to $19.48. Among S&P 500 companies, 438 have reported third-quarter earnings with growth averaging 19 per cent, according to Thomson Financial – 73 per cent beat consensus forecastsA $3.7bn private bid for Four Seasons, the luxury hotel chain up 28.4 per cent to $82, was chief among a number of deals announced during the week.Swift Transportation, the US long-haul truck company that received a $2.2bn buyout offer, rose 15.2 per cent at $27.70 over the week.OSI Restaurant Partners, which runs the Outback Steakhouse chain, agreed to a $3bn private acquisition and rose 21.4 per cent to $39.37.The faltering housing market bruised homebuilders this week, with Toll Brothers down 2.9 per cent to $27.41. Merrill Lynch downgraded builder DR Horton, and it fell 1.1 per cent to $22.47. Pulte Homes was down 3.2 per cent at $29.15.
514;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-11-08T21:44:23Z;Dow edges higher to record close;;"Wall Street stock indices rebounded from earlier losses on Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging higher to a record close, but some companies and industries that have been criticised in the past by the Democrats were pressured.With the House of Representatives under control of the Democratic party and the Senate still to be decided, analysts expect greater scrutiny over healthcare, energy and credit card companies and the retailer, Wal-Mart, over improving labour conditions.The New York Stock Exchange healthcare index closed down 1.6 per cent while Wal-Mart was off 62 cents, or 1.3 per cent, at $47.03.“Companies and industries that are the target of criticism by the Democrats will have at least a temporary negative reaction,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards.Among health sector stocks in the red were Merck, down $1.56, or 3.4 per cent, at $44.34. Pfizer was down 43 cents, or 1.6 per cent, at $26.62.“Investors widely believe that Democrats will revisit the Medicare Drug Benefit, with an eye toward lowering prescription drug prices” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin was down $1.04, or 1.2 per cent, at $86.45, Northrop Grumman was down $1.42, or 2.1 per cent, at $64.98. Raytheon was off 72 cents, or 1.5 per cent, at $48.96.In spite of fears of Democrats investigating windfall oil profits, higher oil prices boosted energy stocks and the NYSE energy index was up 1.6 per cent. Exxon Mobil hit an all-time high, up 2.2 per cent at $74.13.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.88 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 1,385.72. The Nasdaq Composite rose 9.06 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 2,384.94, boosted by technolgy companies such as Apple, up 2.4 per cent at $82.45. Technology group, Cisco was up
1.1 per cent at $25.10, after hitting a two-year high, ahead of announcing earnings after the close.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.77 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 12,176.54, a record close.Alternative energy producers, generic drugmakers and two leading housing agencies should benefit temporarily from Democrat control of the house, Mr Wren noted.Shares in VeraSun Energy were up $1.69, or 9 per cent, at $20.40. Geron shares were up 3.3 per cent to $8.66.Housing agency Fannie Mae was up 2.9 per cent at $61.65 and Freddie Mac was 2 per cent stronger at $71.23.StemCells, a company researching treating diseases of the central nervous system, surged more than 10.4 per cent, or 32 cents, to $3.39.Satellite television broadcaster DirecTV beat its earnings consensus by 3 cents and its shares rose by $1.13, or 5.2 per cent, at $22.97."
515;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-11-08T18:01:29Z;Market Insight: Defence companies cash in on climate of fear;;The threat of terrorism and conflict has pushed the issue of security up the political agenda.“War and the more-pervasive fear of conflict are driving governments and individuals to spend more on bolstering their security,” said Giles Keating, head of research at Credit Suisse. “For investors, the zeitgeist of fear means selecting companies which offer innovation in protection.”Defence spending exceeded £1,000bn in 2005, according to figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This is more than a third greater than the average during the preceding 10 years.Defence giants such Lockheed Martin, which derives more than 90 per cent of its revenues from the US Department of Defense and other military customers, have benefited from this military largesse. Lockheed Martin shares have doubled since the 2001 terrorist attacks.However, Mr Keating said investors seeking greater returns should consider the host of smaller, less high-profile companies that are pioneering innovative technology.He said: “Since 9/11, a broader range of industries have been catering to the forces of law and order: technology companies developing biometrical scanning devices, face or behaviour recognition systems, detection systems for explosives, robotics, CCTV cameras, smart cards and so on.” He cited US-based Verint Systems, whose technology can intercept and analyse data contained in e-mails, and Smiths Group of the UK, which makes bomb detection equipment.Another pick is NICE Systems, an Israeli company listed on the Nasdaq exchange and whose clients include the New York Police Department and US Homeland Security.NICE has developed a device that can detect unattended package in a busy airport lounge. Using algorithms to map the background, a red circle appears around the item on a screen and an alarm sounds. The same technology can spot people in restricted areas. NICE shares have risen five-fold since September 2001.Clive Forestier-Walker, analyst at Numis Securities, said the flow of money being pumped into research and development by defence companies indicated sales would continue to rise. R&D spend in the UK rose 61 per cent year on year in 2005, he said.However, with a slowdown in the rate of growth inevitable, larger companies have begun to look at mergers and acquisitions as a way of diversifying and sustaining earnings.This takeover speculation has helped to underpin share prices in small to mid-sized defence and technology companies, particularly in Europe, which tend to trade on lower multiples than their US equivalents.Smiths Group, Meggitt, Cobham and Ultra Electronics have all been linked with takeovers in recent months. United Technologies, the maker of Sikorsky helicopters, is cited as a potential predator.BAE Systems, the UK’s largest defence company, has also been touted as a takeover target or a merger partner for a large US defence group.Mr Forestier-Walker said: “It is inevitable that at some stage growth will begin to slow down. Companies are pretty flush with cash – so what are they going to do with the money?“It is likely there will be M&A activity and it could be transatlantic”.A concern for investors remains the prospect of political change in the US and a shift in attitude towards defence spending.Ronald Epstein, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said: “Political control is the primary driver of defence spending [and] defence budget growth is the single most important factor for defence stock valuation.”Seen as more opposed to defence spending than Republicans, the Democrats in Tuesday’s mid-term elections gained control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 12 years.While some have viewed this change of control as bad for the defence industry, Mr Epstein concluded it would result in “modestly higher” defence spending because many of the newly elected Democrats are from southern states with a higher density of military bases and defence sites. That said, a Democrat president in 2008 would not be good for defence spending, he said.
516;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-10-29T22:05:48Z;L-3 signals end of acquisition spree;;L-3 Communications, the world’s biggest defence electronics manufacturer, has signalled an end to years of frenetic acquisition activity and indicated it would be open to takeover approaches.In an interview with the Financial Times, Michael Strianese, who was appointed chief executive of L-3 last week, stressed he was not actively marketing the company and had not received approaches but said it was the board’s duty to consider any bids.New York-based L-3 has been the subject of takeover speculation since its 74-year-old founder, Frank Lanza, died in June.Mr Lanza, an inveterate dealmaker and one of the most high-profile executives in the defence industry, built the company from scratch, starting with the acquisition of 10 unwanted defence electronics businesses from Lockheed Martin in 1997. L-3 is now the next largest Pentagon contractor behind the big five of Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon.The company now finds itself in a potential sweet spot of military spending, with bigger companies coveting many of its defence electronics units, particularly in the crucial area of battlefield information and communication systems.Military equipment budgets are likely to come under growing pressure in the next few years, with more dollars being spent on maintaining existing weapons or upgrading them with new technology rather than developing new “platforms” such as fighter jets, warships and armoured vehicles.Since its inception, L-3’s sales have grown an average of 35 per cent each year, with about 25 per cent of that coming from acquisitions.Mr Strianese, L-3’s finance director before succeeding Mr Lanza as chief executive, said he expected that growth would slow considerably in the next few years, to about 7.5 per cent a year from organic growth and 7.5 per cent from acquisitions. The company has a $9.7bn market value and expected sales of about $12.4bn this year.“Continuing to grow the company at a rate of $10bn at a time is not going to be productive,” Mr Strianese said. “Growing so rapidly over the past nine years has been a huge success but it also meant that focusing on synergies was not the priority.”L-3 is made up of more than 80 often disparate businesses, one of the reasons that makes it difficult for potential suitors, which include BAE Systems of the UK, to put together a bid.Mr Strianese admitted the company was often perceived as a “loose confederation of companies acting independently. But that has to change at the size we are now.”
517;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-10-25T20:45:24Z;Wall Street higher following Fed results;;Wall Street stocks closed higher yesterday, in spite of a surge in oil prices and a mixed batch of company earnings early in the session, as the market responded positively to the US Federal Reserve’s decision to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 per cent.Before the Fed’s announcement, which said the economy seemed likely to expand and inflation pressures moderate over time, Wall Street had struggled to build momentum amid mixed earnings reports and uncertainty ahead of the announcement.Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JPMorgan private bank, said: “The market needed a constructive statement from the Fed and it got one. The Fed confirmed that the economy is neither too hot not too cold.”General Motors, the world’s largest carmaker, was firmly in the spotlight after it reported a narrower third quarter loss and a $529m, or 93 cents a share, profit. Analysts had expected a rebound in profit to 49 cents a share.GM shares were down 4.1 per cent, or $1.48, at $34.71 at the close, as analysts said the market continued to be concerned about its market share. GM shares had rallied sharply this week and the stock was up 86 per cent for the year to date before issuing its earnings report.The S&P 500 closed up 4.84 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 1,382.23. The Nasdaq was up 11.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 2,356.59.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 6.8 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,134.68, its 12th closing high in the past 16 trading sessions.Amazon.com surged after reporting better-than-expected third quarter results on Tuesday after the market close. Its shares rose $4.05, or 12 per cent, to $37.68.Aircraft maker Boeing fell $2.73, or 3.3 per cent, at $80.86 after it reported a fall in third quarter profits.Lockheed Martin shares were dragged lower, down $2.44, or 2.7 per cent, at $86.67.Shares in Corning, the glass, fibre-optics and speciality materials company, fell 8.8 per cent to $21.10 after it revised down its revenue forecast for the coming quarter in spite of better-than- expected results for the third quarter.Shares in tobacco group Altriawere up 2.9 per cent at $82.10 after its third quarter results came in lower than expected. The rise came as Altria lifted its guidance for its full-year earnings.Drugmaker ImClone rose 5.3 per cent, or $1.56, to $31.00 after it announced investor Carl Icahn as its new chairman and also reported an 85 per cent rise in its third quarter earnings.Shares in WellPoint were $2.09, or 2.66 per cent, lower at $76.53 after the health insurer said third quarter net income grew to $810.8m, up from $640.7m for the same quarter last year. The performance fell short of analyst estimates.
518;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-10-24T18:25:25Z;US defence;;Frustration may be spreading on many fronts in the war on terror. For now, however, investors in defence contractors have not shared the pain. Over the past 12 months, returns in US aerospace and defence shares have beaten the broader market by 10 percentage points. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence contractor, has done even better, with returns of 45 per cent, almost three times those of the S&P 500.Lockheed’s latest results – along with those of Northrop Grumman, best known for its warships – provide some ammunition for defence enthusiasts but also suggest a need for caution. Even after stripping out one-off gains, Lockheed once again beat earnings expectations in the third quarter. That is all the more impressive given that analysts’ forecasts have been steadily rising. However, revenues were up just 6.7 per cent at Lockheed and were even weaker at Northrop.At least both benefited from rising operating margins. Changes in product mix were partly responsible for this, with Lockheed’s recent focus on IT in particular starting to pay off. Mainly, however, defence contractors seem to be getting better at squeezing higher profits out of a slow-growing sales base.Operating leverage, however, can be a bit of a double-edged sword when the bulk of revenues are dependent on a single customer. At Lockheed, about 85 per cent of 2005 sales were to the US government, with another 13 per cent to foreign governments (including those funded by the US). But growth in overall US defence spending is likely to slow and calls for more boots on the ground instead of high-tech gear are on the rise. Add the prospect of a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections and pressures on the Pentagon and other federal agencies to get a bigger bang for their buck are set to increase.
519;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-10-02T18:32:52Z;Boeing targets defence deals in the UK;;Boeing is looking to buy into the UK defence sector in response to a shift by the British government towards greater protection of its domestic arms industry.The UK, the biggest western military spender after the US, is a valuable market for US weapons makers. But Boeing has a far smaller presence in the country than US rivals General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.US defence companies have cash to spend and are eager to expand internationally to compensate for an expected flattening of budget growth at the Pentagon over the next few years.Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing’s $31bn-a-year defence business, said his company had done business with the UK for 50 years but needed to adapt to a radical change in procurement strategy at the Ministry of Defence.The UK has scrapped a 20-year policy of buying most weapons through open international competition.Instead, it will seek to ensure intellectual property for key military systems resides in the UK, though it is relaxed about whether this is through local subsidiaries of US or European companies.“With the new policy, obviously having more Boeing badges in the UK is something we are looking at really hard,” Mr Albaugh said.“We have about 600 people now but I would not be forthright if I did not tell you we were going to respond.”Though potential acquisitions were expensive and Boeing would not overpay, he said the group was looking all the time.“It is really a question of where we have gaps and we clearly have one in how we generate intellectual property in the UK.”Mid-sized UK companies with defence businesses such as Ultra Electronics, Cobham and Meggitt have seen share prices spike recently on speculation they could become targets for larger US or European industrial groups.Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, chief executive of Finmeccanica, the Italian defence group that owns Westland Helicopters in the UK, said recently he would like to buy more British companies.Northrop Grumman, another top-five US defence contractor, is also looking to beef up its UK defence and homeland security operations through deals.An acquisition of an electronics specialist such as Ultra would be unusual for Boeing, which describes itself as a “systems integrator” rather than an acquirer of technology companies.Mr Albaugh would not be drawn on potential targets, other than to say Boeing had relationships with 250 UK suppliers.US acquirers might be tempted by companies that offer support services to the MoD such as Serco or IT systems houses such as Detica, Anite or SciSys.A senior industry adviser said he expected consolidation of the UK defence sector would gather pace in the next “six to nine months”.
520;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-07-24T15:45:49Z;Worth watching;;Bubbles in the body could save the lives of people suffering from malignant tumours if findings by scientists at the University of Michigan lead to a new way of cutting off the blood supply of cancer cells.The usefulness of bubbles is usually confined to the bath or keeping the kids amused but the researchers are working on technology that will use gas bubbles like corks, blocking the flow of blood to tumours - starving them of oxygen and killing them in the process.Blocking blood flow is one of the techniques doctors use to treat tumours - known as embolisation. Typically, the blood vessel leading to the growth is blocked using a solid “cork”, or emboli, made from a blood clot or a gel.But it is difficult to control exactly where the emboli - which is delivered by catheter - is placed, meaning that it can block other vessels, causing damage to healthy surrounding tissues or necessitating very invasive procedures.According to the Michigan team - led by Joseph Bull, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, and Brian Fowlkes, an associate professor in the Department of Radiology in the university medical school - the gas bubble method allows doctors to control exactly where the bubble is formed by using a focused high intensity ultrasound. This makes for a much greater degree of control of the emboli, minimising the impact on surrounding tissues.There are two stages to the procedure. A stream of encapsulated superheated perfluorocarbon liquid droplets - small enough so they don’t lodge in the vessels - is injected intravenously into the body.Doctors follow the progress of the droplets with standard ultrasound and once they reach their destination, doctors blast them with high intensity ultrasound. The ultrasound “acts like a pin popping a water balloon” and the perfluorocarbon expands into a gas bubble with a volume about 125 times larger than the droplet. The bubble shapes to size of the vessel, forming a “sausage-shaped” bubble which acts as a cork.The researchers say two or three doses of bubbles should be enough to completely stanch the blood flow, killing the tumour. They add that the technology could be particularly effective at treating renal cancer and the most common form of liver cancer.Printed planeLockheed Martin have taken an unusual approach to keeping down the costs of building unmanned aircraft, by using “printed parts” rather than traditional machine-tooled components, according to a story on New Scientist.com.Much of the Polecat unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), revealed to the public at this year’s Farnborough airshow, was constructed using 3D rapid prototyping or 3D printing, the process of generating an object directly from its digital representation in a computer-aided design (CAD) system.3D designs for individual parts of the Polecat were fed from a CAD system to a chamber known as a 3D printer. Inside the printer, two computer-controlled laser beams fuse polymers or metal powder layer by layer into complex 3D shapes.Although the technique is typically used in industry to make prototype parts for testing, the technology has improved so much that 3D printing can now be used to make working components.The developers at Lockheed’s “Skunk Works” facility in California, who also designed the U2 high-altitude spyplane and the F117 stealth fighter, say that much of the Polecat was made from composite materials using rapid prototyping including all of its airframe.The main benefit of this process is to reduced time to produce a part, which in turn speeds up the entire development process. UAV’s are becoming more and more sophisticated making them almost as expensive as piloted aircraft, but at the same time they tend to crash more. Lockheed hope the Polecat will point the way to a more affordable and rapid way of constructing unmanned aircraft.Medication from fish slimeWith superbugs running rampant through hospitals as they become more resistant to antibiotics, the search is on for alternative methods to beat hospital bacteria.And the hunt has lead researchers into strange plaices - pun intended!Trude Tvete, a chemical engineer of Nord-Trondelag University in Norway, has discovered that the slime that covers the flat-fish plaice contains a substance that kills staphylococcus, a category of bacteria that can cause boils, food and blood poisoning, septicemia and other serious infections.Staphylococci are generally partly or wholly resistant to antibiotic action, raising serious problems in the treatment and control of infections. This is especially the case in hospitals where they spread quickly, putting the young, old and infirm at risk.Ms Tvete cleaned and separated the slime into its component parts, identifying a protein deep within its skin that has the greatest effect against staphylococcus.The protein, which is used in the fish’s immune system, was shown to be “very efficient” at killing the bacteria.Ms Tvete thinks the substance could be used as the basis of human medication. Bacteria-killing substances from other animals such as mammals have been investigated, but those in fish are built up in a different way and therefore can overcome bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics. The plaice also has the potential to be fish-farmed, meaning that potential bacteria-killing agents could be produced on a large scale - pun not intended!..
521;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;UK resists BAE pressure over fighter;;The British government is resisting pressure from BAE Systems to build a final assembly line in the UK for its future fleet of Joint Strike Fighters, because of worries that it is not affordable.BAE, Britain’s biggest arms manufacturer, has claimed that assembling the jets in the UK is vital to maintaining the country’s sovereign ability to build, maintain and upgrade its own fighter jets.The $276bn JSF project, the biggest weapons programme in history, is being led by Lockheed Martin of the US and has been beset by disputes between the US and the UK over the sharing of sensitive military technology. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy are planning to buy about 150 of the aircraft to replace the Harrier fighter jet.Tom Burbage, the Lockheed Martin executive leading the JSF project, said a recent joint study by the Ministry of Defence, regional development agencies and BAE had provided an estimated cost for the assembly line that had so far proved too expensive for the government.He said there was still time for the government to change its mind and push on with a UK plant, but MoD officials said the relatively small number of jets ordered made it uneconomic. The Italian government has reached agreement to build such a facility.Lockheed and its eight partner nations plan to build about 3,000 of the aircraft, most for the US armed forces. The UK is the prime partner to the US on the project, having contributed about $2bn, or 10 per cent of the costs so far.An MoD official said: “This is really an industrial question for BAE, but the case for whether this will provide value for money has not been made.”Sources close to BAE stressed that a final decision on whether or not to build an assembly line had not been taken. But an unsuccessful BAE lobbying campaign is likely to test relations between the company and the MoD.In a recent interview with Defense News, the respected industry journal, Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, said the UK was now in the position that it could ask for whatever JSF technology it wanted from the US. But he said the question remained whether the government, particularly the Treasury, was “willing to pay for the capability you need to establish in the UK to give the operational sovereignty the government has talked about”.Lockheed executives said even without the final assembly line, BAE would still have a strong position on “Team JSF”, in partnership with itself and Northrop Grumman of the US.BAE is responsible for about 20 per cent of the aircraft, including its rear fuselage, built in Lancashire, England, and many of its electronic warfare systems.Separately on Tuesday, Des Browne, the UK defence secretary, signed a contract with BAE to order 12 new Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft. The project was hit by cost severe cost overruns and delays in the past.BAE also received a letter of intent from Malaysia for the purchase of two frigates.
522;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-06-29T17:26:07Z;Boeing warns of more than $1bn charges;;Boeing warned on Thursday that it would take charges of about $1bn against its second quarter earnings to cover delays in a defence programme and a tentative legal settlement with the US government following a series of procurement scandals.The estimated $300m-$500m cost of delays to early warning and control aircraft for Australia and Turkey caught analysts by surprise. It could be followed by further charges later this year on the aerospace group’s in-flight communications business, Connexion by Boeing, which has failed to attract sufficient customers.The announcement of the $1bn charges marks the first significant setback for Boeing’s chief executive, James McNerney, who took on the post in July last year.It comes as EADS, the US group’s European rival and parent company of Airbus, is facing discord among shareholders, management infighting and technical problems with its new aircraft programmes. It recently had to issue a €2bn ($2.5bn) profits warning arising from further delays in its A380 superjumbo programme.Boeing said it would take a charge of $300m to $500m, including penalty payments, in its second quarter results, which are due to be reported on July 26, to cover delays to the 10 surveillance aircraft, which were won as fixed-price contracts.Australia has ordered six of the 737-700 aircraft in the so-called Wedgetail programme. Boeing said that delivery would be delayed by 18 months to the end of 2008. The delivery schedule for the four aircraft for Turkey under the Peace Eagle programme had still not been finalised.Mr McNerney refused to speculate on whether the delays would have any impact on Boeing’s efforts to win further orders for the airborne surveillance aircraft in South Korea in competition against Israel’s IAI.He said the group was also facing delays in its programme to deliver in-flight refuelling tankers to Italy.Boeing said earlier this week that it was reassessing the future of its Connexion in-flight communications business, which could lead to its possible sale, closure or the pursuit of a joint-venture partner. Analysts estimate that Boeing has invested about $1bn in Connexion.It said the market for the Connexion highspeed, mobile broadband communications business had “not developed satisfactorily.” It was limiting further commercial expansion of the service pending a round of intensive negotiations with existing customers.Connexion, which allows airline passengers to use their own laptops and other hand-held devices for in-flight access to the internet, is already available on some flights operated by Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and Singapore Airlines. The other carriers planning to install the service on their long-haul aircraft are China Airlines, Korean Air, Asiana and El Al Israeli Airlines.The previously announced $615m charge to settle Boeing’s case with the US Department of Justice will resolve all civil and criminal claims against the group. The company said the wording of the agreement was still be finalised. This would determine whether damages were “compensatory” and therefore tax deductible or whether they were “punitive.”The DoJ’s three-year probe centred around Boeing’s hiring of Darleen Druyan, a senior air force procurement official who helped the company win an air tanker contract and was later jailed for her role, as was Mike Sears, Boeing’s former chief financial officer.The company was also under investigation for acquiring proprietary documents from rival Lockheed Martin that it used to try and secure a rocket launcher contract.

Two weeks later, Elf reversed the roles by launching a €50bn counterbid. The use of a Pacman forced Total to increase its initial offer by more than 10 per cent before finally acquiring Elf.

Heaven forbid that Leeds might one day change its mind and claim Yorkshire’s biggest company as its own. After the past two years of turmoil at the group, that might be the final straw for Morrison’s more partisan local shareholders.Now, he’s offNigel Payne, who on Thursday announced he was stepping down as chief executive of Sportingbet, has a politician’s skill with words.A while back, Mudlark heard a whisper that the head of the online gaming group was thinking of moving on. Mr Payne replied that he had the best job in the world and had “no intention of leaving the company”. Yesterday it was announced that Mr Payne was ceding the role to Andrew McIver, Sportingbet’s finance director, who takes over from October 17. Mr Payne will continue to have a seat on the board and will lead Sportingbet’s lobbying efforts in the US.When Mudlark quizzed Mr Payne about his earlier reply, he joked: “What did you expect me to say? I chose my words very carefully. You asked if I was leaving Sportingbet, and I’m not.”The quiet assessorAnthony Bolton, manager of Fidelity’s flagship Special Situations Fund, offers a sobering thought for City hopefuls revising for professional exams.When Bolton, one of the most successful fund managers of recent times, started out in 1971, he was interviewed by Keyser Ullman, a small merchant bank. Asked whether he was taking any securities exams, Bolton admitted he was not.This week, he told an audience at the Securities & Investment Institute: “I have never done an exam in securities or securities analysis.”It has not held him back.

525;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-04-25T17:16:59Z;Lockheed prospers on US arms build up;;Lockheed Martin profits rose 60 per cent in the first three months of 2006 as the world’s biggest defence company continued to take advantage of growing US military budgets.Northrop Grumman, its US rival, also beat analyst expectations, though first quarter profits fell 12 per cent to $358m, largely because of damage at its Gulf coast shipyards caused by Hurricane Katrina.The strong performance recently by all the major US contractors - Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon - has pushed defence shares to fresh highs. It has also generated huge cash piles at the companies, raising expectations for further consolidation of the industry.Net income at Lockheed rose to $591m, or $1.34 a share, from $369m, or 83 cents, in the same period last year. The higher figure included a $150m contribution for share disposals in a satellite company and the sale of space imaging assets.Sales rose 8.6 per cent to $9.21bn.Operating profits rose across each of Lockheed’s businesses in the quarter, but most markedly in its electronics division, boosted by the contribution from air defence, training and maritime systems. The company also recently won a $2bn contract from the US air force to develop a secure global communications network.Lockheed, like many of its peers, is also pushing into the lucrative provision of IT services to federal government departments. It won a contract in the first quarter to shift the FBI from a paper-based to an electronic case management system.Profits at Lockheed’s space business also rose sharply, to $193m from $153m. This was because of bigger sales of government satellites, ballistic missile systems and missile defence activities.Growth at the aerospace business was held back by lower sales of F-16 fighter jets and fewer C-130J deliveries. But profits still rose from $222m to $240m because of higher volumes on the F-22 and F-35 programmes.Northrop, which makes B-2 stealth bombers and nuclear submarines, managed to lift operating profit at its information systems, electronics and aerospace divisions. But profits fell sharply in naval ship-building because of Katrina and less work on the DD(X) programme to build a new destroyer for the US navy.L-3 Communications, the defence electronics group, reported quarterly profit of $138.9m, compared with $102.4 million, a year ago.
526;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-04-07T19:09:21Z;BAE unlikely to pick big US targets;;The prospect of BAE Systems building a £5bn ($8.7bn) acquisition war chest and parking its tanks on the lawns of big US rivals may have a certain appeal to UK patriots.In reality, the US ambitions of Britain’s biggest defence company are likely to be more mundane.BAE broke into the top tier of Pentagon suppliers last year with the $4.2bn purchase of United Defense Industries, maker of the US army’s Bradley fighting vehicles.The possible £3bn proceeds from the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Airbus to EADS provide the firepower to strike similar sized deals. Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, argues that with its strong balance sheet BAE could have more than £5bn to spend.But BAE executives are cautious, and while US deals are wanted, expensive acquisitions are unlikely – for now at least. “They will probably use the money over time on smaller transactions,” says one person close to the company. “And any transactions will probably be smaller than the UDI deal, though things can change.”BAE bought UDI relatively cheaply but since then the values of US defence companies have soared. Big US rivals – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon – also have cash to spend.BAE has said it is not interested in acquiring L3 Communications, a defence electronics specialist with a $10bn market value, because the “numbers do not add up”. But even smaller US defence groups valued in BAE’s £500m-£2bn target range command racy price to earnings ratios.The company is looking to buy smaller defence electronics specialists, but is also building a presence in the more prosaic area of IT contracting for US government departments, an increasingly lucrative business. In 2004, it paid $600m for DigitalNet, a computer network provider to the Pentagon and other federal agencies, and similar low-key deals are probable.“The US targets are not likely to be names which are clearly on our radar screens, in much the same way as the DigitalNet acquisition,” says Ben Fidler, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.BAE executives insist the Airbus disposal was driven by the timing being right for an exit rather than to provide funds for any specific acquisition.But this could leave them with a large unused cash pile unless they identify targets quickly that will not destroy value. That could stretch investor patience.“It will take a little while to spend the Airbus cash and pressure will grow on BAE management to return money to shareholders if it takes a long time,” says Mr Fidler. “If they did return money, they could always launch a subsequent rights issue if they needed cash at a later stage for an acquisition.”The Airbus stake sale will initially dilute BAE earnings by between 15 and 20 per cent. But the positive reaction of the London market on Friday showed investors were expecting the sale and were comfortable with BAE’s strategy to reuse the funds on its US acquisition strategy. BAE’s shares, which have risen 60 per cent in the past year, rose 4½p to 435½p.The dilution could also put on hold any plans by BAE to sell out of more of its European joint ventures.A statement on Friday from Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive, highlighted his strategic goal to “be the premier transatlantic defence and aerospace company with a strong footprint in both the UK and US”. He failed conspicuously to mention Europe, where BAE owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA, the missile company, and 20.5 per cent of Saab, the Swedish fighter-jet maker.EADS, which also owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA, is keen to buy out BAE and Finmeccanica, the Italian defence group that owns 25 per cent of the missile group.However, an industry source says an MBDA deal is now less likely in the short term because BAE will be reluctant to reduce its group earnings any further after the Airbus sale.And while the Airbus sale allows BAE to exit at a good time from a non-core business, MBDA is more central to BAE’s ongoing strategy. Britain’s Ministry of Defence would also be worried about BAE selling out of the UK missiles business.The acquisition of BAE’s Airbus stake could also hold back further any plans by EADS to bid for Thales, the French defence electronics specialist.EADS had €5.5bn ($6.6bn) of net cash at the end of last year, but much of this will be spent on the Airbus stake. While an EADS/Thales deal would not unduly worry BAE because of its own strategic US focus, the prospect of a much enlarged competitor on its doorstep would present challenges.Thales has a strong relationship with the MoD, and BAE would resist any threat to its domestic dominance.BAE had threatened to pull out of the UK because of its troubled relationship with the MoD, but a recent government white paper heralding BAE as the UK’s contractor of choice in “air, land and sea” has repaired the damage.It is considering a joint bid with VT Group for Babcock International, where it could emerge as the owner of most of Britain’s naval shipyards.Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal group, says BAE’s plans to sell its Airbus stake would be received well in the US.“It removes the negative sentiment about BAE being a tool of European government economic policy.”Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
527;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-04-06T23:31:12Z;BAE builds up its dealmaking firepower;;BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest defence company, has made no secret of its ambition to expand further in the US and the sale of its Airbus stake to EADS, the Franco-German defence company, will give it more firepower to do deals.The company has in recent years been exiting its European businesses and looking to form an ever-closer relationship with the US defence department, the highest-spending military customer in the world.In its annual results presentation in February, Mike Turner, BAE’s chief executive and architect of its US-dominated strategy, said he was keen to buy more US companies following last year’s $4.2bn (£2.4bn) purchase of United Defense Industries, the armoured vehicle maker.The UDI deal was the biggest acquisition in BAE’s history and made it the sixth-largest defence contractor in the US - one level below the big five: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon.At the same time, it has sold its UK avionics business to Finmeccanica of Italy and a German naval electronics business to ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial group, and EADS.According to Mr Tuner, BAE had even considered pulling out of its home market in the UK because of its unhappy relationship with the Ministry of Defence.But times have changed and a recent UK government white paper has established BAE as the partner of choice for the MoD across “air, land and sea”.Where the UK was the most open defence market in the world to international competition, it will now do more to protect BAE as its national champion.Mr Turner is glad that the new spirit of rapprochement should guarantee his company margins of about 8 per cent from what remains its biggest customer. But this pales by comparison with the 15 per cent defence companies expect to make in the US.Hence, while BAE is happy with its position on the Eurofighter, with a huge new deal expected with Saudi Arabia, it continues to see its most attractive growth prospects in the US.In a meeting with analysts last week, BAE’s US management team said it did not need to make more big acquisitions to gain scale because the UDI deal had provided it with a perfect political “footprint” with the DoD.Through UDI, BAE makes the Bradley fighting vehicle used by US armed forces and is heavily involved in creating the next generation of fighting vehicles.Some speculation has centred on a possible bid for L3 Communications, a US defence electronics specialist. But it has a $10bn (£6bn) market value and US BAE executives said such a deal would be too expensive and not earnings enhancing.Some experts feel BAE is more likely to make further bolt-on acquisitions in the £1bn-£2bn range, but with the Airbus cash in its pocket maybe its ambitions will grow.
528;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-04-04T18:39:04Z;CSC cuts 5,000 job cuts as it considers sale;;Computer Sciences Corporation, the US information technology services provider, said on Tuesday it was exploring a sale of the company and would cut 5,000 jobs as business lagged behind in Europe in particular.Los Angeles-based CSC has been seen as an acquisition target for the past six months. Its share price rose 4.6 per cent to a 52-week high of $59.92 in early New York trading.The company said it was exploring “strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a potential sale”. But it warned there was no assurance the process would result in a transaction. Goldman Sachs has been retained as its financial adviser.CSC also announced a restructuring that it expected would significantly improve cash flow and earnings. Van Honeycutt, chief executive, said: “For some time it has been apparent to us that there is excess capacity in certain geographies, particularly in Europe.”CSC said it would eliminate 4,300 jobs by the end of its fiscal year in March 2007 and a further 700 positions in fiscal 2008, a total of about 6 per cent of its 80,000-strong workforce. Most of the cuts would be in Europe, where it has 10,000 workers in the UK and is one of several outsourcers involved in a £6.2bn (€8.9bn) National Health Service project.The restructuring will result in estimated charges of $345m (€285bn) this year and $30m next year, but savings of $150m this year and $300m in fiscal 2008.CSC, which had a market capitalisation of $10.68bn at Monday’s closing price, was first reported to be considering a sale last October. Carlyle and a consortium of private equity groups including Blackstone, Texas Pacific Group, and Warburg Pincus, looked at CSC, as did Lockheed Martin, the aerospace and defence company. EDS was also thought to be a possible buyer and Hewlett-Packard has been linked with the company.CSC deals mainly in large-scale IT outsourcing contracts with business and government customers, including the US military and the Federal Aviation Authority. However, the vogue for all-encompassing IT outsourcing deals has subsided in favour of more specialised contracts, while outsourcing to lower-wage countries has become popular.
529;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-04-04T18:26:58Z;Lex: Computer Sciences;;Sweet clarity. After months of bid rumours, Computer Sciences Corp is formally up for sale. But shareholders should be wary of popping the champagne corks too early. Any potential buyer unaware that the group has long been up for grabs must have its head deep in the sand. Although a formal process might attract more interest, the shares have already enjoyed a healthy dose of takeover speculation.Potential buyers have to wrestle with a few key issues. First, there is the balance between growth and predictability. For private equity bidders, the fact that most of the group’s revenues come from long-term contracts means they can safely add debt to the almost ungeared balance sheet. Falling capital expenditure in the non-government side of the business should also help improve cash flows. But that falling expenditure is not a reflection of strength. It has more to do with the fact that new outsourcing projects have big upfront costs. The relative paucity of new contract wins on the commerical side of the business in the last year or so means lower investment costs, but it also means weaker growth prospects.Second, there is the effect of overseas outsourcing. That increases competition for the non-government business. It also provides potential buyers with the chance to boost margins if they shift more of CSC’s staff offshore.A deal could well include a mix of financial and strategic buyers – for example, Lockheed Martin has shown interest in CSC’s government-focused business. That adds complexity. CSC’s announcement of restructuring plans alongside the potential sale suggests it expects buyers to pay for cost-cutting potential. Even if those issues can be overcome, investors should not expect a big premium.
530;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
531;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-03-26T21:14:26Z;US seeks to end dispute with UK on fighter jets;;The Bush administration is considering ways to provide Britain with technology related to the Joint Strike Fighter after Britain threatened to pull out of the $257bn programme.The UK defence procurement minister told Congress earlier this month the UK would withdraw from the JSF programme unless the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin – which is building the F-35 next-generation stealth fighter – agreed to share technology Britain says is necessary to ensure “operational sovereignty”.A senior Pentagon official said the US was “disposed to really working out this issue”. An official at the State department, which is responsible for licensing military exports, said Washington wanted to be “as supportive as possible of the UK’s defence requirements within the framework of existing law”.A top former administration official said the State department was considering several options, including a presidential waiver. The State department declined to comment on that possibility.The UK, the top international partner in the programme, has already committed $2bn in development money, and plans to buy 150 F-35s. But it wants the Pentagon to share technology – especially computer code that would let the UK upgrade the aircraft without US help – before it locks in its participation.The UK has in the past raised its concernsin private. But the public appeal by Lord Drayson, defence procurement minister, reflects frustration that Washington has not acted quickly enough. However, a British defence official warned that US companies and some members of Congress still resisted sharing sensitive technology.A former senior US official who was heavily involved in the JSF programme said British lobbying over technology transfer had been “shameful”.He said the UK wanted access to computer code for radar systems developed by US companies, despite having opposed the Eurofighter using US technology. “If the Brits force the issue on source code we will have a mess with friends and allies like the Israelis, Singaporeans, Australians and a lot of others.”Australia and Italy, additional partners in the JSF programme, are also unhappy at the US policy. But some industry insiders say Lord Drayson’s appeal will not end opposition from key figures in Congress.Alex Ashbourne, a defence analyst, says: “It is all very well pleading to the Pentagon, but it is not their problem. It is Congress blocking it, but the UK is just not a priority for Congress.”However, UK withdrawal could lead to other countries pulling out, which could raise questions about the programme’s viability.Lord Drayson says the UK has a “Plan B” if he fails to win US concessions. Mike Turner, chief executive of BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest defence company, has said it was possible to adapt the European-built Eurofighter to replace the JSF. Another possibility is for the UK to buy Rafale jets from the French.
532;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-02-23T21:02:31Z;Lex: BAE Systems;;"After an appalling start to the 21st century, BAE Systems had an outstanding 2005. Five big question marks – cash conversion, pensions and government spending in the UK, US and Saudi Arabia – have all been answered emphatically.Operating cash flow after capital expenditure was more than double underlying operating profit, helped by customer pre-payments. BAE expects continued good performance next year. It is addressing its large IAS 19 pension deficit of £4.1bn pre-tax. New agreements should result in a one-off contribution of perhaps £540m, continued cash top-ups of £150m annually and the shouldering of some longevity risk by employees. The hole will not decrease much, but will become easier to measure with reasonable confidence.BAE’s tough negotiating stance with the UK Ministry of Defence has paid off, with a white paper in December committing to more favourable terms. In the US, now accounting for 30 per cent of pro forma sales, President George W. Bush’s recently submitted request for a 7 per cent rise in the 2007 defence budget vindicates BAE’s emphasis on that market and the recent £2.2bn acquisition of United Defence Industries. A little help from the UK government has also prompted Saudi Arabia to sign up to the Typhoon fighter. The terms remain murky, but have restored faith in BAE’s ability to sustain revenues from the Thatcher-era Al Yamamah contract, which still contributes 15-20 per cent of operating profits.From a share price perspective, it is difficult to see what else could go right. BAE’s market capitalisation has risen to £14bn, larger than all its US peers, bar Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The big question now is whether, with low net debt, a £3bn-£4bn stake in Airbus that could be sold and bags of confidence, BAE’s next move will be to find a more substantial acquisition.- Click here to add your comments

533;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-02-13T21:00:11Z;John Dizard: Blood money could be good money;;"Across the ideological spectrum, the US defence budget announced a week ago has been reviled for a continued emphasis on the procurement of huge, technologically ambitious weapons systems at the expense of “boots on the ground” and improvements in existing equipment.At a time when the rest of the federal budget is being restrained to accommodate tax cut extensions, the Pentagon will be getting an 8 per cent increase in weapons expenditures for a total of $84bn or more.That’s not all; under the “supplemental appropriations” for Iraq and Afghanistan war operations, more tens of billions of dollars in equipment purchases will be layered on top. As a US citizen, you might well despair at the Pentagon’s extravagance and poor management. As an investor, the question is: “What’s in it for me?”Until the size of the current budget began to leak out, defence industry analysts in the financial community were beginning to despair of the prospects for their stocks. US defence procurement had bottomed in 1998. The current build-up under both the Clinton and Bush administrations seemed to be passing the sell-by date for equity investors.That would have represented a good run for the patient believer in the truth of Plato’s maxim that: “Only the dead have seen the end of war.” Had you bought a basket of defence stocks at the end of the cold war in 1989, you would have made seven times your money by now, using the Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace fund as a yardstick.Over the first part of that period, stock appreciation will have come from the efficiencies imposed on the industry by newly business-minded managements. Until the post-cold war period, many defence contractors were embedded in diversified conglomerates along with unrelated civilian companies that were supposed to provide counter-cyclical balance. These were unwieldy organisations that focused on the top-line winning of contracts rather than profitability.With the encouragement of the Pentagon, most big contractors were reshuffled though M&A activity into dedicated defence companies. Political risk to any one contractor was reduced by spreading their newly consolidated activities even more broadly through every Congressional district. In the past, one cancelled contract could put an entire company’s finances at risk.Pierre Chao, a senior fellow in the defence industrial practice of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says: “If you had got rid of the F-16 programme [initiated in the 1970s], it would have killed Lockheed. Now, if they cancelled the F-22 programme [the Air Force’s new attack plane] Lockheed Martin would survive. The industry is better run as a business than it has ever been.”Engineering and general management skills, along with connections to friendly members of Congress and the White House, are not enough for success in the defence industry. It is the breadth of your marketing that makes the difference, starting with a high ratio of contracting officers who “liaise”, as they say, with mid-level managers at the Pentagon. And a handful of members and Senators won’t swing the politics. You need politicians across the country. What we are talking about here are corps manoeuvres, not raids by fire teams.Politically, the cynicism and waste of this process are provoking a reaction across the ideological spectrum. I recommend Why We Fight, Eugene Jarecki’s well-made film about the rise of what President Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex. Among the most telling episodes is the account of the use of Air Force “precision-guided munitions”, or PGMs, at the opening of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The idea was to end the war in its first hour by killing, or “decapitating”, Saddam Hussein. The PGMs, which Defence Secretary Rumsfeld insists have hit their target, are shown to have “precisely” killed innocent civilians.This reaction is not only from left-liberals. Ralph Peters, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and faithful supporter of the Iraq war, says: “The worst enemy of our defence is Lockheed Martin. They are so slick, so deeply embedded, that they will prevail no matter what. Rumsfeld has a greater commitment to the defence industry than to national defence.”
Mr Peters, along with many Iraq war veterans in the Army and Marine officer corps, believes the adage that the military should equip the man rather than man the equipment.It’s this sort of sentiment that had led some to think that defence procurement would taper off, starting about now. Steven Kosiak, the director of budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budget Assessments, a Washington defence think-tank, says: “I keep thinking there will be cutbacks but they haven’t happened.”But whatever the political principles – or lack thereof – involved, the latest defence budget appears to be a buy signal for investors. One advantage is the relative certainty of revenue increases over a longer period of time than you can see with other sectors. Mr Chao, who spent years as a Wall Street analyst before moving to the policy side, points out: “With the fiscal 2007 budget I have visibility of earnings into 2008. There aren’t many industries in which you can say that.”Defence companies are much better prepared than in the past for cuts. They spread contracting among the services and weapons systems, so a few cancellations aren’t so dangerous. There are some companies, such as Lockheed Martin and L-3, that are ahead of the pack on contracting skills. Their advantages may not be fully reflected in stock prices, because these stocks tend to move in unison.Even so, the non-professional investor is probably best served by low-cost diversification. Look over such instruments as the Powershares Aerospace & Defence Portfolio Exchange Traded Fund, which is benchmarked against the American Stock Exchange’s Spade defence index.You might dislike the idea of investing in war. Mr Peters, a certified conservative, says “I don’t own any defence stocks. That’s blood money.” But give it some thought. As Leon Trotsky said, “You may not be interested in war but war is interested in you.”"
534;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-02-02T18:19:38Z;Raytheon profits up 13% in busy defence season;;Raytheon, the world’s largest maker of missiles, on Thursday announced better-than-expected profits of $276m for the fourth quarter, closing out an earnings season for the US’s largest defence contractors that saw all five of the Pentagon’s leading arms manufacturers post impressive gains.Raytheon’s fourth quarter profits were up 13 per cent on 2004 levels, and its revenues for the quarter were up 9 per cent to $6.2bn. For the year, Raytheon earned $871m on $21.9bn in sales.Although Raytheon is the smallest of the so-called Big Five Pentagon contractors, it has benefited from the continuing rise in US defence spending along with its bigger competitors, all of whom in the last week reported strong revenue and earnings improvement in 2005.The strong performance has pushed shares in all the major US contractors – Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Raytheon – to at least three-year highs, and has generated huge cash piles for several of the companies, raising expectations for another round of industry consolidation.The industry has also been buoyed by the Pentagon’s decision – expected to be confirmed next week, when it unveils its 2007 budget – not to kill any of the large weapons programmes that were subject to intense cost-cutter scrutiny over recent months as part of the departments’ sweeping quadrennial defence review.Although Raytheon was less vulnerable than the other prime contractors since it makes fewer of the large, high-cost platforms that came under scrutiny, it is a leading subcontractor on several programmes that were thought to be at risk, including the US navy’s new destroyer, called DD(X).Raytheon’s gains came in almost all its business divisions, including its high-profile missile unit, which saw revenues jump 11 per cent to $1.1m in the fourth quarter thanks to the rollout of its latest upgrade for the US navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile. Earnings in the unit climbed 4 per cent to $118m.The company’s defence electronics and sensors division performed the strongest, posting $154m earnings on $1bn in sales. The profits were a 29 per cent increase on a year earlier, an improvement the company said was due to sales overseas and improved performance in domestic programmes.
535;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-01-27T21:58:09Z;Corporate earnings flow helps Wall Street higher;;"Wall Street shrugged off concerns about the pace of economic growth on Friday as the improved flow of corporate earnings drove US equity markets sharply higher.The week had produced robust quarterly figures from Caterpillar, the heavy machinery group, United Technologies, the aerospace and industrial concern, and jet maker Lockheed Martin, which helped ease concerns about profit growth at US companies. Shares in Caterpillar rose nearly 12 per cent over the five days.This was followed by strong earnings on Friday from Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods group that last year bought Gillette, and computer software group Microsoftthe previous evening.The combination helped the markets shrug off news that the US economy grew much less than expected in the fourth quarter.In fact, indications that economic expansion may have started to flag raised hopes that Alan Greenspan, outgoing Federal Reserve chairman, would use the Fed’s next meeting on Tuesday to signal an end to the prolonged period of interest rate tightening.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.9 per cent higher at 10,907.21, the fourth day out of five that blue-chip stocks had gained. The positive run helped erase the memory of a sharp sell-off in equities the previous Friday.The broader S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,283.72 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,304.23.This took the weekly gain in the Dow to 2.3 per cent; in the S&P to 1.8 per cent; and in Nasdaq to 2.5 per cent.Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co, said the week had seen a change in sentiment.“Last week there were lots of negatives with earnings guidance. But right now there is more good news than bad news out there.“European and Asian markets are strong and with these numbers from Microsoft and Procter & Gamble we have the foundations for a good market.”However, wider concerns were never far from the surface, as the week gave more evidence of a slowdown in the US housing market. The market also remained wary of fluctuations in the oil price, ahead of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna, which begins on Tuesday.The week brought an upswing in merger and acquisition activity and an end to the two-month battle for Guidant, the heart devices maker.It opted for a $27bn deal with Boston Scientific, which meant defeat for rival healthcare group Johnson & Johnson. However, news of weak quarterly earnings from Guidant on Friday weighed on the deal, and Boston shares ended the week down 9 per cent.Walt Disney, the entertainment house, also sealed the $7bn acquisition of Pixar, the animation house that made the Toy Story cartoons, a deal that was well received.“We view the Disney-Pixar combination as a near-perfect strategic fit,” said Jessica Reif Cohen, at Morgan Stanley. Disney shares ended the week down 2.6 per cent.Steel consolidation was also on the agenda, particularly after news that Mittal Steel had made a $22.8bn approach for European rival Arcelor. Shares in US Steel were up more than 17 per cent on the week on hope it too could receive a takeover.The auto industry continued to make the wrong sort of headlines, as General Motors unveiled its biggest loss since 1992, hurt by a $4.8bn fourth-quarter deficit, and Ford Motor announced plans to axe 25,000 jobs and close seven plants in an effort to scale back capacity. That said, General Motors remained the best performing Dow stock last week, up more than 17 per cent.Om Friday, tech stocks came to the fore after Microsoft, up 4.9 per cent to $27.79, reported solid quarterly figures.Chipmaker Broadcom surged 19 per cent to $69.87 as its profits tripled and came in well ahead of Wall Street expectations.Procter & Gamble gained 1.6 per cent to $59.74 on higher-than-expected earnings.Oil giant Chevron rose 0.3 per cent to $60.38 as the continued high oil price pushed its earnings well ahead of the year before.However, a downgrade from “overweight” to “neutral” from JPMorgan pulled Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer, down 1 per cent to $45.84."
536;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2006-01-26T21:57:42Z;Caterpillar does the heavy lifting on Wall Street;;Earnings from a host of leading companies, including six constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, contributed to a strong performance on Wall Street.Among the best performers was Caterpillar as the heavy machinery group capped a year of “unprecedented customer demand” by raising its earnings forecast for 2006. Caterpillar shares gained 5 per cent to $65.17.Also raising guidance for the year, after reporting a surge in quarterly earnings, was Lockheed Martin, the defence group. Its shares rose 3 per cent to $66.99.More sobering was news of a large quarterly loss at General Motors. The ailing carmaker lost 3.4 per cent to $23.05 after reporting fourth-quarter losses of $4.8bn, which contributed to its largest annual deficit since 1992. GM remains the best-performing Dow stock this year, up almost 19 per cent, albeit from a low base.Overall, it was a strong day for equity markets, helped by a robust performance from the financial services sector. The S&P 500 financial services index rose almost 2 per cent.The Dow ended 0.9 per cent higher at 10,809.47, which took the index back above the level at which it began the year. The S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,273.82 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1 per cent to 2,283.00.The rally was helped by the latest batch of economic data that revealed durable goods orders rose more than expected in December and the number of unemployment claimants remained low.Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards & Sons, said: “The market had to digest a lot and that reached a climax on Friday [when US stocks fell sharply]. But I think we are now back into the dominant trend, which is up.”He also said signs of weakness in the US housing market could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates sooner rather than later, which would please investors.In other earnings news, engineering group Honeywell International gained 3.7 per cent to $37.41 thanks to strong demand for its aircraft parts and services.Telecommunications group AT&T rose 1.2 per cent to $25.51 after solid quarterly earnings. Tellabs surged 19.6 per cent to $12.57 after the telecoms equipment maker forecast a rise in first-quarter earnings.However, Apple Computer lost 2.5 per cent to $72.33 as Bear Stearns said search engine Google was working on a rival to Apple’s iTunes download service.Brunswick slumped 13 per cent to $36.04 in spite of higher quarterly earnings as the pleasure-boat maker gave disappointing guidance.There was a sparkling debut for Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain in which McDonald’s has a large stake. Priced at $22, the share doubled in value to end at $44.
537;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Northrop reports profit rise despite hurricanes;;Northrop Grumman, the Los Angeles-based defence giant, saw its profits in the fourth quarter rise 22 per cent over 2004, despite having its warship building operations hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in October.While its revenues for the quarter were largely unchanged at just under $7.9bn, its net income rose to $331m from $272m thanks largely to improved performance in its fast-growing integrated systems division, which includes the company’s unmanned spy drones like the Global Hawk and Firescout.The earnings beat analyst estimates, and the company improved its earnings guidance for 2006 from $4.10 to $4.30 per share to $4.25 to $4.40 per share. The fourth quarter results helped Northrop deliver record revenues of $30.7bn for the year, up 3 per cent over 2004.Northrop also announced it had generated $678m in net cash in the quarter, more than double a year earlier, finishing the year with more than $2.5bn in cash from operating activities. The pile joins other strong cash positions from the US’s defence companies, a situation that has led to speculation the industry is poised for another round of consolidation.Already, shipbuilding rival General Dynamics has moved to acquire defence technology group Anteon for $2.2bn, and Lockheed Martin took a stab at buying the defence services business from Computer Sciences late last year.Ronald Sugar, Northrop chief executive, said in a statement that the “outstanding cash generation” would help the company proceed with its already-announced $1.2bn share buy-back. “This year’s strong results were achieved despite the charges associated with Hurricane Katrina,” Mr Sugar said.The industry is braced for the Pentagon to announce its 2007 budget next month, which is expected to see cuts in several large weapons programmes. Already, Northrop has been hurt by a slow-down in the navy’s new destroyer programme, called DD(X), but the Pentagon has said it would not kill the ship, as many analysts expected.Still, the slow-down in the DD(X) programme, coupled with damage to the company’s shipyards in the Gulf Coast town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, saw Northrop’s shipbuilding revenues slip from more than $1.7bn in 2004 to just under $1.5bn last year. The hit was particularly hard in its surface ships division, where sales dropped 56 per cent.Northrop also said it took a $65m pre-tax charge because of problems in the upgrade of the F-16 fighter, built by Lockheed Martin. Northrop, which is responsible for the electronic warfare suite for the newest version of the fighter, being built for the UAE, said costs will be higher to complete the system.Some of those charges were offset by the sale of its remaining stake in wireless communications provider Endwave, which it unloaded for $14m.
538;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-12-06T18:24:13Z;Aircraft crash kills at least 128 in Tehran;;A military transport aircraft crashed in a residential district of Tehran on Tuesday, killing all 94 people on board and at least 34 people on the ground.The US-made Hercules C-130 had taken off from Mehrabad airport before the pilot reported a technical problem. Most of the 84 passengers were Iranian journalists on their way to cover military exercises in the south.The aircraft landed in the residential district of Azadi, near the airport, where it hit and set on fire an apartment building in a housing estate for air force personnel. Residents said many children were at home from schools shut because of air pollution.Fumes from the millions of vehicles on the streets of Iran’s capital have been trapped by lack of wind. State radio had warned the elderly, young people and those with heart or respiratory ailments not to leave their homes. Many residents were wearing masks, and visibility was greatly reduced.Iran has a patchy air transport safety record. In April, three died when a Boeing 707 left a runway at Tehran, and in 2003 the crash of a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 carrying members of the Revolutionary Guard killed 302.Iran’s ageing US-built aircraft, military and civilian, were all bought before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. US sanctions prevent Iran buying new aircraft and, at least directly, spare parts. The Hercules C-130 is made by Lockheed Martin in Georgia.Unusually, the pollution in Tehran has affected the higher areas in the city’s north, home to its more prosperous citizens, as well as the less affluent south, which contains Tehran’s enormous bazaar.Ahmad Sadat-Mousavi, head of parliament’s environment commission, told Fars news agency that the government had “not always” informed people about dangerous levels of air pollution. “[The levels of pollution] on most days in Tehran are critical, and the schools in the centre of Tehran should be closed on all such days,” he said.“Most residents of Tehran suffer from headaches and tiredness generally caused by pollution,” said a general practitioner. “Asthma is high and more serious diseases are also being triggered.”Tehran’s congested streets reflect petrol prices that are, at about 10 cents a litre, among the world’s lowest. Parliament has shied away from ending high subsidies for fear of increasing inflation above an official level of 15 per cent. But it has recently approved a plan to ration motorists’ access to subsidised petrol through the use of smart cards.Although Tehran’s population has doubled to about 12m since 1986, public transport is limited. The city has a limited metro service, being expanded by Chinese companies, but most travel is in private cars or taxis.
539;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-11-21T21:36:21Z;Fresh M&A keeps Wall Street buoyant;;Wall Street extended its winning streak on Monday, with the main indices all hitting 4½ year highs. Gains in Boeing led the Dow, while General Motors suffered from a renewed sell-off despite announcing radical restructuring plans.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent, or 53.95 points higher at 10,820.28, while the broader S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent, or 6.58 points to 1,254.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.7 per cent, or 14.60 points at 2,241.67.Despite the seemingly impressive upswing, Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, cautioned that the indices are still a way off of their peak from the heady days of the dot-com boom.“We have had a fantastic rally but are we breaking through? Probably not,” he said. “We still need confirmation on whether the indices will be sustained at these levels. But for that we’ll need to wait until next week when the numbers from Black Friday come out.”In the wider market, all eyes were on Boeing after the world’s second-largest commercial planemaker announced record jet sales. The company said it has received $14.3bn in new orders so far at the Dubai Air Show, sending its share price up 3.1 per cent to $69.The stock was the top gainer on the Dow, accounting for 30 per cent of its increase.In contrast, General Motors failed to impress Wall Street cynics with its string of cost cutting initiatives, including the elimination 30,000 jobs and closing plants in the US and Canada.After moving up by as much as 3.7 per cent at one point, its shares hit the skids in afternoon trading, falling 2 per cent to close at $23.58.Traders also made a run on Computer Science, down 11.8 per cent at $48.38, after defence contractor Lockheed Martin pulled out of talks to buy the IT outsourcing company. Lockheed rose 2 per cent to $61.18.A fresh batch of takeover activity, led by Mentor’s $2.2bn hostile bid for Medicis Pharmaceutical, drove much of the movement elsewhere in the market.Medicis rocketed 13.8 per cent to $31.57 after Mentor, a cosmestic surgery product company, made an unsolicited $34.81 a share offer for the skincare product maker.Medicis, which is involved in a bidding war of its own for Inamed, the breast implant maker, said its board had unanimously rejected the Mentor proposal.Mentor was down 8.5 per cent at $51.35.The deal making continued in the telecoms sector, with Sprint Nextel, announcing plans to acquire Alamosa Holdings, its largest wireless affiliate, for $4.3bn, or $18.75 a share. Shares of Sprint rose 0.9 per cent to $25.17 while Alamosa surged 12.9 per cent to $18.35.Meanwhile, home builders continued to recover from the bearish sentiment that has afflicted the sector in the last two weeks amid retreating long term bond yields.The Philadelphia Housing Index rose 1.6 per cent, led by gains in DR Horton, up 3.8 per cent at $36.14, and Toll Brothers, up 3.4 per cent at $35.24.
540;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-11-01T21:27:55Z;Wall St unmoved by Fed rate increase;;Wall Street responded with a yawn to a widely anticipated quarter-point increase in interest rates by the US central bank on Tuesday.The indices were largely unchanged from morning trading following the Federal Reserve’s vote to raise the Fed funds rate by a quarter of a point to 4 per cent as it assessed long-term inflation threats as “contained”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent, or 33.3 points to 10,406.77, with the S&P 500 shedding 0.4 per cent to 1,202.75 and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.3 per cent to 2,114.05.“There was nothing in the Fed’s statement that was unexpected,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach. “Consequently today’s trading was more driven by earning results than anything else.”Away from the Fed’s decision, traders took their cues from corporate earnings, with some downbeat news in the technology sector.Dell tumbled 8.3 per cent to $29.24 after it issued a third quarter earnings warning. The world’s largest personal computer maker said that revenues for the quarter just ended would be below its previous forecast while earnings would be at the lower end of its guidance due to a weak US and UK market. Sentiment for the stock was further weakened following downgrades from UBS and Bear Stearns.Dell’s news hit sentiment across much of the technology sector, with Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, falling 3.6 per cent to $22.65. Meanwhile, Dell’s rivals traded mixed. Shares in Apple slipped 0.2 per cent to $57.50 while Hewlett-Packard rose 0.9 per cent to $28.28 amid reports it is to sell $400 laptop and destop computers through Wal-Mart.Shares in household products makers were also among the fallers. Procter & Gamble shed 1.3 per cent to $55.25 despite announcing better-than-expected figures. Third-quarter profit rose 4.5 per cent, with price increases and new products offsetting higher production and transportation costs.Colgate-Palmolive also slid 1.1 per cent to $52.36 even as results met forecasts while Johnson & Johnson closed 1.2 per cent lower to $61.90.Reliant Energy slid 25.1 per cent to $9.51 as the power provider swung into a loss due to unrealised energy derivatives and a $217m charge to settle a lawsuit.But Medco Health Solutions slid 11.9 per cent to $49.80 as the pharmacy benefits manager said 2006 earnings were likely to miss analyst estimates.Elsewhere, Computer Sciences rose 13.2 per cent to $58 on reports that military contractor Lockheed Martin and three private-equity firms are considering a $12bn, or $64-$65 a share, takeover bid for the technical services provider. Lockheed Martin edged off 1 per cent to $59.95.Broker-dealer and asset manager BKF Capital leapt 10.6 per cent to $19 as Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, revealed he had built up a 15.5 per cent stake and said that BKF was “undervalued”.Nabi Pharmaceuticals crashed 71.8 per cent to $3.63 as the company’s vaccine against staphylococcus infection failed in phase III trials.
541;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-10-25T20:30:42Z;Wall Street pauses for breath;;Wall Street bulls paused for breath on Tuesday after their broadest rally in more than a year as several downbeat earnings forecasts encouraged profit-taking.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at Charles Schwab’s CyberTrader unit, warned clients that Monday’s rally “does not guarantee” further gains, even though such broad rallies tend to herald more durable advances, rather than their conclusion.Shares in Texas Instruments fell 7.7 per cent to $28.55 after the maker of mobile phone chips gave a lower guidance than expected for earnings for the fourth quarter.Also in technology, Lexmark International was 6.5 per cent lower at $39.69 after the printer maker reported sharply declining third quarter profits.PortalPlayer, which makes chips used in Apple’s iPod music players, tumbled 27.7 per cent to $20.15 after the company announced a secondary share offering aimed at raising cash.Altera shares gave up 7.3 per cent to $16.43 a day after the maker of programmable chips said its third quarter revenues would fall short of earlier estimates.Similarly, Altiris saw its shares decline 4.3 per cent to $16.90 after the software company reported falling profits in its third quarter.There was some excitement away from technology stocks as Primedia shares plunged 35.1 per cent to $1.98, a day after the news that its chief executive had left while the niche publisher was exploring plans to split itself into two units.In the same sector, Cablevision Systems lost 12.8 per cent to $24.26 after news its owners, the Dolan family, gave up on taking the cable television operator private.Among Dow components, DuPont, the chemicals manufacturer, saw its stock gain 3 per cent to $40.80 as the announcement of a share buyback offset news of quarterly loss and a warning of profits below expectations in the fourth quarter. Dow Chemical, a rival, was 0.9 per cent lower at $43.89.Also on the old economy side of the market, Sherwin-Williams shares lost 9.1 per cent to $40.75 after the paint manufacturer warned of higher raw materials costs weighing on its latest and future earnings.Against the predominantly negative backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 7.13 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 10,377.87 at the close of the session. The broader S&P 500 index fell 2.84 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,196.54 and the Nasdaq Composite index retreated 6.38 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,109.45.Arthur Hogan, the chief US markets strategist at Jefferies & Co, said that Tuesday’s session amounted to “a whole lot of nothing. However, he said that the stage had been set for a 1,000-point move of the Dow industrials in either direction. “As such, we’ll take flat instead of 100-points down any day,” he said.Defence contractors also suffered, with Lockheed Martin off 1.8 per cent at $61.23 as analysts raises concern about its growth outlook, despite the company reporting 39 per cent growth in third quarter profits.Peer Northrop Grumman was 1.8 per cent off at $52.92 after it reported stalling profits, adding that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico had damaged its shipyards.
542;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-09-07T22:40:25Z;Northrop joins EADS in air force tanker bid;;"US defence giant Northrop Grumman ended months of speculation on Wednesday by announcing it would join Franco-German aerospace group EADS in a campaign to sell in-air refuelling tankers to the US air force, a contract that could be worth more than $20bn (€16bn, £11bn).Northrop and EADS have been in talks for months about joining forces in the bid, using Airbus’s A330 to compete against an expected offer from arch rival Boeing and its 767. But Ronald Sugar, Northrop chief executive, had delayed a final decision because of the ongoing row between the US and European Union over subsidies to the two commercial aircraft makers.Northrop officials said they believed the political climate was now open to a bid with the A330 in spite of the subsidy rift. “We’ve heard both Congress and the air force stress the need for a competition, and we are prepared to address that need by forming a strong industry team,” said Scott Seymour, head of the Northrop division that will oversee the tanker bid.Northrop said it would be prime contractor for the aircraft, dubbed KC-30; EADS would be “a principal subcontractor and team-mate”. The arrangement is similar to competitions in which foreign defence groups have tried to sell airframes to the Pentagon by teaming up with US contractors.Italian group AgustaWestland, for example, recently won a battle to sell the US navy its EH-101 as the president’s Marine One helicopter, but only after it joined up with US defence group Lockheed Martin, which acted as prime contractor on the bid. The Pentagon chose Brazil’s Embraer business jet to act as a new spyplane in a bid where Lockheed was the prime contractor.The agreement is significant for EADS, which has been fighting to get its A330 offering taken seriously since the US tanker replacement programme ramped up three years ago. Former Northrop executive Ralph Crosby, who heads EADS’ North American business, has said it would be nearly impossible for Airbus to win a competition against Boeing without a US partner.“Partnering is important because we can’t bring all the capabilities,” Mr Crosby said in a recent interview. “Quite frankly, in a practical sense for a programme of this scale and scope, the US air force is not likely to buy from a foreign company, even one that is incorporated in the United States.”Boeing dominates the global tanker market, and has sold the 767 to Italy and Japan. But Airbus has made inroads in the last two years, beating the 767 in the UK and Australia."
543;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-08-23T22:38:57Z;Lockheed hired to provide NY subway security system;;New York City's transportation authority has hired Lockheed Martin, the US defence contractor, to build a security network for its subway system, a move meant to protect the largest US public transport network against a terror attack.The announcement of the $212m contract comes three years after New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority was awarded $591m in federal funds to upgrade its security system. Since then, terrorists have killed commuters in Madrid and London, but the MTA has spent only a fraction of the security funds, mostly on information campaigns.But the MTA and the New York Police Department have taken more visible steps to protect the subway system since the July 7 bombings in London. Random bag searches were introduced and the NYPD increased the number of police in the subway.Installation of more than 1,000 cameras and 3,000 motion detectors will begin immediately. The surveillance system will be connected to computers, creating “intelligent video” capabilities. Software will trigger an alert when packages are left on a platform.The MTA said it would eventually install devices to detect biological or other weapons, once the technology is proven and tested.Michael Bloomberg, New York's mayor, had been critical of the pace at which the MTA a state authority was developing its security plan. He called yesterday's announcement an “important step” and said the surveillance cameras would act as an “important deterrent” to terrorists.The delay in developing the plan was due in part to a shake-up within the MTA, which fired its security director in 2003. Another strategy, developed with the US army, fell apart over issues of control.“There was definitely some time lost,” said Neysa Pranger, campaign co-ordinator for the Straphanger's Campaign, a subway riders' advocacy group. “But it seems like they're moving toward getting the [federal] money spent.”Katherine Lapp, the MTA's executive director, said Lockheed's technology was “cutting edge” and “doesn't exist anywhere else in the world”.
544;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-08-23T11:28:41Z;GE and Rolls win $2.4bn defence contract;;The US Department of Defense has awarded a $2.4bn contract to General Electric and Rolls-Royce to develop and produce an engine for the joint strike fighter, the most expensive project in military history.The deal was expected and will provide competition to Pratt & Whitney, which won the initial contract to supply engines for the fighter.GE has a a 60 per cent stake in the engine, known as F136, while Rolls-Royce has 40 per cent.The two companies will produce 14 test engines under the terms of the project, and said they would be ready to begin full production in 2012. Pratt & Whitney will be the sole engine producer for the fighter until that time.Initial estimates suggest that US and UK military forces could buy as many as 5,000 to 6,000 of the fighter aeroplanes in the next 30 years, although there are fears that the Pentagon may cut back on the $245bn project.Lockheed Martin, the US defence company, is the lead builder of the plane, which is scheduled to fly for the first time next year. The fighter is a joint project between the US and the UK, with seven other allies also investing.
545;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-07-28T17:48:40Z;Stealth keeps secrets under allies’ radar;;"An aircraft that winds up costsing $2billion (£1.2bn) should inspire awe, apiece is always going to find itself the brunt of barbed humour, but when it emergedstoriesTRUE??appeared a decade ago that the $2 billionNorthrop Grumman’s hugely expensive B-2 Stealth Bomber was prone to losing its anti-radar stealth ‘paint’ability whenever it flew through rained, it inspired jokes instead. – turning the aircraft into the stealth-equivalent of a flying barn door - needless to say, no-one in the Pentagon was laughing.The problem, which was diagnosed in the early days of the production programme, was soon corrected and stealth aircraft went on to fly in Afghanistan, Kosovo and Iraq, but it quickly fostered a view that the technology, aircraft, stealth aircraft, – which are is designed to be all make planes all but invisible to detection by radar, and other sensors, – are temperamental gold-plated silver bullets – nice if you need to surprise your adversaries with a precision weapon delivered from a black, apparently empty sky, but is prohibitively expensive bothto acquire and maintain; – unless, of course, you’re you are the USnited States of America military.US allies now want the newest generation of the aircraftluxury weapon, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but, it seems, stealth technology and defence export policy do not go well together., as the US and its allies are rapidly learning to their cost, do not go together well.The Pentagon has spent three decades and tens of billions of dollars developing stealthtechnology, much of it in deepest secrecy. Now it is trying to export an the latest stealth aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the latest word in stealth technology, and finding the runwayoad ahead strewn with obstacles. Whilste the F-35 is not a secret programme per se, much of the technology within it is – especially that relating to stealth. The US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps – the aircraft’s three US customers – want to restrict foreign access to stealth and other sensitive aspects of the aircraft. The F-35’s foreign partners, however, many of which have committed large sums of money to the programme, want unfettered access so that they can support and maintain the aircraft during its 30- to 40-year service life.Adam Ingram, UK armed forces minister, recently conceded that the restrictions limiting the UK’s access to design data and weapons technology was a “very serious issue” for the UK. He told Quoted in Jane’s Defence Weekly, he said, :“Discussions are under way to ensure that the information transfer, which is crucial to our maintenance of the [F-35] fleet, is completed to our satisfaction,” he told Jane’s Defence Weekly. Mr Ingram said that the UK government would work earnestly to ensure that ““blockages” to the tech-transfer issue in the US political process were removedMany now predict a titanic struggle. ahead. Jeffrey Kohler, director of the US Defense Security Co-operation Agency, was recently quoted JANESas sayingid that the UK should not expect access to “all design data and blueprints”. relating to the aircraft.But the clock isnow ticking. At the end of next year, up to eight nations – Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the UK – need to sign agreements with the US government that will commit them to production of the F-35. Between now and then, the deadlock must somehow be resolved.broken.The US has made no bones over the fact that the “low observable” or stealthy attributes of the F-35, built by Lockheed Martin and its industrial partners Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, will be toned down, or “de-tuned”, for all exportcustomers of the aircraft, . But it has only recently become clear that this is no simple proposition. a walk around he new recently completed F-35 production line at Lockheed Martin’s mile-long combat aircraft manufacturing facility at Fort Worth, Texas, reveals that tells even a casual observer that stealth has become is so integral to the aircraft, so bound up in the production process, to production that de-tuning stealth it from the aircraft is far easier said than done.The F-35 JSF is built by Lockheed Martin and its industrial partners Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems. The aircraft is being developed in three variants: a conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) version for operation from normal runways, a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant and a naval carrier-capable (CV) version. The first prototype F-35A, the CTOL variant, is due to fly next year, the F-35B STOVL prototype the year after and the F-35C CV version in 2009.A truly stealthy aircraft is one that is difficult to detect across a range of electromagnetic frequencies – radar, infrared and even visual -but the most critical, and certainly the first to be seriously addressed, was the issue of is radar detection.When energy from a ground-based radar strikes an aircraft it is typically reflected in multiple directions, bouncing every which way off the target as it hits wings, fuselage, tail surfaces and the whirling compressor blades of the aircraft’sengines. But a critical percentage of the energy is reflected back at the radar’s receiver, resulting in a radar ““return” – the image an operator sees of an aircraft on a radar screen.When Lockheed made its stealth breakthrough in the mid-1970s, it realised that composing an aircraft of a series of “facets” orflat panels, each capable of angling radar energy away from the most severe radar threat – transmitter-receivers to the front and rear of the aircraft – effectively reduced the radar cross-section or RCS of the aircraft to that of a small bird. The Lockheed product of this, the F-117A Stealth Fighter, deployed in secret in the early 1980s, , was the most revolutionary advance in air warfare since the advent of the jet engine, but like the B-2, its Northrop-built successor, the aircraft had problems: it was notoriously difficult to maintain in the field. After each sortie a small army of “stealth maintainers” would swarm over the aircraft, applying radar-absorbent putty over cracks and gaps. Even A screw, poorly adjusted, could make the ­aircraft “bloom” on a radar screen. Improvements in computational design techniques since the F-117A, visible in subsequent generations of stealth aircraft like the B-2 and the US Air Force’s brand new fighter, the Lockheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor, have done away with the facets to produce smooth, ‘blended’ designs. But even the F/A-22, its designers are forced to admit, requires serious post-sortie attention from the stealth-maintainers and their radar-absorbent putty.This bespoke, costly and time-consuming methodology had to end with the F-35, which on top of its requirement to be super-stealthy – it has an RCS of a bee-sized insect – also had to be cheap to maintain in the field or face cancellation. Lockheed Martin has achieved this by building stealth into the aircraft via a series of manufacturing advances that are visible right the way across the F-35’s production and assembly line at Fort Worth.By working to manufacturing tolerances of 50 microns, less than half the thickness of a human hair, Lockheed has been able to eradicate the cracks and gaps that have bedevilled previous generations of stealth aircraft. The upper wing-skin of the first F-35 prototype now coming together at Fort Worth - at 42 ft in span it is the largest composite part ever made for a fighter - was measured to be accurate to within two thousandths of an inch across its span after the cutting and trimming process; a feat, says Ed Linhart, vice-president of F-35 production operations integrated product team, says the new aircraft has: that will be repeatable on every F-35 that rolls off the line. “The F-35 has a requirement for ‘supportable low observability’,” Linhart says. “That means the aircraft is turning a lot of sorties and it gets beat up, but it still has to maintain its LO performance. But unlike previous stealth planes, it can’t afford to be swarmed over by what we call ‘Martians’ – the guys who putty over the cracks and recoat. It’s “got to be able to take a beating and go back out and operate undetected. These manufacturing tolerances are a way to achieve that”. The glass-fibre composite structure, itself, Mr Linhart adds, is also much more resilient than earlier composite materials and is even able to resist bird strikes without chipping. Composite parts, especially those that are large and complex in shape, are notoriously difficult to scan for production flaws, but here, too, Lockheed has been able to fall back on some critical innovation. The Laser Ultrasonic Technology (LaserUT) Center, tucked into a quiet corner of the production floor, has been under development at Fort Worth for almost two decades. It used to take up to 24 hours to scan the mid-fuselage structure of the F/A-22 using traditional water-based ultrasound methods. LaserUT carries out the same procedure in less than an hour. A deployable version is currently being explored that will enable maintainers to support the F-35 in the field. By the time full rate production is reached in around 2012, one F-35 is set to roll off the line every working day of the year. Production could continue to 2030 and even beyond.International partnership is key to the future success of the F-35 project. Somehow A formula must be found between now and the end of next year to resolve unlock the current deadlock on certain the critical tech-transfer issues. The Pentagon still has not explained how it is going to “de-tune” the F-35’s stealth signature for the export market, perhaps because it knows that in an aircraft where stealth is more than skin deep it is not easy to do. it cannot be done – at least, not completely. True stealth, epitomised by its state of the art in the F-35, is not skin-deep, but built in from the inside out. Only now that the F-35’s lean, ultra-modern production line is at last on show is it possible to see how deep that capability is embedded within the aircraft."
546;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Lockheed soars on Pentagon contracts;;The continuing turnround at Lockheed Martin's space business, which includes satellites and rockets, helped the world's largest defence group increase second-quarter profits by 56 per cent to $461m, or $1.02 a share.The US company's space systems unit showed on Tuesday it was continuing to streamline to improve profit margins, while at the same time securing increases in revenue. Lockheed also saw cost controls and profit improvement across the company, prompting it to raise its estimate for full-year earnings by about 7 per cent to $3.60 to $3.75 a share, against earlier estimates of $3.35 to $3.55.David Strauss, an analyst at UBS, said the higher earnings forecast reflected a better performance than expected at the space unit, as well as a lower corporate expense and tax rate, plus a one-time gain.Lockheed shares rose 2.4 per cent to $64.00 in New York trading, close to their 52-week high of $65.46. Like its industry peers, Lockheed has benefited from a surge in defence spending. The US defence budget has seen increases for high-technology products, including new electronic networks to connect battlefield components, as well as upgrades to jet fighters and ships.However, some investors and analysts remain cautious about the short-term outlook for defence stocks.Rising US budget deficits could curb future spending and delay contract awards, and the Pentagon is also conducting a scheduled defence programme review that could hurt some companies.Nick Fothergill, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said: “We would articulate some caution at any significant [share] price increase due to possible headline risk from the quadrennial defence review.”For its part, Lockheed has concentrated on improving efficiency and boosting cash flow across all its units.Total sales in the quarter rose 6 per cent to $9.29bn. It expects between $36.5bn to $38bn in sales this year, and $3bn in cash flow from operations.Space systems sales rose 5 per cent in the quarter, with profit up 13 per cent.The electronics and information technology unit saw sales rise 17 per cent, and operating profit up 27 per cent.Lockheed's military aircraft sales declined in the quarter, although the division managed a 3 per cent rise in operating profit.
547;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-05-18T23:13:13Z;US defence group in talks to acquire Titan;;L-3 Communications Holdings, the US defence group, is in talks to acquire Titan Corporation, a developer of technologies for national security worth $1.7bn in market capitalisation.The discussions come less than a year after Titan's previous agreement to be sold to Lockheed-Martin for $2.4bn was terminated because of a federal investigation into a case of foreign bribery. In March, Titan settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $28.5m after admitting to charges, including having funnelled money to an adviser of the president of Benin in the 1990s. The settlement paved the way for Titan to actively consider a sale again. The current talks to be taken over by L-3 are at a fairly advanced stage, although they could still fall apart, according to people familiar with the matter.L-3, which produces items such as surveillance and communications intelligence systems, as well as collision avoidance systems and cockpit voice recorders for military and commercial aircraft, has grown spectacularly since Frank Lanza, former Loral president, founded the group in 1997. It did so through dozens of small to mid-sized acquisitions of defence and security companies. Last year Mr Lanza made five purchases totalling $435m and posted $6.9bn in sales.In addition, L-3 recently lost out in a bidding war to Britain's BAE Systems for armoured vehicle maker United Defence, according to people involved in those negotiations.L-3, which is based in New York, offered to pay about $4bn for United Defence, industry executives said.Titan would fit into L-3's expanding portfolio, where Mr Lanza has made a series of purchases of small groups specialising in surveillance and intelligence-gathering. The price of L-3's potential offer for Titan was unclear on Wednesday night. Titan's shares rose 6.6 per cent on Wednesday to $20.03 after it emerged that the company had abruptly cancelled two investor presentations.The move was interpreted by many Wall Street investors as evidence that Titan, which is based in San Diego, was in the middle of negotiating a deal. L-3 shares rose 1.5 per cent to $68.59, giving the company a market capitalisation of $8.1bn.The talks between L-3 and Titan at a time when US defence companies are enjoying strong earnings growth despite the possibility that the Pentagon might cut spending. Last month, Northrop Grumman's earnings rose 76 per cent, while Raytheon's earnings rose 30 per cent. Titan's net income from continuing operations was $18.2m in the first quarter compared with $3.6m in the same period last year. L-3 and Titan declined to comment.
548;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-05-03T00:04:19Z;Boeing and Lockheed in satellite deal;;Boeing and Lockheed Martin are to combine their satellite launch operations in an unusual move between two defence rivals, ending a US government strategy of seeking to maintain two launch services available to support US military launches.The proposed merger, which must get government and regulatory approval, could save the government up to $100m-$150m a year and is also intended to cease several years of bitter civil litigation between the two companies over a military launch contract.Boeing was accused of improperly using proprietary data from Lockheed to win the so-called Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Contract in 1998. Amid the ensuing ethics scandal, the US Air Force removed $1bn in contracts from Boeing and temporarily suspended its division.The companies discussed the concept with the Air Force, which is supportive of the approach, Lockheed said. The plan maintains each company's rockets, but combines administrative, launching and manufacturing infrastructure. The government will deal with only one provider in bidding for either rocket.Robert Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said: “This combination will permit our national customers to achieve their mission objectives while reflecting current budget pressures and providing the government with full cost visibility.”Despite the acrimony between the companies,the launch business had changed, prompting thejoint venture. Both Lockheed and Boeing had been lobbying the US Air Force for several yearsfor subsidies to help maintain separate launch capability and infrastructure.In the 1990s, the idea for two launch providers came as a booming commercial satellite market was expected to keep both companies' order books full. But recently they argued that the collapse in that commercial market had made it uneconomic and counterproductive.Lockheed produces its Atlas V family of launch vehicles, and Boeing has a Delta IV family. Both services will be available under the venture, to becalled United Launch Alliance.Meanwhile, at its annual general meeting on Monday in Chicago, Lew Platt, Boeing's chairman, said Boeing had finalised a shortlist for a new chief executive.

Arnaud Lagadère, a big French Airbus shareholder and billionaire, yelled: ""I love you dad,"" paying tribute to his late father Jean-Luc, who helped found the multinational Airbus.Meanwhile Jacques Chirac, French president, told Airbus to expect him tomorrow. He's straight into the slipstream, no doubt clutching a copy of the European constitution to show how essential approving it is for France's industrial future.Part-time boffinEdward Krubasik, one of the more cerebral of the management board members at Siemens, the German engineering giant, could have a new outlet for his thoughts about how to reform the European economy.In September the former McKinsey consultant - known there as ""Crazy Eddie"" on account of his sometimes radical ideas - will take over as the president of Orgalime, a Brussels-based trade organisation for the pan-European engineering industry.It's just as well the former nuclear physicist has the part-time job to occupy him. Krubasik, 61, has been given less and less to do by Siemens, which on Wednesday reported its half-year results in Lisbon.His responsibilities have been cut back in the past two years, while the prized job of stewarding new management programmes has passed to fellow board member Klaus Wucherer.Certainly Wucherer - nicknamed ""the wandering engineer"" because of his interest in travelling the world to inculcate new technical wheezes - appears almost deliriously happy in the latest picture of the management board posted on the company's website, while Krubasik is the only one not smiling.Blunt phone callThe figures told the usual sad story of Siemens' mobile phone division.

Congress has 30 days to object.Any deal would be the first sale of the Lockheed Martin-built munition to a foreign country.In January, Dick Cheney, US vice-president, suggested that Israel might take military action if the US and European Union failed to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions.Ariel Sharon, Israeli prime minister, this month said Israel had no intention of attacking Iran.However, Iran will not welcome any sale, which would come as Tehran negotiates with France, Germany and the UK over halting its nuclear programme. Iran says the programme is for peaceful purposes.“It is certainly going to catch the attention of the Iranians who are concerned that bombs might be used against the kind of facilities that they have been building,” said Patrick Clawson, deputy director of the Washington Institute of Near East Studies.Mr Clawson said the bunker buster could be used against other targets, including those in Syria.Some experts doubt that Israel would attack Iran's nuclear facilities, given their number and the fact that not all locations are known. Others have argued that striking some facilities could deal a serious setback to any Iranian attempts to develop a nuclear bomb.David Siegel, spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington, said the GBU-28 was “one component in a basket of measures Israel is acquiring”.

The S&P 500 also fell 0.9 per cent, to 1,151.83, while the Nasdaq fell 1.2 per cent to 1,927.44.The slide followed reports that US consumer confidence fell to a five-month low in April, the third successive month of declines in the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index.Owen Fitzpatrick, fund manager at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said the recent volatility on Wall Street was a sign that investors were rotating into more defensive stocks, or out of equities altogether.“You’ll see people return to equities later this year, once they realise there is still growth there,” he said.American International Group, the insurance company, was one of the biggest laggards on the Dow. It fell 1.3 per cent to $51.07 after Eliot Spitzer, New York state attorney-general, said he would expand his probe of the company.Gains for International Business Machines helped keep the Dow’s losses in check.

Lockheed's improved outlook reflects more revenue from the space unit this year, as well as the effects of an acquisition and the delay in booking as expenses stock options used for employee compensation.The company expects earnings per share this year of $3.35-$3.55, up from earlier expectations of $3.05-$3.30. It projects sales this year of $36.5bn-$38bn, up from prior forecasts of $36bn-$37.5bn.Nevertheless, investors and analysts remain watchful for signs that US defence spending could be reduced significantly in the near future because of federal budgetary pressures.Lockheed could be sensitive to shifts in spending. It has recently won several big defence contracts and could be vulnerable if they were scaled back as well as being exposed to Pentagon evaluations of several ongoing military programmes, some analysts said. A rise in its stock price relative to its earnings was ""limited due to defence budget and Lockheed specific programme risk"", said David Strauss, analyst at UBS, in a report.Lockheed improved its first-quarter earnings with profit margin expansions in its space and aeronautics businesses, and higher sales in its computer system and electronics unit.Net income increased 27 per cent to $369m, or 83 cents per share, compared with $291m, or 65 cents, last year.Sales in the quarter increased 2 per cent to $8.49bn, from $8.35bn last time, which was lower than Wall Street's averaged projection of a 5 per cent rise.Space division profits rose 28 per cent in the quarter, on a sales increase of 5 per cent.Sales in its aircraft business fell 4 per cent, but profits increased 8 per cent. The group saw lower sales of its F-16 fighter jet, but more sales in its C-5 heavy cargo plane, and improvements in the scrutinised C-130 cargo aircraft programme.It also said it had won a $1.1bn contract to upgrade Turkey's F-16 fighters."
553;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-04-13T23:18:06Z;Air force agrees to restructure Hercules deal;;The US air force has agreed to restructure C130-J Hercules aircraft contracts with Lockheed Martin, after John McCain, the Arizona senator, raised concerns about transparency and accountability to the taxpayer.The decision marks another victory for Mr McCain, a Republican who is campaigning to increase transparency and cost protections for military acquisitions.Last week the US army agreed to convert the Boeing-led $100bn Future Combat Systems programme into a more transparent contract following prodding from Mr McCain. “The air force has already begun to implement a more traditional contract structure for the C-130J program,” said Doug Karas, an air force spokesman. “They have also initiated discussions with Lockheed to convert the current multi-year to a more traditional structure.”In his budget proposal for fiscal 2006, President George W. Bush recommended that the Pentagon kill the C-130J contract. But the air force is lobbying to save the programme, which has strong support from lawmakers in Georgia, where the aircraft is built. Last week, the air force told the Senate armed services committee that cancelling the C130-J contract would increase overhead costs for the F/A-22 Raptor aircraft, a programme that is seeing increased scrutiny from Mr McCain.In 1995, the air force structured the C-130J cargo aircraft contract as a “commercial” rather than “military” aircraft, which allowed Lockheed not to reveal cost information. Mr McCain last week threatened to subpoena Lockheed for information, saying the cost per aircraft had increased from $33m in 1995 to $67m in 2004.“We have a deep respect for the senator and he clearly has the interests of the taxpayer at heart and wants to make sure that the airplane provides the right value,” said Tom Jurkowsky, a Lockheed spokesman. “The airplane has performed and has provided good value to …the taxpayer.”Mr McCain said he was looking forward to seeing how the air force would implement its commitment to protect taxpayer interests.
554;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-04-08T21:14:44Z;Scrapping Hercules ‘will raise costs on Raptor';;The Pentagon decision to cancel the C130-J Hercules transport aircraft will increase overhead costs on the stealth F/A-22 Raptor, which has already seen programme cuts because of rising costs, according to the US air force.In his fiscal 2006 budget proposal, President George W. Bush recommended that the defence department cancel a contract with Lockheed Martin to buy C130-J aircraft.John McCain, a Republican on the Senate armed services committee, and the Government Accountability Office have suggested the structure of the deal does not protect the taxpayer.But some lawmakers from Georgia, where the aircraft is built, argue that big cancellation costs would make it more cost-efficient to keep the programme.According to a congressional aide, the air force on Friday told the Senate armed services committee that cancelling the C130-J would also increase costs of the controversial Raptor jet, also made by Lockheed at the same Georgia plant.An air force spokeswoman confirmed that cancelling the C130-J would increase the Raptor's overhead costs. The amount of increase would have to be determined in talks between Lockheed and the air force, she said.Mr McCain, who is spearheading a congressional campaign to ensure that military contracts do not waste taxpayer money, has criticised the C130-J contract, which precludes Lockheed from having to release cost data to the government. He said the cost per aircraft had increased from an estimated $33m in 1995 to $67m in 2004, and has threatened to subpoena the cost information from Lockheed.Lockheed said the company was “working the issue”.James Roche, the former air force secretary who has championed the F/A-22 programme, said cancelling the C130-J would “absolutely” lead to increased costs for the Raptor because of shared overhead costs. “The taxpayer will pay for the overhead in any event,” he said. The C130-J development comes as some members of Congress are more closely scrutinising the spiralling costs of military programmes. The FT reported yesterday that the Joint Strike Fighter three versions of a Lockheed jet intended for the US air force, as well as the UK and other allies could cost $5bn more to develop than previously estimated.This week Gordon England, the secretary of the navy who has been nominated to become deputy defence secretary, said the companies building the JSF had resolved previous technical difficulties. But the Cost Analysis Improvement Group, an internal Pentagon analysis group, is now preparing a report estimating that development costs will rise a further $2bn-$5bn, according to several sources.
555;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-04-07T23:42:05Z;US fighter set to exceed estimates by $5bn;;"The Joint Strike Fighter could cost $5bn more to develop than previously estimated, raising the prospect of additional scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about the spiralling costs of military systems.The JSF programme - three versions of a Lockheed Martin fighter jet that will be used by the US air force, navy and marines, as well as allies, including the UK - is already slated to cost over $200bn, making it the most expensive procurement in history.Last year, the Pentagon raised the estimated development costs by $7.5bn to $40.5bn, after it emerged that the vertical take-off version of the jet wanted by the US marines and the UK navy, was too heavy to perform vertical lift-off. Gordon England, the secretary of the Navy who has been nominated to become deputy defence secretary, on Wednesday was quoted by the Fort Worth Star Telegram as saying the companies building the JSF had resolved previous technical difficulties, including the weight problem.But now, signalling potential further cost overruns, the Cost Analysis Improvement Group [CAIG], an internal Pentagon analysis group, is preparing a report that estimates that development costs will rise a further $2-5bn, according to several sources with knowledge of the analysis.""The programme office usually takes a more optimistic attitude towards what cost will be than CAIG, who rely mainly on historical data,"" said one industry source. ""The CAIG is saying $2-5bn more through the end of development than the programme office is.""CAIG is expected to submit its assessment to the Defence Acquisitions Board, which will meet on May 5 to evaluate the JSF programme.Tom Jurkowsky, a Lockheed Martin spokesman, said the company was not aware of any cost overruns, saying the acquisitions board would have to consider many assessments of the JSF programme, including some from Lockheed.But one former senior official said CAIG is ""very highly regarded"" and has been taken increasingly seriously in recent years by Pentagon acquisition chiefs.""They are the true arbiters of cost in the department,"" he said.CAIG played a significant role in raising cost concerns about the now defunct $23.5bn Boeing deal to provide the air force with refuelling tankers. Congress cancelled the contract last year following a protracted investigation by John McCain, a senior Republican senator who wants the Pentagon to tighten the military acquisitions process to protect taxpayers, and revelations that a former air force official had boosted the price of the contract to benefit Boeing.According to one former government official, the Pentagon analysts are concerned about costs to make sure the fighter jets would be ""tamper proof"" so that US allies who buy the planes could not reverse engineer some of the technology onboard.But other sources questioned whether that could amount to $5bn, saying weight issues and integrating computer systems were the most likely cause.""Given a $40.5bn non-recurring bill, [an additional]$2-5bn sounds about right,"" said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at the Teal group. ""You have got to knock a few thousand pounds out of it. That means design changes, and design changes aren't free.""James Roche, who resigned as air force secretary earlier this year, said he was not surprised to learn about cost overruns on the JSF. Mr Roche championed the rival super stealth F/A-22 Raptor jet, also being made by Lockheed, which saw deep cuts in the recent proposed Pentagon budget for 2006.Donald Rumsfeld rebuffed efforts by the air force to ask for fewer JSF in an attempt to save money for the Raptor programme.""I have openly predicted a rise in JSF costs for three years, and a major set of schedule delays,"" said Mr Roche. ""No one believed me. Yet another reason for me to press to fix the F\A-22 which I did!!""Marvin Sambur, who as Mr Roche's acquisitions chief was involved with the JSF programme, said the cost overruns were more likely to be related to integrating the computer systems on the jet. ""[Integration costs] was still the mountain that was going to come and was always an area of great risk,"" said Mr Sambur.But Mr Sambur also cautioned that it was important for CAIG not to consider only the ""worst-case scenario,"" which he said could make a self-fulfilling prophecy, taking money away from other Pentagon programmes.""You want to hold Lockheed's seat to the fire. Don't give them a get out of jail card.""Ahead of the May 5 defence acquisitions board meeting, the Pentagon is trying to hammer out a contract for test aircraft with Lockheed.One source familiar with the negotiations said the Pentagon wants Lockheed to assume more cost risk for the JSF than it has had to for the Raptor aircraft, which has seen costs spiral. Last month, the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, warned that the JSF programme lacked an ""executable"" strategy."

557;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US backs curbs on maker of presidential helicopters;;The US Senate on Wednesday took steps to bar Agusta-Westland from building the new Marine One presidential helicopter unless the company agrees for at least five years not to do any business with Iran or any other state sponsor of terrorism.The move was a backlash against the Pentagon decision in January to bypass Sikorsky, the Connecticut-based helicopter maker, and award the $1.7bn contract to build 23 helicopters to the rival team of Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland.Many observers were surprised when the Pentagon decided against awarding the Marine One to Sikorsky, speculating that the White House wanted to select AgustaWestland, a fully owned subsidiary of Italian defence contractor Finmeccanica, to reward Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, for supporting the US war in Iraq.Under an amendment sponsored by Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, which was attached to a State Department spending bill, AgustaWestland would also face more onerous export control restrictions than are normally imposed on US allies, making it more difficult to share data and technologies with US companies participating in the project.“There are few more sensitive and more important national security concerns than the safe transport of our nation's chief executive,” said Mr Dodd.The bill still faces many obstacles. John Warner, Republican chairman of the Senate armed services committee, warned on Wednesday that the provision interfered with Pentagon procurement authority and that he would fight it.But the House of Representatives has in the past favoured legislation to restrict sharing of defence technologies with US allies.“There's no history of Congress successfully blocking weapons contracts for political reasons,” said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst. “This is more of an effort to look good for the folks back home, but you never know when the ‘buy American' crowd will turn and fight.”Stephen Bryen, president of the US arm of Finmeccanica, acknowledged in an interview with NBC in February that Finmeccanica did business with Iran. “If it's a civilian item that doesn't threaten anyone, then I don't have a problem with that,” he said.Frank Gaffney, founder of the rightwing Center for Security Policy, said companies like Finmeccanica had to decide whether to do business with state sponsors of terror, such as Iran, or the US. “They can’t have both,” he told the FT.AgustaWestland on Wednesday distanced itself from the actions of its parent company, saying it had no plans to do business in Iran.“AgustaWestland has not sold any equipment civil or military, including helicopters and parts to Iran in more than 20 years and has no plans to do so in the future,” said Giuseppe Orsi, chief executive.Mr Dodd made clear his anger that Sikorsky was not awarded the contract, and complained that European countries had reserved similar helicopter contracts for European companies. “They have virtually kept us out of their marketplace,” he said.“This is clearly a Sikorsky home-team effort to stall the Lockheed Martin/Agusta-Westland procurement,” said Todd Malan, director of the Organisation for International Investment, which represents the US subsidiaries of foreign companies.“But Sikorsky is a global company too, I wonder if Sikorsky and its major suppliers could qualify under the terms of this amendment.”Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House armed services committee, has unsuccessfully attempted for the past two years to introduce legislation that would make it more difficult for non-US companies to obtain defence contracts, after his efforts received little support from the Pentagon.Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut congressman, said: “I have raised the issue of AgustaWestland's helicopter sales to Iran and China as a means of gaining support for the Marine One Made in America bill.”
558;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-03-25T19:06:24Z;India bridles at sale of US F-16 jets to Pakistan;;The US has agreed to sell F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, in a significant policy shift that has raised concerns in India.President George W. Bush told Manmohan Singh, the Indian prime minister, on Friday that the US intended to sell the sophisticated jets to Pakistan, according to a senior administration official.?The prime minister expressed India's great disappointment at the decision, which could havenegative consequences for India's security environment,? Sanjaya Baru, a spokesman for Mr Singh, told Reuters.The US suspended delivery of the Lockheed Martin jets in 1990 over concerns about Pakistan's nuclear programme. The decision to proceed with the sale now reflects US recognition of co-operation from Pakistan in the search for Osama bin Laden and the ?war on terror?.The September 11 Commission, the congressionally mandated panel that investigated the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001, recommended in its report last year that the US make a ?long-term commitment? to Pakistan.In November, the US proposed a $1.2bn (?926m, ?640m) package of arms that included Orion surveillance aircraft, Phalanx rapid-fire guns, and missiles.Only last week, Pakistani officials had expressed disappointment that the visit by Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, to Pakistan did not mark any progress on the sale of the F-16s. Senior US officials had said that the delay was partially because of potential opposition from Capitol Hill, especially frompoliticians who are strong opponents of nuclear proliferation.While the long-anticipated sale will not surprise New Delhi, it comes at another awkward moment in an otherwise blossoming relationship between India and the US.New Delhi still believes Islamabad has not done enough to stop separatist Islamist terrorism on Indian soil.Military analysts believe the sale of F-16s will not upset India's conventional supremacy in the region, but it still grates with Indian diplomacy, which has long portrayed Pakistan as an unreliable partner in south Asia.India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers, have waged war three times over the disputed region of Kashmir, though a a 13-month peace process is continuing. This week, Pakistan released hundreds of Indian fishermen in the latest gesture of confidence-building.
559;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-03-02T00:30:54Z;Titan to pay $28.5m in foreign bribery case;;Titan, the US military communications company, is to pay $28.5m in fines after pleading guilty to criminal charges that it violated legislation banning the bribery of foreign officials.Titan on Tuesday settled charges brought by prosecutors and regulators who accused the company of wrongly channelling $2m to the 2001 re-election campaign of Mathieu Kerekou, president of the west African state of Benin.The $28.5m of criminal and civil fines are the biggest ever against a public company for breaches of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Titan which did not admit or deny the civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission had no immediate comment. Lockheed Martin terminated its $1.7bn planned acquisition of San Diego-based Titan last year after the allegations were disclosed.Carol Lam, the US attorney who announced Titan's guilty plea together with the Department of Justice's fraud section, said the penalties demonstrated “both the severity and scope of the misconduct in this case”.The SEC alleged that between 1999 and 2001 Titan paid a total of $3.5m to the Benin president's business adviser in an effort to develop the company's telecommunications project in the country. In 2001, on the orders of at least one former senior Titan officer in the US, the company funnelled $2m via the adviser to Mr Kerekou's re-election campaign, the SEC said.One ex-Titan officer allegedly said the $2m should be falsely invoiced as consulting services by the adviser, who was also the company's business agent in Benin. Some of the $2m was used to pay for T-shirts with messages urging people to vote for Mr Kerekou, said the SEC, which did not claim the Benin president knew about the payments.The SEC alleged that Titan did not have adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.It said the company, thinking Mr Kerekou's support was critical to its wireless telephone project in Benin, gave his wife earrings worth $1,850 in 1999.Titan also falsified documents to enable its business agents in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka to under-report commissions paid to them, said the SEC. It alleged Titan falsified documents to the US government about commissions on equipment exported to France, Japan and Sri Lanka.
560;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Pentagon widens Druyun inquiry to air force contracts;;The Pentagon said on Monday it would launch investigations of eight US Air Force contracts worth about $3bn as part of a broadening inquiry into conflict-of-interest allegations involving Darleen Druyun, the Pentagon's former acquisitions official.Pentagon officials told congressional staff there was evidence that the contracts were tainted through costs being inflated or requirements being watered down in order to help funnel work to companies favoured by Ms Druyun, particularly Boeing.The eight contracts were among more than 400, dating to 1993, that have been examined by the Pentagon's defense contract management agency since the allegations concerning Ms Druyun surfaced last year. She was sentenced last October to nine months in prison on conflict-of-interest charges for negotiating a job at Boeing while serving as the Pentagon's number-two official in charge of acquisition. She has admitted steering billions of dollars in contracts to the company.The largest of the contracts to be investigated by the Pentagon's inspector-general is a $1.5bn maintenance contract for Boeing and Pemco for the KC-135, the air force's jumbo refuelling aircraft. The others include a $561m deal for Lockheed Martin involving the C-5 avionics modernisation programme to update air force flight control systems. The companies said they would co-operate with any investigations.Michael Wynne, acting Pentagon acquisitions chief, said the potentially tainted contracts were identified though an exhaustive review of all contracts handled by Ms Druyun. He said he found no evidence that other acquisitions officials had engaged in similar activities. Boeing is hoping that the contracts scandal, which led to the cancellation of a $23.5bn deal for the air force to buy and lease refuelling tankers, is winding down. Michael Sears, the company's former chief financial officer, will be sentenced on Friday for his role in negotiating with Ms Druyun.Congress's government accountability office is set to announce this week whether it will recommend re-bidding of several contracts awarded to Boeing after objections by Lockheed Martin and others, including a $4bn contract for the C-130 cargo aircraft. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, is also gearing up an investigation of the army's Future Combat Systems project a $100bn system for which Boeing is the lead contractor.On Monday, Mr McCain a vocal advocate for more procurement transparency at the Pentagon hinted that the alleged misconduct in awarding contracts could have involved other Pentagon officials.“It would be astonishing if the alleged misconduct in awarding the contracts could have been so freely perpetrated by one individual,” he said.
561;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-02-10T21:47:07Z;Pentagon re-considers expensive arms cuts;;The Pentagon is considering restoring expensive weapons systems cut from its 2006 budget, just days after President George W. Bush submitted his funding request to Congress.The White House this week asked Congress to provide $419bn (€325bn, £224bn) to fund the military. While the proposed budget prioritises fighting the war on terrorism, it suggests deep cuts in several programmes, including the next generation F/A-22 Raptor fighter jet, the C-130J Hercules transport aircraft and shipbuilding programmes.At a Senate armed services hearing on Thursday, several senators questioned whether the US air force could retain air superiority in coming years without the Raptor. The Pentagon budget slashes to 180 the number of Raptors the air force can buy. The air force says it needs 380 Raptors.John Jumper, the air force chief of staff, told the committee the Pentagon would re-examine whether it should buy more of the Lockheed Martin supersonic fighter in its quadrennial defence review a study of the military's future needs that will be completed this autumn.Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary, told some senators this week the Pentagon would re-evaluate the proposed cuts to the Raptor programme, AP reported on Thursday.Gen Jumper said the Pentagon was also reconsidering planned cuts in the C-130J fleet, saying the military had underestimated the costs associated with cancelling its contract with Lockheed.Some senators, including Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, expressed concern that the US was not funding its navy adequately. The 2006 budget “reverses a lot of the gains we have started to make in recent years”, she said.The administration has also proposed retiring the John F. Kennedy, one of its 12 aircraft carriers, a decision that John Warner, chairman of the committee, said was “shocking”.Carl Levin, the top Democrat on the committee, and John McCain, an Arizona Republican, accused the Pentagon of hiding some costs in a supplementary budget to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that the White House is expected to send to Congress next week. “That is not honest budgeting,” said Mr Levin.Mr Levin also raised concerns about $4.5m included in the budget to fund research into a “bunker-buster” nuclear bomb capable of destroying targets deep beneath the earth.“We're assured there's no plan to producing an RNEP [robust nuclear earth penetrator], and yet suddenly there's money that appears in the air force budget,” he said.Separately on Thursday, Michael Wynne, the top Pentagon acquisitions official, said he had asked the air force to prepare for a competition to replace its ageing fleet of refuelling tankers.The Pentagon last year cancelled a $23.5bn contract with Boeing to buy and lease 100 tankers after Darleen Druyun, a former senior air force procurement official, admitted boosting the price of the deal as a “parting gift” for the company.Ms Druyun was last year sentenced to nine months in prison for violating procurement laws by negotiating a job with Boeing before removing herself from air force negotiations with the company. Mike Sears, who was fired as Boeing's chief financial officer for holding the job talks with Ms Druyun, is next week due to be sentenced for his role in the scandal.“An open competition results in best value for the customer and greatest combat capability for the warfighter,” said Guy Hicks, a spokesman for EADS, the European defence group that plans on competing for the tanker contract.A Pentagon study into ways to recapitalise the tanker fleet has been pushed back several months, increasing the chances that Boeing may have to close its 767 production line.
562;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;The serious doubts over $200bn jet project;;"Lockheed Martin's mile-long manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, is the only place in the world where three fighter aircraft are built under the same roof.Most of the cavernous building is given over to the assembly of dozens of venerable F-16 Fighting Falcons, the single-engine jet that is the backbone of the US air force and the main fighter for two dozen other allied countries. Further down are pieces of the stealthy F/A-22 Raptor, arguably the world's most advanced fighter and certainly its most expensive, which has begun to arrive in the hands of its maiden US air force squadron.But pride of place goes to a giant slice of graphite epoxy composite: the upper wing-skin of Joint Strike Fighter number A-1, the first of what is expected to be thousands of aircraft that may be the last manned fighter jet ever built.The JSF is billed as an aircraft that will transform military aviation. Instead of American and allied pilots flying a mishmash of more than a dozen fighters, there will be one. In the US the JSF will become the primary fighter for the navy, the air force and the Marine Corps, replacing the F/A-18 Hornet, the F-16 and the Harrier respectively. The British armed forces have decided to make it the only fighter on its aircraft carriers, replacing its Harriers. Seven other allies have invested more than $2bn (£1bn, €1.5bn) to be partners in the programme.At an estimated $200bn when completed early in the next decade, the JSF programme is by far the largest project in military history. Yet it must clear hurdles that some believe may be insurmountable.It must prove it is not too heavy to complete its mission. It must convince allies it is not part of a US scheme to control the technologies that run their air forces. Perhaps most importantly, it must also survive in a Pentagon budget that, because of the billions being spent on the war in Iraq, is likely to see deep cuts in weapons procurement for the rest of the decade.The first signs of those budget cuts are expected next week when George W. Bush, the US president, reveals his 2006 spending plan. Robert Elrod, one of two general managers of Lockheed's JSF programme, describes 2006 as a ""tough damn year"": ""With all the funding and all the programmes on the plate, in addition to the stress of funding the Iraq war, it is serious business. And it's going to get harder, not easier.""The aircraft almost did not make it this far. A year ago detailed work by Lockheed engineers uncovered a flaw that almost stopped the programme on the drawing board: the aircraft was thousands of pounds overweight.The JSF is actually three similar fighters. The first, which will be bought by the US air force and most allies, is a conventional fighter designed for standard airstrips. The second version, bigger and sturdier, is for the US navy and can take off from aircraft carriers. The third and most complicated is a ""jump jet"", modelled on the Harrier and to be used by the US marines and the UK's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.For this third version - known as the ""Stovl"", for Short Take-Off, Vertical Landing, and pronounced ""Stove-all"" - Lockheed needed to cram lots of advanced systems - including a revolutionary engine - into the same skin as that of the more conventional versions.As a result the Stovl version emerged about 3,500lb (1,600kg) overweight, making it unable to carry enough bombs and fly far enough. That forced the Pentagon to delay the entire programme by a year and add $7bn to its development budget. Questions were raised about whether the Stovl version could be saved at all, calling the whole programme into question, since without the marines and the UK, much of the rationale behind a single service-wide fighter would be lost.Lockheed asked 500 engineers to look for reductions, and found about 600 changes it could make to bring down the weight by almost 3,000lb. More weight was saved by agreeing to change some of the mission requirements with the Pentagon and improving the engine. In November the Pentagon's acquisition chiefs approved the changes.Not everyone is convinced, however. The Pentagon's independent testing agency said last week the changes might not be enough. ""The Stovl weight reduction target of 3,500lb is optimistic,"" the report found. ""[We] assess there is an additional 800lb to 1,000lb threat to the Stovl design."" Even if the changes do work, many of them - such as smaller bomb bays - make the Stovl increasingly different from the other versions, which could increase costs.Lockheed is also facing some testy allies who argue they were misled when they invested in the programme. Assuaging angry partner countries has become so onerous that Lockheed recently split the job of programme manager between Mr Elrod and Tom Burbage, the fighter's original overseer. Mr Burbage said he had been spending more than half his time dealing with complaining allies.The complaints have their roots in the unusual way the programme is structured. Traditionally, countries that want to buy into a large fighter project are given an industrial sweetener in return for participating. In the rival Eurofighter programme- built by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica - each of four European countries is guaranteed a share of the work for their domestic defence industry, according to a complicated formula based on the number of aircraft they will eventually buy.More common is the use of so-called ""offsets"", which amount to direct investments in the country buying the aircraft by the company and the country that are making the aircraft. The F-16 programme, arguably the most successful fighter ever exported, with more than 4,000 in existence, has already involved $14bn in offsets.Because the JSF was conceived as a low-cost fighter that could be widely bought, however, a decision was made that no country would be guaranteed work. The right to subcontracts would be on a ""best value"" basis rather than through uncompetitive offsets. For some - particularly the UK, with its sophisticated defence industry - such a deal has been beneficial. ""In competition, we have won a greater proportion of the share of work than we would have been entitled to under a strict pro-rata share out,"" says Geoffrey Hoon, UK defence secretary. ""If other countries are not capable of winning those competitions, I don't think I'm going to lose any sleep over that.""However, Lockheed officials are increasingly concerned that other partners might abandon the project and opt for another aircraft, such as the Eurofighter. Mr Burbage's job includes an outreach programme to partner countries to help their industries compete for contracts.Several countries remain unconvinced. ""When Lockheed distributes work, there's a lot of politics behind it, beyond the best value. That's how it looks to me,"" says Murad Bayar, Turkey's undersecretary for defence industries, who maintains that his country does not see many of the bid requests and has not received a fair return on its $175m investment. ""There's a filter. I don't know what I'm not getting.""Norway, which has put in $122m, has taken an even tougher stance, insisting that its air force is keeping its decision as to its combat aircraft open. It has also invested significant funds in Eurofighter. ""If there's no progress on the industrial side I think [parliament] will look at another [fighter],"" says Erik Hernes, head of Norway's Defence Logistics Organisation. ""I'm not confident that things will change too much for the better.""While Britain has no complaints about the amount of JSF work it is winning, however, it has another concern, far more worrying for Lockheed, over its access to the technology needed to keep the aircraft flying.The UK is considered a ""level one"" partner, giving it direct influence on the make-up of the aircraft. This is partly because of its big investment: the Ministry of Defence has contributed $2bn, twice that of any other non-US participant. There is also widespread belief that without the UK the Stovl version would never have been developed, which would have meant the US Marine Corps going without. In addition, Britain's BAE Systems is part of Lockheed's team building the aircraft. This influence means the UK has expected to be given access to all technology developed in the programme.Yet thus far such access has come only through relentless negotiations. The original bilateral agreement has been amended nine times to grant Britain rights to technologies it needed during developmental stages.British defence officials worry that such talks will only get thornier once the aircraft moves into production. ""What we're looking forward to is the technology transfer that we're going to need for the support so these planes can be properly operated and run by the UK,"" says Lord Bach, Britain's defence procurement minister. ""We know that will test the boundaries of the US national disclosure policy.""At the core of the problem are US laws on arms exports that mean the US will disclose technologies only once Britain needs them. During the development phase this was not an important problem. Next year, however, the British government must decide whether to buy the aircraft, putting as much as £2.6bn ($4.9bn) for 150 aircraft at risk. Since the aircraft will not go into service until early next decade, Britain will not know for years whether the US will eventually grant it access to the core software codes it says it needs.British officers are worried. ""With any airplane in my inventory, I need the capability rapidly to modify for different circumstances, whether it be its software or hardware,"" says Air Chief Marshall Sir Brian Burridge, head of the RAF's fighter force. ""We need the intellectual understanding close at hand so we can do that.""Bruce George, an MP and head of the British parliament's defence committee, says: ""It seems to me truly absurd for a country like the UK, which has proved itself to be by far and away the most loyal ally to the US, to be in the position of almost grovelling to the US and saying, 'Please will you give us the information we require'.""Lockheed, for one, is hoping the US government gives in. ""The US wants them to commit to buy airplanes,"" says Mr Burbage. ""The US, if they're going to get that commitment, is going to have to open up and give some reasonable guarantees that the countries that buy the airplanes are going to be able to maintain them. Right now, that's not in the agreement.""Still, it will not be Norway, Turkey or even Britain that decides whether the programme goes forward: it will be the Pentagon. Its ""transformational"" school - officers and civilians who are trying to push the military beyond its cold war-era doctrines, including Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary - supports the JSF, since it transforms the way big programmes are developed and procured. Traditionally, large fighter programmes were managed by a single service, whereas the JSF is being run in partnership by the air force and navy, saving costs in procurement and support. In addition, it is designed for the kinds of missions envisioned by Mr Rumsfeld: ground attacks in support of advancing troops and precision bombing. The transformational school of thought holds that the air force no longer needs highly sophisticated fighters designed for air-to-air dogfights.There are strong indications the Pentagon is about to make a big move in the transformational direction. In a budget decision memo obtained by the Financial Times this month, the Pentagon proposes cutting the F/A-22, the air force's new fighter, by 96 aircraft $10.5bn. There are no cuts for the JSF.The air force, however, whose pilots would rather fly the more sophisticated F/A-22, has frequently made moves that appeared to undermine the JSF programme. In the most recent budget round it proposed cutting its purchase from 1,700 to 1,200, a move seen as an effort to find money for the F/A-22.Publicly, air force officials insist they need both aircraft since the air force has historically operated with an expensive high-end fighter and a larger force of cheaper ""infrastructure"" jets. But privately, senior air force officials question whether the JSF will be delivered on time - a tactic that could convince wavering members of Congress to approve the purchase of more F/A-22s until the JSF comes into service.The air force position has weakened, however. James Roche, arguably the F/A-22's most ardent civilian backer, was recently forced out as secretary of the air force in the wake of a scandal surrounding an air-to-air refuelling tanker contract, improperly awarded to Boeing.In addition, some analysts say the war in Iraq has given Britain political leverage that will make the Bush administration reluctant to propose any JSF cuts. ""Do you honestly believe that if the Pentagon had recommended reducing the Joint Strike Fighter . . . Tony Blair would not immediately be on the phone to George W. Bush?"" asks Dov Zakheim, who recently retired as the Pentagon's top budget official. ""How long do you think it would take for the president to say to Tony Blair: 'I get you'?""Whether the JSF programme survives without cuts will soon be in the hands of a fiscally conservative Congress looking to slash deficits. In spite of its powerful backers, it faces a tough time if it is to win this year's battle - and the battles for years to come.Raptor’s erratic path to air force viabilitySeated in his office at Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics unit in mid-December, Ralph Heath had reason for cheer. After two decades of development, years of manufacturing problems and a last-minute spate of avionics snags, the F/A-22 Raptor programme he had overseen for nearly three years was delivering to its first US air force squadron.His achievement in the $72bn programme had also just brought him one of the top jobs in the global defence industry: head of all Lockheed’s military air craft business. “We’re going to be operating a position of strength on this programme, which is where you want to be,” Mr Heath said at the time. “I think it would have been difficult to move me if we didn’t have confidence, and our customer didn’t have confidence, that the programme is moving forward.”But within weeks, the aura of confidence was challenged. First, just before Christmas, a Raptor being tested at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada crashed shortly after taking off, an accident that remains under investigation. Then Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defence secretary, signed a budget decision memo that cut the programme by $10.5bn, from 277 aircraft to 180. Once again, a cloud hangs over its future.With Donald Rumsfeld running the Pentagon and working to transform the military, his civilian aides - most notably Stephen Cambone, now undersecretary f or intelligence - have made the Raptors a main target.Last year, the White House ordered the Pentagon to determine whether two programmes, the F/A-22 and the army’s Comanche reconnaissance helicopter, were still needed. Just weeks after the memo - widely believed to have been issued at the urging of Mr Cambone - was leaked, the $39bn Comanche was dead. So far, the Raptor has survived, but barely. The air force had originally ordered 750 but, as the number shrinks, the price of each fighter rises. Now each one will go for about $260m, compared to $45m for a Joint Strike Fighter.The air force and Lockheed argue that the aircraft is needed to contend with increasingly sophisticated anti-aircraft systems being developed in Russia and exported. They note that the F-15, the air force’s current high-end fighter, has been beaten in war games against forces with Russian-made fighters. But the JSF will have similar stealth capabilities to the F/A-22, even if it will not be as fast or as manoeuvrable. That has led critics to argue that JSF will be good enough for the task at hand.The cuts in the programme are not a foregone conclusion. There is strong support for the Raptor on Capitol Hill and the reductions could be restored when the official budget is announced next week. But the absence of James Roche, the Raptor backer who quit as air force secretary after a contract scandal, will hurt the air force’s chances. “The air force needs to work very hard at regaining the credibility lost,” says an industry executive involved in the programme. “I’m concerned that in the budget battle, the re’s not going to be anyone to carry the water.”In the long run, however, the cuts are unlikely to be fatal. Many of them are in so-called out-years - from 2009 to 2011, under a new administration. In addition, Lockheed executives note that the original order for the F-16 was for fewer than 1,000 but about 4,500 have been built.“They’ve got a stated requirement of at least 381,” says Mr Heath of the Pentagon and the F/A-22. “As [more are built and] the cost continues to come down, and the capability is as advertised or better, I think Congress and government in general are going to be more willing to invest further in that programme.”"
563;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-01-29T00:44:44Z;Deal lifts US ambitions of European defence companies;;The navy decision on Friday to award a share of the prestigious Marine One presidential helicopter deal to AgustaWestland raises the question of whether the US is becoming more fertile ground for European defence companies.AgustaWestland and Lockheed Martin, its US partner, received a $1.7bn contract to build a 23-aircraft fleet of presidential helicopters. The transatlantic team delivered a stunning blow to Sikorsky, which had flown the US president since 1957 when it delivered its first chopper to President Dwight Eisenhower.The competition was high stakes from the beginning. As one of the most prestigious defence deals with plenty of opportunities for photo-ops for the winner as the president flies in and out of the White House it was expected by many observers to go to the Sikorsky. The Connecticut-based company launched a big political and press offensive, playing the patriotic card, saying its US-made helicopter was safer and would not compromise the president's security.Meanwhile, Lockheed and AgustaWestland emphasised that 65 of their US-101 choppers would be made in the US. “That's really not a factor in the source selection because both teams were required with their proposal to submit a certification that they were compliant with the applicable provisions statues and regulations in the Buy American provisions,” said John Young, assistant secretary of the navy for research, development and acquisition.“Both teams have done that and beyond that it's not a factor in the source selection.”While there was a lot of pressure from lawmakers supporting Sikorsky to select a US company, some observers suggested the White House would tell the Pentagon to pick the Anglo-Italian AgustaWestland to thank Tony Blair, UK prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, for supporting President George W. Bush's war in Iraq. Mr Young on Friday said politics had not influenced the decision.The competition was also keenly followed across the Atlantic as European defence companies watched to see whether the Pentagon would be prepared to choose a consortium with a strong European flavour. Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House armed services committee, last year tried to push through legislation that would have made it more difficult for non-American companies to win defence contracts.The Marine One competition was keenly observed by EADS, the parent of Airbus, which wants to supply the US air force with refuelling tankers. The Pentagon recently decided to cancel Boeing's non-competed $23.5bn deal to supply the tankers after a former air force procurement official admitted boosting the price as a “gift” to the company.James Roche, who recently resigned as Air Force secretary, last month said EADS was now technically capable of supplying tankers for the Air Force. He had disparaged EADS and Ralph Crosby, head of its American operation.
564;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-01-27T14:00:06Z;Lockheed lifts earnings to $372m;;Lockheed Martin reported that fourth quarter net earnings rose to $372m, or 83 cents a share, compared to $344m, or 77 cents a share, the year before, driven by space systems and electronics.Net sales were $10bn, an 11 per cent increase over fourth quarter 2003 sales of $9bn.“We had excellent performance in 2004, resulting from the dedicated efforts of our workforce,” said Bob Stevens, chief executive. “We will continue to deliver critical capabilities to our customers and focus on the fundamentals of our business while improving returns on invested capital and deploying cash to enhance shareholder value.”In electronic systems, operating profit jumped by 35 per cent for the quarter and 13 per cent for the year. Space systems’ operating profit increased by 23 per cent for the quarter and 21 per cent for the year. For the quarter, the increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to the additional commercial satellite deliveries, which was partially offset by lower profit on certain government satellite programmes.The company said the fourth quarter results included an after-tax loss of $154m, or 34 cents a share, for the effect of previously disclosed unusual items including a litigation charge, the cost of early retirement of debt, and gaines on asset sales.The period also included a $144m reduction in income tax expense.The company is forecasting earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.30 for 2005. The figure excludes about 30 cents a share in higher pension costs and stock option expenses. Sales for the year are forecast at $36bn-$37.5bn.
565;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2005-01-12T20:55:22Z;EADS to seek US home for tanker facility;;Airbus parent EADS on Wednesday took its biggest step yet towards setting up a US-based plant to construct air-to-air refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, announcing a search to find a home for the new facility.Although the Pentagon has not yet announced a new tender for tankers, rival Boeing's deal with the air force a $23bn contract to convert 100 767s into refuellers is widely regarded as dead.This follows revelations that the air force procurement official overseeing the programme steered billions of dollars in contracts to Boeing to secure a job at the company.Ralph Crosby, head of EADS in North America, said it hoped to select a city by the end of the year. The company would at first build a small engineering centre to support Airbus's A330, A340 and A350 commercial aircraft.The engineering centre would be operational by the first quarter of 2006, employing just 50 people to begin with.However, EADS was budgeting an investment of $500m-$600m to expand the facility in case it was chosen to build a “sizeable” number of tankers for the air force. The site would then be able to convert A330s into tankers and potentially do more advanced assembly work on the aircraft.“While there is no formal programme at this point, the deputy defence secretary has said there definitely will be a competition,” Mr Crosby said. “Given the US will be the place where these tankers will be built …we felt like giving states and localities the chance to put their best foot forward.”EADS, largely a Franco-German company, has said it hopes to link with a large US defence company in a tanker bid. Mr Crosby said the future partner likely to be either Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman could influence the location of the new plant.Mr Crosby said that, for the time being, the criteria would be limited to infrastructure including an existing 9,000 ft runway and a skilled employment base. He declined to comment on whether political considerations would be taken into account in choosing a location.

Other action was limited amid a dearth of corporate news.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 10,800.82. The S&P 500 was marginally firmer at 1,213.55, and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1 per cent to 2,178.34.Traders, pundits and investors brimming with anticipation at the prospect of a so-called ""Santa Claus rally"" to end the year have been disappointed by the stock market's lacklustre performance in the first days of post-Christmas trading.Bulls took heart in the penultimate trading session of the year, however, as oil briefly fell back below $42 per barrel and US figures showed a bigger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims.Boeing, the aerospace group, took centre stage after it announced it had won a $1.3bn order for 10 of its new 7E7 Dreamliner commercial jets from Continental. But Boeing shares gave up early gains to fall 0.3 per cent to $51.90.Defence stocks edged higher despite a New York Times report that the Pentagon plans drastic spending cuts. Lockheed Martin rose 0.6 per cent to $55.60. Northrop Grumman edged up 0.3 per cent to $54.76.Airlines recovered some of their recent losses, with AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, up 1.6 per cent to $10.98. Continental Airlines rose 1.9 per cent to $13.70 and Delta Air Lines jumped 0.8 per cent to $7.51. US Airways fell 6.6 per cent to $1.14, however, as its Comair subsidiary continued to struggle to clear a backlog of lost luggage from cancelled flights on Christmas.Steelmakers led decliners amid mounting concerns that a flood of Chinese steel exports could lead to falling prices. US Steel fell 5.5 per cent to $50.04, while Nucor, a rival, dropped 6.4 per cent to $51.38. Allegheny Technologies, another steel maker, declined by 3.4 per cent to $21.38.Semiconductors were broadly higher. Applied Micro Circuits rose 5.9 per cent to $4.14, while Texas Instruments rose 0.7 per cent to $24.51. Intel, the world's biggest chip group, was flat at $23.35.Pfizer shares fell 0.9 per cent to $27.01 after the Wall Street Journal reported that prescriptions for the company's Celebrex painkiller fell by more than 50 per cent last week."

The Nasdaq Composite was barely changed at 2,177.01.The stock market's sputtering performance confounded bullish investors seeking to extend Tuesday's rally, which led all three main US indices to fresh multi-year highs.By the end of Wednesday's session, the Dow was down for the week while both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher, stoking investors' hopes that the stock market would regain momentum to finish the year on a high note.Joe McAlinden, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said: ""It's possible that the strength we saw starting in late October and continuing to mid-December has sapped some of the potential of this final week before the new year.""Mr McAlinden stressed, however, that market fundamentals remained solid, with a ""pretty good"" outlook for corporate earnings in early 2005.Amid a quiet week for corporate news, investor attention remained fixed on oil prices, which edged higher after car bombs exloded in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Investors also digested an update on the US crude oil and distillate stockpile.Aerospace stocks led decliners after a string of downbeat reports from the defence and commercial aircraft sectors. Lockheed Martin, the defence group, fell 2.7 per cent to $55.25 after the New York Times reported that the Pentagon planned cuts in its F/A-22 stealth fighter programme. The US air force had planned to buy 277 fighters at $258m each.Boeing, the leading US aerospace group, fell 2.2 per cent to $52.09 after the Wall Street Journal reported that China planned to suspend new aircraft purchases.Airline stocks were also lower one day after the US government announced it would open an investigation into the severe delays and cancellations that affected flights over the Christmas holiday.US Airways fell 4.7 per cent to $1.22 after it called on employees to volunteer to work without pay at the weekend. The airline was forced to cancel flights and thousands of passengers lost their luggage after large numbers of employees called in sick over Christmas.Delta Air Lines, the parent company of Comair, which stranded thousands of passengers when it cancelled all of its flights on Christmas owing to a computer glitch, fell 1.3 per cent to $7.45.Semiconductor stocks led gainers. Advanced Micro Devices was among the best-performing stocks in the sector, rising as much as 2.3 per cent before falling back to close up 1 per cent at $21.96.Intel, the chip maker, gave up early gains to close down 0.1 per cent at $23.25 after it said it would invest in three companies developing digital devices for the home.Genzyme, the biotechnology group, rose 1.1 per cent to $58.16 after US regulators approved the company's leukaemia treatment.Satellite radio stocks continued their bumpy ride, with shares in Sirius Satellite Radio down 6.7 per cent at $7.29.Shares in rival XM Satellite Radio fell 3.2 per cent to $37.63. Both companies have garnered attention in recent months as they attempt to carve a niche in the market for radios that receive music broadcast by satellite.Toys R Us rose 2.6 per cent to $20.59 after the company said it would offer executives bonuses if they chose to stay on after the company completed its restructuring programme."
568;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2004-12-22T20:22:05Z;Lex: Christmas markets;;The only religion that demands its adherents work over Christmas is cricket. Isolated in the office, fans can watch Australia's annual five-day Test match undisturbed by Indiana Jones, close relatives and, they hope, share prices. Usually, it is a safe bet. From December 24 to the first trading day of January, the Dow Jones has risen in 29 of the past 40 years, with a mean return of 1.6 per cent. Only in 1974 did returns in either direction exceed 5 per cent.The FTSE All-Share has performed similarly. Contrary to general belief, volatility is usually low, in spite of volumes that are only a quarter of typical levels. But what about traditional Christmas profit warnings, slipped out while the market is asleep? Like Santa, they are something of a myth. Since 2000, only 14 quoted US companies have released new guidance on the December 25 or 26. Of these only four were clearly downgrades, according to Bloomberg data. The last big western company to warn on profits directly around Christmas, excluding retailers releasing sales data, was Lockheed on December 23, 1998.Yet, between wickets, there is often light entertainment. Recent US Boxing Day announcers include America's largest hair-salon operator, issuing a weather related profit warning, and a Las Vegas slot machine operator, restating its books. December 25 in Japan has witnessed a $2.8bn golf driving-range bankruptcy and, last year, the indictment of Takefuji, its consumer finance giant. Indeed, tranquillity cannot be guaranteed. The interest rate rise that finally pricked Japan's bubble occurred on December 25, 1989. Argentina, Mexico and South Korea have all faced currency crises in the dying days of the year. Contested offers are occasionally launched then too, with the benefit that rival bidders and defence teams struggle to respond quickly. Vodafone-Mannesmann and Argyll-Distillers are cases in point. This year, so far, things look quiet. But, as cricket fans know, that is when it pays to keep an eye on the ball.
569;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2004-10-25T15:47:16Z;Lex: US defence;;"""There never was a good war or a bad peace,"" wrote Benjamin Franklin. Try telling that to US defence contractors. America's military spending is running 50 per cent higher than in 2001. Not surprisingly, investors have pumped up the sector, especially since the start of the war in Iraq. Yet those same investors greeted last week's mostly better-than-expected quarterly earnings from some defence companies with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. The biggest guns, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, report this week.One damper is that US defence spending may be topping out after three years of strong double-digit growth. The base budget for fiscal year 2005 (which began this month) is only about 5 per cent up on last year's, although that may not be the final word. Defence is a priority in Washington and so unlikely to be a target for big cuts, whichever candidate wins the election. But both Republicans and Democrats are likely to try to keep a lid on increases in military spending which, at $437bn, made up about half of the amount the government classifies as discretionary outlays in fiscal 2004. Uncertainty over the outcome of the election is another concern for investors - John Kerry has said he would spend more on troops and less on projects, such as missile defence, that directly benefit the big contractors.With military revenues set to grow more slowly, some defence companies can look to civilian aviation as an alternative engine of growth. Honeywell, for example, reported third-quarter commercial aerospace sales up 17 per cent year-on-year, compared with just 3 per cent for defence aerospace. United Technologies also pointed to strengthening commercial aviation markets. Those two companies are active in upgrades and repairs to existing aircraft; stronger demand for new jets from the likes of Boeing could follow. Any business, though, is only as good as its customers. With many of the biggest US airlines in dire straits and high oil prices, there could be turbulence ahead in this market too."
570;LMT;Lockheed Martin Corp;2004-09-27T20:24:56Z;Wall Street lower as oil rises again;;"It was Wall Street stocks that blinked in Monday's showdown between equities and oil as the Dow closed below 10,000 for the first time in more than five weeks while oil threatened to exceed $50 per barrel.Having recovered earlier to hover just above the psychologically important 10,000 level, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.6 per cent off at 9,987.95. In the broader market, the S&P 500 index eased 0.6 per cent to 1,103.39 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.1 per cent to 1,859.75Crude oil rose amid concerns about supply disruptions and a renewed fall in US inventories as traders awaited official data.Bob Doll, president and chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, said: ""We believe that a further decline in the price of oil would be needed …to see a sustained equity market rally.""In addition to oil-related jitters, traders said that Thursday's debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, his challenger in the race to the White House, was seen as crucial in deciding the outcome of the November polls. Some predict that a Bush re-election will help stocks rally in the fourth quarter.As the rally that started in early August appears to have fizzled out, some market participants will have to revisit hopes of a run-up in the last quarter of the year. While bulls say stocks have ignored upbeat earnings throughout the year and will have to respond at some stage, bears worry that by the time that happens earnings news will no longer be particularly good.Standard & Poor's confirmed concerns about profit growth in corporate America just as those worries had been revived by the renewed rise in crude futures. Companies in the S&P 500 index achieved operating earnings growth of 13.9 per cent in the third quarter compared with last year, according to S&P. However, the index provider said profit margins were flat or slightly improved even as sales increased.This underscored the lack of pricing power for US corporations unable to pass on cost increases to customers. Meanwhile, energy prices are reaching record highs and consumer companies such as Colgate-Palmolive have warned of increased competitive pressures.Airline stocks saw widespread selling on worries that high fuel costs will further damage an industry in which some leading players are under bankruptcy protection and fuel prices are jeopardising attempts to control costs.Delta Air Lines shares lost 9.5 per cent to $2.95 while Continental Airlines gave up 5.5 per cent to $8.29. JetBlue, one of the few stock market darlings in the sector, lost 6 per cent to $20.56. The Amex sector index was 3.9 per cent lower.Insurance shares saw losses as Florida assessed the effects of a record fourth hurricane this season, with some estimates saying Hurricane Jeanne inflicted between $4bn and $8bn in damages, while Charley, Frances and Ivan had combined for about $18bn in damages. St Paul Travelers saw shares lose 46 per cent to $32.75 days after after it said earnings would be affected by hurricanes. Allstate shares lost 1.6 per cent to $47.56.Among other stocks in the news, shares in Tommy Hilfiger tumbled 22.9 per cent to $10.16 after the fashion group said it was the subject of a federal inquiry into commissions paid to one of its non-US subsidiaries since 1990.In merger and acquisition news, Cemex shares lost 7.5 per cent to $27.94 after the third-biggest cement group in the world, based in Mexico, announced the purchase of RMC, a UK-based maker of ready-mix concrete. Urban Larson, head of Latin America investments at ING Barings, said: ""This is a very big acquisition in a segment and in markets that are much less attractive than Cemex's current business. This will increase indebtedness significantly."""
