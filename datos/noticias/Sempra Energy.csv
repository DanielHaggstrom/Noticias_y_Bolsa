0;SRE;Sempra Energy;2020-01-21T05:00:28Z;US gas exporters fight to survive supply glut;Prices fall around the world and planned capacity exceeds what will be needed;Multibillion dollar gas export projects that are central to the Trump administration’s push for “energy dominance” are locked in a battle for survival as prices fall and the market faces a supply glut.Liquefied natural gas is a critical outlet for the US’s surfeit of cheap natural gas and the country is on track to pull ahead of Australia and become the world’s biggest exporter by 2024, the International Energy Agency has said.Companies ranging from Royal Dutch Shell and Total to utilities and smaller independent groups are racing into the LNG export market, but planned capacity exceeds what is likely to be needed.The consultancy McKinsey predicts that only one in 10 proposed export terminals will ever be built.Last year, global importers received 346m tonnes of LNG — gas condensed to a liquid so it can be loaded on to tankers — according to S&P Global Platts. The volume will rise by 100m tonnes to 446m by 2025, it estimates. Yet in the US alone, 14 unbuilt export terminals with government approval would add 160m tonnes a year of capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Another 90m tonnes’ worth of projects are still awaiting approval.Last year, three US projects totalling 30m tonnes in annual capacity received final investment approval from their sponsors.Plunging natural gas prices are also complicating the outlook for companies developing LNG export terminals, as the US benchmark price fell to its lowest level in four years on Monday. Cheaper US gas helps in the intensifying battle for market share, but also makes developers’ projects look less financially viable. Companies are already cutting processing fees, burning cash and letting construction deadlines slip.The global LNG glut has also pushed down prices outside the US as customers use their negotiating power with exporters. The Japan-Korea Marker, a regional benchmark, has been trading at about $5 per million British thermal units, well below the level when most US export projects were conceived.“There’s no question that the marketplace has become increasingly competitive,” said Jeff Martin, chief executive of Sempra Energy, a US company developing LNG terminals.US projects face growing foreign competition from countries including Qatar, the largest and cheapest exporter, which recently confirmed plans to increase output from 77m tonnes to 126m by 2027. Mozambique is entering the market with a 13m tonnes per annum project and Nigeria said in late December that it would raise output from 22.5m tonnes to more than 30m by 2024.There’s no such thing as economies of small. There’s only economies of scaleChina is set to overtake Japan as the world’s largest importer in 2024, the International Energy Agency predicts. But when the US trade war with China worsened last year, Beijing cut off purchases and added a 25 per cent tariff on US gas.The trade deal announced last week included a commitment by China to increase purchases of US energy — including LNG — by $52.4bn over the next two years, but the tariff remains. If nothing else, the agreement will increase China’s negotiating power with other exporters, said Ira Joseph, head of gas and power analytics at S&P Global Platts. To attract financing, independent developers require contracts of 15 or 20 years. This includes a price for the gas and a fee for liquefaction — cooling the gas into a liquid. Liquefaction fees are also falling, another challenge to the economics of some projects.Six years ago, another independent group Cheniere Energy was charging a fee of $3.50 per million Btu when it was lining up customers for its export terminals in Louisiana and Texas. It has since stopped disclosing fee terms. Other companies say they will liquefy gas for prices in the low $2 range.One source of pricing pressure has come from Venture Global’s 10.8m-tonne project in Louisiana, which was among the three to receive the go-ahead last year. Still, a rival notes that Venture has only disclosed 1.5m tonnes of sales for a second, 20m-tonne export facility. Venture did not respond to requests for comment. Several other projects are still trying to add customers. Tellurian wants to build a 27.6m-tonne terminal in Louisiana, while LNG Limited has been promoting the 8m-tonne Magnolia LNG project in the same state.At the mouth of the Rio Grande river in Texas, three companies in November won federal permission to collectively export more than 37m tonnes a year. As developers chase customers and financing, one of the largest construction contractors in the industry is under severe stress: McDermott International is in talks with lenders to avoid default.LNG developers are working hard to attract and hold on to clients. At the Gastech trade fair in Houston, potential customers entering Tellurian’s two-storey booth were serenaded by a harpist and a string quartet beneath crystal chandeliers.Tellurian said its $30bn Louisiana project would produce some of the lowest-cost LNG in the world, at a cost per tonne of $796. “There’s no such thing as economies of small. There’s only economies of scale,” said Tellurian chairman Charif Souki in an interview.However, Tellurian’s target for a final investment decision has slipped from 2019 to 2020. As of last September, it had $91m in cash on its balance sheet and outflows from operations and investing totalling $200m in the previous 12 months. Meg Gentle, chief executive, said: “We are not going to run out of cash, this is not a concern.” Mr Joseph predicts that only three US projects totalling 12.7m tonnes in capacity will receive a final investment decision this year. Two would expand terminals at Freeport, Texas and at Cheniere’s Corpus Christi site in the same state. A third is Sempra’s Mexico project, known as Energía Costa Azul.Greg Vesey, chief executive of LNG Limited, said he travelled more than 200,000 miles last year drumming up business. So far the company has signed one nonbinding agreement to export 2m tonnes to Vietnam, a country he visited in November with US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross.“I wouldn’t kid you, it’s a very tough market,” Mr Vesey said.Additional reporting by Anjli Raval and David Sheppard in London
1;SRE;Sempra Energy;2019-10-01T07:50:18Z;China seals LNG supply via Peru electric group deal;China Yangtze’s $3.6bn purchase of Luz del Sur is biggest by a state-owned group since 2015;China Yangtze Power International has agreed to buy Peru’s largest electric company Luz del Sur from US-based Sempra Energy for $3.6bn, a transaction that also promises to help sate China’s hunger for liquefied natural gas as the trade war with the US disrupts supply.Announcing the deal, Sempra Energy said it had also agreed to potentially supply China Yangtze’s state-run parent with LNG to “support demand growth in China, including the growth of natural gas power generation”.The deal is the biggest acquisition by a Chinese state-owned enterprise in the Americas since 2015, according to data from Refinitiv.This initial agreement “represents an opportunity to support strong growth in natural gas demand in Asia, with future expansions of our LNG projects right here in North America,” said Jeffrey Martin, chairman and chief executive of Sempra.China is the world’s second-largest importer of LNG, which features heavily in its plans to move away from the polluting coal-fired plants that dominate the country’s power generation.But it has moved to diversify its sources of the fuel as trade tensions with the US have deepened. In September last year Beijing imposed a 10 per cent tariff on US LNG imports, and raised that to 25 per cent in June this year.“The hope was that growing LNG production in the US would over the coming years help to meet a lot of the Chinese demand but obviously the trade war has complicated that,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.Though US and Chinese officials are set to resume trade negotiations in Washington next week, China has not imported any LNG from the US since May, according to Chinese customs data. Instead, it has relied on shipments from other countries including Qatar and Australia, which late last year overtook its Middle East rival to become the world’s top exporter of LNG.Sempra said the cash deal, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 subject to regulatory approval, would include all equity interests in its Peruvian businesses. Chief among those is the nearly 84 per cent stake in Lima-based Luz del Sur.Its LNG subsidiary signed a memorandum of understanding with China Yangtze’s state-run parent China Three Gorges Corporation on potential LNG supply.Sempra’s exit comes as Peru is engulfed by political chaos. On Monday, President Martín Vizcarra ordered the dissolution of congress and called for parliamentary elections in a move that opponents said was a coup d’état. Analysts have downgraded their growth forecasts for the country amid the political infighting.Sempra, which is also seeking to sell its 100 per cent stake in Chilean electricity distributor Chilquinta Energía, came under attack in 2018 from activist investors including Elliott Management, who said the company needed to refocus on its core operations in the US.
2;SRE;Sempra Energy;2018-12-19T14:48:12Z;Poland adds to US natural gas imports with Sempra deal;Latest contract comes as country tries to reduce reliance on Russian supplies;"Poland has signed another contract to import liquefied natural gas from the US as it seeks to cut its dependence on supplies from Russia. The deal is a further step forward for the Trump administration, which wants to increase LNG exports for economic and political purposes. PGNiG, Poland’s national oil and gas company, has agreed a 20-year contract with Sempra Energy of the US to buy 2m tonnes a year of LNG from its proposed Port Arthur export terminal in Texas, starting in 2023. The deal follows similar contracts for US LNG signed with Venture Global in October and Cheniere Energy last month. In total, they amount to almost 40 per cent of Poland’s gas consumption last year. PGNiG also said on Wednesday it was moving ahead with an expansion of its LNG import terminal at Swinoujscie on the Baltic Sea.The Trump administration has been promoting sales of LNG — gas that is super-cooled so it can be carried in tankers — to Europe, seeing them as a way to create jobs in the US and reduce the trade deficit, while weakening Russian influence. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, visited Poland last month. John Sullivan, the US deputy secretary of state, and Mark Menezes, the undersecretary of energy, were among the US officials at a signing ceremony for the contract in Warsaw on Wednesday afternoon.However, some analysts have warned that the administration’s rhetoric about the use of gas as a geopolitical tool could put off some potential buyers. US gas output has soared over the past decade as a result of the shale revolution, and is expected to continue to grow as new sources are developed, including associated gas that is a byproduct of oil in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. The first US LNG cargo was shipped in 2016, and exports are rising rapidly.Jeffrey Martin, Sempra’s chief executive, said the PGNiG deal and other impending contracts gave him increased confidence in achieving the company’s objective of having the capacity to export 45m tonnes of LNG a year. That is equivalent to roughly 6bn cubic feet of gas per day, about the same as the consumption of the state of California.The Polish contract is for gas from Sempra’s proposed LNG plant in Port Arthur, Texas. Mr Martin said he aimed to be able to give a final investment decision to build that plant by the first quarter of 2020.Sempra also has a controlling stake in the Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana, which is aiming to ship its first cargo of gas early next year, and is developing the Energía Costa Azul project on the west coast of Mexico.After a lull in approvals for new US LNG export projects, activity is expected to pick up next year. Three projects on the US Gulf of Mexico coast are expected to be given final investment decisions in the first half of 2019, according to Wood Mackenzie: an expansion at Cheniere’s Sabine Pass plant; Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil’s Golden Pass LNG, and Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass.Rystad Energy, another research firm, said the rapid growth in demand for LNG worldwide meant there was a “heightened risk” of a deficit in supplies after 2022, creating opportunities for US and other exporters.Mr Perry said in a statement that Sempra’s deal with PGNiG “marks an important step toward Poland’s energy independence and security”.Poland imported about 63 per cent of its gas from Russia last year, but has announced it intends not to renew its main contract with Gazprom when it expires in 2022. Last month, it gave the go-ahead for a new pipeline to import gas from Norway via Denmark.US LNG has higher production and transport costs than pipeline gas from Russia, but buying it can still make economic sense for Poland because having a wider range of supply options increases its bargaining power in contract negotiations. Poland expects to pay less for US LNG than it has paid for Russian gas in the past.A report from Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy suggested this week that prices under Russia’s long-term gas supply contracts with Europe dropped about 25 per cent over the 2010-15 period, as competition from US LNG emerged.Tatiana Mitrova, director of the Skolkovo Energy Centre in Moscow and a co-author of the report, said the creation of a more liquid and competitive gas market in Europe had been good for consumers and helped gas compete as a fuel against renewable energy and coal.However, she added, concerns that either Russia or the US could use gas supplies as a weapon to secure strategic objectives could hurt demand. Rhetoric from the US about breaking Russian influence could lead European countries to think “we had better go for wind power, which is local and has no geo-political issues”, she said."
3;SRE;Sempra Energy;2018-11-07T18:24:51Z;Sempra Energy lines up sales deals for new Mexican LNG terminal;US group aiming to build new west-coast plant steals march on rivals;The plan for Mexico’s first terminal for exporting liquefied natural gas has taken a big step forward by signing agreements to use all of the plant’s production, stealing a march on some of its US rivals.Sempra Energy, the US group that aims to build the Energia Costa Azul LNG plant in Baja California, about 50 miles south of San Diego, has signed heads of agreements with Total of France and Mitsui and Tokyo Gas of Japan.The announcements come as several companies are working on plans to develop new LNG export plants along the Gulf of Mexico coast of the US, but most have not yet reached any agreements with buyers.The Mexican plant is a rival to the US projects both because it will compete in some of the same markets, and because it is intended to liquefy American gas, from the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.Jeff Martin, Sempra’s chief executive, said being on the west coast would give its plant a competitive advantage in the Asian markets that are expected to be the source of most of the growth in demand for LNG in the coming decades.Tankers could take 12-15 days to reach import terminals, compared to 32 days or more for ships coming from the US Gulf of Mexico coast, even if they use the Panama Canal, he said.The cheap gas released by the shale revolution meant that in world markets “the US has a competitive advantage in both the short term and the long term,” he added.Sempra’s agreements are not firm contracts, but the companies say they “contemplate” negotiating and finalising 20-year commitments to buy gas so that the project can be given a final go-ahead by the end of next year.Total earlier this week signed a memorandum of understanding with Sempra on working towards contracts to buy up to 9m tonnes of LNG per year from its projects in the US and Mexico. Total has a 16.6 per cent stake in Sempra’s Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana, which is scheduled to start production next year, and could also invest in the project in Mexico.Patrick Pouyanné, Total’s chief executive, said Energia Costa Azul benefited from having some of the necessary infrastructure in place because there is an existing LNG import terminal at the site, and from “a significant shipping cost advantage for customers in Asia”.Of the competing projects seeking to start construction in the US, Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass appears to have made the most progress, having signed contracts with buyers including Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The company said last month that it planned to give a final approval and start construction early next year.Tellurian and NextDecade, two other companies with plans for new US LNG export plants, say they expect to sign up customers by the first half of next year.LNG Limited said last month that discussions with potential customers were “proceeding well”, and it also aims to give approval for its project early next year.Another LNG export project is planned for Mexico’s west coast, in the Gulf of California, called Mexico Pacific Limited. The developers said in September they were “actively negotiating long-term contracts with top-tier LNG buyers across the Pacific basin”.Projections of future demand and supply growth for LNG worldwide suggest markets are likely to be tight in the mid-2020s, encouraging Total and other international companies to sign contracts for gas in the expectation that they will be able to sell it profitably.There is particular interest in gas from the Permian Basin, where it is a byproduct of oil extraction. Inadequate infrastructure for transporting the gas to customers means it is priced at a discount: gas at Waha in west Texas has been selling this week at about $1.90 per million British thermal units, compared to a benchmark price of $3.50 at Henry Hub in Louisiana.That discount is expected to grow as Permian oil production increases and companies are hit by restrictions on how much unwanted gas they can burn off in flares.Mr Martin said the first phase of Sempra’s Mexico project could use gas brought from the Permian using existing infrastructure, although a possible expansion would require a new pipeline from Texas.

Sempra’s market capitalisation was about $27bn at the closing price of its shares on Friday.The shares jumped 16 per cent higher on Monday, closing at $117.19.Elliott, Paul Singer’s $35bn activist investing firm, is working together with Bluescape Resources, a private investment firm run by John Wilder that focuses on investments in upstream oil and gas, power and utilities. Mr Wilder is a former chief executive and chairman of TXU Corp, a Texas utility company.The duo worked together before in campaigns against two other US utility groups, NRG Energy and FirstEnergy. The shake-up at NRG proved highly successful: the company’s shares were the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2017.The activists argued in a letter to Sempra’s board and a presentation that the company “has continually underperformed” and “its conglomerate strategy has failed”. The investors wrote: “A litany of operational and financial setbacks demonstrate drift into a low-performance organisation with a detached management structure and board as the company has become larger, more complex, and more disparate.”Sempra owns utilities in California, Chile and Peru, pipelines in the US and Mexico, and the Cameron LNG gas export project in Louisiana. In March it paid $9.45bn for a company with an 80 per cent stake in Oncor, the Texas electricity transmission and distribution company. That deal was said to have created a utility holding company with the largest customer base in the US.Elliott argues that Sempra “does not fit together”, and suggests that spin-offs, asset sales and improvements in operational performance would mean “enhanced value realisation” for shareholders.The investors want Sempra to simplify its business structure by selling assets including the Peruvian utility Luz Del Sur, its Chilean utility Chilquinta Energía, Sempra Renewables and IEnova, the Mexican natural gas distribution company, while dividing the remaining conglomerate into a US utility company and an LNG company.The investors, whose stake in Sempra is worth about $1.3bn, are recommending six new directors for the company’s board and the creation of a strategic review committee.The fund first contacted the company on Monday morning and hopes that there will be “constructive” talks, said a person familiar with the stake. Elliott is hoping to avoid a proxy fight to force a shareholder vote over adding board members, which could not take place until next year because the company’s annual meeting is in May and board nominations are due in February.“That would be very disappointing to go down that path,” another person familiar with the investment said.

With the transaction now terminated, we expect the company’s current leverage to remain within our original expectations.
6;SRE;Sempra Energy;2017-08-21T08:34:37Z;Sempra Energy gatecrashes Warren Buffett’s Oncor deal;Elliott-backed $18.8bn purchase of Texas utility beats Berkshire offer;Sempra Energy has gatecrashed Warren Buffett’s deal to buy Oncor, reaching an agreement worth $18.8bn, including taking on more than $9bn in debt, with the owner of the Texas utility.The board of Sempra, a California energy utilities group, and Oncor’s parent Energy Future Holdings signed off on the deal on Sunday night, according to two people involved in the transaction. Sempra confirmed the agreement early on Monday morning.The deal pits two giants of US finance against each other, with Mr Buffett squaring off against Elliott Management chief Paul Singer, who has become one of the most high-profile activist investors on Wall Street.Elliott Management is the largest creditor of bankrupt Energy Future Holdings and has backed Sempra’s bid instead of Mr Buffett’s, the hedge fund confirmed in a statement on Monday morning.Elliott had vowed to oppose the $18bn offer, including debt, made in July by Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, arguing it was too low and not in creditors’ interest, these people added.Last week, Elliott acquired a specific class of debt worth about $60m from Fidelity Investments that gave it the power to block Berkshire’s offer. The move by Mr Singer, who made his own rival proposal to buy EFH in July, would have forced Berkshire to raise its offer or walk away from the deal.A person close to Sempra said the California group viewed the public fight between Berkshire and Elliott as an opportunity to emerge as a “white knight” for EFH, which went bankrupt in 2014 but still controls 80 per cent of Oncor.“It is important for Oncor to remain financially strong,” said Debra Reed, Sempra’s chief executive, in a statement on Monday announcing the deal.“Our proposal will help bring a satisfactory resolution to Energy Future’s bankruptcy case, keep Oncor financially strong and protect Oncor customers, while addressing the needs of Texas regulators, creditors and the US bankruptcy court.”Sempra also argued on Monday that buying Oncor would boost its earnings from next year.“This transaction is expected to enhance our earnings beginning in 2018 and further expand our regulated earnings base, while serving as a platform for future growth in the Texas energy market and US Gulf Coast region,” Ms Reed added.Elliott, which believes Berkshire’s offer would be damaging for creditors of EFH, had proposed to buy Oncor for about $18.5bn, a plan in which the hedge fund would convert its debt into equity accompanied by an injection of fresh cash via a third-party partnership.“Elliott is supportive of the proposed Sempra transaction, which provides substantially greater recoveries to all creditors of Energy Future than the proposed Berkshire transaction,” the hedge fund said.Keep up to date on M&A with the day’s top stories and analysis of global deals and dealmakersMr Buffett and Greg Abel, Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday that they stood by their agreement to buy Oncor and did not plan to raise their offer.“We appreciate the continued opportunity to collaborate with many stakeholder groups in Texas and thank them for their outstanding support, which sets our offer apart from any other bid,” Mr Abel said. “We’re committed to being an exceptional long-term partner in Texas and our simple, straightforward deal is good for Oncor, its customers and the state.”Berkshire emerged as a credible buyer for Oncor after several suitors were blocked by Texas regulators. Mr Buffett made clear that Berkshire was happy to keep Oncor independent from the rest of his existing energy group, a move Texas regulators believe would protect the domestic utility group in case the parent ever went bankrupt.EFH, which was formerly known as TXU, was infamously acquired by KKR, TPG Capital and the buyout arm of Goldman Sachs in 2007 for $45bn in what turned out to be the largest leveraged buyout in history. However, the debts raised to buy the group weighed so heavily on the company that it was eventually unable to service them.

The deal marks a surprise turnround after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway looked to buy the group in an an $18bn pact. The FT reported early on Monday that Sempra was set to clinch the deal.Sempra said it would fund the deal using a mixture of debt, equity, and $3bn of investment grade debt at the reorganised holding company, and it expects Oncor’s “underlying financial strength and credit ratings” to improve after the deal.At the completion of the transaction, Bob Shapard, Oncor’s chief executive, will become
executive chairman of the Oncor board of directors and Allen Nye, currently
Oncor’s general counsel, will succeed Mr Shapard as Oncor’s CEO.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018, and should be accretive to earnings from next year.“Both Sempra Energy and Oncor share more than 100 years of experience operating utilities that deliver safe, reliable energy to millions of customers,” said Debra Reed, chairman and chief executive of Sempra Energy. “With its strong management team and long, distinguished history as Texas’ leading electric provider, Oncor is an excellent strategic fit for our portfolio of utility and energy infrastructure businesses.”"

However, they added that the agreement had not been sealed yet and it could still fall apart.The fresh bid from Sempra comes days after Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which is a key creditor in Oncor’s owner Energy Future Holdings, vowed to block the $9bn offer made in July by Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway because it deemed it to be too low.Bloomberg News first reported the news of Sempra nearing a deal with Oncor’s owner EFH.
9;SRE;Sempra Energy;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;SRE;Sempra Energy;2014-11-13T18:35:24Z;Oil’s dive set to transform LNG market;Top buyers in Asia still locked into contracts will see lower prices;The downward spiral in oil prices is poised to shake up liquefied natural gas, a critical source of energy in east Asia and an alternative to Russian gas supplies in Europe.LNG, as the fuel is known, is gas chilled into a liquid state so it can be poured into domed tankers for shipment abroad. Japan, South Korea and China are the top buyers.The 30 per cent plunge in crude since the middle of this year, to below $80 a barrel this week, is likely to have a big effect on LNG. Many Asian customers are locked into contracts linked to the Japan Custom-cleared Crude index, or JCC (nicknamed the Japanese Crude Cocktail). By early next year, crude’s slide should be reflected in LNG prices.The coming decline could have several effects. First, it would lower costs for consumers, even though some benefits in Japan are offset by the recent depreciation of the yen.Second, some analysts also say it could – surprisingly – temper buyers’ urgency to break down the old, rigid oil-based pricing system.Finally, the prospect of lower gas prices to Asia has ignited debate over the viability of new LNG projects planned in Australia and the US, which Wood Mackenzie forecasts will be the first and third-largest exporters by 2020. If crude holds steady or keeps falling, this debate will intensify.The Japan Korea Marker, an east Asian LNG benchmark, was $11.10 per million British thermal units this week, according to Platts. That was down about 8 per cent from mid-June. Brent crude dropped to $80 a barrel this week from $115 in mid-June.“Brent is going down the tubes. Because of the way the formula works, that’s going to start dragging down the Japanese quote significantly and has very profound effects on LNG markets in Asia,” says Jim Jensen, a US-based energy consultant.Naomi Hirose, president of Tokyo Electric Power, says that lower crude prices should feed through to lower LNG procurement costs for Tepco within five or six months.At a government-sponsored LNG conference last week in Tokyo, consumers from Japan and other Asian nations seemed in an uncharacteristically ebullient mood, arguing that new shale gas supplies in North America, in particular, were shifting the balance of power away from producers.“Traditional suppliers need to defend themselves or keep up with the changes,” says a senior official from Japan’s ministry of economy, industry and trade, alluding to the likes of Qatar, Russia and Malaysia.Dai Jiaquan, director of the oil market department at the CNPC Economic & Technology Research Institute in Beijing, told the conference it was “extremely urgent” for suppliers to “enhance the competitiveness” of imported LNG.Three plants in Gladstone to liquefy coal seam gas for exportThis week Beijing signed its second big agreement of 2014 to purchase gas by pipeline from Russia, in volumes that in time could compete with LNG.However, some analysts say the fall in prices might ease buyers’ misgivings about oil indexing even as they push to scrap restrictions such as the destination clause, which stipulates that a tanker leaving a terminal cannot sail toward any port other than that specified in the contract.“They’re going to come to agreements more readily, because they both realise oil’s not always going to be $100,” says Noel Tomnay of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy.Falling LNG prices from traditional suppliers also call into question the viability of some new export projects. In the US the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved four, with 15 pending.Tony Regan, of consultancy Tri-Zen International in Singapore, says that with Brent at $80 a barrel, oil-linked supplies are almost equal in price to LNG contracts priced at the main gas trading hub in the US.“In 2012 the differential between the two formulas was $7 per mBtu and we saw a surge of interest in trying to access ‘cheap’ LNG. With the differential now less than $2 per mBtu that interest in the USA is waning,” Mr Regan says.Would-be exporters are striking a confident tone. Sempra Energy, which plans to build a $10bn LNG project in Louisiana along with GDF Suez of France and Japan-based Mitsubishi and Mitsui, says customers seek the “stability and continuity” of US supplies.“And we really haven’t seen that interest abate even as we’ve seen oil prices fall in the last few days here,” says Sempra president Mark Snell.Sempra does not anticipate cutting a ribbon on its project until 2018.“It was a misperception to believe that oil-linked prices would always be high and spot gas prices always low,” says Jason Bordoff of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “And a short-term dip in oil prices does not tell us where oil prices will be when US LNG exports start up in large volumes several years from now.”

Under his stewardship, the stock market has developed a flourishing market in so-called Fibras, akin to real estate investment trusts, or REITS, and has just joined the MILA bourse tie-up with Chile, Peru and Colombia.Mr Téllez new position at the sovereign fund, which will manage oil revenues, raised questions of a possible conflict of interest since Mr Téllez sits on the board of Sempra Energy. However the real question is: to what extent did a lawsuit brought by billionaire businessman Ricardo Salinas against Mr Téllez motivate his decision?Grupo Salinas was seeking compensation for statements by the stock market chief that, it allegeds, caused moral damages following changes to bourse methodology that could exclude the group from the benchmark IPC index. In April this year, a Mexico City court upheld the case against Mr Téllez, which he had tried to appeal. At that time the stock market had insisted that the ruling did not mean he had to leave. Contacted by beyondbrics, Mr Téllez declined to comment immediately on why he was quitting.The stock market chief, who holds a PhD from MIT, was also embroiled in scandal in 2009 while serving as communications minister when recordings surfaced purporting to refer to a “secret account” and to former President Carlos Salinas. He resigned.
12;SRE;Sempra Energy;2014-03-10T17:06:44Z;US LNG exports: waiting is hardest;There is no guarantee about how prices will evolve;Are US liquefied natural gas export terminals the next expensive flop in energy? Members of Congress are clamouring for faster approval of permits for terminals so US natural gas can reach across the globe. Yet the first US facility, built by Cheniere Energy, will not come online until 2015, having cost $10bn. Just a handful have received approval so far but more than 20 are awaiting word. While they wait, terminal backers should be nervous about the trajectory of gas prices.With the latest approval in February of a terminal built by Sempra Energy, total export volume could be 8.5bn cubic feet a day. In a 2012 study by the US energy department, the highest volume of LNG exports envisioned was 12 bcf/day. The capacity of the facilities still in the approval queue: a whopping 30bcf/day (for reference the US is forecast to produce a total of about 80bcf/day by 2020).An accompanying study from consultant NERA, found that US gas prices would rise, as would be expected assuming new foreign demand. But that rise was only about $1 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), leaving prices still near historically low levels. Prices in Asia and elsewhere are linked to the oil price benchmark that makes cheap US natural gas attractive. For example, Asian LNG spot prices were above $19/mcf last month. The puzzle, though, is how global prices will evolve over the next two decades. Worldwide LNG projects along with general shale exploration may lower global gas prices, diminishing demand for US exports. With infrastructure costs, exports to Asia and Europe are economical when US gas prices are $5 to $6 /mcf, a level they jumped to during this cold winter.If the economic impact of greater gas exports is unclear for terminal companies, gas explorers however will still benefit from a (modest) bump in price. And chemical companies such as LyondellBasell, which have benefited from low gas prices for plastic making, should still find that prices for their gas-based “feedstock” remain profitable.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
13;SRE;Sempra Energy;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US energy revolution gathers pace;;The growing role of the US in world energy markets was underlined on Friday as the Obama administration approved wider exports of liquefied natural gas and international companies committed billions of dollars for new infrastructure.The developments were both consequences of the shale revolution in the US, in which improvements in the techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, have unlocked new supplies of oil and gas, and raised the prospect that the US will be an increasingly important supplier of energy to the rest of the world.The Department of Energy on Friday authorised the Freeport LNG project in Texas to export to countries that do not have a trade agreement with the US, including Japan and the members of the EU. It was the first such approval to be granted for two years and only the second ever.President Barack Obama had been expected to approve worldwide sales from the Freeport project, as the administration sees rising energy exports as providing economic benefits and strengthening the global influence of the US.However, a vocal lobby of companies in industries such as chemicals and steel has urged restrictions on gas exports to ensure US manufacturers continue to derive a competitive advantage from cheap energy.Freeport has signed deals to sell its gas to Osaka Gas and Chubu Electric of Japan, and BP of the UK. The export project is owned by a consortium including Osaka Gas and Michael Smith, Freeport’s founder and chief executive.Separately, Japanese and European companies said they would invest billions of dollars in another proposed gas export project, the $10bn Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana.Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Nippon Yusen of Japan, and GDF Suez of France, which had already agreed to buy LNG from Cameron, will provide construction financing in return for equity stakes totalling 49.8 per cent.Mark Snell, president of Sempra Energy, the project developer, said the deal “promotes a favourable balance of trade for the national economy, and supports national and international energy security by assuring reliable long-term gas supplies to US allies and trading partners”.He estimated the contribution of the Japanese and French groups at between $6bn and $7bn of the facility’s $9bn-$10bn construction cost.Shale gas production has soared in the US in recent years, creating a supply glut that has driven prices down to about $4 per million British thermal units from a peak above $13 in 2008.Cargoes of LNG, supercooled to minus 160 degrees so it can be transported on tankers, are selling in Asia for the equivalent of about $15 per mBTU, creating an attractive opportunity for exports from the US.Twenty-six proposed US LNG plants have applied to the Department of Energy for export permits, but before Friday, only one – Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass development in Louisiana – had been granted permission to sell to countries that do not have a trade agreement with the US.The US energy department said it would work through the remaining applications in order. The Cameron project is towards the top of the list and analysts believe it is likely to win approval for global exports this year. However, the department added that at the end of this year it would “assess the impact of any market developments” on future decisions, a concession to fears that the cumulative impact of allowing a series of LNG export developments might push US gas prices higher.Japanese utilities have been particularly interested in projects such as Sabine Pass because its gas is priced off Henry Hub, the US benchmark, which is much cheaper than the oil-indexed price in many of the world’s long-term LNG supply contracts.We are proud to be able to contribute not only to the development of stable energy trade between the US and countries around the world, including Japan, but also to the growth of the US economyJapan is already the world’s largest importer of LNG, and the crippling of its nuclear industry by the 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi atomic power station has only increased its demand. Tokyo Electric Power, owner of the Fukushima plant, signed a deal to buy Cameron gas in February.Mitsui and Mitsubishi are the largest of Japan’s huge trading and investment houses. Mitsui is to take a 16.6 per cent stake in Cameron, while Mitsubishi and Nippon Yusen, a shipping company, will together take 16.6 per cent through a joint venture. GDF Suez, the French utility, will also take 16.6 per cent.Jun Nishizawa, vice-president of the global gas business department for Mitsubishi, said: “By participating in this LNG export project, we are proud to be able to contribute not only to the development of stable energy trade between the US and countries around the world, including Japan, but also to the growth of the US economy.”Jean-Marie Dauger, head of GDF Suez’s global gas and LNG business, said the project would serve to “expand and diversify the group’s LNG portfolio and increase its flexibility for supplying existing or future markets in high-growth areas”.GDF Suez is Europe’s largest LNG importer and the world’s third-largest seller of LNG with a portfolio of 16m tonnes a year.
14;SRE;Sempra Energy;2012-04-17T16:18:51Z;Japanese groups sign US gas import deals;;Japan’s two largest trading companies by market capitalisation have signed agreements to import liquefied natural gas from a US supplier, in the first such deals between the two nations.The announcements, a day after the US energy regulator granted final approval to the first LNG export project in more than 40 years, are an indication of how urgently Japan is seeking alternative sources of energy after the Fukushima crisis caused all but one of the nation’s 54 nuclear reactors to be shut down. In the fiscal year ending in March, Japan’s power utilities burned 53m tonnes of LNG, up 27 per cent from the year before, according to data this week from the Federation of Electric Power Companies.Under the agreements, Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co will each take 4m tonnes a year of LNG from a new export facility to be built at a site in Louisiana owned by Cameron LNG, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy of San Diego. The Japanese partners will help to fund the initial design, permitting and engineering expenses, along with an undisclosed share of the estimated $6bn total cost of development.While Japan’s trading companies have been sourcing LNG from Alaska since the late 1960s, they have done so as agents for customers at home and elsewhere, subject to fixed pricing formulas linked to Japan’s average imported oil price.With Sempra, however, the duo will negotiate 20-year supply agreements in which they can – in theory – push for more flexible terms, say people familiar with the situation. That may mean paying prices closer to the daily settlements at Henry Hub, a Louisiana pipeline nexus. The current supply glut from US shale-gas formations has caused the benchmark Henry Hub price to sink to $1.88 per million British thermal units – one-ninth the average rate Japan paid for its US LNG in February.The Louisiana facility could begin exporting gas in late 2016, pending regulatory approvals, Sempra said. Mitsubishi and Mitsui are the biggest of Japan’s trading companies, with an estimated Y694bn ($8.6bn) of combined net income from their energy and minerals divisions in the year to March.Securing cheaper supplies of LNG is an urgent priority for Japan, say analysts, as the nation prepares for a future less reliant on nuclear power. Before the Fukushima accident last March, nuclear generation accounted for about 30 per cent of total electricity supply.“At the moment, Japan has no leverage whatsoever [in LNG],” said Sabine Schels, head of fundamental commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. “We’re seeing them very strongly in the market. They are taking any cargoes they can get, at whatever price they can get it.”
15;SRE;Sempra Energy;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Apple under pressure over board elections;;Apple will face fresh shareholder pressure at its annual meeting this month to change the way it elects directors.Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest US public pension fund, has called for the largest US company by market capitalisation to allow directors to be elected by majority voting.At present, Apple shareholders can only withhold their vote on an election of a director, rather than vote against. If a director is unopposed he only requires one vote in favour to retain the post, irrespective of how many votes are withheld.“Apple needs a governance upgrade,” said Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance for Calpers.The pension fund last year submitted a proposal that Apple adopt majority voting in its annual elections for board members. That was supported by 73 per cent of shareholders who voted last year.However, the proposal was non-binding and Apple declined to change its voting procedures, nullifying what had had been seen as a victory for shareholder rights. Calpers targeted the company as the most high profile part of a campaign by the three largest US pension funds for shareholder democracy.Apple was among 38 big US companies Calpers lobbied on the issue last year, 36 of whom then adopted majority voting. Nearly 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies have now adopted the practice, as have over half of the Russell 1000 according to Calpers. “It’s a hallmark of accountability”, said Ms Simpson.Apple has again opposed the motion. “The unusual mechanics of California law create the risk that directors who enjoy overwhelming shareholder support may fail to be elected because an insufficient number of shareholders voted in the election,” the company said in its proxy materials sent to investors.In a letter to shareholders seeking support for the proposal, Calpers argued that other California-based companies, including Cisco Systems, Edison International, and Sempra Energy, had adopted some form of majority voting. “State law is no barrier to good practice as Apple has claimed,” the letter said. Institutional Shareholder Services has also recommended that investors support the proposal.Calpers, which has around $230bn assets under management, owns 0.26 per cent of Apple. It has approached another 56 companies on majority voting this year, 29 of which have said they will make changes.At the February 23 meeting, Apple faces additional shareholder proposals asking for greater disclosure of political donations, and an advisory vote on directors pay. The National Center for Public Policy Research has also proposed that Apple publish a “conflict of interest report” detailing possible conflicts of interest between the company and its board members.The group is concerned that “Apple’s policy on greenhouse gas regulations was developed to personally benefit a board member”: Al Gore, the former US vice-president, a global warming activist whom the NCPPR says has “personal financial interests in companies that would profit from government regulation of greenhouse gases.” A spokesman for Mr Gore did not respond to a request for comment.Apple said that it already had adequate disclosure and corporate governance practices in place, and has recommended that investors vote against all the shareholder proposals.

The UK bank was ordered to divest its stake by the European Commission in return for state bail-out funding.JPMorgan in July bought RBS Sempra’s global oil, metals, coal and European power and gas business for $1.6bn, aggressively raising its commodities profile against entrenched Wall Street rivals.But the bank initially balked at the North American assets because they overlapped with an existing power and gas group added in JPMorgan’s 2008 takeover of investment bank Bear Stearns. Uncertainty over US financial reforms, since passed, also weighed against a wider deal.JPMorgan is now buying a trading book with a gross value of $6bn as of June 30, according to RBS. The portfolio includes physical and financial gas and power transactions and access to pipelines and gas storage facilities. The roughly 750 counterparties to the trades include gas producers, power plants, utilities and governments. In the second quarter, RBS Sempra ranked the fifth-largest North American gas marketer by volume, after BP, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Macquarie, according to Platts. JPMorgan was 12th.The sale announced on Thursday “will complete the divestiture of the last of the principal assets” of RBS Sempra, RBS’s joint venture partner, Sempra Energy, said. But JPMorgan is not hiring the 300 people who remain at RBS Sempra, down from 1,100 when the entire unit first went up for sale. RBS said it still is considering “various alternatives for the modest level of residual assets and liabilities of the business.”Last month, Hong Kong-based commodity trader Noble Group agreed to buy RBS Sempra’s retail energy unit for $317m, plus assumption of $265m in debt.US energy regulators must approve the deal, which sellers expect to happen by year end.
17;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-09-26T20:31:36Z;JPMorgan in talks for RBS power trading book;;JPMorgan Chase is in talks to acquire another part of RBS Sempra Commodities, the trading group partly owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, after the US bank bought the bulk of the business earlier this year.The deal could lead JPMorgan to buy the group’s North American gas and power trading book, said people familiar with the matter, with another buyer taking the people and systems associated with the business.An acquisition could increase JPMorgan’s energy exposure at a time when choppy markets have pressured the bank’s commodities unit, headed by Blythe Masters. Among those said to be considering acquiring the remaining RBS Sempra infrastructure is Société Générale, the French bank that has been expanding its presence in North American commodities.JPMorgan and SocGen declined to comment.A spokesman for RBS said: “A number of parties have expressed interest in acquiring the remaining assets of our RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture.”However, people familiar with the deal said JPMorgan was the frontrunner to buy the gas and power trading book, having paid $1.6bn for RBS Sempra’s global oil, metals, coal and European power and gas business earlier this year.The bank at the time opted not to purchase the North American assets because of overlap with existing business and concerns about pending financial regulations.Morgan Stanley, which was previously bidding on the North American business, had left the process, those people added, after being unable to reach agreement on its value.Selling the remaining pieces of RBS Sempra has been slowed by uncertainty about financial reform and flat power markets, executives at Sempra Energy, RBS’s joint venture partner, have said.Sempra Energy said last Monday that it was in “advanced negotiations” to sell the North American power and natural gas business, and estimated its share of proceeds from the sale of all of the joint venture’s businesses and related cash distributions to total $1.8bn-$1.9bn. The company declined to identify potential buyers.Last week, Hong Kong-based commodity trader Noble Group agreed to buy RBS Sempra’s energy marketing unit for $317m, plus assumption of $265m in debt.
18;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-07-05T17:36:12Z;JPMorgan brushes aside bill concerns;Law would “not substantially” affect business;JPMorgan, which last week acquired a large energy and metals trader, has brushed aside industry concerns that legislation forcing banks to spin off swap trading desks would make its commodities business less competitive.The US financial reform bill, passed by the House and pending in the Senate, would require banks to hive off most commodity swap trading to affiliates.Commodities are among a handful of derivatives still targeted after an aggressive proposal by Blanche Lincoln, chairman of the Senate agriculture committee, was watered down.Blythe Masters, head of commodities at JPMorgan, said the bank already traded most energy through an affiliate and the law would “not substantially” affect business.“It’s not a big change for commodities. It’s fine-tuning more than a material impact,” she told the Financial Times. Ms Masters is one of the pioneers of credit derivatives.JPMorgan on Thursday closed its $1.6bn purchase of RBS Sempra Commodities’ oil, coal, metals and European power and gas businesses, adding 500 employees and a network of more than 130 oil storage tanks, metals warehouses and other infrastructure.Bankers fought Ms Lincoln’s swap spin-off proposal, which in an earlier version would have forced banks to surrender all derivatives trading to separate affiliates.After horse-trading with the House it was scaled back, allowing banks to keep interest rate, foreign exchange, bullion and lower-risk credit default swaps on their books.As well as high-risk credit default and equity swaps, only over-the-counter commodities are to be forced into separately capitalised entities. Credit, equity and commodity derivatives were less than 10 per cent of the notional amount of derivatives held by US banks in the first quarter, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Other US banks with large commodity operations, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, also trade commodities through separately capitalised affiliates.The bill “doesn’t seem to be terribly onerous”, said Richard Bove, banking analyst at Rochdale Securities.Some observers have said the once-feared swap provision has become toothless. A spokesman for Ms Lincoln said the senator “believes this provision accomplishes her goal because it ensures that the riskiest activity is moved out of the bank, protecting depositors and taxpayers”.Industry lobbyists warn that the spin-off provision will hurt members.“This will be more capital intensive than keeping the business in the bank. Some clients may only deal with banks, while others will only deal with non-banks if they have substantial capital resources,” said Conrad Voldstad, head of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.JPMorgan acquired the RBS Sempra units from a joint venture of Royal Bank of Scotland and Sempra Energy, after the rescued UK bank was ordered to divest its stake by the European Commission.RBS Sempra has suffered high-level departures since its formation in 2008. A number of fuel oil traders were the latest to leave.
19;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-06-08T22:00:19Z;RBS draws up shortlist for £4bn asset sale;;Royal Bank of Scotland has stepped up its asset sell-off programme, and drawn up shortlists for two key businesses that are expected to fetch about £4bn ($6bn) for the government-backed bank.Morgan Stanley and Jefferies are among the final bidders for RBS Sempra Commodities’ North America business, which focuses on natural gas and power trading and could potentially reach a total value of $2bn (£1.4bn), people familiar with the process said.RBS has also narrowed the field of bidders for its £2.5bn payment processing arm to two US private equity consortiums that are vying to seal the UK’s biggest buy-out deal for almost three years.The sales of both businesses were triggered by a European Commission ruling ordering RBS to sell assets in return for receiving a government bail-out.The commodities business – a joint venture between RBS and US utility group Sempra Energy – could still be sold in pieces and the negotiations with some bidders could still fail, people familiar with the process said.The bidding process, expected to produce a deal by next month, comes after JPMorgan agreed in February to buy RBS Sempra’s international oil, metals and European businesses for $1.7bn.The continued interest of Morgan Stanley suggests the bank is not deterred from expanding in commodities trading by proposals to ban banks from trading on their own account.In the auction of RBS’s payment processing arm, the two consortiums chosen to go through to the final round were an alliance of Advent International and Bain Capital, and a likely combination of TPG and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, people close to the process said.They added that TPG and CDR initially bid separately, but RBS was encouraging them to team up as a way of strengthening their bid and to mitigate the execution risk of the deal.RBS was concerned about whether a pure private equity buyer would have the scale or expertise to manage RBS Global Payment Solutions. But bids involving trade buyers – such as Moneris, the Canadian payment processing group, and a consortium of American Express with UK buy-out house Permira – came in too low, according to people familiar with the process.The two shortlisted bidders offered in the region of £2.5bn for the assets. A consortium of banks is in talks to provide about £1bn of senior debt for the deal and Goldman Sachs is lining up a £500m mezzanine loan.RBS is expected to keep a stake of about 20 per cent in the payment processing business.It hopes to reach agreement on a sale within the next month and to complete the deal in the third quarter. All parties declined to comment.
20;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-02-16T19:00:13Z;JPMorgan to buy units from RBS Sempra;;JPMorgan on Tuesday agreed to buy a large chunk of RBS Sempra Commodities for $1.7bn in cash in a deal that will challenge the dominance of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital in raw materials dealing.The bank said it would purchase RBS Sempra’s global oil unit, its profitable metal trading business and operations in coal, freight and power and gas in Europe and Asia. RBS Sempra Commodities will retain its US natural gas and power operations.The sale of the business– a joint venture between RBS, the rescued UK bank, and US utility group Sempra Energy – was triggered by a European Commission state-aid ruling late last year ordering RBS to divest its stake.JPMorgan initially considered buying the whole joint venture for up to $4bn, but decided not to because of the large overlap between its existing business and RBS Sempra’s US power and gas unit, bankers said. Although the decision not to bid for the US unit came shortly after the US government’s proposal to clamp down on banks’ proprietary trading, bankers said the developments were unrelated.Blythe Masters, head of global commodities at JPMorgan in New York, said the transaction would make the bank “a true global leader” in commodities, with the number of corporate customers almost doubling overnight.“In terms of capability, we are now as good as anyone,” she told the Financial Times. “That was not true before the deal [with RBS Sempra], but it is now.”In contrast to Barclays, which built its commodities unit slowly over a decade, JPMorgan has built its business via a flurry of acquisitions over the past two years. The purchase in 2008 of Bear Stearns gave the bank a stronghold in the US natural gas and power business, and the subsequent acquisition of energy and agriculture activities from UBS and other small deals in emission further expanded its operations.Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in New York, said that JPMorgan was “clearly breaking into the level now where they’re a competitor against Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Goldman, the historic leaders in this business”.Lazard advised RBS on the sale and Sempra Energy has retained JPMorgan to review alternatives for the North American power and gas unit.Donald E. Felsinger, chief executive at Sempra Energy, said the transaction “represents a positive first step of an orderly exit by RBS from the joint venture”.Deutsche Bank and Australia-based Macquarie were also on the bid for the assets initially, but dropped from the race because of the high price and their concerns about the speed at which RBS wanted to seal a transaction, which limited due diligence.The purchase will give JPMorgan much needed size and assets for oil and base metals trading. The bank will inherit 30m barrels of crude oil storage capacity worldwide plus access to tankers on lease. On base metals, the bank will now own the profitable Henry Bath & Son warehouses network, considered one of the best in the industry, and become a floor member at the London Metal Exchange, the world’s largest market for base metals such as aluminium and copper.The transaction will also push JPMorgan into freight and coal trading in the booming Asia-Pacific, a business area where the bank has had little presence.JPMorgan’s commodities business grew significantly in late 2008 as it benefited from customers seeking to diversify their banking relations, according to consultants Greenwich Associates. Last year, the business grew as the bank expanded. Consultants said that banks such as JPMorgan have continued to invest heavily in commodities in spite of the financial crisis because of the profitability of the business and the belief that the sector represents a rare opportunity for growth while other banking sectors shrink.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York

Power and gas – the largest commodities market – accounts for about 45 per cent of the global commodities revenue pool.Banks can use physical trading capabilities to hedge risks in the futures markets with underlying commodities and use first-hand information on commodity flows.JPMorgan is in exclusive talks to buy RBS Sempra Commodities, a joint venture between Royal Bank of Scotland, the rescued UK bank, and Sempra Energy, the US group, after a European Commission state aid ruling ordered RBS to divest its stake.Bank of America Merrill Lynch plans to expand its commodities team by 25 per cent during the next two to three years in expectation of strong demand for commodities; while Deutsche Bank recently opened an office in Houston and started trading US power and gas.Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, formerly Calyon, is planning to enter the European physical gas and power markets by the end of March with the aim of having 90 front-office staff by the end of the year.Barclays Capital has also been expanding aggressively in recent months, following its acquisition of Lehman’s US business and UBS’s operations in base metals, oil and US power and gas. The investment bank plans to increase the number of employees in commodities by more than 30 per cent by the end of the fiscal year.Nomura’s acquisition underlines the bank’s commitment to internationalising its business and growing outside of Asia following its takeover of the European and Asian equities and M&A business of Lehman Brothers, which collapsed in September 2008.The Japanese bank enjoyed a strong third quarter, reflecting the recovery in capital markets and the benefits of its acquisition of Lehman operations, which helped push international revenues to 50 per cent of overall revenues, compared with 20 per cent previously."
22;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-01-31T23:51:08Z;RBS Sempra arm sale hits snag;;JPMorgan’s proposed £2.5bn takeover of RBS Sempra’s global commodities trading business has hit a snag.The US investment bank now has concerns about buying the group’s American division after revelations about a likely crackdown on bank trading across the Atlantic, industry insiders said.The announcement by Barack Obama, US president, that banks in America might one day be banned from engaging in proprietary trading– trading for their own profit – has thrown a spanner into the works of the planned sale.It is understood that the US division of RBS Sempra’s commodities operations could be put up for sale separately in an attempt to avoid any complications that might arise if restrictions on bank trading were put in place by the Obama administration.JPMorgan is said to remain committed to buying RBS Sempra’s European operations and its global oil trading group, which together account for about 50 per cent of the business.The sale of the combined group, a joint venture between RBS, a bailed out bank, and US group Sempra Energy, was triggered by a European Commission state-aid ruling that ordered RBS to divest its 51 per cent stake.A person familiar with the negotiations on Sunday described the talks continuing between JPMorgan and RBS as “constructive”.It is understood, however, that Deutsche Bank still maintains some interest in purchasing RBS’s stake in the group.JPMorgan declined to comment.For RBS, a swift sale of the business is part of the drive by Stephen Hester, chief executive, to push ahead with the bulk of the European Union-ordered divestments as quickly as possible to draw a line under the bank’s troubles.It was revealed on Sunday that the bank has decided not to go ahead with a sale of its £350m global headquarters in Edinburgh.A deal would make JPMorgan a fourth big force in the commodities trading business alongside Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital, after an aggressive two-year acquisition drive by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive.JPMorgan’s commodities business, led by Blythe Masters, almost doubled in size in 2008 after the acquisition of Bear Stearns, which owned a strong natural gas and power business, and the later purchases of energy and agriculture activities from UBS.JPMorgan has also lured key traders and commodities bankers from rivals, particularly from Goldman Sachs, the market leader.Consultants said that investment banks, including JPMorgan, have continued to invest heavily in commodities this year.Additional reporting by Patrick Jenkins
23;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-01-21T17:46:38Z;RBS Sempra / JPMorgan;;Being a forced seller is hardly an ideal negotiating position. But fortune may be about to smile on the UK’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which has to sell its 51 per cent stake in RBS Sempra Commodities to comply with European Commission rules on state aid. The joint venture with Sempra Energy has haemorrhaged key staff since RBS was taken into state hands. Further uncertainty prompted by the Commission’s ruling risked further damage to the trading franchise, so RBS chief executive Stephen Hester has moved fast. Booming commodity prices provided a further spur. JPMorgan has now emerged as the preferred suitor after Deutsche Bank and Macquarie baulked at the mooted $4bn price tag. Although Sempra Energy has not publicly stated that it will sell its stake, the California-based energy company is likely to seize the opportunity.Comparable deals are few and it is rare for such assets to become available. But at about five times estimated historic profits, the business looks reasonably priced against, say, Glencore, whose recent convertible bond issue valued the unlisted Swiss commodity trader at seven times earnings. Even so, that may be a high price for JPMorgan to pay for a business so dependent on poachable talent. But RBS Sempra’s physical commodities activity, with its associated logistics support, is a strong drawcard, as is the good overlap in US power and gas with JPM’s commodities business, which has grown rapidly by acquisition and costly hires.Is RBS therefore giving it away? The bank contributed about $1.7bn for its stake in April 2008. Based on a $4bn valuation, and assuming that RBS’s share of the JV’s profits were $540m a year, it will have generated a 45 per cent return in two years. Not shabby at all, Mr Hester.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
24;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-01-20T19:50:00Z;JPMorgan nears $4bn RBS Sempra deal;;JPMorgan has seen off Deutsche Bank and Macquarie in the battle to acquire RBS Sempra Commodities, entering exclusive talks to buy the trading business for more than $4bn.A deal could be announced in a matter of days, people close to the negotiations said on Wednesday.The sale of the business – a joint venture between RBS, the rescued UK bank, and US group Sempra Energy – was triggered by a European Commission state-aid ruling late last year ordering RBS to divest its stake.A deal would make JPMorgan a fourth big force in the commodities trading business alongside Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital, following a two-year acquisition drive by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive.JPMorgan’s commodities business, led by Blythe Masters, almost doubled in size in 2008 after the acquisition of Bear Stearns, which owned a strong natural gas and power business, and the subsequent purchase of energy and agriculture activities from UBS.Ms Masters told the Financial Times in late 2008 that the string of purchases were boosting the bank’s commodities business and gaining it market share. “The acquisition of Bear Stearns has made a huge difference in our business,” she said.JPMorgan has lured key traders and commodities bankers from rivals, particularly from market leader Goldman Sachs.While the acquisition would enlarge JPMorgan in metals and agricultural commodities, bankers said it would face a large overlap on its North American power and natural gas operations, which constitute the bulk of RBS Sempra’s business.Traders said Deutsche’s exclusion from talks was a blow, given its stated desire to expand its commodities business organically and by acquisition.With booming profitability in commodities trading, the price tag for RBS Sempra rose beyond what most rivals expected. The bank aims to announce a deal by early February, limiting the window for due diligence to about a week, bankers said.
25;SRE;Sempra Energy;2010-01-08T07:38:34Z;Aberdeen agrees £85m RBS fund management deal;;Aberdeen Asset Management announced on Friday that it is paying about £85m ($135m) for nearly half the asset management business of Royal Bank of Scotland, as the troubled lender continues to shrink.Aberdeen, which is funding the acquisition through a share placing, is buying a £13.5bn portfolio of funds of funds and hedge funds.The move is the latest in a series of deals by Martin Gilbert, Aberdeen’s chief executive, who has been aggressively buying up rival asset management businesses during the financial crisis.People close to him say he has for some time wanted to build a fund of funds business.In November, the Scottish group, capitalised at about £1.4bn, agreed to pay about £5m for the contract to manage Bramdean Alternatives, the listed funds of funds investment vehicle with about £130m in assets set up by Nicola Horlick.Aberdeen said at the time it would use Bramdean as a stepping stone to building up alternative private equity and hedge fund assets.The RBS deal follows almost exactly a year after Aberdeen agreed its £300m purchase from Credit Suisse of £35bn of long-only equity funds for 240m shares, giving Credit Suisse a 24 per cent stake .That acquisition took Aberdeen’s assets under management to about £130bn.Aberdeen also secured an agreement to distribute funds via Credit Suisse’s private bank and the RBS deal is likely to be designed on the same basis.However, it is understood that Mr Gilbert is now keen to expand into US equity management and might want to bulk up money market funds bought from Credit Suisse to achieve economies of scale.In a statement released to announce the deal on Friday Mr Gilbert said: “The businesses acquired from Credit Suisse mid year are now fully integrated into the group and are delivering on their considerable potential.”Aberdeen had £144.1bn of assets under management at the end of last year it revealed in a trading statement on Friday which is 1.4 per cent lower than at the end of September. Gross new business for the final quarter totalled £9.6bn but redemptions for the same period were £12.2bn.Aberdeen will finance the deal through a placing of 84m shares representing 8.3 per cent of the existing share capital in the fund management group.The RBS arm has about $44bn of assets under management, including money market funds and a portion of third-party assets run on behalf of Coutts, RBS’s private banking unit. It has annual revenues of £22m and made an operating profit of £10m last year.RBS is expected to sell the remainder of its funds business separately, possibly to private equity.In a separate transaction, RBS is also in talks with three ­final-round bidders over the sale of its Sempra Commodities ­business.It emerged on Thursday that the bidders – Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Macquarie – had all offered about $4bn for the business, which is jointly owned with Sempra, a US energy group.Both deals are part of efforts by RBS, owned 70 per cent by the UK government, to sell off non-core assets.
26;SRE;Sempra Energy;2009-12-09T23:29:37Z;Suitors line up for RBS’s Sempra stake;;More than a dozen investment banks and other companies have signalled an interest in buying Royal Bank of Scotland’s stake in Sempra Commodities, the US energy trading business, which could lead to a sale being agreed within a couple of months.RBS is being forced to sell its share in Sempra as part of the concessions demanded by the European Commission for the state aid it has received during the financial crisis.RBS acquired a 51 per cent stake in the venture in 2007 for $1.35bn (£665m). Traders said the bank was likely to recover its investment but cautioned that some recent sales of commodities businesses have obtained low valuations.Under Sempra’s agreement with RBS, the bank is obliged to maintain its ownership of the joint venture until April 2012. However, RBS is keen to offload the business earlier, according to someone close to the bank. RBS has appointed Lazard to seek out potential bidders and manage the sale of its share of the venture. The bank is thought to have been approached by 12 to 20 possible buyers.Sempra Energy, which owns the remaining share of the joint venture, is understood to be considering its options, which include buying RBS’s stake, finding an alternative partner or divesting some of its holdings. It is thought unlikely that it would sell its entire investment.Consultants said banks have continued to invest heavily into commodities in spite of the financial crisis due to the profitability of the business and the belief that dealing in raw materials represents a rare opportunity for growth while other banking sectors are shrinking.The sale of RBS’s investment in Sempra would be the first of a string of punitive divestments the bank is being forced to make to meet competition rules over state aid. RBS, which is 70 per cent-owned by the government, is also having to sell more than 300 RBS and Natwest branches, a proportion of its small business customers across the UK and its insurance brands, Direct Line, Churchill and Greenflag.The bank has been given a timeframe of four years in which to complete the sales.By moving out of commodities, RBS would follow UBS and the collapsed Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Citigroup has also sold its profitable Phibro unit to US-based oil company Occidental Petroleum, although it does have another commodities business. Commodities dealing is dominated by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital.
27;SRE;Sempra Energy;2009-08-19T17:16:35Z;Naturally gassed;;Some twisted souls in Houston, Alberta and the trading pits of the New York Mercantile Exchange are secretly praying for a devastating hurricane, or at least a scorching heat wave. Who are these misanthropes? Producers and traders of natural gas, which has hit a seven-year low just above $3 per million British thermal units in the US, the world’s largest market.With North America choking on the stuff, prices may approach $2 and underground storage could bulge to a once unthinkable 4,000bn cubic feet before the heating season begins in October.Operators of liquefied natural gas terminals such as Sempra Energy expect a global glut to result in further shipments into the saturated US market.Even a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico or a late-summer surge in air conditioning demand cannot avert an awful year for producers. But overextended commodity markets tend to self-correct, giving them some reasons for optimism.One is that drilling activity has ground to a multi-year low barely a year after reaching an all-time high. Another is that some producers such as Devon Energy may take the unusual step of voluntarily reducing output, deeming the present value of gas in the ground superior to current prices.Quicker production decline rates at new fields will also aid in curbing supply. The demand side may get an unexpected boost, as some less-modern coal-fired generation plants shut in favour of natural gas. Coal has traditionally been cheaper, but its environmental compliance costs are high and may rise further with cap and trade legislation.Prices will eventually rebound, but structural changes in the market will cap gains. Technological advances that have opened up vast new drilling acreage virtually guarantee that the price record above $15 will stand for a long, long time.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
28;SRE;Sempra Energy;2008-12-07T22:51:05Z;US companies launch ethical standards push;;"Some of the largest companies in the US, including General Electric, Wal-Mart and PepsiCo, were expected on Monday to launch a drive to improve ethical standards in business in an attempt to stem the decline in corporate America’s public standing.The move by 17 companies, with nearly $1,000bn in sales, to commit to key principles of good business conduct comes as the financial crisis and recession are fuelling a political and public backlash against the corporate world.The huge problems faced by companies, such as banks and carmakers, that are run by highly paid executives have exacerbated anger among ordinary Americans who have seen their living standards deteriorate due to the economic slowdown.“In these challenging economic times, it is important that the public have confidence in all of business and not just select companies. We take this very seriously,” said Larry Thompson, PepsiCo’s general counsel and a former deputy US attorney-general.Under the agreement, from the Ethisphere Institute, companies will sign up to four principles of ethical behaviour: legal compliance, including not paying bribes; transparency; avoiding conflict of interests and increasing accountability.The organisers admit that the initiative, called the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance, is partly driven by companies’ desire to burnish ethical credentials and curry favour with Barack Obama’s Democratic administration.But although the principles are vague and most companies should be able to comply with them, the 17 signatories, which also include United Airlines, Dell and Accenture, have agreed to periodic examinations by independent auditors.The founding members have also pledged to try to get other companies to join.Gary Hill, chief ethics officer at Wal-Mart, said the retail group would encourage its huge supplier base to sign up to the principles.Mr Hill said that unethical behaviour was on the rise in corporate America, reversing a trend sparked by the regulatory clean-up that followed the Enron collapse.Some of the companies involved in the pact have faced their own ethical challenges. In 2006, Sempra Energy agreed to pay more than $377m to settle accusations that it manipulated natural gas prices during the 2001 California energy crisis. Sempra could not be reached. In 2005, Wal-Mart paid $11m to the Department of Justice to settle an investigation into the use of illegal immigrants by cleaning contractors at its US stores.Three employees of CACI International, the defence services company, were cited in a 2004 report by the Pentagon into the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.CACI could not be reached but said at the time: “Nothing in the…report can be construed as CACI employees directing, participating in or even observing” the abuses."
29;SRE;Sempra Energy;2008-08-07T20:13:29Z;Stimulating Sempra;;It might sound oxymoronic but there is such a thing as an interesting utility. Sempra Energy is just that, largely because it does two things at the heart of the business model well: judging energy trends and handling risk. Sempra has staked its future on gas – building or buying positions in new pipelines, storage and import terminals. Renewables generate headlines but gas will play the major role in addressing America’s near-term electricity needs. Energy officials expect 40 per cent of the country’s incremental generation capacity by 2015 will be gas-fired. As gas markets tighten and demand patterns change – particularly across geographies – ownership of the connecting nuts and bolts is lucrative.Sempra’s recent purchase of Energy South, a gas storage and distribution business in Alabama, fits perfectly with these trends. It is situated next to new gas supplies coming from Texas and overseas, and is in the middle of the fast-growing south-eastern power market.Tapping into gas demand growth is why Sempra’s earnings are expected to rise 10 per cent per annum over the next few years, almost double the sector average. It raised guidance for 2008 on Thursday. If that makes Sempra seem a high-risk bet, consider the fact that it recently folded its commodities trading business into a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland. This allows Sempra to keep a close eye on energy flows in the market, which is handy for judging where the next pipeline is needed. While giving away some of the potential profits, Sempra gains a less volatile earnings stream and frees capital – a smart trade given the extreme swings in the energy and metals markets and credit constraints characterising today’s environment. Above-average earnings growth, proven risk management and a strong balance sheet: all that should keep investors interested.Post and read comments on this Lex
30;SRE;Sempra Energy;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Petronas needs to invest a further A$3bn to fund its share of the project, lifting its total commitment to nearly $5.5bn, although part of that could be debt funded.The deal also underlines the growth in demand for gas which is increasingly recognised as a cleaner burning fuel.“It is becoming a fuel of choice and the fuel of the future,” a person close to the deal said. “This deal underscores the viability of coal-seam gas.”David Knox, acting chief executive of Santos, said. “No one has done coal seam gas to LNG anywhere else in the world.”Petronas has been scouting the world for quality gas assets and is particularly interested in coal bed methane.The Malaysian state-owned energy group is understood to have outbid rivals in the final states of an auction.Groups that had expressed an interest in the Gladstone project included Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips of the US, Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, and Sempra, owner of the largest US natural gas utility.Petronas will make an initial cash investment of $2bn, plus a further payment of $500m after a decision is made on a second LNG train.BG formed a joint venture with Queensland Gas Company in February to develop an A$8bn liquefied natural gas project in Gladstone, one of four projects based on coal-seam gas.The Petronas transaction requires approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.Santos was advised by Citi, with JPMorgan acting for Petronas.
32;SRE;Sempra Energy;2008-03-27T20:30:43Z;US shares fall amid earnings concerns;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second day in a choppy trading on Thursday as concerns about earnings in the technology and financial sectors overcame initial enthusiasm at better-than-expected data on employment and growth.On Wednesday night Oracle posted disappointing results which knocked sentiment in the whole sector, analysts said.Third quarter sales at the software company were $5.35bn, undershooting analysts’ forecast for $5.42bn, while net income climbed 30 percent to $1.34bn.Oracle, which is often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector and of the broader business environment, said an increased threat of a recession had made customers more prudent in their technology spending.“[The results] put salt in the wound and reminded people that tech earnings are not going to be as ebullient as was hoped,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The market had a big rally last week and when you are consolidating you are vulnerable to almost anything - good news, no news or bad news.”Oracle shares dropped 7.2 per cent to $19.43. Fellow software companies Microsoft and Akamai Technologies also slipped - 1.8 per cent to $28.05 and 6.4 per cent to $30.06, respectively.Meanwhile, Google stocks dropped, 3.1 per cent to $444.08, after the internet search company said it had seen slower growth in clicks on text ads, adding to worries about an economic slowdown.The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.9 per cent at 2,280.83 points while the benchmark S&P500 index - which rose as much as 0.3 per cent before falling back - dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,325.78 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 per cent to 12,302.70 points.Banks remained in focus after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said that Merrill Lynch and UBS may post losses this quarter on write-downs of $6bn and $11.1bn, respectively, due to escalating credit problems.Merrill shares fell 5.7 per cent to $41.90 and an index of investment banking stocks slid 5.1 per cent.On Wednesday Ms Whitney slashed her earnings estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 by an average of 84 per cent for a number of related banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and Wachovia.Citigroup lost 1.2 per cent to $21.79, Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $38.64 and Wachovia lost 3.4 per cent to $27.07.Lehman stocks were worst hit by the sector sell off, slumping 8.9 per cent to $38.71.Ms Whitney noted that further downward revisions were likely and that banks’ capital ratios could come under serious strain going forward as ratings downgrades to securities forced banks to hold more capital in reserve.In February over $370bn of securities were downgraded – more than three times the amount downgraded in October which was previously the single most disruptive month for the debt market in terms of selling pressure from ratings.“As many expected the fourth quarter to be the ”kitchen sink” for the industry, we believe first quarter results, to be reported in two weeks time, will be a rude awakening,” she said.Markets initially rallied after new data showed that initial jobless claims fell unexpectedly and revised growth figures suggested that the US consumer was not quite ready to give up spending.But by mid-afternoon that enthusiasm had for the most part petered out.Results from Lennar however, provided some unexpected momentum for housebuilders. The company reported $88.2m losses in the first quarter due to write downs in asset value.Sales plummeted 62 per cent to $1.06bn compared to last year and average selling prices, deliveries of new homes and new home orders also dropped, while the cancellation rate hit 26 per cent.Still, moderately optimistic outlook statements from Lennar executives helped the stock gained 1.8 per cent to $17.90.Housebuilders proved particularly resilient given data released on Tuesday painting a bleak picture of a sector stung by declining house prices.Pulte Homes added 1.6 per cent to $14.42 and DR Horton rose 2.2 per cent to $15.53.Utility stocks were the only other bright spot as upgraded earnings forecasts helped drive shares Sempra Energy higher, and peers benefited from investors looking for a safe haven.Sempra shares added 3.9 per cent to $53, while Teco Energy rose 2.8 per cent to $15.74.
33;SRE;Sempra Energy;2007-09-17T19:02:48Z;US utilities;;Defensive, dependable, durable – utilities are supposed to be dull. Yet they have not fulfilled their traditional safe haven role in the past two months, instead tracking the US equity market’s ups and downs since its peak on July 19. That is all the more odd considering the yield on 10-year US Treasuries fell by as much as 70 basis points during that time. Many investors view utilities as bond proxies. When Treasury yields fall, utilities’ dividend yields usually also decline. Instead, they have risen.This is in part down to timing. When the subprime problem first surfaced in February, utilities stocks rose in contrast to the broader market’s sudden drop. Helped along by the TXU bid, the sector peaked at 17 times forward earnings in May – a multiple last seen in late 2000. Meanwhile, the sector’s dividend yield reached a level more than 230 basis points below that of 10-year Treasuries, about twice the average gap since 1990.During the wider correction that eventually transpired, the takeover premium was cut. Utilities also gave investors a way of raising cash as liquidity dried up elsewhere. Looking ahead, lower risk appetite ought to support utilities’ valuations. Still, it pays to be selective. Many investors target the traditional utilities offering payout ratios of 60 per cent or more. The US, however, needs significant investment in its electricity infrastructure. As Citigroup points out, it is worth looking at those utilities that, while paying out less of their earnings, are investing more in their regulated asset base, pointing to solid earnings growth.Of particular appeal are those utilities for which regulators have already approved big spending plans. Sempra Energy, trading at a slight discount to the sector, is a good example. Moreover, it is based in California, which has gone furthest in decoupling utilities’ rates of return from energy consumption while also incentivising measures to reduce demand. In effect, this provides a legislative hedge against easing demand growth. That sort of defensiveness is very interesting. Exciting, even.

But it does want to ensure that other investors know more about what is going on.The “one share, one vote” principle won the support of a resounding 86 per cent of delegates at last week’s ICGN conference. That should be heard in Brussels, where Charlie McCreevy, the internal market commissioner, went a bit wobbly last month, after receiving a report that suggested “control-enhancing” voting structures did not destroy shareholder value. But while rococo voting structures are not unknown in the UK, many have been reformed away. They are now rightly thought of as a “continental” problem – as suspect as man-bags and siestas.That makes the ICGN’s resolution on transparency in stock lending and borrowing more pressing for the City. The initiative chimes with hints from the Takeover Panel that it may look again at the disclosure regime, and it leads on from efforts to reveal more about stakes built via derivatives. Care is needed. The ICGN recognises the usefulness of stock lending in lubricating modern markets and regulators should beware the unintended consequences of tinkering with disclosure. But an examination of what can be done cannot come too soon. Dual-share structures take time to establish through company statutes and are getting rarer, but stock lending is developing at the lightning pace of the marketplace – and with it, the potential for abuse.Browne’s sensible sacrificeLord Browne left BP ignominiously in May, forgoing severance payments, a bonus and participation in a performance share plan, having lied in court as he tried to stop allegations by his ex-lover being printed. Even before that, the BP chief executive had had to bring forward his planned retirement, following safety lapses at the oil company, and had already seen his remuneration package cut.Now Lord Browne will have to endure a long wait before receiving £1.5m in ex gratia payments from his old employer, while a shareholder lawsuit accusing executives of mismanagement plays out in Alaska. The oil company’s decision to withhold payments to Lord Browne, and to John Manzoni, outgoing head of refining, was agreed with the executives themselves.It looks sensible, even if the Alaska lawsuit is the sort of overblown and bluntly worded class action that inevitably follows in the wake of corporate disasters and gives the US system a bad name. In brighter times, BP’s high-ups could probably have toughed it out and let their legal team deal with it. But BP – not to mention Lord Browne and Mr Manzoni – must be keenly aware of the reputational risk of taking an unnecessarily firm line right now, particularly in the US, where other legal actions are under way. Irrespective of the merits of this case, the company and its former executives have done the right thing.RBS bets on itselfNo bank likes to see money slip away to competitors. Royal Bank of Scotland’s purchase of a majority stake in Sempra Commodities should help plug one potential outflow by giving the Scottish bank’s existing customers the ability to hedge their exposure to investments in mining, carbon trading and renewables within the RBS network, rather than letting specialists at Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs win the business.The venture is structured aggressively to give RBS 70 per cent of pre-tax profit above current levels. That is in part a typically bold wager by RBS on commodities as an asset class, but it also demonstrates the bank’s confidence in its own skill at milking existing clients. On past form, there are few who would bet against its expertise in that domain.
35;SRE;Sempra Energy;2007-07-09T20:18:22Z;RBS marks entry into commodities;;Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday moved to catch up with rival investment banks in the commodity-trading business by acquiring a majority stake in Sempra Commodities, a subsidiary of the US energy group Sempra.The deal, under which RBS will pay $1.35bn for a 51 per cent stake, highlights the increasingly important role played in the financial markets by commodities such as natural gas, oil and metals.RBS, which has seen strong growth in its investment banking operations, has long aimed to add commodities trading to the range of products it offers large corporations, investors and financial institutions.Johnny Cameron, chief executive of RBS’s Global Banking & Markets division, said the deal was the best way for the bank to establish a foothold in the booming commodities business without the risks of an acquisition. “Prices might move in a cycle. But we think that the importance of commodities as an asset class is here to stay,” he said.Sempra Commodities, which trades natural gas, crude oil, power and base metals in Europe and North America, generated $504m in profit after tax last year, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous 12 months.But Donald Felsinger, chairman and chief executive of Sempra Energy, said it was proving increasingly difficult for it to provide the capital required to support its commodities trading side. “Our success was our problem,” he said. “This company was growing so rapidly it was difficult for us to allow Sempra Commodities to reach its full potential.”Under the terms, Sempra will keep about 70 per cent of the venture’s current pre-tax profits, but RBS will take 70 per cent of any increase in profits above that level.The deal will release more than $1bn in capital for Sempra Energy, allowing it to buy back shares worth $1.5bn-$2bn.In addition to being a significant player in the US energy market, Sempra is one of the only eleven houses that trade base metals, such as copper, on the London Metal Exchange.Barclays Capital, Societe Generale and Calyon, the investment arm of Credit Agricole, are the only other investment banks which trade face-to-face in open outcry sessions, also known as rings, at the LME.Sempra was advised by Lazard.
36;SRE;Sempra Energy;2005-01-31T16:31:30Z;Market Insight: Liquefied Natural Gas;;Liquefied natural gas is a commodity on the move, attracting the largest ever energy project-finance deal and exciting producers that used only to care for oil.Last week Egypt joined the growing club of LNG exporters when its first cargo arrived in Spain. And Kogas of South Korea, the biggest LNG buyer in the world, said surging demand from its power generating customers had boosted profit by almost 10 per cent.The US and Britain will become increasingly dependent on the shipped super-cooled gas as reserves closer to home decline. So will more tankers plying the seas cause regional gas prices to converge and lead to a global, liquid, oil-aping spot market?“Probably never,” says Andy Flower, a consultant who worked on LNG at BP. “Not for 10 to 15 years,” believes Gavin Law, head of global LNG at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy. Stalling LNG's progress have been politics, security of supply fears and huge capital costs.“In the short to medium term we don't see a truly spot LNG market,” says Mr Law. “It continues to be underpinned by long-term contracts. Securing supply at the right price is quite difficult. And the prospect of somebody, even the Qataris, saying ‘I'm going to build an LNG terminal and don't need buyers' is remote.”This is borne out by Sempra Energy, the US utility, which has a federal permit - and has appointed contractors - for a terminal in Louisiana. Spadework is delayed though. “We don't start construction until the contracts are in hand,” Sempra says. “We want to be sure that the agreements are in place before we invest the capital.”Sempra has at least jumped through the permit hoop - others have not been so lucky. Frustrated oil and gas majors say US and European citizens are no longer “nimby” (not in my backyard) but “banana” (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anybody). Terminals have been delayed by environmental and terrorism fears. In the south of France, residents of Fos-sur-Mer have protested that a new Gaz de France terminal will hurt the local mussel population.Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil have got the regulatory go-ahead for a terminal in Wales. The pair have raised $7.6bn, the most ever for an energy project, to ship LNG from Qatar to Britain using the biggest LNG production trains and, at up to 216,000 cubic metres, the biggest LNG tankers.Although such tankers bring efficiency gains, their size could prevent them turning around in the middle of the ocean and sailing to the highest priced market - they are too big for many ports and so the ability to trade on a spot basis is constrained.Contracts themselves are becoming less restrictive on where LNG ends up as buyers and regulators press for flexibility and an end to destination clauses.One supplier, though, said demand was so high that the secondary market was not likely to grow soon: “A Japanese customer is buying its LNG for a power plant or its customers. They are not in the business of pushing it around the world.”But Mr Law said such suppliers are worried that their customers could start selling on surplus volumes. “Tokyo Gas and its counterparts with their own shipping capacity will be able to say, ‘I'll ship additional cargoes to the US West Coast.'”Spot trading will grow from the current 5 to 10 per cent of the total LNG market as more capacity comes on stream, analysts and gas companies agree. But few think it will attract very liquid trading in the near future.Free market advocates should not despair though, says Roland Kupers, vice-president of LNG at Shell, the biggest western LNG seller. “Often there is an implied contradiction between long-term contracts and the benefits you would get from spot markets - it is a bit more complicated than that.”The liberalised market in the US and arbitrage between regions should narrow the difference in prices. “Prices available in the US cast a shadow around the world. You don't actually need the physical spot market on a very large scale, the current limited one drives and influences the next batch of long-term contracts.”
