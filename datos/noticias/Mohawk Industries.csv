According to recent research from Bear Stearns, investors find these protections so valuable that they are willing to accept 15-25 basis points less in coupons for bonds with additional covenants.“The market is apparently placing a higher price on event risk protection in Black & Decker, CRH America, Federated, Mohawk Industries, Temple Inland, Tyson Foods and Universal Health,” says Victor Consoli, credit strategist at Bear Stearns.Increasing numbers of issuers are responding, with the inclusion of change of control puts – which force the company to buy back debt at full value if there is a takeover – and coupon step-ups – which force a company to pay more interest on the debt if there is a deterioration in creditworthiness.Home Depot, the A-rated home improvement retailer, which last month was the subject of takeover rumours, is the latest company to include a change-of-control clause in the bond indentures for its $5bn bond financing, priced last week.The change of control option would force the company to pay bondholders 101 per cent of the bond’s face value if a buy-out results in the company’s downgrade to junk status.“For an $86bn market-cap company [this] is a true sign of the times,” says Mr Consoli.In the past, investment-grade bonds in the US have rarely had any covenants to protect the bondholder against, for example, a management team seeking to boost its share price with big stock repurchases.As investors in the covenant-light bonds of HCA, the hospital operator recently discovered, a management team that embarks on the LBO trail can be disastrous. HCA’s buy-out caused the company’s benchmark 10-year bonds to lose 20 per cent of their value.Just as LBO activity has shown equity investors the value of leverage, analysts say, bondholders are using covenants to steel themselves for more equity friendly activity from corporate management. Home Depot’s recent bond deal, for example, was used to fund stock buy-backs – just the latest in a string of such deals this year.As one head of debt syndicate says: “Either you’re going to buy back your stock, or someone else is.”

According to Jeffrey Lorberbaum, chief executive of Mohawk, the market for laminate flooring in the US grew 24 per cent to $1.2bn last year, and is expected to grow a further 15 per cent per year going forward.The acquisition of Unilin, which has more than 2,400 employees and annual sales of €837m, was touted by Mr Lorberbaum as the “second major step“ in the company's diversification.The first step was made in 2002, when Mohawk bought Dal-Tile, the Texas-based ceramic tiles company, making it the largest producer of ceramics in the US.Mohawk emerged as the leading contender to buy Unilin at the end of an auction that began in March when the Belgian company appointment bankers to examine its options. A number of private equity groups are believed to have shown interest in Unilin since then.Under the terms of the deal, Frans de Cock, chairman of Unilin's management board, will take a seat on Mohawk's board. Unilin's management is expected to remain in place.On Friday, shares in Mohawk, which is based in Georgia and has a market capitalisation of $5.5bn, fell 0.4 per cent to $82.20. In February, Mohawk shares hit a peak of about $94 before slumping through the rest of the year. The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, should enhance Mohawk's earnings next year, the company said.Lehman Brothers advised Mohawk. Goldman Sachs advised Unilin.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
