0;SEE;Sealed Air Corp;2017-03-27T12:12:08Z;Bubble-wrap maker Sealed Air to sell hygiene unit to Bain Capital for $3.2bn;;Sealed Air, the company perhaps best known for making bubble wrap, has entered in to a definitive agreement to sell its Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business to US private equity group Bain Capital for about $3.2bn.The North Carolina-based company bought sanitisation group Diversey Holdings in 2011 in a cash-and-stock deal that valued it at about $4.3bn. At the time experts had questioned why Sealed Air would pay a premium for the business.Last year, Sealed Air’s chief executive Jerome Peribere had said the company was interested in spinning off New Diversey and that the company’s shareholders would have 100 per cent ownership of the common stock after the spin-off was completed.Monday’s deal includes the Diversey Care division, which accounts for about 29 per cent of Sealed Air’s overall revenues, and the food hygiene operations within its Food Care division, the company’s largest unit, which have together been dubbed New Diversey. The new hygiene and cleaning solution company combined generated net sales of $2.6bn last year.Sealed Air expects to use the proceeds of the transaction to repay debt, repurchase shares and fund core growth initiatives — including potential complementary acquisitions to its Food Care and Product Care divisions. The company’s board has authorised an increase of the share buyback program by an additional $1.5bn — bringing the total under the current program to about $2.2bn — in an effort to minimise earnings dilution.The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second half of the year.Citi is acting as financial adviser to Sealed Air, while Barclays and RBC Capital Markets are advising Bain. Sealed Air shares were up 1.2 per cent in pre-market trading.
1;SEE;Sealed Air Corp;2015-08-26T13:09:06Z;Sustainable innovation: shaped for the circular economy;Small companies wanting to create ecological innovations must plan how they fit in with the mainstream;"Knee-deep in half-empty paint pots, the residues of a lifetime’s home improvement projects now destined for the refuse tip, Keith Harrison felt a stab of regret — and the stirrings of an opportunity.“I kept thinking I could do something with it, the paint had an intrinsic value. It would have been a huge waste just to throw it away,” says the former industrial chemist.He launched Newlife Paints on the south coast of England in 2009. Remanufacturing eco-paints from leftover paint, the novice entrepreneur is joining the “circular economy”.Advocates insist that circular econ­omics is more than upmarket recycling. It involves designing goods at the outset that will be easy to repair, reuse or re­make from their parts. The aim is to de­v­ise production processes that avoid waste; keep high- and low-value materials separate; and, like Mr Harrison, en­able spent goods to be remanufactured to their original condition, rather than salvaged for their components or recycled into lower quality products.Philips, Renault and other big industrial companies are among the pioneers of the circular economy. But when it comes to devising bold alternatives to the “take-make-dispose” model of growth, start-ups are joining in and sometimes showing the way. As Joss Blériot, who leads on policy at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which promotes the circular economy, puts it: “Start-ups are free to innovate in ways that big companies sometimes aren’t.” Yet, lacking the benefit of well-resourced facilities, established routes to market and well-known brands, they also face many challenges.Scaling up
Mr Harrison set up on his own bec­ause he was nearing retirement and impatient to put his ideas into practice. He developed his technology, which in­volves removing leftover paint from tins that have been diverted from landfill, and blending and filtering them to produce colour-matched new paints.He started in his garage, later renting a small manufacturing plant. But with limited resources he struggled to scale up production of the paints, which he sells online and through retailers. So, in 2013, Mr Harrison began licensing his technology as his main route to market. Waste company Veolia began making Newlife Paints under licence this year. “By licensing we can have more impact and spread internationally, ” he says.Procurement impasse
Enthusiasts for integrating circular economy principles into manufacturing argue that longevity, avoided disposal costs and potential resale value outweigh the small cost increases that at­tach to goods specifically designed or reformulated for reuse. But paying more today for a saving tomorrow is not necessarily what procurement managers with short-term budgets are looking for.We’ll transition from a green manufacturing business into a technology businessThis at least was what C-Tech Innovation, a UK company, and the Nonwovens Innovation and Research Institute, which develops new textiles, concluded when they wanted to commercialise a technology to prolong the life of uniforms. Every year thousands of tonnes of workwear ends up in landfill and incinerators before it has worn out. With the new technology, Wear2, clothes are sewn with a yarn that fragments when exposed to microwaves, so they can be pulled apart and remade into new garments. Company logos on the clothes can be easily removed if made with the yarn, leaving them ready for reuse or resale.To avoid being blocked on price early in discussions, Rob Bell, a director at C-Tech, advises circular economy innovators to make contact with the management board of potential clients. As decision makers, they should have a better overview of the company’s overall strategy. “[Operational] people often say: ‘I like the idea, but if it costs more than my usual supplier, I won’t buy it,” he says. To do otherwise might cost them their bonus. The support of a managing director, he adds, helped Wear2’s developers sign a licence with Northern-Ireland’s Hunter Apparel Solutions.Reaching consumers
When it comes to wooing consumers to circular brands directly, getting the semiotics right can be decisive. Mr Harrison first named Newlife Paints “Sussex recycled paints”, before swapping to “eco-paints” when he realised consumers took “recycled” to mean “cheap”.He has also launched an upmarket brand, called Reborn Paints. The development was part funded by Akzo Nobel, maker of Dulux Paints, which has been working with him as part of an initiative led by Innovate UK, a government agency. Blended with extra minerals — such as Cornish clay, for a nicer finish — the range is aimed at affluent householders with a green conscience.It pays to plan ahead
For the economics of circular systems to be viable, the procedures for recovering materials must be well planned. Wear2 developers focused on work wear be­cause it is usually handed back to the issuer once finished with. This creates an obvious and easy recovery path.Sometimes generators of waste realise there is value in the rubbish they are giving away and start to levy a charge instead of paying for its removal — as with brewers’ grains, which found a secondary market as animal feed.Bio-bean is a London start-up that turns old coffee grounds into a source of energy. It collects them via waste management contractors from freeze-dried coffee factories, high-street chains and kiosks in transport hubs to turn into biomass pellets, which are sold to heat offices and homes. Those companies do not wish to extract the value themselves, but this could change. To protect itself against this potential development, Bio-bean is investing in technology and exploring what more value it can extract from coffee grounds, starting with oils for biodiesel. It is also analysing other sources of urban waste.Once it can prove its technology works on several kinds of refuse, it plans to license it to waste producers wanting to become waste processors. Then, says Arthur Kay, co-founder: “We’ll transition from a green manufacturing business into a technology business.”Also experimenting is New York-based Ecovative Design, which makes an alternative to plastic packaging that is grown from crop waste and mycelium, the root-structure of mushrooms. Its best-known product, Mushroom Packaging, which it licensed to the packaging company Sealed Air, protects merchandise such as electronic goods in transit.Now Ecovative is commercialising a mycelium-based board designed to re­place engineered wood, and its chemical adhesives, in furniture. Other projects include mycelium-based insulation and grow-it-yourself kits to enable consumers to invent their own uses for mushroom materials. “When you design a sustainable alternative, you essentially take on a constraint for which you cannot charge. The cost to the planet of existing materials, such as plastics, simply isn’t counted, which makes sustainability quite a difficult path to take,” says Eben Bayer, a co-founder.Undeterred by the challenges he has encountered, Mr Harrison is suggesting to manufacturers how they could plan more imaginatively for the afterlife of their products. One suggestion is adding more symbols to packs to assist sorting waste paints into types. “At the moment we’re fighting fires, because the paints we pull out of the waste stream today were manufactured five or so years ago, when the circular economy was barely on the horizon,” he says."

Today, we also provide other protective packaging solutions, including inflatable cushioning, lightweight mailers and expanding foam. We ensure products such as televisions reach their destination in the condition in which they started their journey.As European packaging development manager, I develop new and existing “cushioning performance packaging solutions”, working with manufacturers to test their products in our packaging design centre. At the moment, I am working with a new material called Restore Mushroom Packaging, which uses the root of a mushroom mixed in with agricultural by-products to create a moulded cushion that grows by itself and is home compostible.I started as a trainee design engineer here 24 years ago when I was 18 years old. Packaging has had to meet new challenges. When I first started, LCD screens were something on calculators, not televisions.Bubble Wrap started life as a form of wallpaper – Sealed Air could very well have become a painting and decorating company.While I love to think outside of the box, my world lives inside of it.
3;SEE;Sealed Air Corp;2011-07-20T20:32:56Z;Ecolab / Nalco;The deal is less than pristine, in the market’s view;"While the world is unpredictable, it is likely to remain dirty. This explains the recent flurry of transactions involving companies that cut grime. Carl Icahn has made and raised an offer for bleach-maker Clorox; Switzerland’s Lonza picked up anti-microbials exposure by buying Arch; Sealed Air acquired cleaning products maker Diversey. Now Diversey’s competitor, Ecolab, is going from washing dishes and sheets to purifying water, buying industrial water treatment firm Nalco for $8.1 bn, including debt.The deal is less than pristine, in the market’s view: the acquirer’s shares were down 9 per cent the morning of the announcement. This despite Ecolab management’s argument that the stock and cash deal will be accretive to earnings per share, brings Ecolab into a market with strong secular growth potential and generates plenty of synergies over time, given the firms’ shared foundation in chemistry.The basic problem with these arguments, and likely reason for the tumble in Ecolab’s shares on Tuesday, however, is that Ecolab’s appeal to investors is less its growth than its stability and strong returns on invested capital. Adding Nalco’s $4.3bn in revenues to Ecolab’s $6.1bn threatens to dilute both these virtues. During the crisis year of 2009, Ecolab’s sales fell by under 4 per cent, for example; Nalco suffered an 11 per cent drop. Returns on invested capital at Ecolab were 15 per cent in 2010, according to Credit Suisse. At Nalco it was 9 per cent.The different financial profiles reflect how different the businesses really are. Chemistry may unite them, but Ecolab’s core customers are restaurants, hotels, food processors and hospitals; Nalco serves factories, paper mills and oil and gas firms. In a world where predictability is at a premium, a skittish reaction to change of that magnitude was inevitable.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
4;SEE;Sealed Air Corp;2011-06-01T19:26:19Z;Sealed Air wraps up Diversey deal;The acquisition provides Sealed Air with relatively cheap entry into a new area;Journalists seeking cheap puns about a bubble in mergers and acquisitions and spurious claims of diversification were handed a gift with Sealed Air’s agreement to purchase cleaning products company Diversey on Wednesday. Just as obvious, the maker of Bubble Wrap mentioned that the transaction would be accretive in the first year and it trotted out venn diagrams to highlight overlapping customers such as Walmart, Coca-Cola and Tyson Foods. But, in this era of ultra-low interest rates, nearly any deal with a substantial cash component should boost earnings per share initially and it is hardly surprising that two large companies would have customers in common in food manufacturing and retail.The acquisition does provide Sealed Air with relatively cheap entry into a new and not wholly-unrelated area. Though synergies are modest at just $50m per annum or just over 1 per cent of the $4.3bn purchase price, the adjusted trailing multiple of enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation is 8.7 times, about three-quarters of competitors Ecolab and Procter & Gamble. Diversey, which mainly sells hygiene products to large buyers, is less profitable than both, but margins have been on a clear upward trend under the guidance of penny-pinching private equity shareholders.Will Diversey do even better under new ownership or has it already been put in as flattering a condition as possible? That is unclear and Sealed Air’s own spotty record of shareholder wealth generation – essentially zero since the beginning of 2000 – does not inspire. Management would hardly admit that it wants Diversey for growth’s sake or because bankers were dangling cheap financing, but it is hard to avoid that impression. Much like Sealed Air’s most famous product though, the deal only provides a firm underpinning as long as bubbles stay inflated.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Advances were led by consumer staples and telecom companies, while energy and industrial shares led the declines.“The equity market may be transitioning from last year’s ‘high-octane’ rally to a ‘regular’ or ‘unleaded’ rally driven by a mixture of later- and counter-cyclical sectors,” said Barry Knapp, portfolio strategist at Barclays Capital.After falling by as much as 1.3 per cent, by close the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,136.94. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 0.3 per cent to 2,354.23, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was marginally higher at 10,623.18.The Vix index of volatility declined slightly but remained elevated at 31, still above its 2010 average.Deal activity provided some support. Pactiv, a food service and packaging company, jumped 19 per cent to $28.44 after it was reported that Apollo, a private equity group, was interested in taking it private.Competitor Sealed Air, a manufacturer of speciality packaging, also jumped 5.6 per cent to $22.32 as investors anticipated further activity in the space.Pharmaceutical groups OSI and Astellas moved closer to finalising a deal, with Japan’s Astellas agreeing to acquire the US oncology specialist for $4bn. But OSI shares declined 4.1 per cent to $57.35 after arbitrageurs cut holdings to bring its price in line with the reported deal terms.The sense of a peak was sparked by an Empire State manufacturing survey that was lower than expected. The Federal Reserve’s general economic index of the New York region dropped to 19.1 from a cyclical high of 31.9 in April, as both new orders and shipments of goods declined.“The first look at manufacturing for the month of May does hint that we may be seeing the first signs of slowing in the rapid manufacturing expansion,” said Zach Pandl, desk economist at Nomura Securities in New York.Purveyors of consumer staples were the top performers, rising 0.6 per cent as a group. Kraft gained 1.8 per cent, Procter & Gamble gained 1.4 per cent, and Walmart added 1.2 per cent.Also seeing gains amid investors’ cyclical shift were sellers of prepaid mobile phones. MetroPCS jumped 3.8 per cent to $9.05. Sprint Nextel’s CFO said its revenue declines were easing as the market for prepaid phones was “improving dramatically”. Shares added 3 per cent, to $4.49.Cyclical industrials led the decliners in the Dow. Alcoa, the global metals group, dropped 2.1 per cent to $12.10. Caterpillar, supplier of construction and farming equipment, fell 1.7 per cent to $63.78.There was some optimism, however. ProLogis, a real estate investor in factories, jumped 4.3 per cent, to $12, after it was upgraded from “sell” to “buy” by Citigroup. “[I]ndustry fundamentals are poised to surge given increased industrial production, global GDP and historically low construction starts,” said Michael Bilerman, analyst at Citi.Lowe’s, the do-it-yourself home retailer, dipped 3.1 per cent after it lowered its forecast for 2010. Shares were trading at $25.26. Rival Home Depot was up 1.1 per cent to $35.39.Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, West Virginia, where 29 miners were killed in an explosion, led the drop in energy stocks after the US Department of Justice said it was launching a criminal probe.Massey shares dropped 10 per cent to $33.29. Peabody, the US’s biggest coal miner, dropped 5.3 per cent to $39.61. Citigroup led a decline across banking. A provision that banks should spin off their swaps operations remained in the US financial reform bill, in spite of Wall Street’s lobbying efforts.Citi was down 4 per cent, to $3.82, its lowest level since early March. S&P 500 financial shares were broadly down 1.2 per cent.American Express shares added 1.4 per cent to $41.22 after it reported the steepest drop in delinquent consumer loans.

The S&P utility index gained 1.6 per cent, helping to reassure investors even after a row erupted between the two countries.Late on Friday US President Barack Obama had said he would impose a duty of 35 per cent on Chinese tyre imports. Beijing accused Washington of “rampant protectionism”, saying it would investigate imports of US poultry and vehicles.Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the biggest US tyremaker, climbed 3 per cent to $17.78. The Ohio company has been badly hit by the recession and cut 5,000 jobs in February after axing 4,000 staff in the second half of last year. Cooper Tire & Rubber, which manufactures tyres mainly in the US but also in China, rose 7.1 per cent to $15.60.Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, fell 2.3 per cent to $5, while Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat processor, fell 2.4 per cent to $12.45.Mr Obama’s speech on regulatory reform on Monday had little immediate effect on the market and stocks continued to fluctuate until rallying late in the day.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,049.34, while the technology-focused Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent to 2,091.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 9,626.80, powered by a 4.6 per cent gain in General Electric after the shares broke through the $15 milestone to $15.35.“People are taking a little bit of protection but they’re not willing to give up on the market yet,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Canaccord Adams. He said the market had declined in early trading because investors were taking money off the table after last week’s rally and guarding themselves in response to the trade dispute with China.“Markets have been overbought and they’re due for a pull-back at some point, it’s just a question of when that is,” he said.Financial stocks led the market lower in early trading. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning US economist, had added to concerns about the economy when he said in an interview on Sunday that underlying problems still lingered in the the US banking system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.After early losses, Bank of America crept up 0.1 per cent to $16.99, while Citigroup lost 2 per cent to $4.52. MB Financial, which operates mainly in the Chicago area, rose 5.5 per cent to $17.97 after it announced a $150m share offering.Materials stocks also helped the market. Sealed Air, the bubble-wrap maker, added 5.9 per cent to $20.16 after its biggest intraday gain since May on an upgrade from BofA.The brokerage raised its rating on Avery Dennison, the world’s largest label maker, helping boost the shares 6 per cent to $34.55.Sprint Nextel, after soaring 20 per cent, was up 10.1 per cent to $4.15 after reports that Deutsche Telekom was considering a bid for the mobile operator.At the weekend, Cadbury reiterated its stance on the takeover bid from Kraft Foods, saying Kraft’s low-growth business model was an “unappealing prospect”.BofA analysts later issued a note saying the British confectioner was unlikely to receive a competing bid. Kraft closed flat at $26.11.Falling commodity prices had initially hit the market but following the afternoon rally ExxonMobil was unchanged at $70. ConocoPhillips gained 1.4 per cent to $46.59 even though oil remained below the $70 level.Following a good performance last week on the back of rising metal prices, Alcoa was unchanged at $12.94. A downgrade from HSBC had initially pushed the stock lower.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Alexza Pharmaceuticals fell 11.7 per cent to $2.56 after it reported disappointing results from the trial of its migraine drug.Salix Pharmaceuticals soared 51.1 per cent to $20.22 after it said Rifaximin, used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, had met the goals of its latest trials.
7;SEE;Sealed Air Corp;2008-05-20T20:51:07Z;Wall St hit by fears of prolonged credit crisis;;Wall Street stock markets were knocked off four-month highs on Tuesday after a rise in core inflation and record high oil prices threatened to trim corporate profits and a leading banking analyst said the credit crisis could extend well beyond 2009.The latest inflation figures gave a mixed picture of the price pressures on US businesses. Prices paid to producers in April, excluding food and fuel, rose twice as fast as forecast but a surprise decline in gasoline prices restrained overall increases to 0.2 per cent.Still, analysts said the trend was clear. “Inflation pressures are mounting and that is spooking the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “And of course record oil prices aren’t helping.”Crude prices pushed above $129 for the first time after billionaire investor T. Boone Pickens predicted oil could hit $150 and a number of analysts raised their price targets for 2008.The strains on the consumer of high fuel prices appear to be limited – so far. Home Depot joined the group of retailers who have posted first-quarter results that were not as bad as feared.The numbers were poor nonetheless. The home-improvement retailer said on Monday that net income slumped 66 per cent to $356m on revenue down 3.4 per cent to $17.9bn.Home Depot shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value in the last year, fell another 5.2 per cent to $27.37.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day down 0.9 per cent at 1,413.42 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 12,828.68. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,492.26.On Monday US stocks pared gains in late trading but held on to close at their highest levels since early January after new data suggested that the US economy may skirt outright recession.Significant drag factors remain, foremost among which are the cascading effects of the credit crisis.According to Meredith Whitney and a team of analysts from Oppenheimer, the extended credit crisis will result in further multi-billion dollar revenue reversals at the major banks.“We believe the real harrowing days of the credit crisis are still in front of us and will prove more widespread in effect than anything yet seen,” Ms Whitney said.The culprit is less the writedowns themselves than the “shut-down” in the securitisation market which at its height provided 66 per cent of household borrowings in the first quarter of 2007.Without that market, consumer credit losses may be “far worse than what is currently estimated, even by the most draconian of investors”. Ms Whitney and her colleagues also slashed their 2008 earnings estimates for the large-cap banking stocks they cover by an average of 17 per cent.Financial stocks were among the leading fallers in the S&P 500, dropping 2.2 per cent while an index of investment banking shares also slumped 2.2 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $44.80, JPMorgan lost 5 per cent to $43.70 and Citigroup slipped 3.8 per cent to $22.11.Elsewhere, AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime-related losses, said it would raise about 60 per cent more capital than it originally indicated in order to strengthen its balance sheet, knocking its share price 2.1 per cent to $38.12.On Tuesday, concerns about rising input costs, as well as a credit rating downgrade for a leading homebuilder, hurt the consumer discretionary sector in particular. The sector fell 1.6 per cent, led down by Centex and KB Home which lost 5.5 per cent to $21.81 and 5.5 per cent to $23.15 respectively.Amid the broader market malaise, energy was one of the few sectors to find any positive momentum. ConocoPhillips rose 0.9 per cent to $93.55, Chevron added 0.9 per cent to $103.09 and the broader sector climbed 0.8 per cent.After a strong run last week materials were largely flat on Tuesday, as rising gold prices weighed against analysts’ comments that weaker demand from China might result in soft metal prices. Newmont Mining rose 1.7 per cent to $49.88 but Alcoa fell 3.1 per cent to $43.23.Packaging stocks were also hit by a number of analyst downgrades. Sealed Air deflated, falling 4.4 per cent to $23.96 while Bemis dropped 4.1 per cent to $26.45.
8;SEE;Sealed Air Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
