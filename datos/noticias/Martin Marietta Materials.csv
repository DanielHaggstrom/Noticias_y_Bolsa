Martin Marietta is also barred from going forward with its proxy contest. It had hoped to elect four new members to Vulcan’s board at the company’s June 1 annual meeting.But Mr Strine, who has become one of the business world’s most influential judges with his impassioned views on boardroom ethics, and his offbeat references to pop culture also took time to sound off about the nuances of confidentiality agreements, and how this decision might impact dealmaking in the future.The case before Mr Strine arose after Martin Marietta, a US maker of construction materials, made its unsolicited bid for rival Vulcan last December. The two companies had been in talks about a merger since 2010, when Vulcan approached Martin Marietta about a tie-up, a topic it had floated with no success for years.Both companies signed a non-disclosure agreement, and a joint defence agreement. Those documents were meant to prevent either company from using confidential information against the other. But the companies did not sign a standstill agreement, which explicitly prohibits a hostile bid.Talks broke down last year after Vulcan concluded the potential synergies did not outweigh the potential antitrust risks, which could have included costly divestitures of lucrative assets. Martin Marietta has contended that another factor was growing personality clashes between the two companies’ chief executives, with Vulcan head Don James unwilling to cede control of the combined company to Martin Marietta chief Ward Nye.Summarising the dynamics that led to the fight, Mr Strine wrote: “When this love story started, it was Vulcan who was pursuing Martin Marietta, seeking to entice a nervous wallflower to go to the dance, after years of flirtation, but ultimate rejection …When the original suitor cooled its ardour, the once-reluctant dance date became more enamoured.”Martin Marietta launched its hostile bid on December 12, with Vulcan’s share price down 25 per cent on the year. At the same time, it filed a document with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included details of the companies’ discussions.Vulcan rejected the offer and sought an injunction to block the bid, arguing that Martin Marietta had violated its confidentiality agreements in several ways, including using information obtained during merger talks to inform its hostile bid and disclosing the fact that the two companies had been in merger discussions.Mr Strine on Friday found in favour of Vulcan and enjoined Martin Marietta’s bid and proxy battle. He ruled that Martin Marietta had used confidential information to inform its hostile bid, and that it intentionally revealed more information about Vulcan than was legally required in order to help its bid.Martin Marietta has claimed that its disclosures are required by law and thus not in breach of the confidentiality agreements. But Mr Strine pointed to evidence that suggests Martin Marietta and its advisers at Deutsche Bank were aware that they might be violating its confidentiality agreements by using information obtained during merger discussions to inform their hostile bid.The judge did not stop there. He also went to lengths to discredit Martin Marietta’s argument that because there was no standstill provision in place, it was free to go ahead with its hostile bid. To support this argument, Martin Marietta has said that if it is not allowed to pursue its bid, a chill on M&A activity might result because every confidentiality agreement might be interpreted as a standstill.But Mr Strine found that despite the lack of a standstill in this case, Martin Marietta’s violation of the existing confidentiality agreements invalidated its bid. “Martin Marietta is not being held to any promise it did not make,” Mr Strine said.The opinion could set a precedent for future deals. “This opinion can be seen as a warning shot to buyers who might have taken comfort in the absence of a standstill, together with what they thought was a broadly-worded use restriction, in thinking that they had preserved the ability to proceed on a hostile basis,” said Matthew Herman, a partner in the US corporate practice of Freshfields.Strine suggested that one way Martin Marietta might have got around this conflict was to use a “clean team” of officers and advisers who had not been exposed to the information obtained during previous merger talks.But this too is an imperfect solution, as the confidential information would have been seen by senior executives of the acquiring company. “It may be an impossible bridge to cross,” said Brian Quinn, professor at Boston College Law School. “You can’t get a new board or a new CEO.”To lighten the tone of such serious considerations, Mr Strine included some of his signature witticisms. At one point Mr Strine invokes a popular actress to reprimand Martin Marietta, saying its behaviour was “cute in a non-Zooey Deschanel way”.In another section, Mr Strine mocks Martin Marietta’s argument that a combined company’s headquarters should be in its home town was “simply a selfless manifestation of his [team’s] obviously superior management approach and the undisputed fact that an aggregates company should be closer to ACC basketball than SEC football”.For Martin Marietta, Mr Strine’s decision is a serious one. It has spent more than $40m over the past two quarters pursuing this deal. Its stock has fallen 11 per cent over the past 10 weeks. Martin Marietta can appeal Mr Strine’s decision to the Delaware Supreme Court, which could rule before Vulcan’s annual meeting.But even if Martin Marietta were to succeed in an appeal, Mr Strine has laid out in bold terms his view that confidentiality agreements, even when they are not paired with a standstill, must be respected by potential buyers.“Failing to enforce confidentiality agreements in the M&A context will reduce, not increase, value-enhancing combinations,” he concludes. “If managers of corporations come to understand that confidentiality agreements will not be enforced as written, that will probably diminish their willingness to explore M&A transactions.”
1;MLM;Martin Marietta Materials;2012-01-29T17:11:30Z;Sluggish start to year for M&A volumes;;Dealmaking has had its slowest start to a year for nearly a decade as companies’ appetite for mergers and acquisitions remains suppressed by the uncertain outlook for the global economy.M&A volumes have been at their lowest levels since 2003, with $102.9bn worth of deals announced globally so far this year – nearly half the level at the same time last year, according to data provider S&P Capital IQ.The muted start comes as some bankers say this year may not improve much on 2011 as the sovereign debt crisis continues to create market volatility. “We are expecting this year to be softer overall across investment banking,” said Larry Slaughter, co-head of North American investment banking at JPMorgan Chase.“However, our pipeline of activity is up so we expect M&A to increase. Shareholders still prefer companies to grow, either via M&A or organically, rather than return cash to shareholders by dividends or stock buy-backs.”The fall in activity has been most marked in the US, where only $34.2bn of deals have been announced so far this year, when in 2011 the figure was nearly three times that level ($89.1bn). Oil and gas companies accounted for the largest proportion of M&A activity – 16.5 per cent, according to Dealogic.Activity levels are slowest in Europe, with $30.4bn worth of deals announced this year, down by a quarter on last January’s $40.4bn. With takeovers typically taking months to negotiate, dealmakers say the lull reflects volatility in the markets from last autumn when deal talks broke down or were shelved.“Overall, volumes have been fairly anaemic so far in 2012,” said Gary Posternack, head of M&A for the Americas at Barclays Capital. “But the numbers do not really represent the level of activity and, to the extent that we get some stability in the markets, there is room to have a strong second half.”With interest rates low, the cheap cost of funding is helping drive dealmaking. On Friday Eastman Chemical highlighted how cheaply it raised the $3.5bn it needed to buy Solutia, the speciality materials company, paying an expected after-tax rate of about 3 per cent for a mix of five to 30-year debt.Some bankers also note a growing number of so-called hostile deals in recent weeks, a leading indicator for a rebound in M&A. Last week Roche made a $5.7bn hostile bid for Illumina, a genetic sequencing specialist, while Martin Marietta remains in pursuit of construction aggregates rival Vulcan Materials, having launched a $4.8bn hostile bid last year.“Companies feel that M&A needs to play a critical role in driving growth and hostile deals are evidence of confidence among buyers and the pressure to act,” said one dealmaker.
2;MLM;Martin Marietta Materials;2012-01-10T20:06:28Z;Marietta turns up heat on Vulcan over merger;;Martin Marietta, the US construction materials company, increased the pressure in its hostile bid for Vulcan Materials on Tuesday by accusing its rival of mismanaging the company and misleading investors over the nature of the $4.8bn all-stock offer.In a conference call with investors, Ward Nye, chief executive of Martin Marietta, attacked Vulcan’s management for failing to acknowledge the company’s “sustained underperformance” and “impaired business profile.”Mr Nye also criticised Vulcan for misrepresenting the bid to shareholders. He said that the offer represented a significant premium over Vulcan’s undisturbed share price and noted that the stock swap would allow Vulcan investors to participate in any future gains.Despite a long history of amicable but unsuccessful discussions about a merger, since Martin Marietta made its unsolicited bid the two sides have exchanged increasingly hostile words, set up rival websites and bombarded shareholders with competing data designed to bolster their positions.Earlier this month, Vulcan’s management elaborated on its initial objections to the offer with a long investor presentation that criticised the bid as opportunistic, inadequate and likely to face opposition from federal regulators.Vulcan argued that historically it has rebounded strongly from recessions, has greater exposure to fast-growing markets than Martin Marietta and has certain key assets, such as an extensive property portfolio, that the bid did not value appropriately.The company was also critical of the $200m-$250m in merger synergies identified by its would-be buyer. The two companies, in joint discussions, had previously identified $125m-150m in cost savings through a merger, Vulcan said.On Tuesday, however, Martin Marietta fought back, reiterating its synergy targets and arguing that the enlarged company would have a stronger balance sheet, more resources to reward shareholders and be better able to weather the choppy economic conditions.Mr Nye said that Vulcan’s case to remain a standalone entity depended on a robust economic recovery in the sector but insisted that that was unlikely. “There [are] no blue-sky prospects with this kind of recovery. At Martin Marietta, we face reality as it is.”Vulcan has been struggling to reduce its debt load after purchasing Florida Rock Industries for $4.6bn near the market peak in 2007. The company had net debt of 8.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the past year.A combined Vulcan-Marietta group would be worth $11.4bn including debt, have operations in 35 US states and control mineral reserves of about 28bn tons. The two companies produce materials for road-building and other infrastructure projects.Since Martin Marietta made its initial all-stock offer, Vulcan shares have climbed about 19 per cent, while Martin Marietta shares have risen about 2 per cent.

If Martin Marietta succeeds in its hostile offer for Vulcan, valuing the construction materials maker at $38 a share, or $4.9bn, it will be picking up such assets at 1.3 times book value, near the lowest multiple in memory. Of course, Martin Marietta points out the market is valuing those assets cheaply for a reason and that it could squeeze more out of them, achieving $250m a year in synergies.Though Vulcan’s board rejected the offer and its chief executive called it “lowball and opportunistic”, the fairness opinion Vulcan relied upon from Goldman Sachs lacks heft, having come weeks after Goldman’s analysts slapped a $29 price target and a “sell” recommendation on Vulcan. This would not be the first time that analysts were wrong. But Vulcan does look sickly, having slashed its dividend and underperformed Martin Marietta. It has spent far more of the past decade trading above the offer price but is now below it largely because of the construction sector’s slump. But management is hardly blameless in reaching this point. It announced a cost-cutting plan only this week.Analyst opinions and the initial market reaction to the offer suggest that another $4 to $6 a share, or up to $1bn, may be warranted. If a richer offer is what Vulcan’s management is trying to accomplish then its aggressive defence – a lawsuit alleging improper use of confidential information from earlier talks and a warning to shareholders that the offer would be “conditional” given antitrust concerns – might be justified. If it is to protect their personal interests then it is not.Martin Marietta should go over the board’s head by making its best offer and then channelling Mr Spock. When logic failed to convince stubborn opponents that they would live long and prosper, he used a Vulcan grip to disable them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
4;MLM;Martin Marietta Materials;2011-12-22T18:39:54Z;Vulcan board rejects Marietta’s $4.9bn bid;;Executives at Vulcan Materials, the building materials company, have urged shareholders to reject a $4.9bn bid for the company from rival Martin Marietta, arguing that the hostile offer is illegal, inadequate and risky.In a sharp riposte to the unsolicited all-stock offer, Vulcan on Thursday laid out seven broad reasons why shareholders should resist the bid, including a pointed accusation that Martin Marietta had breached confidentiality agreements in making its offer.Since 2002, the two companies have held a series of talks about a potential tie-up and Vulcan accused Martin Marietta of obtaining and then divulging “highly sensitive, material, non-public and confidential information”.Vulcan said it had begun litigation against its rival in two US courts in an effort to forestall the offer.In response, Ward Nye, Martin Marietta’s chief executive, said: “Despite the rhetoric by Vulcan, the only real obstacle to delivering to Vulcan’s shareholders the substantial benefits of the proposed combination is the opposition of Vulcan’s board of directors.”People familiar with the Martin Marietta bid argue that it was produced without reference to confidential information and point out that the Vulcan shareholders will own about 58 per cent of the combined company, allowing them to participate in any deal benefits.On December 12, Martin Marietta offered to buy Vulcan by exchanging half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share, arguing the enlarged company would create a global leader in the construction aggregates industry, better able to weather the choppy economic conditions.Vulcan has been struggling to reduce its debt load after purchasing Florida Rock Industries for $4.6bn near the market peak in 2007. The company had net debt of 8.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the past year.A combined Vulcan-Marietta group would be worth $11.4bn including debt, have operations in 35 US states and control mineral reserves of about 28bn tons. The two companies produce materials for road-building and other infrastructure projects.On Thursday, Vulcan shares, which have fallen about 12 per cent over the year to date, rose about 1 per cent to $39.11 in early trading. Martin Marietta shares, which have dropped about 18 per cent over the year so far, slipped about 1 per cent to $75.86Much will depend on behind the scenes efforts to win over key shareholders. Earlier this week, Martin Marietta scored a coup when a prominent member of the Ireland family, owners of Vulcan’s predecessor company, endorsed the bid.In its statement, Vulcan accused Martin Marietta of attempting an “opportunistic” land-grab at a low point in the industrial cycle and said it could achieve significant cost savings on its own. Earlier this week ,Vulcan increased its cost reduction plans.
5;MLM;Martin Marietta Materials;2011-12-13T23:00:16Z;CRH boosted by sector consolidation;;The potential merger of its two biggest competitors helped put CRH among the risers yesterday as the London market rebounded.The Irish aggregates maker, which last week won promotion to the FTSE 100, rose in the wake of Monday’s hostile offer for Vulcan Materials from US peer Martin Marietta.“Marietta management would not be taking such a significant step without having a good degree of confidence that its end markets had at worst stabilised,” said Liberum Capital.Analysts also noted a price tag including debt of $7.4bn — equivalent to around 25 times Vulcan’s operating earnings, compared with CRH which trades at around 8 times earnings. The high price meant CRH was very unlikely to counterbid, but would be likely to pick up disposals required by the enlarged group, they said.“The elevated valuations at which US peers trade could again raise the issue of whether or not CRH should contemplate splitting its US operations and listing them separately,” added NCB Stockbrokers.

It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,236.47, although the index had fallen as low as 1,227 before a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 12,021.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,612.26.“Participants didn’t want to be short last week, because the risk was to the upside in case the summit came up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Now investors are more willing to exit, and they’re telling us European leaders didn’t do enough.”Cyclical bank and material stocks led the fallers, with Morgan Stanley off 6.1 per cent to $15.38 and Alpha Natural Resources falling 8.8 per cent to $21.39.Citigroup also fell 5.4 per cent to $27.22 and Bank of America fell 4.7 per cent to $5.45, even though Richard Ramsden, Goldman Sachs’ US banks analyst, was broadly positive on the sector after Goldman’s bank conference last week.Mr Ramsden told clients that conference participants had pointed to strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, and suggested all major US banks would pass tougher Fed stress tests.Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, fell 6.3 per cent to $116.07. Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500.

7;MLM;Martin Marietta Materials;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Vulcan Materials / Martin Marietta;Either a sweetened offer or more bids are expected;It has been a long and winding road indeed for Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials. The two companies began mulling a combination nearly a decade ago and stepped up talks last year, but those recently broke down. Now that it is unclear who will pay for American roads – of which the companies’ aggregates are a key component – Martin Marietta is trying to force the issue.The market reaction after the proposed $5bn all-share deal was unveiled indicates that either a sweetened offer or more bids are expected. Vulcan’s shares surged far above the proposed premium and Martin Marietta rallied, too, on a weak day for US equities.With federal and state highway spending in limbo (federal funding has been on a stopgap basis since 2009), cost savings from a combination could insulate the two companies from a weak market for road building materials. Already number one and two in the US, the combined group would be more than twice the size of their largest domestic competitor and would overtake HeidelbergCement for the top spot globally.Martin Marietta did not hesitate to highlight Vulcan’s financial woes, with its dividend being slashed to cope with looming debt maturities. Significant overlap between the two shareholder bases and the promise of a healthy pay-out from the combined group will aid approval of the deal. Even after a successful deal, the combined group would have only 15 per cent market share in the US. Aggregates are usually a very local business so economies of scale are tough to come by. The attractiveness of this deal comes from heavy regional overlap in the sunbelt – a feature that Martin Marietta must hope does not force divestitures.The reason the two failed to hook up for so long seems to have been personal, not business. If anyone should know the value of aggregation it is this bunch.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
8;MLM;Martin Marietta Materials;2011-12-12T16:24:58Z;Martin Marietta launches $4.7bn bid for Vulcan;;Martin Marietta, the building materials company, has made an unsolicited $4.7bn stock offer for its larger rival Vulcan Materials, in a bid to create a global leader in the construction aggregates industry and shore up the companies against a faltering macroeconomic outlook.The US’s second-largest producer of aggregates said on Monday it would pay half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share, worth $36.69 based on the closing levels last week. That represents a premium of about 15 per cent based on the companies’ share prices over the past 10 days.The combined group would have a market value of about $7.7bn, before synergies, and would be worth a total of $11.4bn including debt.Together the two companies, which produce materials for road-building and other infrastructure projects, would have operations in 35 US states and combined mineral reserves of 28bn tons. With shipments of about 278m tons last year, the pair would edge ahead of HeidelbergCement as the largest company in the sector.“Recent events, including the fragile state of the US economy, the lack of visibility as to when a sustainable recovery will take place, and the uncertainty surrounding government spending on infrastructure projects, only strengthen the rationale behind a combination,” said Ward Nye, Martin Marietta’s chief executive, in a letter to his counterpart at Alabama-based Vulcan.Vulcan shares jumped more than 19 per cent to $39.94 on Monday morning in New York trading, while Martin Marietta shares rose 5.7 per cent to $77.54.The pair have long flirted with a deal, and have been in talks on-and-off since 2002. Mr Nye noted that the two had most recently been discussing a transaction for a year and a half.“It is our very, very strong preference to negotiate an agreed transaction with the Vulcan board of directors,” Mr Nye said on Monday, adding that he was ready to start discussions immediately. Martin Marietta intends to submit five of its own nominees to Vulcan’s 11-strong board.Vulcan said in a statement it was reviewing the offer and would advise shareholders on what course of action to take in the coming days.The deal would help to reduce Vulcan’s leverage levels and create substantial cost savings, the company added. Martin Marietta expects synergies of $200m to $250m, or about $2bn of equity value once taxed and capitalised.Vulcan has been grappling to bring down its debt levels, after buying Florida Rock Industries for $4.6bn close to the market peak in 2007. The company had net debt of 8.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the last twelve months, a figure that would fall to 5.6 times through a combination with Martin Marietta.Martin Marietta also said it would reinstate Vulcan’s dividend, which was recently cut to $0.04 per share, paying $1.60 for each of its shares annually.Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan are advising Martin Marietta. Vulcan is advised by Goldman Sachs.
