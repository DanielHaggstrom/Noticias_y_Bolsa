0;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2019-07-23T22:13:59Z;Chipotle boosts outlook after strong sales growth in second quarter;;Chipotle Mexican Grill bumped up its outlook for a key sales revenue metric, following forecast-beating revenue and adjusted earnings during the second quarter.That countered some of the concern around a rising food, beverage and packaging costs, and helped push shares 4 per cent higher in after-hours trade on Tuesday to a record high.The fast casual restaurant chain said it now expected comparable restaurant sales — a closely watched industry metric — to increase by the high single-digits percentage compared with a year ago. That was up from their previous forecast for growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range.Comparable sales, which are for outlets open at least 13 months, in the quarter ended June 30 rose 10 per cent from a year ago, and drove an overall 13.2 per cent year-on-year increase in group revenue to $1.43bn. That was ahead of the median forecast for $1.4bn in a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Brian Niccol, chief executive, said this was the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales growth. “These strong results were delivered despite a tougher year over year comparison and benefited from better restaurant operations, more effective marketing, and leveraging our digital make line to grow sales and expand access”, he added.Reported earnings almost doubled to $3.22 a diluted share from a year ago, but were weighed down by a 77 cent after-tax impact from expenses related to restaurant asset impairment and corporate restructuring.On an adjusted basis, earnings of $3.99 a share were up from $2.87 a year ago and came in ahead of Wall Street estimates for $3.76.Chipotle said its food, beverage and packaging costs, rose 1.1 percentage points from a year ago to represent 33.7 per cent of revenue. That was primarily due to the increased cost of avocados and, to a lesser extent, increased dairy costs, although these were partially offset by menu price increases that were rolled out countrywide at the end of last year.Shares were up 4 per cent in after-hours trade at $769.18, a record high.
1;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2019-05-23T18:15:56Z;US food and restaurant chains hit by rising pork prices;Chipotle shares among those affected as African swine fever prompts hog cull;A disease ravaging hog farms 11,000km away in China is affecting US restaurant chains and meat producers, leaving customers forking over higher prices for their pork.Hormel Foods, which produces Spam, said on Thursday that African swine fever in China drove up pork costs, weighing on its quarterly earnings and contributing to a cut in its full-year earnings and sales outlook.Meanwhile shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill came under pressure after analysts at BMO Capital Markets issued the equivalent of a sell rating for the stock, warning that surging pork prices will eat into the restaurant chain’s bottom line.Minnesota-based Hormel, whose brands also include Jenny-O Turkey and Justin’s peanut butter, reported record sales in its latest quarter but chief executive Jim Snee said: “As we look forward, the biggest unknown in the protein industry is related to the outbreak of African swine fever in China.”African swine fever is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that affects both domestic and wild pigs. On its earnings call, Hormel pointed to industry information that showed China, the world’s largest pork producer and consumer, has lost 150m to 200m hogs, equivalent to more than the entire pork production in the US.Hog prices jumped nearly 20 per cent in China in the second quarter, and Hormel said it expects prices to continue to rise as cold storage stocks are drawn.The considerable decline in China’s pig population has driven US lean hog prices up 46 per cent since the start of the year, after declining 15 per cent in 2018.BMO analyst Andrew Strelzik said among the restaurants within his coverage, Chipotle is the most vulnerable to swings in pork prices. He forecast that Chipotle could begin to see the effect as early as the third quarter, and the impact “could be far greater” than current estimates.The bank downgraded Chipotle’s stock to underperform from market-perform and cut its price target to $620 from $675.“We believe the potential magnitude and duration of [African swine fever] impacts to margins is under-appreciated and [Chipotle] is among the restaurants most at risk,” Mr Strelzik wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle’s shares dropped 5.4 per cent to $667.33 in afternoon trading. The stock had been up more than 60 per cent year to date, thanks to a run of strong sales growth.Hormel shares fell 1.4 per cent to $38.94. Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin’ Brands, two other chains with notable pork exposure, tumbled 4.4 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively.Hormel’s Mr Snee also noted that trade wars were contributing to price pressure. “The key driver to the decline [in international sales] continues to be lower fresh pork exports volume and pricing caused by global trade uncertainty related to tariffs,” he said.
2;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2019-04-25T17:38:44Z;Chipotle shares fall on new subpoena over food safety;Restaurant chain faces request related to illness outbreak in Ohio last year;"Chipotle Mexican Grill shares fell on Thursday after the restaurant chain disclosed a new subpoena it received over the outbreak of a foodborne illness at one of its stores last year.The Denver-based company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it received a subpoena on April 18 requesting information related to outbreaks at multiple locations, including a restaurant in Powell, Ohio, where hundreds of customers got sick last summer. The other locations — stores in Simi Valley, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Sterling, Virginia; and Los Angeles, California — were also covered under previous subpoenas from the US District Court for the Central District of California.The subpoenas are related to a criminal investigation by the US attorney’s office and the Food and Drug Administration.“Food safety is our number one priority at Chipotle. We have been co-operating and meeting with the government over the last several years and have been providing them with information regarding our food safety standards, which we believe leads the food service industry. The subpoena that we received is part of the government’s ongoing investigation and we are continuing to co-operate fully,” the company said in a statement.Chipotle confirmed in August that bacteria sickened customers who ate food prepared at the Ohio restaurant. It was the latest food safety incident to plague Chipotle, which dealt with a widespread E. coli outbreak in late 2015 and early 2016 that scared off customers.Shares were down 4.3 per cent on Thursday. However, the stock remains 57 per cent higher so far this year amid improving sales trends at the fast-casual chain.Chipotle reported better first-quarter earnings and revenue than expected and boosted its guidance for comparable sales on Wednesday, saying digital orders continue to drive growth. Under chief executive Brian Niccol, Chipotle has expanded online ordering and delivery and experimented with new menu items to win back diners. The company has also run advertisements highlighting its use of fresh ingredients."
3;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2019-04-24T21:36:55Z;Chipotle raises sales view as online orders double;;Chipotle Mexican Grill bumped up its expectations for full-year sales after the company’s first-quarter results outpaced forecasts, aided by online orders that doubled.The fast-casual restaurant chain, purveyor of tacos and burrito bowls, on Wednesday forecast mid- to high-single digit growth in comparable restaurant sales in 2019, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 5.8 per cent. Chipotle previously expected to post an increase in the mid-single digit percentage range.It continues to plan on opening between 140 and 155 new restaurants this year.“The ongoing improvement in each of our key operating metrics over the past few quarters gives us confidence that our mission to win today and cultivate the future, is resonating,” Brian Niccol, chief executive of Chipotle, said in a statement.Chipotle’s sales suffered from a string of food-safety incidents dating back to 2015 that scared off customers. Mr Niccol, the former head of Yum Brands’ Taco Bell who joined Chipotle one year ago, has sought to revitalise the brand by expanding its menu, investing in online ordering and delivery and running advertisements focused on the use of fresh ingredients.Mr Niccol’s strategy has won over investors. Shares in Chipotle have been on fire, surging 65 per cent on the year after a 49.4 per cent rally in 2018. The stock was up 0.3 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.In the March quarter, Chipotle registered a 9.9 per cent increase in comparable restaurant sales, its fifth consecutive period of accelerated growth and better than the 7.29 per cent gain expected by analysts.Revenue jumped 13.9 per cent to $1.3bn. Digital sales, which doubled year-over-year, accounted for 15.7 per cent of overall sales during the quarter.Chipotle earned net income of $88.1m, or $3.13 a share, up from $59.4m, or $2.13 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs and other one-time charges, adjusted earnings per share of $3.40 handily beat analysts’ estimate of $3.01.
4;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2019-02-06T22:05:48Z;Online order surge fires up Chipotle sales;Shares rallied 10 per cent in late trading;Chipotle Mexican Grill handily beat expectations for quarterly sales and earnings amid a surge in digital orders, heating up shares late Wednesday.The fast-casual restaurant chain, known for its burrito bowls, said comparable sales jumped 6.1 per cent year-over-year in the December quarter. That was stronger than the 4.5 per cent increase projected by analysts, according to a Refinitiv poll, and included 2 per cent growth in transactions.Digital sales were up 65.6 per cent, accounting for 12.9 per cent of all sales.For 2019, Chipotle said it expects comparable sales at stores open at least 13 months — a closely watched industry metric — to grow in the mid-single digit range, compared with analysts’ average forecast of a 4.4 per cent improvement. The company also plans to open between 140 and 155 new restaurants.“The growth acceleration this quarter gives us confidence that our strategy is working,” chief executive Brian Niccol said in a statement. “When we connect with guests through great operations, relevant marketing focused on Chipotle’s great taste and real ingredients, and provide more convenient access, they respond enthusiastically.”Chipotle has sought to win back customers after a string of food-safety incidents, including a widespread E. coli outbreak in late 2015. Under Mr Niccol, the former head of Yum Brands’ Taco Bell who took the reins in March 2018, Chipotle has invested in online ordering and delivery, new menu items and a national marketing campaign that highlights the use of fresh ingredients.The stock has recovered in the past year to hit a three-year high of $543.90 on January 25. Shares rallied 9.6 per cent to $576.70 after the closing bell on Wednesday.California-based Chipotle booked $1.23bn in revenue during the fourth quarter, up 10.4 per cent against the same period a year earlier. The company opened 40 new stores and closed or relocated 12 others, bringing its total restaurant count to 2,491.Food, beverage and packaging costs were 33.2 per cent of revenue, a decline of 100 basis points driven by menu price increases and favourable avocado pricing.Net income was $32m, or $1.15 a share, down from $43.8m, or $1.55 a share, in the year-ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share rose to $1.72 from $1.55.Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of $1.37 a share on revenue of $1.19bn.Chipotle’s board approved up to $100m in additional share buybacks, adding to the current $57.6m under the previous repurchase program.
5;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Chipotle falls to bottom of S&P 500 after analyst downgrade;;Questions about Chipotle’s turnround efforts prompted Wedbush analysts to downgrade the fast-casual burrito chain on Monday, sending the company to the bottom of the S&P 500.Chipotle was down more than 4 per cent by midday, after Wedbush moved the stock from neutral to underperform, citing risk to near-term same-store sales and margin expectations.Chipotle investors have been optimistic that newly installed chief executive Brian Niccol would right the ship after joining from Taco Bell. That has helped Chipotle’s stock price climb back after years of tepid growth that followed a number of health crises.Just two weeks ago, Morgan Stanley raised Chipotle from equal weight to overweight, which sent shares skyward.But Wedbush said that the burrito chain’s same-store sales growth numbers are trending below expectations after a food poisoning outbreak in Ohio led the company to temporarily shut down one of its locations and retrain its employees nationwide on “food safety and wellness protocols,” according to a note from Mr Niccol posted to the Chipotle website.“We view the prospect of ongoing negative headlines from future outbreaks, even if relatively contained, as more likely,” say the analysts, while also expressing concern that Chipotle’s planned “product innovations” may fail to materialise as expected.Even with Monday’s decline, however, Chipotle’s stock is still up by more than 72 per cent for the year.
6;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-08-15T16:02:05Z;Chipotle’s comeback hopes spur Morgan Stanley upgrade;;Investors are digging into Chipotle on Wednesday, sending the fast-casual burrito chain’s shares to a two-and-a-half year high after receiving an upgrade from Morgan Stanley in hopes that its turnround is off to a solid start.Morgan Stanley raised its rating on Chipotle from equal weight to overweight with a price target of $600, up from $413 previously. The vote of confidence pushed shares up 4.38 per cent to $514.94.When it first went public, Chipotle’s popularity made it a hot property, but the momentum came to a screeching halt in 2015, when it was rattled by a food-safety scare. Attempts to juice growth with new menu items and marketing initiatives largely fell flat, leaving growth to stagnate.Earlier this year, the company named Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Mexican fast-food chain Taco Bell, to replace founder Steve Ells as its new chief executive. That whetted Wall Street’s appetite, given the strides Taco Bell made under Mr Niccols to generate buzz with coveted millennial consumers.Mr Niccol has laid out an ambitious plan to put the sizzle back into Chipotle sales — including efforts to become more “culturally relevant”, building up digital offerings and forging deeper ties to customers through a new loyalty programme.While it is still “early days”, Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass said that he saw “increasing evidence” that Chipotle may have come across a recipe for success — including the management change and plenty of “low hanging opportunities” to boost sales through marketing, product development and operational improvements.“The scarcity of growth stocks across consumer discretionary could also increase investors’ willingness to pay a high multiple for an early innings recovery story, while the narrative of new management with sales levers to pull is one that has typically worked in restaurants,” he wrote.Still, he noted that there was a risk that turnround hopes could be running too hot — especially given its reliance on consumer discretionary spending remaining strong and the lingering threat that another food-safety problem could derail its progress.Chipotle shares rose nearly 5 per cent to $517.55 on Wednesday, their highest since March 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. So far this year, they have advanced nearly 80 per cent, after three consecutive years in which they lost more than 20 per cent of their value.
7;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-07-26T21:18:43Z;Chipotle results top market forecasts as turnround bears fruit;;Chipotle’s new chief executive is already seeing signs of a recovery at the fast-casual burrito chain after it reported quarterly sales and earnings that cruised past analysts’ forecasts. Revenue at the Denver-based fast-casual burrito chain rose 8.3 per cent from a year ago to $1.3bn in the three months ended June 30, thanks in part to the opening of a net 26 restaurants during the quarter. That topped the average of $1.26bn from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Net income was $46.9m, or $1.68 a diluted share, and included $33.4m in expenses related to restructuring charges. Adjusted earnings of $2.87 a share were up 23.7 per cent from a year ago and were 7 cents ahead of market forecasts.Chipotle in February appointed Brian Niccol, who previously led Mexican food chain Taco Bell, as its new chief executive. Investors have been optimistic that Mr Niccol can transplant his success reviving the fortunes of Taco Bell at Chipotle, which had suffered several years of lacklustre sales following a food-safety crisis in 2015.Mr Niccol then brought over former colleague Chris Brandt, who oversaw some of the initiatives that made Taco Bell popular with millennials, to be Chipotle’s chief marketing officer.Mr Niccol said in a statement he was pleased with sales and restaurant margins coming in ahead of expectations during the second quarter. “While we made progress during the quarter with particular strength in digital sales, I firmly believe we can accelerate that progress by executing our reorganisation and our strategy to win today and cultivate tomorrow.”Chipotle shares were up 5 per cent cent in after-hours trade on Thursday. The stock is up about 55 per cent in 2018, having fallen by more than 20 per cent in each of the past three calendar years.
8;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-06-27T22:15:41Z;Chipotle plans some belt-tightening to beef up growth;;Chipotle executives warned investors of some short-term hiccups — including the closure of up to 60 underperforming stores and a restructuring charge of as much as $135m — as the fast-casual burrito chain tries to transform into a leaner, meaner company under its new chief executive, Brian Niccol.During a call on Wednesday, Mr Niccol — who joined the company from fast-food chain Taco Bell earlier this year — and other executives laid out their strategies for trying to put the sizzle back into Chipotle after several years of lacklustre sales following a damaging food-safety crisis.Mr Niccol focused on three key initiatives: revamping its marketing and communication strategies to become more “culturally relevant”, including new menu items, building up its digital offerings, and forging deeper ties to customers with a new loyalty programme, set to launch in 2019.“I can easily see a future where Chipotle more than doubles the business to $10 billion in revenue,” Mr Niccol said. “We will execute flawlessly in our existing restaurants, add more high-performing restaurants, build brand relevance and engagement, expand digital capabilities for team members and customers, and build an organisation with top tier talent that can win today and cultivate a better future.”Part of that transformation will involve some slimming down, executives said. Chipotle is planning to close between 55 and 60 underperforming locations — including five of its Pizzeria Locale restaurants outside of Denver — and expects to take a restructuring charge between $115m and $135m.Investors’ appetites have been whetted by the arrival of Mr Niccol, who was seen as key to the success Taco Bell has had in recent years in engaging with millennials and exciting customers with unusual menu items. The first earnings report released after his arrival unleashed a wave of enthusiasm, driving Chipotle shares to a record one-day gain on optimism that he will be able to cook up similar results at his new company.On Wednesday’s call, Mr Niccol assured investors that “the underlying sales trends that we are seeing as the sales trends from Q1 have continued into Q2.”But investors seemingly found less to sink their teeth into than they had expected during Wednesday’s call. Chipotle shares dropped more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading.After falling 23.4 per cent in 2017, Chipotle shares are up 58.2 per cent so far in 2018, still making them one of the top performers in the S&P 500.

10;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-05-23T18:51:16Z;Chipotle to move headquarters to California;;The changes keep coming at Chipotle. Just months after it named a new chief executive, the fast-casual burrito chain said on Wednesday that it will move its headquarters from Denver, Colorado — where its first restaurant was opened 25 years ago — to Newport Beach, California, as it ploughs ahead with efforts to make a clean break from recent woes.Chipotle said that over the next six months, it will move operations from its current Denver office to either Newport Beach or another office in Columbus, Ohio, which houses support functions. It will also transition functions from its offices in New York to one of those two locations. About 400 employees will be affected, Chipotle said.Brian Niccol, the former Taco Bell executive who took over as chief executive earlier this year from founder Steve Ells, said:“We have a tremendous opportunity at Chipotle to shape the future of our organisation and drive growth through our new strategy. In order to align the structure around our strategic priorities, we are transforming our culture and building world-class teams to revitalise the brand and enable our long-term success.”Mr Niccol’s arrival has fed hopes that Chipotle was finally turning the page on a food-safety crisis that rattled it in 2015. It was subsequently plagued by lacklustre growth, but investors are now pinning their hopes on Mr Niccol’s ability to transform Chipotle and boost its popularity like he did at Taco Bell.
11;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-04-26T21:30:33Z;Chipotle shares serve up $239m one-day gain for Ackman;Mexican fast-food chain’s new boss, Brian Niccol, wows Wall Street on debut;Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square made almost a quarter of a billion dollars on its stake in Chipotle on Thursday, as shares in the burrito chain soared by 24 per cent.Chipotle’s stock made its largest-ever one day gain on Thursday, after its first earnings report under a new chief executive injected optimism that the beleaguered chain may finally be turning a corner. Pershing Square, Mr Ackman’s investment group, is Chipotle’s largest shareholder, with 2.9m shares, or 10.3 per cent of the company, according to regulatory filings. The value of its stake jumped $239m to $1.2bn as Chipotle shares rose $82.98 to $422.50.Thursday’s rise only takes the shares back to around the level at which they were trading in September 2016 when Pershing Square first disclosed a big stake, however.After coming under pressure from investors including Mr Ackman, the company replaced founder Steve Ells as chief executive in February this year. To lead its turnround, it brought in a respected veteran of fast food, Brian Niccol.On his debut earnings call with analysts, Mr Niccol spoke of his ambitions to make Chipotle’s brand “much more visible”.We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I’m optimisticIn the coming months, he said, “you will see us piloting various tests” in areas such as online ordering, marketing spending and menu tweaks. He also cited “simple pivots” the company is already making, such as advertising that highlights locally-sourced ingredients.“I do want to acknowledge that there’s a lot of great work under way and we are starting to get some traction,” he said. “We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I’m optimistic.”While light on details, investors and analysts welcomed the comments and Mr Niccol repeatedly promised to share more on a “special call” before the next quarterly results.“We found the CEO enthusiasm contagious,” said Jeffrey Bernstein, analyst at Barclays. “With a new CEO for the first time in the 25-year brand history, it was not surprising that CEO commentary overshadowed [quarterly results].”However, Mr Bernstein warned “execution will prove more difficult” and that the plans appear to be “more evolution than revolution”.While Chipotle helped pioneer the trend of “fast-casual” dining, the company’s reputation has been bruised in recent years by incidents ranging from food safety scares to rising avocado prices to rats falling from the ceiling in restaurants. Since then, efforts to win back customers have largely fallen flat. Mr Niccol had previously led Yum Brands’ Taco Bell chain and was credited with reviving that Mexican fast-food chain’s popularity with millennials, thanks to clever marketing and new menu items. Chipotle’s shares are up 46 per cent this year, after registering double-digit percentage declines each year from 2015 and 2017, as it struggled to bounce back from a food-safety crisis.In the three months to the end of March, Chipotle’s comparable sales rose 2.2 per cent, outpacing analyst forecasts for a 1.3 per cent increase. Operating costs, including food, fell. A slew of analysts upgraded their price targets for Chipotle after the results and the comments from Mr Niccol. “While 1Q results were only slightly better than expected, we are more intrigued by the potential for brand improvement under new CEO Brian Niccol,” said David Palmer with RBC, who raised his price target for Chipotle shares to $360, from $340. Andy Barish, an analyst with Jefferies, raised his price target from $300 to $350, explaining that “we believe turn is in early stages with new CEO Brian Niccol’s strategies . . . possibly helping later in the year”.
12;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-04-26T16:40:39Z;Chipotle eyes best day on record as new chief feeds turnround hopes;;Order up at Chipotle. The fast-casual burrito chain is cruising towards its best-ever one-day gain after its first earnings report under new chief executive Brian Niccol unleashed a wave of optimism about its prospects of finally turning a corner from the food-safety crisis that has dogged it.The company’s shares zoomed 24.3 per cent higher on Thursday to $422.13 following the report, putting them on track for their biggest one-day advance since going public in 2006.For Chipotle, it’s a welcome break from the bruising it has taken in recent years as the food-safety scare dented its momentum, and efforts to spice up its offerings and lure back customers largely fell short.To help jump-start those efforts, founder Steve Ells agreed last year to step aside from his role as chief executive (while staying on as executive chairman) and in February, Brian Niccol – who led Yum Brands’ fast-food Mexican chain Taco Bell – was named as his successor.Mr Niccol has only spent a little over a month in the top job, but Chipotle’s earnings from the first three months of 2018 indicate that there is some momentum for him to build off of as he moves to put his mark on the chain, with sales growing and operating costs, including food, falling.In his subsequent call with investors, Mr Niccol – who garnered a reputation for menu innovation and smart marketing during his time at Taco Bell – said he will lay out details of his strategic plan before its next earnings announcement. In the meantime, he said that Chipotle will focus in the short term on making “simple pivots” to help boost the brand’s appeal, like tweaking menu items and advertising.That message resonated with analysts, who delivered a slew of upgrades to their ratings and price targets on the company.One of those upgrades came from BTIG, which switched its rating from “neutral” to “buy” with a $460 price target. Analyst Peter Saleh wrote:“We expect the recent change in leadership will bring some fresh perspective, generate efficiencies within the restaurants and drive much needed innovation. While management indicated more clarity on strategy changes will be discussed in the coming months, we believe Chipotle could see material improvements in marketing, innovation and digital access. Given the earnings potential from a stronger sales and margin recovery, we are inclined to get ahead of this prospect rather than wait and are upgrading shares accordingly.”After falling by more than 20 per cent each year since 2015, Chipotle shares are up 46.1 per cent so far in 2018, including Thursday’s gain.
13;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-04-25T20:40:44Z;Chipotle earnings whet Wall Street’s appetite;;Chipotle’s first quarterly report under new chief executive Brian Niccol has given investors something to sink their teeth into, and the fast-casual burrito chain’s shares heated up in after-hours trading following better than expected earnings.The company’s shares rose more than 10 per cent on Wednesday evening on the results, which fuelled Wall Street hopes Chipotle may finally be turning a corner from the food-safety crisis in 2015 that has weighed on it.For the three months ended March 31, revenue grew 7.4 per cent year-on-year to $1.1bn. Comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 2.2 per cent, with recent price increases helping to offset fewer transactions.Net income was up to $59.4m from $46.1m in the year-ago period, while earnings per share rose 33.1 per cent year-over-year to $2.13. Food costs fell 140 basis points from a year ago to represent 32.4 per cent of revenue, with menu price hikes and lower paper usage helping to offset the higher costs of its switch to preservative-free tortillas.Analysts had been looking for $44m in net income, or $1.58 a share, on sales of $1.14bn, according to Factset. Same-store sales had been pegged to rise 1.3 per cent.The results are the first since February’s announcement that Mr Niccol, the one-time chief executive of Yum Brands’ Mexican fast-food chain Taco Bell, took over Chipotle’s top job, replacing founder Steve Ells, who said last year he will be stepping back — though he will remain executive chairman. Investors cheered the news, as Mr Niccol was seen as a driving force behind Taco Bell’s recently resurgence in popularity, especially among millennials.The company’s shares are up 17.5 per cent this year, after registering double-digit percentage declines each year from 2015 and 2017, as it struggled to bounce back from a food-safety crisis that spooked customers. In addition to the new chief executive, Chipotle bagged another Taco Bell alum, Chris Brandt, last month to replace its outgoing chief marketing officer.Mr Niccol said:“While the company made notable progress during the quarter, I firmly believe we can accelerate that progress in the future. We are in the process of forming a path to greater performance in sales, transactions, margins and new restaurants. This path to performance will be grounded in a strategy of executing the fundamentals while introducing consumer-meaningful innovation across the business. It will also require a structure and organisation built for creativity, action and accountability. Finally, Chipotle will have a culture that is centred on running great restaurants, putting the customer first, innovating for today and tomorrow, supporting each other, and delivering on commitments. The future will be meaningful at Chipotle.”

Having worked with Chris in the past, I have seen first-hand his ability to generate sales overnight and build brands over time. His experience and expertise make him an ideal fit for our leadership team at Chipotle as we look to reinvigorate this exceptional brand, and build sales, transactions and profitability.”The executive shake-up at Chipotle comes as the company attempts to turn the page on a damaging food-safety crisis. Its recent efforts to re-whet customers’ appetites by launching new menu items like queso dip have landed with a thud, however, and Chipotle’s founder, Steve Ells, said he would step aside from the chief executive position once a replacement was found.Chipotle shares are up 1.5 per cent in midday trading on Tuesday to $321.70, and have advanced 11.3 per cent so far in 2018 after falling 23.4 per cent in 2017.
15;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-02-14T16:39:42Z;Chipotle eyes best day in nearly 5 years after nabbing Taco Bell CEO;;It’s a mouth-watering combination – Chipotle, the fast-casual burrito chain, has tapped the chief of Mexican fast-food brand Taco Bell to help turn a corner on stagnant sales and a food safety crisis, and the initial rush of enthusiasm has sent its shares on course for their best single-day advance in almost five years.Chipotle shares were up nearly 15 per cent on Wednesday to $288.51, a day after it made the long-expected announcement of who will replace founder Steve Ells as chief executive. Brian Niccol will be joining the Denver-based company from Taco Bell, the Yum Brands fast-food chain where he has held leadership roles since 2011.Mr Niccol has been credited with helping to turn around Taco Bell, which has been exciting younger consumers through creative marketing and social media that promotes novel menu items like the Doritos Taco Loco and the Naked Chicken Chalupa – a taco encased in a shell of fried chicken.Chipotle has tried to position itself as a better, fresher alternative to typical fast-food brands. But it was rattled by a food-safety crisis in 2015, and attempts to whet customers’ appetites with new offerings like queso dip have largely fallen flat, leaving its share price wilted and leading Wall Street to question whether it can recapture its earlier mojo.Mr Ells said last year that he would cede the chief executive title once a replacement was found, although he will remain on as executive chairman. That led to speculation about who would get the nod, and how much free rein they would have to pursue their plans for spicing up Chipotle sales.Investors are clearly excited about seeing what Mr Niccol can do with Chipotle, and analysts were cautiously optimistic, while underscoring continued concerns about whether Chipotle’s sluggish sales growth is its new normal.“Mr. Niccol’s appointment will be viewed as a near-term catalyst for the stock given his experience repositioning the Taco Bell brand and successful execution across innovation, marketing, and value initiatives,” wrote Dennis Geiger of UBS. ““However, we continue to believe long-term headwinds remain, with a still challenged brand image and competitive pressures that will likely take time to address,” he added in a note on Wednesday. “Despite the announcement and our favorable view of Mr. Niccol’s appointment, we remain concerned Chipotle faces a new normal of lower sales & earnings growth going forward against a still elevated valuation”Chipotle shares fell 23.4 per cent in 2017 – their third year straight of double-digit percentage declines – and are nearly flat so far in 2018. Despite the jump, shares have only risen as high as $291.88 on Wednesday, a far cry from the peak of $758.61 seen in 2015. The stock dipped below $300 a share earlier this month following several analyst downgrades and lukewarm earnings.
16;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-02-13T21:57:26Z;Chipotle picks Taco Bell chief as new CEO;;Chipotle shares are red-hot in after-hours trading after the fast-casual burrito chain named Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Mexican fast-food chain Taco Bell, to its top job.The long-awaited announcement sent Denver-based Chipotle shares up more than 10 per cent on Tuesday evening. Investors have been waiting to see who would replace Chipotle founder Steve Ells in the top job after he announced last year he would be stepping back — though still staying on as executive chairman.Mr Ells said in a statement:“Brian is a proven world-class executive, who will bring fresh energy and leadership to drive excellence across every aspect of our business. His expertise in digital technologies, restaurant operations and branding make him a perfect fit for Chipotle as we seek to enhance our customer experience, drive sales growth and make our brand more relevant.”Mr Niccol’s most recent job was chief executive of Taco Bell, a division of Yum Brands, a job he held since 2015. Before that, he held various other leadership positions at Taco Bell and fellow Yum Brands chain Pizza Hut, after getting his start at consumer giant Procter & Gamble.He said in a statement:“I am very excited to be joining Chipotle at this pivotal time in its history. I have tremendous respect for the Chipotle brand and its powerful purpose. At Chipotle’s core is delicious food, which I will look to pair up with consistently great customer experiences. I will also focus on dialling up Chipotle’s cultural relevance through innovation in menu and digital communications. This will attract customers, return the brand to growth, deliver value for shareholders and create opportunities for employees.”Yum Brands also announced on Tuesday that it had tapped Julie Fells Masino, president of Taco Bell North America, and Liz Williams, president of Taco Bell International, to lead that division after Mr Niccol’s departure.Chipotle has been looking to restore the sizzle the once-hot chain lost after a food-safety crisis in 2015, but has since been plagued with lacklustre growth. While Wall Street has been hoping that Mr Ells’ successor would help whet consumers’ appetites with fresh ideas, questions remain about whether the new chief will be allowed free rein, or whether Mr Ells’ continued presence will prove one too many cooks in the corporate kitchen.
17;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-02-07T16:35:31Z;Chipotle shares singed by growth worries, CEO search;;Waiting for Chipotle’s fortunes to turn a corner? Get in line.As investors digested its latest batch of quarterly earnings, the fast-casual Mexican chain’s shares are down more than 10 per cent on Wednesday after worries about soggy traffic trends and its ongoing search for a new chief executive prompted Stifel analysts to downgrade the stock to a “sell”.On Tuesday, Denver-based Chipotle reported a doubling in quarterly profits to $43.8m from a year earlier, thanks to a boost from tax reform, and revenue of $1.1bn, in line with analysts’ forecasts. Comparable sales — a key industry metric — were up 0.9 per cent from a year ago, a hair above the 0.8 per cent analysts were looking for, with higher menu prices at certain restaurants helping to offset declining traffic.But for Chris O’Cull at Stifel, the uptick in same-store growth was nothing to cheer about, given the easy prior year comparsion when sales at the company were being rattled by a food-safety crisis.In a note Tuesday evening, Mr O’Cull wrote: “We expect negative traffic to persist. The company seems to be relying on easier comparisons this summer, rather than any initiatives to reverse the trend. We believe improving traffic could prove especially difficult following the 5% menu price increase.”Chipotle didn’t give Wall Street much to look forward to over for the coming year, either, with a forecast of comparable restaurant sales to increase in the low single digits, less than the 6.4 per cent growth registered in 2017.One thing that could kick Chipotle’s shares into high gear would be the expected naming of a new chief executive to replace Steve Ells, the company’s founder and chairman, who announced last year he would leave the top job whenever a successor was found.Mr Ells said on Tuesday that the company was “making good progress” on that search, and on the earnings call with investors, he said that the intention was “to have the new CEO be in charge.” But given that Mr Ells plans to shift into the job of executive chairman once his replacement takes over, it is still unclear how much influence he will retain over the company, or whether the new chief will have to struggle to put his or her vision into place.It “will be interesting to see if the EC reports to the CEO and also leads the board meetings,” Mr O’Cull wrote. “We struggle to see how any experienced CEO candidate would find this arrangement ideal for implementing change.”Stifel’s downgrade moves its rating on the stock from “hold” to “sell” and lowers its 12-month price target on shares from $310 to $250. Last week, UBS analysts also turned their noses up at Chipotle shares, downgrading it to a “sell” on similar concerns that it is “facing a new normal of lower growth.”Chipotle shares are down Wednesday 10.3 per cent to $272.91, putting them on track for their biggest one-day drop since October. Last year, Chipotle shares dropped 23.4 per cent and are down 5.7 per cent so far this year.

The refreshed code, which awaits signoff by DRC President Joseph Kabila, will hike extraction royalties and scrap standstill agreement clauses that protect mines from changes in the fiscal regime for 10 years.Randgold’s Kibali gold mine in DRC provides 20 per cent of 2017 group production and about 36 per cent of net present value, according to Barclays.With world market rebounding, Investec and Old Mutual are leading a rally for financial stocks. The pair were also helped by a strong South African rand, which was boosted by speculation that President Jacob Zuma’s resignation is imminent.GlaxoSmithKline advanced after its fourth-quarter revenue beat forecasts, thanks in part to robust sales of new products in its respiratory franchise.“The guidance for 2018 is encouraging and we believe is about 1 per cent ahead of consensus expectations adjusting for the multiple moving parts,” said Liberum. “This should settle nerves on the company’s expectations for HIV in a year when new competition is expected. We are also encouraged by the company being ‘increasingly confident’ in the longer term guidance to 2020 which consensus sits below.”Cardboard box maker Smurfit Kappa is under pressure even after delivering fourth-quarter results that matched market forecasts, as strength in Europe and cost savings offset tough trading in the Americas. A medium-term strategy update set out Smurfit’s plans to invest €1.6bn above maintenance capital expenditure by 2021 to take advantage of growth, integration and cost-savings opportunities.Goodbody Stockbrokers said: “We assume the share price reaction relates to the natural front-loading of cash expenditure before reaping the returns benefit. However, we would note that the investment plan is flexible in relation to market conditions and this management team has a strong track record of delivery.”Croda climbed after Reuters reported that the chemicals maker has ended talks to buy US-listed peer Ashland. Market speculation in recent days had linked Croda with a possible offer of around $93 a share for Ashland, which would have given the US group a market value of $5.7bn and would likely have required Croda to launch a rights issue.Redrow has jumped on better than expected interim results from the housebuilder, which came with a 50 per cent dividend hike. The group’s outlook statement also reassured, with reservations in the first five weeks of 2018 being in line with last year.Numis Securities upgraded Redrow to “buy”, saying: “The results highlight that Redrow’s past investment in land and WIP [work in progress] — rather than returning large amounts of capital to shareholders — is feeding through to strong levels of volume and profit growth. Sales so far in 2018 are in line with the strong comparative last year, and this, alongside the strong order book, give us confidence in the [outlook] for the full year.”In the US, Snap surged by as much as 35 per cent after reporting better than expected revenue and a surprise reacceleration of daily active user growth. It was the first beat since the Snapchat owner’s flotation last March.“We think the worst is behind Snap,” said Barclays. “We think shares could continue to grind higher as the narrative changes from 2017’s ‘Facebook is going to crush Snap’ to 2018’s ‘users and revenue accelerate and the platform is under-monetised’. Shares are expensive (8.3 times our 2019 revenue estimate), but everything is accelerating, and as we’ve seen repeatedly in consumer internet, these inflection points are not likely one-quarter events.”Chipotle Mexican Grill was a sharp faller after reporting a slow start to 2018. The restaurant chain said customer volumes had turned negative again, having failed to recover from last summer’s food safety scare.● Redburn starts coverage of the UK bus and rail operators, with the research house preferring buses over trains. FirstGroup and National Express are rated “buy”, with Stagecoach and Go-Ahead on “neutral” recommendations.“Somewhat surprisingly, we conclude opportunities abound. Our analysis of 147 regional bus subsidiaries confirms this is an idiosyncratic sector, but one in which growth and improving profitability can be driven through individual market characteristics, higher fuel prices and fleet investment. In less compelling regions, costs can be mitigated through network rationalisation.”“By contrast, the UK rail industry is structurally flawed. Heady passenger growth projections are needed to justify the premia, the major consideration in the Department for Transport bid process. However, with demand growth slowing, and operators locked into contracts with little protection, profitability will fall.”● Credit Suisse upgrades Rentokil Initial to “outperform” with a 330p target price. Its note highlights that the US makes up two-thirds of Rentokil’s pest control business, which accounts for 63 per cent of group revenues.“We think Rentokil can continue to take share in the US and, as it builds density . . . we think Rentokil’s position and brand in attractive end markets will support sustainable and consistent growth and value creation that we do not think is reflected in the current share price.”● HSBC cuts Capita to “hold” from “buy” with a target cut from 640p to 200p. It begins with a mea culpa:“We allowed enthusiasm for what we believe can be done with Capita by new management to overwhelm the scepticism with which we had viewed Capita for a number of years. There is, at this point, simply too much we do not know. [ . . .] We downgrade the stock to hold given the uncertainty around disposals, the unknown quantum of the discount on the rights issue and the upcoming strategy. Our turnround scenario suggests that the share price could more than double, over time, but it is too early to factor that into the valuation, as of yet, in our view.”● In brief: UBS upgrades Sage to “neutral”. Spectris upgraded to “overweight” at JPMorgan Cazenove. Royal Bank of Scotland raised to “hold” at Investec. Stifel raises Spirax Sarco to “buy”. Macquarie raises Diageo to “neutral”.

19;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-02-06T22:07:18Z;Higher prices, tax gain beef up Chipotle profit;;Chipotle’s quarterly profit more than doubled from a year ago after the fast-casual burrito chain reaped the benefits of higher menu prices and recently enacted US tax reform.The company said on Tuesday that its revenue for the three months ending December 31 rose 7.3 per cent to $1.1bn, while comparable sales — a key industry metric — increased 0.9 per cent. The revenue figure came in line with analysts’ expectations, while comp sales managed to eke out a small beat over the 0.8 per cent that Wall Street was looking for.Chipotle attributed the comp sales gain to its decision to raise prices on some menu items at certain restaurants, which it said helped to boost average tickets to help balance out a decrease in transactions. The price hike also helped drive down food costs by 110 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2016, to 34.2 per cent of revenue — as did its effort to save money on paper and packaging, along with cheaper avocados.Net income came in at $43.8m, compared to $16m during the same period a year earlier, with diluted earnings per share of $1.55, versus 55 cents a year ago. Earnings were lifted by a $6m, or 21 cent per share, tax benefit. Analysts had been looking for $37m in net income, or $1.32 a share.Steve Ells, Chipotle’s founder, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement:“During 2017, we have made considerable changes around leadership, operations, and long-term planning and it is clear that, while there is still work to be done, we are starting to see some success. 2018 marks the 25th anniversary of Chipotle, and I am encouraged by the dedication all of our guests and employees have to this brand. Our focus this year will be to continue perfecting the dining experience, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering, and reinvesting in our restaurants. We are making good progress on our search for a new CEO who can improve execution, drive sales and enable Chipotle to realise our enormous potential.”Mr Ells announced last year that he will step down from the chief executive post once a replacement is found. The company has been grappling with how to spice up its sales and return to the red-hot growth that once made it a favourite of lunch-goers and investors before it was hit with a food-safety crisis starting in 2015.Its shares fell 23.4 per cent last year, and are up nearly 4 per cent year-to-date in 2018. They rose an additional 1.2 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
20;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2018-02-01T18:04:17Z;UBS downgrade dulls investor appetite for Chipotle;;Can Chipotle get its sizzle back? Investors aren’t so sure, sending its shares down on Thursday after the US fast-casual burrito chain was downgraded to a “sell” by UBS.It’s been a bumpy ride for Chipotle over the past few years, after a red-hot growth streak came to an abrupt end when it was rattled by a food-safety scare, knocking its shares back from an all-time high of $758.61 in August 2015. After the food-safety revelations, shares have shed more than 20 per cent of their value in each of the past three years. The stock is currently trading at $309.63 after shedding another 4.7 per cent on Thursday.In November, its founder, Steve Ells, stepped down from the chief executive role, a spot the company has yet to fill. It has also rolled out new menu offerings, like queso dip, to try to juice up consumer enthusiasm.But online reviews have hit an all-time low, new offerings have done little to stave off fierce competition and unit-development expectations seem overly ambitious, according to UBS analyst Dennis Geiger, who said in a note Thursday that he believed Chipotle “is facing a new normal of lower growth.”Heightened competition, a difficult industry environment, and brand perception challenges highlight risks to sales & earnings growth. New product launches & increased marketing activity have not meaningfully accelerated growth, and we believe CMG is facing a new normal rather than an ongoing recovery.UBS lowered its 12-month rating on Chipotle from “neutral” to “sell” and dropped the price target from $345 to $290 a share.As part of its analysis, UBS said that it crunched more than 137,000 online customer reviews for Chipotle food – and discovered that diner satisfaction was coming apart faster than a soggy chip.The review “indicates a continued decline in scores since 2010 to historic lows,” the report said. “We remain concerned about deteriorating review trends & potential implications for the trajectory of sales.”Chipotle may be able to spice things up in the short term, with an expected boost from tax reform and infusion of new ideas when it finally names a new chief executive. But a longer-term shift in momentum seems less likely at the moment, Mr Geiger wrote:“We expect a new CEO announcement could be a catalyst for shares near-term. But long-term headwinds remain, with competition and a somewhat still challenged brand image as headwinds that could take time for an incoming CEO to effectively address. Opportunities likely exist across new product innovation, day parts (breakfast), remodels, technology, operations, and marketing, to name a few, but we don’t expect fixes to be quick.”Chart courtesy of UBS
21;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-12-20T18:06:12Z;Chipotle shares dip as officials investigate illness reports;;Here we go again.Shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill took a knock on Wednesday after public health officials said they are investigating one of the burrito chain’s restaurants in Los Angeles following multiple reports of customers falling ill after eating there.The Los Angeles Health Department’s Acute Communicable Disease Control unit said in an email to the FT that it was “aware of reports of illness and is investigating.”Chipotle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Chipotle fell nearly 3 per cent before trimming that loss to trade 2.5 per cent lower at $305.25.The news comes at a sensitive time for the fast-casual Mexican food chain, which has only started repairing its reputation and regaining diners following a series of food-safety incidents over the past two years.The health scares battered sales and wiped more than 60 per cent of the company’s market value from its peak in 2015. Last month, founder Steve Ells announced he was stepping down as chief executive, saying it “is the right thing to do for all our stakeholders.”“(W)hile we are continuing to make progress, it is clear that we need to move faster to make improvements,” he said in a statement at the time.

Sour cream? Sure. Norovirus? Hold the norovirus. And maybe swap your inspirational founder for someone who knows more about running a substantial US fast-food chain.The Mexican restaurant chain is looking for a new chief executive after disasters that began with an E. coli outbreak in 2015 and continued this year with a data breach, storm damage and that norovirus attack. The shares have fallen three-fifths.On Wednesday, Chipotle said that founder Steve Ells would step down as CEO, restricting himself to the role of chairmanIf the word “executive” preceding that title acknowledges the thought leadership of Mr Ells in corn taco assembly, no problem. If the entrepreneur cannot resist overruling the newbie CEO, a 3 per cent jump in the shares will look overcooked.“An unco-operative Ells would be the biggest risk to a transition,” opines Bernstein’s Sara Senatore. A time comes in the life of most fast-growing businesses when the progenitor should cede control to a career manager. It is best to go quietly, as illustrated by the fraught removal of Travis Kalanick at online taxi group Uber.The need for change is glaring at Chipotle. Its problems with basic food hygiene bespeak sloppy processes and weak discipline. Recurrences could destroy this sometime Wall Street darling.They have already hurt comparable-store sales, which rose just 1 per cent in the third quarter. Operating margins have fallen to an unappetising 6 per cent, against 17 per cent historic and more than 30 per cent for McDonald’s.The shares are priced for a recovery and growth in the estate of 2,250 stores. At 33 times predicted 2017 earnings, they look pricey compared with rivals, if better value at 25 times for 2019.The stock should rise again if Chipotle hires a decent CEO. That should be easy enough. Harder to restrict Mr Ells to “innovation”. Too many cooks spoil the guacamole.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is Chipotle poised for recovery? Or has it lost the plot for good? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
23;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Chipotle founder to step down as CEO, become executive chairman;;Chipotle founder Steve Ells is stepping down as chief executive of the fast-casual burrito chain in the wake of a series of food safety scandals and missteps that have wiped more than 60 per cent off the company’s market value since its peak in 2015.Chipotle said in a statement on Wednesday that the board has begun the search for a new CEO. Mr Ells will become executive chairman once a new CEO has been appointed.“Bringing in a new CEO is the right thing to do for all our stakeholders,” said Mr Ells. “….while we are continuing to make progress, it is clear that we need to move faster to make improvements.”Shares in the company – which were halted in pre-market trading ahead of the announcement – are down more than 40 per cent since May after it was hit by yet another food safety scandal. Its woes had been compounded by a data breach and a pair of hurricanes that pummeled southeastern US states this year which prompted a sharp drop in third quarter profit.In his new role as executive chairman, Mr Ells said he will be focused on “bringing innovation” to the way Chipotle food sourcing and preparation.Executive recruitment firm Spencer Stuart has been hired to assist in the search for a new CEO.(Photo: Getty)
24;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-11-16T05:02:08Z;McDonald’s flips fortunes with back-to-basics approach;;It is the “dead zone” lull between lunch and dinner, yet McDonald’s is bustling with customers tapping their orders on huge screens. The Chicago store is acting as a blueprint for an overhaul of the world’s biggest fast-food chain in its biggest market. A glass case displays freshly baked apple pies and croissants. Smiling employees, dressed all in black, carry trays of burgers and fries to minimalist tables. “It doesn’t even smell like a McDonald’s,” says a colleague.When asked why he is spending $1.1bn to remodel thousands of US restaurants to mimic this one, Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, is interrupted by a customer who asks for his Instagram handle. “You have IG, right?”, he shouts, waving his iPhone. He is an aspiring photographer looking for social media followers, and his question answers mine — this is the consumer the 62-year-old burger chain is chasing.Mr Easterbrook, a soft-spoken British accountant, has worked at the fast-food chain for more than two decades. He took over in 2015 charged with reviving its reputation and regaining some of the half a billion customer orders it had lost in the US since 2012 and made it his mission to reinvent McDonald’s as a “modern, progressive burger company”.It is a phrase he used with investors when he first took the top job a month after the company reported its first annual drop in same-store sales in the US in 12 years. At the time observers declared the company, which helped define American diets, had lost its identity. Mr Easterbrook repeated the words throughout subsequent earnings calls.“That was sort of their North Star,” says Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bernstein. A former employee is more blunt, describing it as a “cliché phrase” that could mean “anything and everything”.However vague the plan remains, it does appear to be working. It is a challenging time for the US restaurant business. The industry has seen “little to no” growth in visits to restaurants in the past two years, according to market researchers NPD Group, while trade publication QSR declared last year the worst for restaurants since the financial crisis, after sales dropped sharply in the second half of the year. Grocery price deflation has made a stronger case for cooking at home, and a glut of restaurants has given people more choice if they do decide to go out.But after four years of shrinking traffic, McDonald’s this summer lured people back through its doors, posting a rise in customer visits in the second and third quarters. Comparable sales rose between 4 and 7 per cent each quarter this year. Investors have lauded Mr Easterbrook’s progress: the company’s share price has soared 70 per cent to $168 since he took over. The makeover has already been rolled out in much of Europe, with about one-third of French and German restaurants having been remodelled.McDonald’s feeds nearly 70m people every day, making the tale of how it dug itself out of “staggering” customer losses a case study for the business of eating. McDonald’s executives insist the success is built on a return to low prices and convenience, rather than chasing the whims of diners. With $25bn in annual sales and one of the most recognisable brands, the odds were in its favour to stage a comeback. But the way in which McDonald’s achieved it came as a surprise even to its own bosses.Back in 2014 the prevailing wisdom was that McDonald’s was being dethroned by new rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, in a sector dubbed “fast casual”. These outlets emerged after the financial crisis with price points a few dollars higher than traditional fast food, but with a perception that the food might be healthier.Growth in global same-store sales for McDonald’s had been hovering around zero for the past few years, with demand sagging across the US, Asia and Europe, before plunging more than 3 per cent towards the end of 2014. This compelled Don Thompson, then chief executive, to promise “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business.He pledged to slash costs by $300m and open fewer stores, before being replaced by Mr Easterbrook four months later. Its market share of US fast food slipped from 17.4 per cent in 2012 to 15.4 per cent in 2016, according to Euromonitor.Last year Mr Easterbrook hired Lucy Brady, a longtime Boston Consulting Group executive, to investigate what was going wrong. She led a wide-ranging study to dissect where people were eating. Her results, which Mr Easterbrook describes as “frustrating, but actually reassuring”, showed that the majority of the missing McDonald’s customers were going to other burger chains, such as Wendy’s and Burger King rather than rival fast casual outlets.Customers didn’t stop wanting fast food, they just didn’t want McDonald’s fast food. Mr Easterbrook’s response was to adapt the “modern progressive” doctrine and adopt a less aspirational focus: “the day-to-day basics”. This has materialised in cutting prices for coffee and soda, serving breakfast all day, offering mobile ordering and delivery, and improving the quality, if not the nutritional value, of its food.“To Steve’s credit, he is not stubborn,” says Larry Light, McDonald’s former chief marketing officer. “Instead of trying to come up with new kale and bean salads, fix the familiar. Fast food is not in decline, and I think it will always be the number one way the world eats.”McDonald’s share of the US fast food market last year, down from 17.4% in 2012The market capitalisation of the fast-food chain. Its share price has risen 70% since 2015People eat at McDonald’s every day. The company has 37,000 restaurants worldwideTo walk through the McDonald’s campus is to go back in time. Four levels of faded brick balconies envelope a 1970s atrium, making it feel more like a bare bones public library than the headquarters of a $136bn burger company. The group is about to shift its offices to downtown Chicago, where its neighbours will include the likes of Google, after six decades sprawled across 150 wooded acres in suburban Illinois.Since first opening in 1955, McDonald’s has billed itself as a place to eat cheaply. It embedded fast food into American diets as the US industrial farm system developed to make $1 cheeseburgers feasible.McDonald’s executives, former employees and analysts all agree that pricing is one reason the company has bled customers.“McDonald’s lost the plot on value,” says Ms Senatore. “After the company stopped marketing its dollar value menu in 2013, they never came up with anything that was equally compelling.” The dollar menu accounted for about 14 per cent of total US sales at the time.After keeping a lid on prices for years, rising commodity costs and wages put pressure on the independent franchisees who operate most of its 37,000 worldwide restaurants. They began increasing prices, which “destroyed the overall value message”, says Richard Adams, former director of franchising for the western US, who has since sold his restaurants and now consults for other franchisees. “They couldn’t advertise the dollar menu [nationally] because franchisees had raised prices way above that.”Wendy’s and Burger King churned out deals such as four items for $4, helping each preserve a market share of about 11 per cent of the US fast food market, while growth in smaller chains such as Sonic Burger and Jack in the Box loosened McDonald’s grip on the market.Some question the wisdom of the company’s decision to begin customising its menu by region in 2004. Mr Light, who led the effort, says it was internally “controversial” for a company who had codified its menu down to how many pickles are placed on different burgers.By 2014, facing fast casual insurgents, McDonald’s took it one stage further, offering mixed and sometimes awkward messages about its menu. The company put clementines into Happy Meals and avocado on chicken sandwiches, while still trying to tap into burger nostalgia with adverts mocking the new lifestyle trends. “There will never be kale here,” declared a 2015 advert for the Big Mac.Under Mr Easterbrook’s watch, the company has taken a “barbell approach” to its menu, beefing up its offers on both the low and high end of prices. Discounts are a core part of the Easterbrook ethos, with McDonald’s churning out $1 and $2 offers for coffee and soda.In a nod to more health conscious consumers the chain has also promised to strip antibiotics from its chicken meat and corn syrup from bread buns, replaced butter with margarine and is working towards using fresh beef in its Quarter Pounders.But can the food be cheap and higher quality? “It’s about balance,” says Mr Easterbrook. “You can’t just go all in on the premium end, because then you disenfranchise more price-driven customers.” A new “value menu” will be unveiled next year, with price points of $1, $2 and $3.The premium offerings are not necessarily healthy. Its maple-bacon dijon sandwich with buttermilk crispy chicken contains 740 calories and 1,780mg of sodium, nearly 80 per cent of the recommended daily intakes. “American palates have become more sophisticated,” says Ms Senatore. “It’s not necessarily about lower calories, it’s about using whole foods, and McDonald’s is playing to that. But fundamentally the food is still pretty indulgent.”Mr Easterbrook spent much of his tenure in the UK defending the golden arches’ image, going so far as to request the Oxford English Dictionary change its definition of the phrase McJob from “an unstimulating, low-paid job”. The OED refused. But his tactics paid off, and he was credited with reviving British sales in 2006.For decades the company has taken flak for its implied role in the global obesity crisis. Governments are stepping up their healthy eating campaigns, which analysts warn could threaten McDonald’s recovery.They caution that the company is not out of the woods. “We may have seen the end of market share losses,” say analysts at RBC. “[But] in the past, headlines related to the obesity epidemic have resulted in negative publicity for McDonald’s.”Any new regulations, such as mandated calorie counts, could “negatively impact margins”, they added. Still, analysts who cover McDonald’s remain bullish: more than two-thirds rate it as a “strong buy” even after its stock has already soared by more than 40 per cent in the past year.The trend towards organic, customised products has jolted large consumer groups from PepsiCo to Procter & Gamble. While fielding online questions ranging from “do you even sell real food?” to “do you use pink slime in your burgers?”, McDonald’s now assures customers that it uses freshly cracked eggs in its Egg McMuffins and ground pork shoulder in its McRib sandwiches.“One of the most significant changes for all businesses since the financial crisis is consumers are more demanding and expect to know more about you,” Mr Easterbrook says. “They are more questioning of all authority . . . you are no longer in control of your message.”Bernstein’s Ms Senatore says it is “hard to argue that they haven’t improved the perception among at least some customers”.“Two years ago the question was whether [Mr Easterbrook] could bring what he did in the UK to the US, because it was such a bigger market,” she says. “It turned out that he could.”Ten years after the global financial crisis, America’s lopsided recovery can be seen in restaurants across the country. Unemployment has reached historic lows and wages are slowly rising, but consumers are still cautious with their money. The compound annual growth rate for the US restaurant industry was 6.4 per cent from 1970 to 2007, but that rate has slowed to about 4.3 per cent a year since the crisis.As the gap has widened between income groups, middle-of-the-pack restaurant chains such as Chili’s and Applebee’s are now struggling. With higher price points and largely outdated menus, analysts say these “casual dining” restaurants, where a customer can buy dinner at the mall for about $15, are more likely to have been the losers of the rise of Chipotle rather than McDonald’s.Meanwhile, “the price part of value remains the greater part of the overall restaurant selection decision, particularly with lower income consumers”, says Bill Fahy of Moody’s.This has supported fast-food sales, which have been resilient even as a cut-throat battle has broken out in the $800bn US restaurant industry. Executives say there are simply too many restaurants, and a lot of them are mediocre. There are now more than 600,000 places to eat and drink in the US, which has grown at nearly double the rate of the population, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.One of the biggest offenders in overbuilding has been the shiny new trend “fast casual”, as more and more companies have tried to replicate Chipotle’s success.However, it seems supply has outpaced demand, with the number of fast casual restaurants growing by 9 per cent last year, while sales in the segment slipped two per cent.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 23,348 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 6,557.Earnings that fell slightly below Wall Street expectations also weighed on MarketAxess, the largest corporate bond trading platform in the US.The company’s stock price fell 6.4 per cent to $178.03, it’s biggest one-day decline in two years.The stock drop accompanied news that rival Intercontinental Exchange had agreed to buy fixed-income trading platform BondPoint from Virtu Financial for $400m.Shares in ICE also dipped on Wednesday, falling 0.4 per cent to $65.01. Virtu shares rose 1.2 per cent to $14.68 but remain down 9.3 per cent in October ahead of the company announcing earnings in early November.MarketAxess had also looked at acquiring BondPoint, according to people familiar with the bidding process.“We are very interested in acquisitions that will add important clients to our system, new systems or new geographies — this deal didn’t do any of those,” said Rick McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, speaking on the company’s earnings call on Wednesday morning in New York.It sets up the potential for ICE to go head to head with MarketAxess for a greater share of electronic corporate bond trading, said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James.But Mr McVey responded that the company had already weathered repeated challenges from both start-up venues and established players. “There is no sign of that changing,” he said.

27;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-10-24T20:29:08Z;Hurricanes, data breach bite into Chipotle earnings;;Chipotle shares crumbled in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the fast-casual burrito chain’s earnings badly missed expectations, a shortfall that the company blamed on fallout from a data breach and a pair of hurricanes that pummeled southeastern US states.The company — which has been trying to find its footing after a major food-safety crisis in 2015 — said that revenue for the three months ending September 30 was up 8.8 per cent from a year earlier to $1.13bn, in line with the expectations of analysts surveyed by Factset.However, profits were dented by charges related to a data breach announced earlier this year affecting some customers’ payment cards, as well as the impact from Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Net income was $19.6m for the quarter, or 69 cents per diluted share, well below the $47m, or $1.67 per diluted share, that Wall Street was looking for.Comparable-store sales, a key industry metric, rose 1 per cent, just shy of the 1.1 per cent increase analysts were expecting.Steve Ells, the company’s chief executive and founder, said in a statement:We continued to make important progress to improve the guest experience at our restaurants during the quarter. Our strategic initiatives in operations, innovating our digital sales platform, new menu introductions, and marketing the brand are starting to take hold. Despite several unusual impacts during the quarter, including the impact of hurricanes, we maintained our focus and saw some encouraging signs. Our leadership remains focused on setting the foundation for future growth, and we are confident in our teams’ ability to deliver against those plans.Despite Mr Ells’ positive spin, Chipotle on Tuesday softened its comparable restaurant sales guidance for 2017. Previously looking for an increase in the high single digits, the company said that it is now expecting a more moderate 6.5 per cent increase.Chipotle has been pulling out the stops to try to lure back customers following the food-safety issues, including the introduction of cheesy queso dip, which has received mixed reviews from customers. The company’s shares, which are down 14 per cent year to date, dropped more than 8 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement.
28;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-08-23T04:41:11Z;Panera spells out sugary drink details to customers;Sandwich chain uses cola cups listing teaspoons of sugar in move away from sodas;Panera is unveiling cups that list how many teaspoons of sugar have been added to drinks, as the sandwich company battles for the lunch money of more health-conscious American consumers.The new cups, which post sugar and calorie counts in large letters, reveal to customers that a 20oz serving of Pepsi, the cola Panera sells, has 17 teaspoons of sugar. This is more than double the sugar in Panera’s chocolate chip cookie, and also exceeds the daily limit of 12.5 teaspoons that the US government recommends.The move comes amid growing pressure from regulators and consumers for a reduction in sugar and salt, which are linked to obesity and diabetes.Panera has been a bright spot in an increasingly tough environment for eating out in the US. While traditional fast food stalwarts such as McDonald’s have grappled with a global shift in demand towards fresh food, Panera has benefited, with comparable sales growing between 4 and 5 per cent.This year JAB, the investment group backed by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, bought Panera for $7.5bn, a marker of how investors value so-called “fast casual” restaurants. Panera’s move comes ahead of new government requirements for all packaged food and drinks to label added sugars, with a compliance date of 2018 recently pushed back. However, the sugar requirements did not apply to restaurants. “It’s up to companies to take the lead on transparency, not wait for legislation,” said Ron Shaich, Panera chief executive.It’s up to companies to take the lead on transparency, not wait for legislationAnother piece of Obamacare legislation requiring restaurant chains with at least 20 stores to post calorie counts on menus has also been delayed. Panera and some other restaurants already list nutrition information on food menus, but drinks increasingly have been a target in the battle against obesity. The company aims to shift more customers away from sodas, and the decision to post sugar in teaspoons instead of grams was deliberate, said Mr Shaich: “the only people who know what grams are are drug dealers”. Panera in March unveiled a new line of drinks with less or no sugar added, and says that since then 8 per cent of customers have opted for these drinks over soda.US soda sales have been falling for more than a decade as sweet drinks have come under fire from regulators and health officials for contributing to obesity. This week Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other soft-drink makers agreed to limit the amount of sugar they use in beverages sold in Singapore. In the US, local governments in cities such as Seattle and Chicago have raised the idea of so-called soda taxes. Panera aims to roll out the cups across its 2,100 restaurants by next month. This year the Missouri-based company said it had stripped artificial ingredients from its food as part of a campaign to position itself as the healthier alternative to the likes of McDonald’s. McDonald’s has taken steps to stay relevant amid disruption by Panera and Chipotle. The world’s largest burger chain has removed artificial ingredients from chicken nuggets and said it would use fresh beef in quarter pounders. Shares in Panera have risen 46 per cent in the past year, while rival Chipotle’s stock has dropped 21 per cent.
29;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-07-26T14:53:24Z;Chipotle hit with subpoena over latest food-safety issue;;US prosecutors have served Chipotle with a subpoena related to a food-safety issue at one of its restaurants this month as part of an ongoing probe into the US burrito chain.The group said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it received the subpoena on July 19, “requesting information related to illness incidents associated with a single Chipotle restaurant in Sterling, Virginia.”The US attorney’s office for central California, in conjunction with the US Food and Drug Administration’s office of criminal investigations, initially served Chipotle with a subpoena last January.Chipotle intends to “fully cooperate” with the probe, and added that it is “not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur … any fines or penalties in connection with the investigation pursuant to which the subpoena was issued.”Local health regulators said on Monday that 135 individuals reported falling ill after visiting the Virginia Chipotle restaurant between July 13 – 16.“Two ill patrons have tested positive for the same strain of norovirus. Based on symptoms reported and these preliminary laboratory results, the cause of the outbreak is believed to be norovirus, though the specific source of the norovirus has not yet been identified,” Loudoun County Health Department chief David Goodfriend said.John Hartung, Chipotle’s chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday evening that same-restaurant sales, an important industry metric, had been “negatively affected” by about 5.5 per cent on average over the last several days.He added that “it is too soon to know what enduring impact last week’s events may cause,” but that the group’s “hope is that the impact will fade over the coming weeks and that the marketing and buzz around the queso expanded test will change the narrative and encourage our guests to quickly return to their previous visit frequencies.”Norovirus is a highly-contagious illness that can cause an individual’s stomach or intestines to become inflamed, causing symptoms like stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Chief executive Steve Ells apologised for the incident and said that it represented a “failure in one restaurant to comply with our procedures used to prevent norovirus.”The latest safety woes have reminded investors of a debacle in 2015 in which 485 people in 13 US states were sickened in outbreaks that were linked to Chipotle’s restaurants.Chipotle had been recovering, and in fact, its quarterly earnings that were disclosed on Tuesday exceeded analyst forecasts. The shares initially climbed, but then came under pressure by Wednesday morning, recently falling 1.3 per cent.
30;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-07-25T20:30:00Z;Chipotle maintains 2017 sales-growth forecast despite latest safety scare;;Burrito chain Chipotle is sticking with its previous forecast for comparable restaurant sales growth in the high single digits this year, even as it hopes to move quickly past the latest food-safety concerns linked to one of its restaurants.The company’s shares rose 2.5 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported better-than-expected profits during the three months ending June 30. Net income for the quarter was $66.7m, 161 per cent higher than the $25.6m income during the same period a year earlier, and better than the $62.3m that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.Diluted earnings per share also outstripped the year-ago period, coming in at $2.32, versus analysts’ expectations for $2.17. Revenue grew 17.1 per cent year-on-year to $1.17bn, a hair shy of the $1.18bn that Wall Street was looking for.Food costs ate up a slightly smaller share of its sales than the same period last year, the company said, with higher avocado costs offset by reduced costs from bringing preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back in-house, as well as higher menu prices that debuted in certain restaurants during the past quarter.Comparable restaurant sales, however, fell short of forecasts, clocking in at an 8.1 per cent gain, compared to expectations for a 9.5 per cent boost.Chipotle was once a rising star in the fast-casual dining sector until it took a hit from a food-safety crisis in 2015, when a series of multiple foodborne-illness outbreaks sickened dozens of people in 13 US states, spooking investors.Just as Chipotle seemed to be putting that behind it, another food-safety issue cropped up earlier this month when it temporarily shut down a restaurant in Virginia after reports that customers fell ill after eating there.Last month, Chipotle shares were also rattled by a warning it issued on marketing expenses, which raised concerns that its profit margins were under pressure. Nevertheless, in its report on Tuesday, Chipotle said that marketing and promotional expenses accounted for 3.7 per cent of sales, 70 basis points lower than the same quarter last year.Chipotle chief executive Steve Ells said in the release:We saw encouraging signs in our improved financial results during the first half of the year. Recent events, however, have shown that we still have a lot of opportunity to improve our operations and deliver the outstanding experience that our customers expect.The company, whose shares have fallen 22.5 per cent over the past 12 months, said it is still looking for comparable restaurant sales growth in the high single digits and plans to open between 195 and 210 new restaurants.

In the current quarter, it also expects shipments to be down 10 to 20 per cent from a year ago.Shares in the company fell 5.9 per cent to $48.95 by the close of trading.Second-quarter revenue decreased 5.6 per cent to $1.58bn, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.6bn. Investors were also disappointed after Harley said US retail motorcycle sales were down 9.3 per cent from a year ago.“We believe soft, used motorcycle prices adversely affected the industry new motorcycle sales in the quarter,” said chief financial officer John Olin on an earnings call. The used motorcycle market could pose a challenge for the company to meet its goal of adding 2m riders in the US by 2027.However, while, profits slid to $258.9m, or $1.48 a share, compared with $280.4m, or $1.55 a share, in the year ago period, they topped analysts’ expectations of $1.39 a share.The slump in Harley shares came alongside mixed trading for Wall Street. The S&P 500 gained less than 0.1 per cent to 2,460.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.3 per cent to 21,574.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 6,344.31.Financials were among the worst performing sectors, off 0.3 per cent following poorly received results from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. A Republican move to abandon their efforts to replace Obamacare also renewed investor concerns about President Donald Trump’s ability to deliver on his economic agenda.Elsewhere, investors also soured on Chipotle after the burrito chain said it temporarily closed one of its restaurants following reports that customers fell ill after eating there, reigniting memories of a painful food-safety scare in 2015.Jim Marsden, the group’s food safety chief, said that Chipotle was working with local health authorities to “understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible”.He added that the symptoms were consistent with a highly contagious illness called norovirus. The infection is generally spread through food, water or touching contaminated surfaces, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It causes unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms, ranging from stomach pain to diarrhoea and vomiting.“Norovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle. We plan to reopen the restaurant today,” Mr Marsden said.For investors, the incident hearkens back to the crisis the company faced in 2015 when a series of at least six outbreaks were thought to have caused sickness in 485 people across 13 US states.Chipotle shares dropped 4.3 per cent to $374.98 on Tuesday. They have yet to recover even close to the record closing high of $757.77 they struck in August 2015.

Other operating expenses, which include marketing costs along with a handful of other items, represented 4.1 per cent of revenues in the first quarter, according to regulatory filings.Other expenses jumped to 16.4 per cent of sales in 2016, from just 11.4 per cent the year prior as Chipotle launched an aggressive advertising campaign aimed at bringing customers back though its doors after its food-safety crisis in late 2015.Mark Kalinowsk of Nomura noted that he believes “continued investments will be required” to rev up sales growth this year and next. He cut his outlook for earnings per share for 2017 and 2018 and reduced his price target on the stock almost 6 per cent to $480 a share.Chipotle, once a Wall Street high flyer, came under intense pressure in late 2015 after a series of at least six food-safety outbreaks linked to the chain caused sickness in 485 people in 13 US states. The crisis weighed heavily on Chipotle’s sales and sent the stock plummeting from an all-time closing high in August 2015 of $757.77.Steve Ells, chief executive, has emphasised the group’s focus on better-quality ingredients as part of his bid to boost the customer experience and reinvigorate sales. As part of that push, Chipotle said in March that it rid the chain of any artificial colours, flavours and preservatives, something it claims no other US fast-food chain has accomplished.He has also launched programmes aimed at reducing employee turnover and boosting the levels of customer service provided by its workers.“I’m as optimistic as I’ve ever been since starting Chipotle nearly 24 years ago. Since last fall, when I acknowledged that many of our restaurants were not meeting my expectations, we have made incredible progress,” Mr Ells said in April of this year.Looking more broadly, after setting new intraday and closing highs on Monday the markets retreated, with the S&P 500 ending the day 0.7 per cent lower at 2,437. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which also notched new lifetime highs slipped 0.3 per cent to 21,467, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.8 per cent to 6,188.

35;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-04-25T20:42:29Z;Chipotle shares rise as comparable sales rebound sharply;;Chipotle’s comeback from a bruising food-safety crisis seems to be picking up steam, sending shares in the Mexican fast-casual eatery chain higher in after-hours trading on Tuesday.The company said that revenue for the quarter came in at $1.08bn, a 28.1 per cent increase from its dismal first quarter last year — when it was still suffering the ill effects of its food-safety issues — and ahead of analysts’ expectations for $1.05bn in sales.Comparable sales — a key industry metric — were up 17.8 per cent, better than the robust 15.4 per cent that Wall street had been looking for.Net income for the quarter ending March 31 was $46.1m, compared to a net loss of $26.4m during the year-ago quarter, translating to earnings per diluted share of $1.60 versus a net loss of 88 cents last year. That compared to Wall Street’s expectations for $37.8m profit and earnings per share of $1.29.The strong earnings initially sent Chipotle shares up 6.6 per cent in after-hours trading.However, the company said in its analyst conference call that it had hired a cyber security group to investigate “unauthorized activity on a network that supports payment processing” that it believes has since stopped. Shares gave up most of their gains as investors parsed the news.Steve Ells, the company’s founder, chairman and chief executive said:“2017 is off to a strong start, as our restaurant managers and teams are energized by our renewed focus on the customer. By simplifying the focus in our restaurants to only those elements that lead to a great guest experience, our operations have improved every single month, which gives us confidence that we are on our way to achieve our mission to ensure that great food made with whole unprocessed ingredients is accessible to everyone.”
37;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-03-28T19:37:08Z;Chipotle removes last preservatives from ingredient list;;Chipotle has banished preservatives from its tortillas as the US burrito chain that is in the midst of a rebound from a food-safety scare looks to bolster its appeal among ingredient-conscious diners.The Denver-based chain said it is now the only national restaurant brand with no added colours, flavours or preservatives in any of its ingredients, heightening the claims of its already popular ad campaign that emphasises quality ingredients.The Mexican-food inspired chain has been recovering from a 2015 food-safety debacle that sparked a deep decline in sales and sent its shares tumbling from all-time highs.The roll out of better ingredients through its “food with integrity” mission should enhance the appeal of Chipotle’s brand over time, according to analysts at Baird Equity Research. “Using such products results in better-tasting food and leverages a concept that is highly popular with consumers,” wrote David Tarantino, a senior research analyst.To drive sales in 2017 and beyond, Mr Tarantino said marketing and menu innovations would play a key role, especially in the group’s aim to win back customers.Chipotle disclosed a 4.8 per cent fall in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, representing a recovery from the 21.9 per cent drop in the previous three-month period. The group said in February that it expects the key sales metric to increase in the “high-single digits” this year.Shares in Chipotle, which are down 9.9 per cent over the past 12 months, gained 3.1 per cent on Tuesday to $427.74. They peaked at $758.61 in August 2015.
38;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-02-02T21:56:23Z;Chipotle shares dip as revenue falls just short of estimates;;Chipotle shares dipped 2.5 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday after it unveiled slightly softer-than-expected revenue from the past quarter, even as it reaffirmed its commitment to growing same-store sales in the new year.The company – which has been clawing its way back after a food-safety scare – said that revenue for the three-month period ending December 31 was $1bn, a hair shy of the $1.03bn that analysts had predicted, according to Bloomberg. Earnings per share were 55 cents, a penny short of the 56 cents a share targeted by Wall Street.The company attributed the modest revenue growth to the 72 new restaurants it had opened during the quarter. As it had previously announced, same-store sales for the full quarter had declined 4.8 per cent – although they had improved during that time from a 20.2 per cent decrease in October to a positive 14.7 per cent in December.Profits, however, slightly edged out expectations of $15.75m, coming in at $16m for the quarter but a steep decline from the year-ago period, when it clocked income of $67.9m. The company said that its food costs had crept up 150 basis points compared with the same quarter in 2015, with pricier avocados and more costly diced tomatoes partly offset by cheaper beef.Chipotle reaffirmed its outlook of single-digit comparable-store sales growth in 2017. Chief executive and founder Steve Ells said:“In the upcoming year we intend to continue to simplify and improve our restaurant operations, utilize creative marketing to rebuild our brand, and further the roll-out of our digital sales efforts. All three of these strategic initiatives are centered on improving the guest experience and restoring customer affinity for the Chipotle brand, and we are confident in our teams’ abilities as we start this new year.”
39;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-01-10T17:53:57Z;Chipotle shows signs of emerging from food safety crisis;Burrito chain’s shares rally as sales return to growth in December;Chipotle extended its 2017 share price rally on Tuesday as glimmers of hope emerged that the US burrito chain may finally be placing its food safety crisis behind it.The Colorado-based company said like-for-like sales swung from a drop of 20.2 per cent in October, to a fall of 1.4 per cent in November and growth of 14.7 per cent in December.While Chipotle cautioned that the rise was attributable to an easier comparison in the year-prior period, it marks one of the first indications that it may have stemmed the decline that has sent its shares plummeting by almost 45 per cent from a record high recorded in August 2015.Chipotle, once a Wall Street high flyer, was pounded in 2016 as sales fell when it struggled to recover from the aftershocks of a tainted food debacle in the previous year that caused sickness in 485 people in 13 US states.The reverberations are still hitting Chipotle’s profits, however. The restaurant that is known for its Mexican-inspired dishes said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of 50-58 cents a share, nearly half Wall Street expectations of 96 cents.Chipotle said it spent more than it expected on promotions and on testing television advertisements. An increase in the price of avocados also took a toll.The shares rose 5.7 per cent on Tuesday to $417.52, and have risen more than a tenth since the end of 2016.
40;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2017-01-10T13:14:53Z;Chipotle warns Q4 results to miss Wall St estimates;;Chipotle on Tuesday disclosed preliminary figures indicating that its fourth-quarter results will miss Wall Street expectations as the US burrito chain faced higher-than-expected promotional expenses and was stung by rising avocado prices.The Colorado-based company said that its like-for-like sales declined by 4.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2016. Analysts were expecting a fall of 3.7 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.Shares skidded by 3.9 per cent in pre-market trading, which would cut its gains since the end of 2016.The decline in sales comes as the company that is famous for its guacamole and other Mexican-inspired dishes attempts to turn itself around from a food-safety crisis last year.Chipotle said its expects to post fourth quarter sales of $1.035bn, shy of forecasts calling for $1.049bn. Meanwhile, profits are expected to be in the range of 50 – 58 cents a share, also missing the consensus call for 96 cents.The chain said that it spent more than it had originally expected on promotions and on testing television advertisements. An increase in the price of avocados also hit its bottom line.On an upbeat note, Chipotle’s like-for-like sales swung from a fall of 20.2 per cent in October, to a decline of 1.4 per cent in November and a rise of 14.7 per cent in December. The company pegged the shift on easier comparisons to lower sales levels in the year-prior period.
41;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-12-16T18:45:50Z;Chipotle bows to pressure from Bill Ackman with board shake-up;US burrito chain names four new directors as it looks to stem sales decline;Chipotle, the US burrito chain whose sales have tumbled since a food safety scare last year, has shaken up its board of directors as part of an agreement with activist investor Bill Ackman.Denver-based Chipotle on Friday named four new directors to its board, two of whom are longtime allies of Mr Ackman.The pact comes as Chipotle has struggled to stem a sharp decline in sales that was prompted by a number of incidents of food contamination last year that caused sickness in 485 people across 13 US states.Steve Ells, Chipotle chief executive, said the changes strengthened “our board of directors, and gives us the oversight, accountability and leadership we need as we continue our efforts to re-establish Chipotle as the leader we have been for much of our history”.This week, Mr Ells, who founded the group in 1993 and is also the board chairman, was named as sole chief executive after co-CEO Monty Moran stepped down.Pershing Square, the activist hedge fund run by Mr Ackman, disclosed in September that it had a nearly 10 per cent stake in the company, making it Chipotle’s biggest shareholder.As part of the deal, Pershing, known for its heated rhetoric about the companies in which it is trying to agitate change, agreed to not make disparaging remarks for at least two years, according to a filing with US securities regulators. Pershing also will not raise its stake in Chipotle to more than 12.9 per cent without approval from the company’s board.“We are pleased that Chipotle has taken the important step of refreshing its board which will position the company for continued growth and long-term success,” said Mr Ackman. “We look forward to working with the board and management to create sustained value for all shareholders for many years to come.”Among the new directors is Ali Namvar, a Pershing partner who has been with the group since 2006 and Matthew Paull, a former McDonald’s chief financial officer who is on Pershing’s advisory panel and the board of Air Products, one of the fund’s portfolio companies.Paul Cappuccio, chief legal officer at Time Warner and Liberty Global executive Robin Hickenlooper have also been appointed.Shares in Chipotle, once a Wall Street high flyer, have dived from their record high of $757.77 last August as investors have grown impatient with the company’s sales performance. Shares rose 2.7 per cent to $392.55 on Friday morning.Same-store sales for the three months to the end of September slumped 21.9 per cent, the fourth-straight double-digit revenue fall for a company that had previously never reported a drop in the metric since its 2006 initial public offering.The rate of decline has slowed since peaking at nearly 30 per cent in the first three months of 2016. However, Mr Ells spooked investors this month by warning that he was still “not satisfied with the rate of recovery” and that sales have remained “uneven” and “difficult to predict”.Additional reporting by Stephen Foley

The pact comes as Chipotle has struggled to stem a sharp decline in sales that has come after a string of food-safety issues last year sickened 485 people in 13 US states.“The addition of these new directors strengthens our Board of Directors, and gives us the oversight, accountability and leadership we need as we continue our efforts to reestablish Chipotle as the leader we have been for much of our history,” said Steve Ells, chief executive.Pershing Square disclosed in September a nearly 10 per cent stake in the company.

Mr Moran is also stepping down from his board seat and is retiring next year.Steve Ells, founder and chief executive, will continue on as the sole chief executive as well as chairman.Chipotle is attempting to bounce back from a food safety crisis last year linked to its restaurants that sickened dozens in multiple states.Chipotle’s operations have in recent years become “overcomplicated”, Mr Ells said in a statement on Monday. He also announced that he would be looking into employee incentives more closely linked to improving customer experience, an area in which he recently said he believed the restaurant chain was lagging behind.From a year ago, Chipotle’s shares have fallen more than 32 per cent, closing on Monday at $382.48. Its woes have attracted the attention of Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by billionaire Bill Ackman, which disclosed it had taken a 9.9 per cent stake in the company.In another executive shake-up, shares in Alexion Pharmaceuticals dropped 12.9 per cent to $115.08 after the Connecticut-based biotechnology group said its chief executive and chief financial officer had resigned.Chief executive David Hallal, who has been in that role since 2015, was leaving with immediate effect, the company said. David Brennan, previously chief executive of British drugmaker AstraZeneca and a member of Alexion’s board, will take over as interim chief. Meanwhile, chief financial officer Vikas Sinha will be replaced by David Anderson, the former CFO of Honeywell.The departures come a month after Alexion said it would delay its quarterly filing in order to investigate allegations of improper sales practices related to its top-selling drug Soliris, which treats a rare blood disease. That investigation is “nearing completion”, the company said on Monday, and has not yet identified any facts that require updating its previously reported results.US aerospace group Lockheed Martin found itself on the receiving end of a tweet from US president-elect Donald Trump on Monday morning, who said that its F-35 fighter jet programme and cost “is out of control”. The message sent Lockheed’s shares down 5.2 per cent to $245.95, and rattled stocks of some other big defence contractors. Its shares later recovered some ground and closed down 2.5 per cent at $253.11. BAE Systems shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $30.36, Northrop Grumman declined 2.7 per cent to $232.07 and Raytheon fell 1.7 per cent to $143.81.The big US stock indices were relatively calm on Monday after trading in record territory after the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained another 0.2 per cent to 19,796, buoyed by energy stocks surging on the back of rising oil prices.

He will leave his co-chief executive seat immediately, along with his seat on the company’s board, and retire from the company next year, Chipotle said in a statement.Mr Ells, a classically trained chef who founded Chipotle 23 years ago, will continue on as the sole chief executive as well as the company’s chairman, in a move designed to streamline its corporate leadership as it attempts to bounce back from a food-safety crisis last year linked to its restaurants that sickened dozens in multiple states.Chipotle’s operations have in recent years become “over-complicated,” Mr Ells said in a statement on Monday. “I’m very much looking forward to relentlessly focusing on ensuring an excellent guest experience, removing unnecessary complexity from our operations, championing innovation and pursuing our mission of making better food accessible to more people.”Mr Ells also announced that he would be looking into employee incentives more closely linked to improving customer experience, an area in which he recently said the restaurant chain was lagging. Failure to deliver a solid guest experience would harm Chipotle’s efforts to lure customers back to the store, and “needlessly slow” its recovery from the recent foodborne-illness outbreaks linked to its stores, Mr Ells told investors earlier this month at a conference in New York.Compared to a year ago, Chipotle’s shares have fallen more than 31 per cent as it attempts to make up lost ground. The company’s third-quarter results showed same-store sales had declined 21.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis during that three-month period, and it said it hopes to pare its losses in coming months and return to single-digit growth by next year.Chipotle’s woes have attracted the attention of Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by billionaire Bill Ackman, which disclosed it had taken a 9.9 per cent stake in the company.

47;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-10-25T21:01:55Z;Chipotle’s woes deepen as it struggles to lure back customers;;Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday showed that it has not yet managed to turn the corner from a food-safety crisis that started nearly a year ago, with same-store sales sliding more than forecast in the third quarter.Same-store sales were down 21.9 per cent in the three-month period ending September 30, the company announced after the market closed. Although it has staunched the rate of bleeding compared to the first two quarters of 2016, the decline in same-store sales was steeper than the 18.7 per cent slide predicted by analysts.Revenue also failed to meet analysts’ target, coming in at $1.04bn, compared to analysts’ predictions of $1.09bn and down 14.8 per cent from the third quarter of 2015.Chipotle blamed the continued slide on falling same-store sales as well as deferral of $11.5m in revenue related to unredeemed awards from its Chiptopia customer loyalty programme. Comparable restaurant transactions, meanwhile, were down 15.2 per cent in the past quarter, primarily due to the lower number of transactions per restaurant and cheques that were smaller than average, the company said.Third-quarter net income was $7.8m, equating to $0.27 per diluted share and well below the $45.6m in profit and $1.55 per share predicted by analysts. The company said profits were dented by a deferral it took in connection with the unredeemed Chiptopia rewards and an impairment charge connected to its ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants.Chipotle is still working to rebuild sales after customers were rattled by foodborne-illness outbreaks linked to its stores, which have sickened 485 people in 13 US states. It is also fighting against a generally sluggish environment for fast-casual restaurants.“After successfully implementing an industry leading food safety programme, and as our marketing efforts are driving more people to our restaurants, it is critical that we are prepared to delight customers on every visit,” said co-chief executive Monty Moran.Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by billionaire Bill Ackman recently revealed a 9.9 per cent stake in the company, saying it believed its stock was undervalued and an “attractive investment.”Chipotle said it still expects to reach the high end of its projected range of 220-235 new restaurant openings by the end of the year, and to pare comparable restaurant sale losses to the single-digits in the coming quarter, and to be back in the black with single-digit growth next year. The company’s shares, which have fallen 37 per cent from a year earlier, were down another 2 per cent in after-hours trading.
48;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-09-07T17:14:07Z;Chipotle shares jump as Ackman builds 9.9% stake;Investors hope billionaire activist will help rejuvenate beleagueredburrito chain;Dissident investors in Chipotle welcomed Pershing Square’s investment in the burrito chain on Wednesday, as the company’s shares jumped following disclosure from the activist group that it had built a 9.9 per cent stake.CtW Investment Group, which represents union pension funds, said it hoped billionaire Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square would act as a “catalyst” for a turnround at the company, adding that the board “desperately needs new leadership” including an independent chair to ensure accountability to shareholders.“The board ignored its shareholders for too long, and we hope Ackman will be a catalyst for a strategic turnround that creates long-term value, not just a push for financial engineering that boosts the stock price for the short term,” said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director at CtW.Chipotle’s shares gained 5.9 per cent to $438.45 on Wednesday in New York, still 42.1 per cent below its peak last August before a food scare that sickened more than 400 people across 13 US states sent its sales into a tailspin.Chipotle had its first phone conversation with Mr Ackman on Wednesday and the company expects to meet him directly soon.Pershing Square, which is nursing losses from its investment in drugmaker Valeant, is expected to push for corporate governance changes and operational improvements, rather than a financial restructuring or a sale of the company.In contrast to some activist campaigns, which begun with hostile letters detailing managerial failings, Mr Ackman’s regulatory filing was notable for its praise of the company, which it said had “a strong brand, differentiated offering, enormous growth opportunity, and visionary leadership”. It added that the company’s stock was undervalued.The move by Pershing adds a twist in Chipotle’s slow story of recovery, where comparable store sales, a key metric for measuring growth, are still dropping double digits on a quarterly basis, despite moves by management to introduce loyalty programmes, such as Chiptopia, and better food safety procedures to lure back consumers.Chipotle said in a statement late on Tuesday that it welcomed the investment and confidence Pershing had in the company. But analysts did not greet the news as some sort of panacea for the company.“We see no quick fix to what Chipotle really needs — a revitalisation of top-line [growth],” said Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass. “But the presence of a large and vocal investor may provide management more incentive to hasten their turnround efforts, which appear to have stalled, and could cause the shorts to cover, at least for now.”Mr Ackman has experience investing in quick service restaurant chains, including McDonald’s and Burger King.And following a shareholder protest earlier this year over the board’s response to the company’s crisis, there is an empty seat on the board.RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar, said: “At minimum, Ackman could propose board changes. [The board] has been a valid concern.” He added that he expects proposals for new restaurant formats — possibly drive-thrus — permanent loyalty programmes and “some sort of franchising”, as well as adding debt to the company.Some analysts were baffled by Pershing’s investment in the burrito fast casual chain. The team at Stifel, led by Paul Westra, headlined its note to clients: “Pershing Position Creates Excellent Selling Opportunity”.Howard Penney, managing director at Hedgeye Risk Management, said he was surprised that Pershing had invested ahead of the outcome of a criminal investigation.
49;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-09-07T10:33:40Z;Bill Ackman’s Pershing reveals Chipotle stake;Hedge fund expected to push for operational improvements as chain recovers from food safety problems;Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by billionaire investor Bill Ackman, on Tuesday unveiled a stake in Chipotle and said it plans to pursue talks with the US burrito chain.The hedge fund is expected to push for corporate governance changes and operational improvements as Chipotle recovers from food safety problems, rather than a financial restructuring or a sale of the company.In contrast to some activist campaigns, which are begun with hostile letters detailing managerial failings, Mr Ackman’s regulatory filing was notable for its praise of the company, which it said had “a strong brand, differentiated offering, enormous growth opportunity, and visionary leadership”.Pershing said that it had taken a 9.9 per cent stake in the group and that it believed the stock was “undervalued and is an attractive investment”.Chipotle said: “We welcome their investment, and appreciate the confidence they’ve expressed in our brand.”The company, once a Wall Street high-flyer, came under pressure last year after a string of food safety scares that affected more than 400 people across 13 US states sent its sales and stock price reeling. It closed on Tuesday at $414.07, from a record high of $757.77 in August 2015.Same-store sales, a key metric, plummeted 23.6 per cent in the three months ending in June, the third straight quarter of declines that halted a streak of increases that even stretched through the 2008 financial crisis.Co-chief executive Steve Ells has vowed to turn the chain round by bolstering food safety procedures and launching programmes aimed at getting customers back through its doors. For instance, Chipotle unveiled a loyalty scheme called Chiptopia and launched back-to-school specials aimed at parents and students.Shareholders have raised concerns over the quality of directors’ response to the crisis, however, and staged one of the largest protest votes at a US company this year when more than 30 per cent withheld support for the re-election of the chair of the board’s governance committee. In response, the company said it is searching for at least one new board member.Chipotle shares jumped 5.8 per cent to $438 in after-hours trading.
50;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-07-22T20:21:11Z;Boeing shares slide on Dreamliner charge;Chipotle higher after hinting at recovery;Boeing shares fell on Friday after the blue-chip aerospace group said it will take a $2.1bn second-quarter charge related to its Dreamliner programme and other initiatives it has had to reassess.The Chicago-based group said that it had decided not to invest in refurbishing two 787 test aircraft that it produced in 2009 and have remained unsold. As a result, Boeing said it would take an $847m charge and shift the expense to its research and development unit.In addition, Boeing said that it planned to continue making 747-8 aircraft at a rate of 0.5 a month, and no longer increase the rate to 1 a month in 2019 to “account for current and anticipated weakness in the air cargo market”. That move will prompt Boeing to take an $814m charge that “reflects a lower estimated total of 747-8 freighter aircraft to be produced in the programme accounting quantity and lower estimated revenues on future aircraft sales”.Finally, the company will also recognise a $393m charge related to its KC-46 tanker, an aircraft that will be used by the US Air Force for mid-air refuelling of its air assets. The programme had run into technical challenges that also prompted Boeing to take a charge in the first quarter.The company is due to report its full second-quarter earnings figures on July 27.After falling more than 1.5 per cent at one stage on Friday, Boeing’s shares recovered, closing little changed at $133.45, bringing their year-to-date decline to 7.7 per cent.Elsewhere, Chipotle shares were in the black after the US burrito chain hinted at a nascent recovery from a painful sales decline sparked by a food safety scare that formally came to an end in February.Same-store sales, an important metric for food chains, were down 21 per cent in July compared with the prior year, said Steve Ells, co-chief executive. While the figure highlights the struggle the group, once a fast food darling, faces in attempting to right the ship, it points to a recovery from the 23.6 per cent same-store sales decline in the quarter to June 30, and the 29.7 per cent decline in the period before that.Mr Ells also said he was “optimistic” that the new Chiptopia rewards programme would “encourage more guests to visit our restaurants and that this will help lead to a sustained higher sales recovery”.Wall Street analysts offered a mixed assessment of Chipotle’s recovery attempt.“Chipotle’s issues remain unchanged and despite the progress management has made with its supply chain and with its efforts to aggressively reach out to its customers (through marketing, promotions and a loyalty programme), sales traction has been slower to materialise than the company has hoped for,” said Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.However, Jeff Farmer at Wells Fargo noted that the earnings release and the conference call with executives “offered far more bullish than bearish commentary [and] guidance on several key areas of investor debate”.Chipotle’s shares rose 5.8 per cent on Friday to $442.30, but are still down 39 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 reached a new high, up 0.5 per cent at 2,175, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 18,570.9 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 5,100.2.
51;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-03-09T22:05:02Z;Chipotle shares slide after restaurant closure;Fast-food chain’s shares have declined 26% since the beginning of last year;Chipotle shares suffered a blow on Wednesday after the Mexican fast-food restaurant said a Massachusetts restaurant was temporarily closed after it learnt that four of its employees had fallen sick.News that Chipotle’s restaurant in Billerica, Massachusetts, was closed for a “full sanitisation” after employees got sick pushed shares in the Denver-based company 3.5 per cent lower to $506.50. None of the employees worked while they were sick, the company said.“Any employees who reported feeling ill will be held out of the restaurant until they fully recover,” a company spokesman said in a statement.Chipotle has worked to win back customers since it came under scrutiny late last year after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was investigating an E. coli outbreak linked to its restaurants. The company’s shares were rattled further after a norovirus outbreak made students in Boston ill.The food-safety scares triggered its first year-on-year decline in quarterly sales since at least 2006, and sparked a federal probe.Chipotle shares have declined 26 per cent since the beginning of last year.Elsewhere, shares in Darden Restaurants advanced 3.6 per cent to $66.93, after the company behind Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse provided an upbeat profit outlook for its fiscal third quarter and named a new chief financial officer.The Florida-based company said it expected adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $1.18 to $1.21, above analysts’ estimates for $1.06 a share.Meanwhile, same-store sales are estimated to increase 6 per cent for the quarter, which is partly affected by the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. On a comparable calendar basis they are expected to rise 4 per cent.The company also said Ricardo Cardenas had been appointed chief financial officer effective immediately, replacing Jeffrey Davis. Mr Cardenas recently served as chief strategy officer for Darden.Activist investor Starboard Value took control of the company last year with 12 seats on the board. Under Starboard, Darden has made efforts to lower expenses and revamp its menu at Olive Garden in an effort to attract more customers.Groupon shares fell more than 10 per cent to $4.11, after analysts at UBS downgraded the US coupon company to “sell” from “neutral” and maintained their $3.20 price target.While Groupon has showed signs of progress “there is still a long road ahead in strengthening the company’s positioning in the local ad and/or local ecommerce market,” said Eric Sheridan, an analyst at UBS.Moreover, he noted that companies such as Google and Facebook are stepping up efforts to “capture local ad dollars” and that “in light of Amazon’s increasing efforts in the same-day delivery space, we believe the benefit of a ‘local’ marketplace is diminished over the longer term”.Mr Sheridan also downgraded shares of review website Yelp to “sell” from “neutral” sending shares of the review website 3 per cent lower to $20.47.At the close, the S&P 500 was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,989, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 0.2 per cent to 17,000 and the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.6 per cent to 4,674.A rally in oil prices propelled energy shares 1.5 per cent higher, with the sector leading the benchmark S&P 500.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
52;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-02-23T21:38:14Z;Chipotle shares slip on sell call;Bank says US burrito chain at risk of ‘permanent’ loss of customers after food-safety crisis;Chipotle Mexican Grill slipped lower on Tuesday after Deutsche Bank advised selling the stock over concerns the US burrito chain could face a “permanent” loss of customers following its recent food-safety crisis.A string of scares linked to Chipotle last year that left 500 people ill caused the company’s stock price to collapse by more than half from a record high in August 2015.But the shares have since rebounded by about 30 per cent from their low on January 16, as US food regulators said a duo of E.coli outbreaks had ended and Chipotle launched a marketing campaign to strengthen customer loyalty.However, Deutsche isn’t so certain the once high-flying chain is out of the woods. “Ongoing challenges do not bode well for a swift and robust recovery,” Karen Short, an analyst at Deutsche, wrote in a report.Ms Short said she remained “concerned with the potential permanent loss of customers [from changes in brand perception or increased competition] as a result of these issues”.Deutsche Bank is the only big Wall Street investment bank that has a “sell” rating on the stock, Bloomberg data show.Chipotle’s shares dipped 0.3 per cent to $524.54 and are down 21.8 per cent over the past 12 months.Meanwhile, Home Depot shares rose after it unveiled a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly sales and profits as the US home improvement retailer benefited from a robust housing market.The Atlanta-based company said sales climbed 9.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the quarter through to January 31 to $21bn. Meanwhile, earnings rose to $1.5bn, or $1.17 a share, from $1.4bn, or $1.05 a share, in the same quarter the previous year.Adam Samson reports on US burrito chain Chipotle’s food-safety woes and interviews a restaurant-industry consultant on steps companies can take to avoid similar issues.Wall Street had expected profits of $1.10 a share on sales of $20.4bn.The blue-chip company also said it expected revenues to rise 5.1 per cent — 6 per cent in the current fiscal year, topping forecasts.Home Depot has benefited from a strong housing market that has lured consumers who have been skittish about spending on items such as clothing and electronics to invest in home repairs and upgrades.The group climbed 1.4 per cent to $124.53, trimming larger gains amid a pullback in the broader market.Energy shares, meanwhile, fell sharply after Saudi Arabia’s influential oil minister warned the oil producer was “not banking on [supply] cuts”.The comments from Ali al-Naimi throw cold water on hopes that big producers may act to stabilise the price of crude amid a glut of global supply.The S&P 500 energy index dropped 3.2 per cent as US crude oil prices slid 4.6 per cent to $31.87 a barrel.Among the energy laggards was exploration and production company Marathon Oil, which fell 6.1 per cent to $7.03 a share. ExxonMobil, the biggest US energy company, declined 1.4 per cent to $81.23.At the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 1.3 per cent to 1,921.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1 per cent to 16,431.8 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5 per cent to 4,503.6.The broad decline for Wall Street came in stark comparison to the rally in the previous session. The energy sector logged the heaviest losses on Tuesday, but every other big S&P 500 sector, bar utilities, was in the red as well.
53;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-02-05T18:07:40Z;Chipotle founder Steve Ells forced to rework recipe for success;Co-chief is confident his burrito chain can recover from food safety concerns;Steve Ells, Chipotle’s founder and co-chief executive, built his Mexican burrito chain into a company with a $14.4bn market value under the banner “food with integrity”, as he pursued the use of humanely and sustainably produced ingredients.But Chipotle’s integrity when it comes to food safety was called into question last year after outbreaks of E. coli, norovirus and salmonella at Chipotle restaurants across 13 states left hundreds of customers ill — with some being hospitalised. This week, the company posted its first year-on-year drop in quarterly sales in at least a decade.For Mr Ells, who once boasted of being “the best in the world” at sourcing and cooking “really great ingredients”, the challenge ahead is stark — shares in his company are down nearly 40 per cent since August.Once dubbed “the burrito billionaire” — his stake in Chipotle is now worth less than a fifth of that — Mr Ells took a circuitous route into fast food.After studying art history at University of Colorado and attending the Culinary Institute of America, he initially sought work in fine dining as a sous chef under Jeremiah Tower at Stars restaurant.He dreamt of opening his own upmarket establishment, but decided to start smaller, with a simple restaurant that could serve as a “cash cow” for a grander project. Taking inspiration from San Francisco’s taquerias, he borrowed money from his father, a pharmaceuticals executive, and launched Chipotle in 1993.His burritos concept — providing quality ingredients in a fast-casual restaurant — proved so popular that 22 years have passed and he has never opened that upmarket restaurant. The chain eventually won financial backing from McDonald’s and then it listed in New York a decade ago. There are now more than 2,000 Chipotles across the US, with a small number in Canada and Europe as well.Mr Ells has also started an Asian-themed chain called Shophouse and is expanding a pizza chain — Pizzeria Locale — which has the same concept as Chipotle — take the base, choose the toppings and watch it being made as you queue.“We’re having more of an impact on the way people eat than I ever would have had if I’d stuck with my original plan,” he told a Denver magazine two years ago.Mr Ells, 49, struck a humbler note this week, describing Chipotle’s fourth quarter as “without question the most challenging in our history”.Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak has been declared over, but the company is co-operating with a federal criminal investigation. It also faces civil lawsuits and frightened customers.“It has been our aim to serve our guests food that is safe, delicious and wholesome, but the events of the last few months have shown us that we need to do better,” he said.Chipotle is completely reworking its food safety measures, but there are questions over Mr Ells’ communication strategy. Although the company responded to separate instances of E. coli, norovirus and salmonella in the third quarter of last year, it failed to announce a comprehensive response until November, after a multi-state outbreak of E. coli.“It’s really shallow to have communicated the way they did,” said Darin Detwiler, senior policy co-ordinator at Stop Foodborne Illness.Mr Ells and his team face an enormous task as they seek to woo back customers, at a time when monthly sales had already started to slow.Karen Short, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote: “This situation is unprecedented — no concept has been so loved and so abandoned.”But Mr Ells told analysts he was confident: “With our enhanced food safety programme, we are poised to emerge stronger than ever before.”
54;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-02-03T21:39:10Z;Chipotle shares burnt by earnings warning for current quarter;US energy stocks outperform as oil prices jump;Chipotle fell on Wednesday after the embattled US burrito chain warned it may not earn a profit in the current quarter and said an official investigation into a string of food-safety issues is broader than initially thought.Denver-based Chipotle posted its first year-on-year drop in quarterly sales since at least 2006 in the fourth quarter as customers responded to an E. coli outbreak linked to its restaurants that surfaced in early November. The E. coli issue was part of a wider series of six outbreaks that made 487 people sick last year.The company, led by Steve Ells, has vowed to become an industry leader in food safety and is launching a big marketing push aimed at getting customers back through its doors.However, those efforts will come at a higher price than some analysts forecast. Chipotle said in a conference call late on Tuesday that it is likely to break even in the current quarter, compared with Wall Street estimates of profits of $1.95 a share.The chain, which is famous for its Mexican-inspired eats that are advertised as fresher than offerings at fast food rivals, is also facing an investigation into its handling of food safety issues. The US Attorney for the Central District of California has issued a subpoena for Chipotle to “produce documents and information related to company-wide food safety matters dating back to January 1, 2013”, the company said in a statement.Chipotle’s shares dropped 2.9 per cent to $461.74 on Wednesday and have tumbled 35 per cent over the past 12 months.Still, many Wall Street analysts remain bullish on the stock: 40.6 per cent of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg have a “buy” rating on Chipotle. Jeffrey Farmer, an analyst at Wells Fargo, actually increased his rating on Chipotle to “outperform” from “market perform” on Wednesday.Mr Farmer said in a note to clients that history has shown sales growth often returns 12-15 months after a food-safety incident.“While the E.coli pushback has been severe, Chipotle has among the most fervent customer bases in the industry,” he said, noting he sees like-for-like sales improving “more quickly than expected” in the second half of this year.Elsewhere, energy shares outperformed as the price of crude oil raced higher. US crude jumped 8.6 per cent to $32.46 a barrel as the US dollar slid 1.7 per cent against a basket of global currencies. A weaker US currency is generally bullish for the price of dollar-denominated commodities.Murphy Oil, an exploration and production company, jumped 10.5 per cent to $19.26 a share. Kinder Morgan, a large pipeline operator, rallied 6.5 per cent to $15.60 a share. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil company, climbed 5.2 per cent to $78.47.On the other side of the spectrum, banks came under further pressure after weak data on the US services sector once again pushed back expectations for when the Federal Reserve will next increase interest rates.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,912.53, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.1 per cent to 16,336.66 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 4,504.24.
55;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-01-13T16:53:16Z;Chipotle’s food safety concerns turn viral;US restaurant chain’s link to illness outbreaks sparks federal probe and roils share price;Chipotle Mexican Grill, the US restaurant chain that has built a $4bn-a-year empire on burritos and guacamole, is facing a crisis that has struck at its core: a string of food-safety scares that have hit sales hard, sparked a federal probe and roiled its stock market value.The company has been linked to at least six outbreaks of illnesses last year that caused sickness in 485 people in 13 US states, according to an analysis of data collected from local, state and federal health authorities.Linda Harris, a professor of food safety at the University of California, said the number of outbreaks at Chipotle in one year was “mind boggling”.The first three food-safety issues initially did little to dent bullish sentiment in Chipotle. The stock reached a record closing high of $757.77 on August 5, a huge increase from its $22 initial public offering price in 2006, valuing the Mexican-style food chain at $23.6bn.But in early November, a far broader scare hit the headlines: an outbreak of a strain of E.coli that affected 39 people, most of whom ate at one of several Chipotle restaurants in Washington and Oregon.The food-safety woes escalated as the year came to a close, and this time investors, and diners, took notice.When asked if Chipotle management feels it should have tackled the food-safety issues more quickly, a company spokesperson said: “It is natural to second-guess practices after incidents like these, and no one is taking a harder look at what we are doing than we are.”Chipotle said last week that same-store sales tumbled 30 per cent in December from the same month in 2014, and warned “future sales trends may be significantly influenced by further developments”.Chipotle’s stock has dropped nearly 53.3 per cent and shed $10.9bn in market value since its August peak amid uncertainty over how long it will take for the company to get to grips with the issue.The chain also disclosed last week a federal grand jury subpoena regarding a criminal investigation related to its California store that faced a Norovirus outbreak.Chipotle now faces a battle to win back investor confidence and restore its image among customers.Founded in 1993, Chipotle has benefited from shifting consumer appetites away from traditional fast-food to options that are seen as fresher and healthier.It has become known for its simple menu of burritos, tacos and other Mexican-style food served with an array of add-ons, like guacamole and salsa, all made from what the company calls “better ingredients”.Customers can peer into open kitchens, where staff members use “classic cooking techniques” to whip up big batches of food.Until recently, the model has worked: same-store sales rose every year in the decade up to 2014, according to data from Bloomberg. Chipotle has also rapidly expanded, with its store count rising to 1,931 from 298 in 2003.But the very principles that propelled Chipotle are now causing it trouble.Ms Harris said the methods of food preparation at Chipotle that are designed to mimic traditional restaurants put it at a greater risk for the spread of foodborne illness.The chain vowed in early December to be at “the forefront of food safety protocols in the restaurant industry”. Among the plans the chain has outlined are enhanced food testing, improved food-handling procedures within stores and more robust training for employees.Diners at Chipotle are certainly cognisant of the food-safety issue, with about 72 per cent of those who have eaten at the restaurant over the past 12 months responding in a recent Morgan Stanley survey that they were aware of the company’s troubles.What is less clear is just how much of a long-term toll the problems are taking on Chipotle’s brand. Morgan Stanley said in a note accompanying the survey results that “perception of quality, taste, value, and freshness” had not changed dramatically in the wake of the incidents.Wall Street analysts have grown more cautious on the stock in recent weeks, although few recommend selling the stock that has rallied an average of 45.4 per cent annually since 2007 — even including the late-2015 sell-off.“Investors encounter a difficult conundrum with Chipotle shares to determine the length of time and trajectory of recovery from E.coli issues, with risk the recovery will be choppy,” Andrew Charles, an analyst at Cowen, said in a note to clients last week.
56;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2016-01-06T18:01:31Z;Chipotle slips on same-store sales setback;But energy sector is the worst performer on benchmark of US stocks;Chipotle shares were punished on Wednesday after the company said that a key sales metric fell more than previously estimated in the fourth quarter amid a string of food safety scares tied to its restaurants.One such incident had resulted in a grand jury subpoena as part of a criminal investigation.An E.coli outbreak linked to Chipotle restaurants in October and November and an incident involving an outbreak of norovirus at a restaurant in Massachusetts pushed same-store sales 14.6 per cent lower in the fourth quarter.This was worse than the 8 to 11 per cent decline the company had forecast in December.Like-for-like sales dropped 30 per cent in the month of December, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The company also reduced its earnings estimates for the quarter and now expects to report earnings in the range of $1.70 to $1.90 a share, compared with its previous forecasts for $2.45 to $2.85.Chipotle also said it was served a grand jury subpoena from the US District Court for the Central District of California in conjunction with the US Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations in December. The subpoena related to a norovirus incident at a restaurant in California in August.Chipotle shares, which fell 30 per cent last year, declined 5 per cent to $426.72.Shares in Pioneer Natural Resources fell 7.2 per cent to $116.15 after the oil and gas explorer announced plans to increase the size of a share offering and lifted its capital spending programme amid a protracted decline in crude prices.Pioneer said late on Tuesday that it would sell 12m new shares at $117 per share, with an option to sell an additional 1.8m shares. The funds are expected to be used, in part, to develop the company’s drilling in the Permian basin.The bigger share offering “is a surprise given Pioneer’s relative balance- sheet strength and its lack of needs on the acquisition front (in contrast to recent playbooks of smaller Permian peers using equity to fund M&A while keeping leverage at palatable levels)”, said Phillips Johnston, an analyst at Capital One Securities.Moreover, at a time when energy companies have scrambled to reduce costs, Pioneer said it was lifting its 2016 capital spending budget.The company estimates between $2.4bn to $2.6bn in spending this year, compared with $2.2bn the previous year. The new programme was, however, in line with analysts’ estimates.The Dallas-based company also said that it may incur “unusual non-cash impairment charges” of between $800m to $1bn on its Eagle Ford Shale assets in the fourth quarter.The decline in Pioneer shares came alongside a broader sell-off in energy stocks. The S&P 500 energy sector fell 2.6 per cent and was the worst performing sector on the benchmark index.Meanwhile, shares of gold miners advanced on the back of a rally in gold prices. Shares in Barrick Gold climbed 4 per cent to $7.94, shares in Goldcorp advanced 2 per cent to $11.81 and Newmont Mining shares rose 0.8 per cent to $18.56.The precious metal has begun the new year on the front foot as concerns on the health of the Chinese economy and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have boosted purchases of safe haven assets.In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,990.26, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.5 per cent to 16,906.51 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.1 per cent to 4,835.77.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
57;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-12-11T17:29:11Z;Chipotle: going viral;Reputation among consumers can fall quickly and hard;Humility is a burrito best served cold. The magnificent rise of Chipotle, the Mexican food chain, has been founded on an image of hip, ethical, affordable, convenient dining. Its shares rose by an average of 29 per cent a year between 2006 and the start of 2015. But the US-based chain, which thought itself far too cool to ever be referred to as a purveyor of fast food, is facing an old-fashioned health scare.An E.coli bacteria outbreak, first reported in late October, has affected 11 Chipotle locations in the Pacific Northwest. The Centers for Disease Control began investigating outbreaks in other states last week, bringing the number of potential cases to 52. Separately, an outbreak of norovirus that emerged last weekend is being linked to a Chipotle outlet in Boston.Chief executive Steve Ells appeared on morning television to apologise on Thursday. He pledged to make the chain the “safest place to eat”. While only a handful of Chipotle customers are affected, nausea is much more widespread among investors. The company’s shares are down nearly a quarter in the past two months. The spice in Chipotle stock was both its profitability (operating margins above 15 per cent) and its ability to churn out same-store sales growth in double digits. That growth had started to slow to low single digits, although new locations have been keeping the top line moving along. But the unhygienic headlines have hit the company hard. Chipotle says that fourth-quarter sales will be down around a tenth on the same period last year, with earnings nearly 40 per cent below expectations.Chipotle had achieved a cult-like following among customers to the point that virtually every new quick-service concept tries to unofficially bill itself as the Chipotle of its particular genre. Its mastery of marketing, product development and execution made it the envy of the industry. But in the time it takes to fold a burrito, much of that goodwill can be taken away.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The company also did not provide much commentary on 2017, when a key US tax credit for rooftop panel systems is set to expire.The news prompted analysts at Needham to downgrade the stock to “hold” from “buy”. Three other banks trimmed their price target on the stock.Solar-panel makers have been pressured as crude and natural gas prices have tumbled and as competition within the industry has grown.First Solar expects sales in the range of $3.9bn to $4.1bn and earnings per share in the range of $4.00 to $4.50 next year.Shares in First Solar are up nearly 20 per cent this year.Men’s Wearhouse shares fell 16.97 per cent to $15.27, after the retailer warned it could miss its full-year profit guidance if weak sales continue at Jos A Bank.The California-based retailer, which acquired Jos A Bank last year, said comparable sales at the brand fell 35.1 per cent in the current quarter through the first week of December. That compared with average same-store sales that were up 5.5 per cent across its other brands.“If the Jos A Bank trend continues through the remainder of the quarter, the company runs the risk of missing the lower end of the guidance given on November 5 2015,” management said in a statement.The retailer swung to a loss of $27.2m or 56 cents a share in the third quarter, compared with a profit of $6.8m or 14 cents a share in the period a year ago. Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of 50 cents a share in line with analysts’ estimates.Sales slid nearly 3 per cent to $865.4m, below Wall Street forecasts for $876.8m.Chipotle shares advanced 5 per cent to $575.43 as chief executive Steve Ells apologised to customers in an NBC interview and pledged new food-safety practices.Mr Ells arrived a day after health officials said that the 80 students in Boston who fell ill were believed to have been made sick by the norovirus linked to a Chipotle restaurant. These findings suggested that the illnesses in Boston were not tied to a larger E.coli outbreak that affected customers of the Mexican restaurant chain in nine US states.Shares in Australian software company Atlassian closed up 32.29 per cent to $27.78 on their New York trading debut.Materials and utilities were the only big sectors on the benchmark S&P 500 that were in the red.By the close, the S&P 500 had nudged up 0.23 per cent to 2,052.23, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.47 per cent to 17,574.75, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.44 per cent to 5,045.17.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtbadkar
59;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-12-08T21:49:03Z;Southwest Airlines dips on revenue disappointment;Third day of declines in oil prices weighs on US stocks;Southwest Airlines was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on Tuesday after the carrier lowered its outlook for a fourth-quarter revenue metric.The Dallas-based airline said it expected revenue per available seat mile, a measure of airline efficiency, to be “flat to down 1.0 per cent” in the current quarter, compared with a year ago. Its previous forecast had been for 1 per cent growth.“The company’s unit revenue weakness is likely due to leaving low-fare buckets open longer than initially expected,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Southwest said it had flown 9.7bn revenue passenger miles, a gauge of passenger traffic, in November, an increase of 13.9 per cent from a year ago.But it was the downbeat outlook on which investors focused, sending shares in Southwest, which have advanced nearly 9 per cent this year, 9.03 per cent lower to $45.04 by the close.Airline stocks have come under pressure this year from concerns that carriers will boost capacity and cut ticket prices in an effort to win market share.The news sent the NYSE Arca airline index, which includes global carriers, down 2.72 per cent, trimming the sector’s gains of the past two days on the back of lower oil prices.A US antitrust regulator’s move to block its acquisition of rival Office Depot prompted an analyst downgrade that pushed shares in Staples 5.44 per cent lower to $10.08.The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint on Monday to block the $6.3bn deal, arguing that the proposed merger would “significantly” reduce competition and drive up prices for consumers.KeyBanc downgraded Staples from “overweight” to “sector weight” and removed its price target.“Following Monday’s news, we are unable to estimate the likelihood of a deal, and are left with concerns about the underlying businesses,” said analyst Bradley Thomas.Shares in Chipotle found no relief after it said it had closed one of its restaurants in Boston while it investigated “a number of illnesses among Boston college students”.But the Mexican restaurant chain said it did “not have any evidence” to suggest the incident was related to an E.coli outbreak.The Denver-based company’s sales trends have been “extremely volatile” in the current quarter after an outbreak of the infectious illness was linked to its restaurants.Shares in United Natural Foods fell 16.17 per cent to $36.91 after it cut its full-year outlook and reported disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings.The organic foods distributor expects 2016 revenue in a range of $8.43bn-$8.59bn, below its previous estimates for $8.51bn-$8.67bn. This compared with Wall Street’s estimates for $8.48bn.Net income fell nearly 9 per cent to $30.1m, or 60 cents a share, in the three months to the end of October, below analysts’ expectations.A third day of declines in oil prices weighed on US stocks, but with the sell-off in Southwest’s shares it was the industrials sector that fell the most on the benchmark S&P 500.By the close the S&P 500 was down 0.65 per cent to 2,063.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined 0.92 per cent to 17,568.00 and the Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 5,098.24.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
60;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
61;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-12-07T22:58:29Z;Chipotle’s E.coli outbreak prompts ‘extremely volatile’ sales;Energy a poor performer on benchmark index as airline shares rise;"Shares in Chipotle fell after it said an outbreak of E.coli linked to its restaurants prompted “extremely volatile” sales trends in the current quarter and the Mexican food chain was downgraded by analysts on Wall Street.Chipotle said it expects same-restaurant sales, a key metric, to be down 8 per cent to 11 per cent in the three-month period, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. That compared with an increase of 2.6 per cent in the third quarter.The impact on sales prompted the Colorado-based company to rescind its full-year comparable sales outlook.Meanwhile, forecasts for earnings in a range of $2.45 to $2.85 a share were shy of analysts’ estimates of $4.06 a share.Sales trends have been “extremely volatile”, Chipotle said, pointing to sharp fluctuations as US regulators have issued updates on the outbreak of the potentially serious bacterial infection that affects the digestive system.Chipotle announced the closure of 43 restaurants on November 3, which caused a 20 per cent drop in comparable-store sales.The sales gradually improved after that point but when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced further cases of E.coli in three additional states, comparable sales fell about 22 per cent.It also said it expects to incur expenses of $6m to $8m in the current quarter for the cost of replacing food, lab analysis of food samples and other items related to the outbreak.Chipotle’s pain was compounded by downgrades from Cowen and Guggenheim on Monday.Analysts at Cowen cut the stock to “market perform” from “outperform” and lowered the price target nearly 34 per cent to $515.Chipotle shares, which have declined more than 20 per cent this year, pared losses to trade 1.68 per cent lower at $551.75 by the close of trading in New York.Keurig Green Mountain shares jumped 71.93 per cent to $88.89 on news that the maker of K-Cup single serve coffee pods was being taken private by an investor group led by JAB Holding for $13.9bn.Shares in airline stocks advanced for a second straight day as crude continued its slide following Friday’s Opec meeting when the cartel outlined neither a deal on production cuts nor output targets.Fuel is the biggest expense for airlines making them sensitive to moves in oil prices, and Monday’s sell-off helped send the NYSE Arca airline index, which includes global airline stocks, 0.51 per cent higher.Shares in Delta Air Lines advanced 4.02 per cent to $51.78; JetBlue shares jumped 3.96 per cent to $26.49; shares in American Airlines rose 1.80 per cent to $45.78; and shares in United Continental were up 2.68 per cent to $60.52.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.70 per cent to 2,077.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined 0.66 per cent to 17,730.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.79 per cent to 5,101.81.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar"
62;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-11-10T21:57:48Z;DR Horton leads rally among homebuilders;Gap shares under pressure on the back of weaker than expected October sales;DR Horton revealed a bigger climb in its quarterly profits than expected on Tuesday, lending a lift to the homebuilder sector.Net profits jumped 44 per cent from the year prior to $238.9m in the group’s fiscal fourth quarter. The results cover a choppy period for the US real estate market.A measure of sales of newly constructed single-family homes from the commerce department rose 24.8 per cent in July from the year before, but the pace dipped to 2 per cent in September.Shares in DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder by sales, climbed 8.2 per cent to $31.14, bringing the year-to-date advance to 23 per cent.In the same sector, PulteGroup advanced 3.6 per cent to $18.19.Elsewhere, Gap came under pressure on the back of weaker October sales figures than expected and a disappointing profit outlook for the third quarter.The retailer’s troubles deepened in late September after Stefan Larsson, who had been credited with a turning round the lower-end Old Navy Brand, left to become the chief executive of Ralph Lauren.Gap slumped 1.4 per cent to $27.29, widening its retreat this year to 35 per cent.On the other side of the spectrum, Chipotle said 43 restaurants in the US Northwest would reopen after an outbreak of E. coli. Health authorities, which have yet to determine the cause, will oversee the reopenings.The chain — known for its burritos and guacamole — is testing fresh produce, raw meat and dairy items to ensure there is no contamination, and has deep-cleaned the restaurants and discarded all stock.Chipotle shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $629.51, helping cut this year’s loss to 8 per cent.In the healthcare sector, Valeant dropped after its chief executive warned of “significant” near-term risks to its dermatology division, which accounted for 16.7 per cent of third-quarter sales. The biotechnology company has been mired in controversy over decisions to raise prices on certain drugs and its relationship with a speciality pharmacy.The shares slid 2.1 per cent to $83.64 in volatile trading. They have collapsed by nearly 70 per cent since August.Another weak performer on the day was materials. Freeport-McMoRan, the big copper miner, slumped 6.2 per cent to $9.84, as the price of copper fell for a fourth day amid concerns about demand from China.Trade data released on Monday, and a reading on consumer-level inflation on Tuesday, came in below economists’ expectations.McDonald’s wavered in late-morning trading as investors eagerly awaited an investor meeting, which was set to begin later on Tuesday. The world’s biggest burger chain has undertaken measures, including the introduction of all-day breakfast, aimed at reigniting customer enthusiasm. The shares were little changed at $113.29, but have rallied more than 20 per cent this year.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,081.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 17,758.21 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.2 per cent to 5,083.24.
63;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-11-02T17:23:53Z;Valeant rebounds as critic stays silent;Chipotle slides after health scare shuts handful of restaurants;Shares in Valeant rose more than 7 per cent in New York on Monday, after a short-seller who has been targeting the group said he would not release any new allegations.Andrew Left, who runs Citron Research, recently accused the struggling drugmaker of perpetuating an accounting fraud through Philidor, a pharmacy group it controlled, and asked whether the drugmaker was Enron Part Deux.Valeant, which has since cut ties with Philidor, dismissed the claims as “completely untrue”, but Mr Left promised to publish further allegations.On Monday morning, he dialled back in a post on Citron’s website:“While Citron has been at the nexus of information on this story, we will not be releasing new allegations against Valeant in this piece, as we believe that it is not our responsibility to be the judge, jury, and executioner of the company’s deeds.”Valeant’s shares have fallen about 61 per cent since the start of August, amid persistent questions over the sustainability of its business model, which some say is reliant on an unsustainable mix of steep price increases, debt-fuelled dealmaking and aggressive sales techniques.Elsewhere, Chipotle, the popular chain known for its burritos, fell from favour due to concerns over an E.coli outbreak that may be related to a handful of its restaurants in Oregon and Washington state.In a statement the company said that it closed its restaurants in the Seattle and Portland areas “out of an abundance of caution” after health officials said they were investigating about 20 cases of E.coli that included individuals who ate at six of its establishments.A spokesman said there was no evidence to suggest the issue extends beyond the half-dozen restaurants.Seven patients in Washington, and one in Oregon, were hospitalised, according to a statement on Saturday from the Washington State Department of Health. There have been no deaths reported.The Washington health officials said the outbreak “appears to be linked to food served at Chipotle,” but “the food or other source of contamination hasn’t yet been determined and remains under investigation.”Chipotle shares, which have fallen 9 per cent this year, dropped 3 per cent. Health scares at other restaurant chains have sometimes meaningfully affected demand. For example, KFC, owned by Yum Brands, has repeatedly seen its China sales hit on the back of issues related to chicken.Shares in Starwood, the luxury hotel operator, slipped 2 per cent after a report from CNBC that a sale to rival Hyatt was “still weeks away”.Last week the Financial Times reported that Hyatt was in advanced talks to acquire Starwood, a deal that would create a company with a portfolio of more than 500,000 hotel rooms.Starwood, which owns the Sheraton, St Regis and W hotel brands, has been under pressure from investors to break up or sell the company following lagging growth. It hired Lazard in April to explore its strategic options. The company could be sold for more than $17bn, analysts say.Despite weaker than expected US manufacturing data, a reassuring outcome from stress tests on Greek banks pushed stocks higher across Europe and the US.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.2 per cent to 2,104.05, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 17,828.76, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.5 per cent to 5,127.15.
64;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-10-21T20:54:40Z;Chipotle shares slide on growth concerns;Kimberly-Clark is latest US company walloped by the strong dollar;Chipotle shares dropped 5.8 per cent on Wednesday after the chain reported leaner profits than had been expected, fuelling worries about a slowdown in the burrito restaurant’s rapid growth.Late on Tuesday Chipotle said its net profits climbed to $144.9m, from $130.8m in the same period in 2014. On a per-share basis, the fast-food chain earned $4.59, missing Wall Street estimates of $4.62.Sales rose by 12 per cent to $1.22bn, meeting estimates. Same-store sales, a key metric for retailers, climbed 2.6 per cent. Chipotle said it expected same-store sales to rise in the “low to mid single-digits” this year.The chain known for its guacamole and tacos has experienced rapid growth in recent years. Revenues, for example, climbed 27.8 per cent last year.However, the company this year experienced issues sourcing pork that was raised to its standards for its carnitas product, weighing on sales in certain markets.In many ways, Chipotle is representative of a shift in consumer taste that has troubled other performers in the fast-food realm.For example McDonald’s, the world’s biggest burger chain, has seen its sales stall as it has struggled to drum up demand.Chipotle’s third-quarter results “demonstrate the continued success of our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food,” said Steve Ells, founder and co-chief.Shares in Chipotle have fallen 3 per cent this year, while shares of competitor Shake Shack has shrunk 8 per cent and McDonald’s shares are up 9 per cent.Kimberly-Clark, the consumer goods company best known for its Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, was the latest US company to be walloped by the strong dollar.It warned on Tuesday that is now expected full year sales to fall between 10 and 11 per cent, a touch beyond the previous guidance for a 10 per cent drop, due to currency headwinds.Sales in developing and emerging markets decreased 11 per cent, including a 25 per cent negative impact from changes in currency rates.Stripping out foreign currency impact, Kimberly-Clark said organic sales would grow 4-5 per cent and adjusted earnings per share would be $5.70-$5.80.The company had previously predicted organic growth of 3 to 5 per cent and adjusted EPS of $5.65 to $5.80.The forecast revisions came as Kimberly-Clark reported a drop in sales and earnings for the third quarter, although it still beat analyst estimates, leading the shares 0.7 per cent higher on Wednesday.Shares in Yahoo were down 5.2 per cent, building upon Tuesday’s 2 per cent loss, after the struggling internet company missed expectations on both earnings and revenues in the third quarter. Yahoo’s stock has dropped 38 per cent so far this year.GM shares rose 5.9 per cent after the company said strong US car sales boosted its earnings to record levels for the three months to the end of September.The Michigan-based company saw net profits up more than a third to 3.1bn, powered by cheap gasoline prices in the US that have fuelled sales for larger vehicles.Stocks on Wall Street were weaker on Wednesday after mixed corporate earnings. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent at 2,018.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent at 17,168.61. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.8 per cent at 4,840.12.
65;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-07-22T16:51:32Z;Chipotle sizzles on July sales optimism;Sell-off in technology stocks pushes US indices lower;Chipotle lit up on Wednesday after the Mexican restaurant chain said same-store sales in July had been “positive” and higher menu prices and new restaurants had helped boost second-quarter results.The shares initially fell after Chipotle said an important industry metric had risen at its weakest pace in more than two years and that Same-store sales had risen 4.3 per cent in the three months to the end of June, shy of analysts’ forecasts for a 5.8 per cent gain.However, on a conference call, management said comparable sales in July were in “low single-digits” and traffic was in “positive territory”, triggering a rally in the stock.There had been concerns that traffic trends would be negative in July because of more difficult comparisons following a strong third quarter last year.“Chipotle faces its most difficult compares this quarter,” said Jason West, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “From there the outlook turns more positive as easing compares, incremental pricing and return of full pork supply could provide a tailwind to comparable sales.”Profits were up 27 per cent from a year earlier to $140m, or $4.45 per share. Revenues advanced 14 per cent to $1.2bn, with the company attributing much of the growth to store openings and higher menu prices.Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $4.40 a share on sales of $1.22bn.Shares of Chipotle, which have advanced 6 per cent this year, rose 7.7 per cent to $725.Intuitive Surgical climbed 8.7 per cent to $548.81 after it topped second-quarter profits and sales expectations.The maker of surgical robots reported profits of $134.5m, or $3.56 a share, in the three months to the end of June, compared with $97m, or $2.57 a share, in the period a year before. Sales rose 10 per cent to $586.1m.Analysts had forecast earnings of $3.10 a share on sales of $564.8m. Adjusting for one-time items, Intuitive reported earnings of $4.57 a share, ahead of expectations for $3.99.Shares of Blue Buffalo, which makes premium pet food, surged 36 per cent to $27.20 in their debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday morning, securing a valuation of more than $5.3bn.The company priced its initial public offering at $20, above an earlier targeted range of between $16 and $18 a share.Investors sold 33.8m shares in the offering while Blue Buffalo issued 35,934 shares to employees. The company did not receive any of the proceeds from the $677m flotation.Disappointing results from Yahoo and Microsoft and weaker than expected iPhone sales at Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite and triggered a sell-off in technology stocks that pushed US stocks lower on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 5,171.77, while the S&P 500 slid 0.2 per cent to 2,114.15 and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 17,851.04.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
66;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-04-22T17:00:32Z;Chipotle sags as sales disappoint;Disruption in pork supply also affected results;Chipotle shares faced the heat after the US restaurant chain reported first-quarter same-store sales that fell short of expectations and while disruption in pork supply affected its results.The company said comparable sales climbed 10.4 per cent in the first quarter, down from a 16.1 per cent pace in the final three months of 2014 and short of analysts’ expectations.Executives forecast that same-store sales over the course of the year would rise by a “low-to-mid single-digit” percentage.“The quarter was not without its challenges however, as we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers and are exploring options to increase the supply of pork that meets our high standards,” said Steve Ells, the company’s chairman and co-chief executive.The Denver, Colorado-based company reported a 48 per cent rise in profits in the three months to the end of March from a year earlier to $123m, or $3.88 per share. Revenues advanced by a fifth to $1.1bn, with volumes at the average restaurant reaching $2.5m.Analysts on Wall Street had expected the chain to report earnings of $3.63 a share on sales of $1.1bn.Chipotle is a momentum-driven stock, having gained more than 400 per cent in the past five years. However, investors have grown more cautious as same-store sales growth at the company declined for the second consecutive quarter.Shares of Chipotle, which have climbed 26 per cent in the past year, declined more than 7 per cent to $641.23.Boeing shares fell 1.4 per cent to $151.19, after the company said first-quarter profits climbed as it delivered more aircraft.Profits rose to $1.3bn, or 1.97 a share, from $965m, or $1.28 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 8 per cent to $22.1bn.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1.77 a share, on sales of $22.5bn.Revenues at its commercial aerospace business climbed 21 per cent in the period to $15.4bn.Shares of McDonald’s were buoyed by promises of a “turnround plan”, despite reporting first-quarter results that missed Wall Street forecasts.The company said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, would reveal the plan “to improve our performance and deliver enduring profitable growth” on May 4.The announcement came alongside an 11 per cent drop in sales to $5.95bn for the three months to the end of March. Net income fell by a third to $811.5m, or 84 cents per share. McDonald’s shares rose 3 per cent to $97.84.Disappointing first-quarter results pushed shares of Intuitive Surgical more than 5 per cent lower to $516.93.The surgical robot maker reported profits of $97m or $2.57 a share, on sales of $532.1m.

Sales a quarter earlier were limited as the medication was only available in Europe.“Gilead expects lower margins to be offset by higher patient volumes and fewer eligibility restrictions, including treating F0 patients (no fibrosis) in select agreements,” said Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura.Gilead expects to have capacity to treat more than 250,000 patients for hepatitis C in 2015.Matthew Roden, an analyst at UBS, said market penetration would rise as the drug became more affordable, but in the short term “more patients are captured by Gilead ahead of further competition”.But he added that year estimates beyond 2015 would decrease because more patients would have been cured.Gilead profits more than tripled from a year earlier to $3.49bn, or $2.18 a share in the three months to the end of December, while sales more than doubled to $7.3bn.Gilead announced that it would pay a 43 per cent quarterly dividend and announced a $15bn share buyback programme.Shares of Gilead, which have climbed more than 18 per cent in the past year, fell more than 8 per cent to $98.43, wiping $16.5bn in market capitalisation.Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 7 per cent to $676.00 after the restaurant chain reported a 16.1 rise in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, shy of Wall Street estimates for 16.5 per cent growth.Earnings of $3.84 a share topped forecasts, while sales of $1.1bn were in line with estimates.Ralph Lauren was the worst performing stock on the US benchmark after the company reported a 9 per cent drop in fiscal third-quarter profits to $215m or $2.41 a share and sales of $2.03bn that missed Wall Street estimates.The retailer expects fiscal 2015 revenue to rise 4 per cent in constant currency terms, lower than its previous estimates for 5-7 per cent growth. Its shares fell 18 per cent to $139.71.Walt Disney shares advanced nearly 8 per cent to $101.28 after it topped fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales estimates driven by sales of consumer products and home entertainment related to its 2013 animated hit Frozen.Kohl’s reported a 3.7 per cent rise in same-store sales, ahead of its forecast for 2-3 per cent growth, lifting shares up more than 6 per cent to $66.87.Consumer discretionary and telecoms stocks offered support to the US benchmark as lower oil prices and healthcare stocks weighed on the index.The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 2,041.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 17,673.02 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 4,716.70.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
68;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-01-23T17:46:21Z;US diners lose their taste for Big Macs;First fall in same-store sales for 12 years shows McDonald’s global challenges;McDonald’s same-store sales suffered their first annual fall in a dozen years in 2014, as the US economic recovery failed to bring increasingly health-conscious consumers back to its traditional menu of Big Macs and fries.US consumers are opting for fare that is perceived as healthier, such as Chipotle burritos and Panera Bread sandwiches. But a 1 per cent drop in global same-store sales in 2014 highlighted the broad-based challenges facing the emblematic US brand, from China and Japan to Russia and Germany.The $87bn company responded by announcing that it had slashed its restaurant opening plans, cutting back its budget for new outlets by $800m. It will still open more than 1,000 stores, but this compares to 1,300 last year.Threatened at home by upmarket burger brands such as Shake Shack, McDonald’s said it would expand a pilot build-a-burger programme to up to 2,000 US outlets as it presses ahead with a marketing push highlighting the quality of its ingredients.[This year] will be a year of regaining momentum globally . . . however, it will take time, especially in our larger marketsDon Thompson, chief executive, warned that results were likely to remain under pressure well into 2015. This year “will be a year of regaining momentum globally . . . however, it will take time, especially in our larger markets”, he told analysts on a call announcing fourth-quarter results that missed expectations.Low oil prices have boosted many companies that target McDonald’s core low-income customers, who are still struggling with stagnant wages despite the US recovery. But the chain’s US same-store sales fell 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, and 4.2 per cent for the year, and the company acknowledged continued pricing challenges.A food safety scandal involving a supplier in China contributed to a 4.8 per cent fall in quarterly same-store sales in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, while weakness in France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine knocked comparable sales in Europe by 1.1 per cent.In October, the company said it would implement sweeping changes, streamlining an increasingly complicated menu and tailoring it more to regional tastes. McDonald’s said on Friday that it would exercise “further financial discipline” by cutting its capital expenditure budget from $3bn last year to $2bn, its lowest in five years.Fourth-quarter earnings of $1.1bn, or $1.13 a diluted share, compared with $1.4bn, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 7 per cent, from $7.09bn to $6.57bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.22 a share on $6.68bn in revenues, and the group’s shares were down 1.46 per cent by the close in New York, to $89.56.Among the few bright spots was a 0.4 per cent rise in December’s US same-store sales, but Mr Thompson said he expected January sales to fall.The news came a day after 10 former employees sued the company and one of its franchisees for alleged racial discrimination at three restaurants in Virginia. The suit alleges that supervisors at the restaurants used racial slurs and made comments like “there are too many black people in the store”.McDonald’s has long maintained that it is not responsible for wages or the treatment of employees at its thousands of franchised restaurants. Critics have countered that the company exercises control over every other aspect of the store — from food preparation to uniforms to customer interaction — and should be held responsible.Last year, the National Labor Relations Board, a top regulator, ruled that the fast-food chain is a “joint employer”, meaning it may be liable for unfair labour practices at its 14,000-plus US restaurants. In December, the NLRB filed complaints in 78 cases against the company and franchisees across the country for “violating the rights of employees”.The company has vowed to fight the complaints, which are set for hearings in March.
69;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2015-01-14T23:20:39Z;Chipotle tries to beef up pork supplies;Sales suspended at 600 US outlets after violation by supplier;There was hope for carnitas lovers on Wednesday as Chipotle said it was trying to get hold of additional pork supplies, after the burrito chain suspended sales of the meat at about a third of its outlets.Chipotle — among the fastest-growing US restaurant chains — on Tuesday said it had halted sales of pork products at roughly 600 US outlets after discovering that a key supplier had violated the company’s animal welfare standards.The company is “exploring many options to add to our pork supply, including adding new suppliers, finding additional cuts of pork to use, and growing the supply among existing suppliers,” said spokesman Chris Arnold.The suspension affects about a third of the chain’s outlets.Chipotle said a routine audit had revealed that a supplier — which it did not name — was raising pigs without outdoor access and in violation of other humane standards the company insists on.“This is fundamentally an animal welfare decision, and is rooted in our unwillingness to compromise our standards where animal welfare is concerned,” Mr Arnold said.Chipotle has seen explosive growth in recent years in part by marketing itself as “food with integrity”. It is at the vanguard of so-called fast-casual restaurants that are shaking up the traditional fast-food model by marketing themselves as healthier alternatives to the average burger joint.The Denver-based company says it uses pork raised “naturally” on a vegetarian diet and without antibiotics. Along with many other fast-casual restaurants, it promotes itself as serving fresher ingredients that are often organic or locally sourced.Chipotle and others including Noodles & Co and Potbelly Sandwich Shop are growing at 9-10 per cent a year, compared with 2-3 per cent for traditional fast-food chains, according to food consultancy Technomic.Fast-casual customers tend to have higher incomes than their fast-food counterparts.McDonald’s, which has announced major initiatives to stem years of slow growth, Yum Brands and Wendy’s have all made forays into fast-casual in recent years.McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, is expanding a test programme that gives customers greater choice in their burger toppings that has a lot in common with Chipotle’s build-a-burrito model.Shares in Chipotle are up more than 30 per cent in the past year, compared to a drop in McDonald’s shares of more than 4 per cent.
70;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-10-24T18:07:22Z;McDonald’s: Eating their lunch;The world’s largest restaurant chain has missed a dramatic shift in what consumers want to eat;It is lunchtime in downtown Chicago, and the Chipotle Mexican Grill on Franklin Street is packed with customers hungry for burritos, tacos and fajitas. Among those satisfying his Mexican craving is Sameer Mazhary, one of the millions of diners who have made Chipotle one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the US over the past decade.“Chipotle is a different breed,” he says. “It’s like an evolution from fast food.”There is a McDonald’s a few blocks away, but Mr Mazhary, 28, says he has not stepped through the Golden Arches in a decade. “I learnt about the food, and what goes into it and it kind of turned me off,” he says.As he speaks, people rush by with bags from Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Freshii, Noodles & Co and another Chipotle, three blocks away, where the queue stretches on to the sidewalk. Wyatt Steele, 32, is a regular at this branch, visiting once a week or so. He says he grew up eating at McDonald’s but has not bought anything beyond a coffee there in years. “I don’t trust the ingredients, I don’t trust the way I imagine they put together their food . . . with chemists in a lab getting the taste and smell just right,” he says.Tastes are changing in the US, and this is bad news for the world’s largest restaurant group. The children who grew up eating Happy Meals are not hungry for Big Macs. Like Mr Mazhary and Mr Steele, they are as concerned about where their food comes from and what is in it as they are about how much it costs or how fast they can eat it.If Mr Steele is any indication, the future does not bode well. “If I had any kids, I likely would not take them to McDonald’s either,” he says.Throughout the US, McDonald’s largest market, the company’s fortunes in recent years have tracked those of its crucial low-income customers, who have not recovered from the financial crisis.McDonald’s is the biggest fast food player, with 35,000 global outlets and $28bn in annual revenues, and its challenges have been similarly large-scale. The company has seen same-store sales in the US fall in 10 of the past 12 months. This week, it said its global same-store sales fell more than 3 per cent during the third quarter, with profits down 30 per cent. By contrast, Chipotle on Monday reported a 19.8 per cent rise in same-store sales and a 57 per cent jump in profits.The problems for McDonald’s are not limited to the US. Growth in Europe is even slower, while Asia sales have slumped on a Chinese food safety scandal. A rebound in Russia may be even further off, after Moscow opened hygiene and finance investigations into nearly half of the company’s 450 outlets, which some see as retaliation for EU and US sanctions.Speaking to investors this week, Steve Ells, Chipotle’s co-chief executive, took a swipe at the fast food model epitomised by McDonald’s – once the Mexican chain’s largest investor. “The traditional fast food sector has traded food quality and taste for low-cost and ease of preparation,” he said.Judging from comments made this week by Don Thompson, McDonald’s chief executive, the fast food pioneer agrees with him. McDonald’s said it would take “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business in ways that would better position it to compete with Chipotle and other “fast casual” restaurants. It also plans to slash $200m-$300m in spending and open fewer restaurants this year.Customers want to understand the source to make sure they know what’s in it, where it came from and the integrity of the sourcesMr Thompson’s plans add up to a radical departure from the basic McDonald’s formula, with changes to its menus, stores, customer service and technology. It is also taking on negative perceptions about its ingredients with an advertising campaign that gives customers a chance to ask what goes into McDonald’s food. The question is whether these changes will be enough to transform the quintessential American burger chain in the face of a major shift within the US restaurant industry.So-called fast casual restaurants are marketed as healthier alternatives to traditional fast food, serving fresher ingredients that are often organic or locally sourced. But fresher may not always mean healthier: a Chipotle burrito with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, guacamole and salsa contains 1,100 calories – 60 more than in a Big Mac and large fries. But the segment is growing at 9-10 per cent a year, compared with 2-3 per cent for traditional fast food chains, according to food consultancy Technomic.Because fast casual customers tend to have higher incomes than fast food consumers, there is debate about whether Chipotle and other such chains are stealing McDonald’s customers. But there is no doubt that they are having a significant impact on the way traditional players do business.Yum Brands, which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, has launched fast casual taco and Vietnamese sandwich joints, along with adding a gourmet menu at its Taco Bell restaurants. Wendy’s popular Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger is a clear play for those dollars, and the chain has launched prototype fast casual outlets in recent years.As US consumers have become more concerned about the obesity epidemic – and more critical of the food industry’s contribution to it – beverage, snack and restaurant companies have all moved toward offering more healthy options. McDonald’s has added salads and apple slices to its menu, but these changes have done little to stem slumping sales.The company has also become a focal point in the debate over pay inequality and the minimum wage, with a study by the pro-labour National Employment Law Project stating that about 700,000 McDonald’s employees receive roughly $1.2bn in annual public assistance.When Mr Thompson succeeded Jim Skinner as chief executive in June 2012, there were signs that the company’s nearly decade-long streak of same-store sales growth was coming to an end. But few expected the company to hit the wall quite so hard.“He came out at a critical inflection point in the restaurant sector, at the same point when fast casual was really taking off,” says RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar. “You had consumer preferences changing quite quickly.”I don’t trust the ingredients, I don’t trust the way I imagine they put together their food, with chemists in a lab getting the taste and smell just rightMr Hottovy says the company’s response has been “a series of missteps”, including the introduction of many new menu items, which has been blamed for confusing customers, and deep discounting that has infuriated franchisees already coping with thin margins. Ultimately, Mr Hottovy says, the company has been caught flat-footed by a dramatic shift in consumer tastes.Among these shifts is the emergence of a new generation of burger chains. Fast-growing Smashburger, Umami Burger and Elevation thrive by offering organic ingredients including arugula (rocket salad), mushrooms and chipotle lime aioli. The family-owned Five Guys has grown to more than 1,000 outlets by offering customisable burgers that are far from healthy, but succeeds by promoting its fresh ground beef and pure peanut oil.McDonald’s is responding by expanding a test programme at four locations in southern California that give customers greater choice in their burger toppings. Using a touchscreen, they can select from 22 options, including caramelised onions, bacon and grilled mushrooms.All of the chain’s plans are good “in theory”, says Mr Hottovy. “But we’ve been promised a lot of things the last couple years by this management team and haven’t seen follow-through.”If the customisation programme expands, it would herald a significant change to the McDonald’s model, which has made reliability and uniformity its stock-in-trade.The McDonald’s formula was codified in 1958 when Fred Turner – the protégé of founder Ray Kroc, whom he later replaced as chief executive – wrote the company’s operating manual that remains the blueprint on which its restaurants run. It dictates there can be no more than six patties on the grill at a time and that fries can be no thicker than 0.28 inches. There are two pickles on every Big Mac, Double Cheeseburger, McDouble and Quarter Pounder with Cheese, one pickle on a regular burger or cheeseburger, none on a Filet-O-Fish and three on the Angus Deluxe, Angus Bacon & Cheese and the Angus Mushroom & Swiss.Departing from the formula by allowing customers more choice in their burger toppings could solve another problem: it could help alleviate suspicions about what goes into them.McDonald’s is also trying to attack the negative perceptions about its ingredients with a new marketing campaign entitled “Our food. Your Questions”.“Customers . . . want to understand the source of the origin to make sure they know what’s in it and where it came from and the integrity of the sources,” Mr Thompson said this week.The top consumer-submitted questions on its homepage speak to the scale of the challenges McDonald’s must overcome: “Is the McRib made from real pork?”, “Is ‘pink slime’ [a meat-based additive] in a Chicken McNugget?”, “Why doesn’t your food rot?”, “Are there worms in your beef?”, “Do you make your fries with real potatoes?”Bob Goldin, an analyst at Technomic, says it will be tough to change perceptions. “I think there are a lot of questions about the integrity of the food and the quality of the ingredients on the part of consumers,” Mr Goldin says. “McDonald’s is trying to say ‘we use whole-muscle meat and real milk’, but I don’t know if that resonates.“So much of it is fried and heavily breaded and I think that almost goes against the perception of good quality,” he adds. “If Chipotle fried up everything they serve would they have that reputation of food with integrity?”
71;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-08-21T16:49:51Z;Sears ‘unacceptable’ results hit retailer;;Investor disappointment over the latest results from Sears, which the US retailer acknowledged as “unacceptable”, wiped 7 per cent from the value of the company.Edward Lampert, the chief executive of Sears, made the admission as the company reported its loss had widened to $573m in the quarter to August 2, compared with $194m in the same period last year. It was the sixth straight quarterly loss, for the retailer.Same-store sales overall crept 0.8 per cent higher in the quarter compared with a year ago. However, sales at Kmart, a chain also owned by Sears, weakened 1.7 per cent for the quarter.Like competitors such as JC Penney and Kohl’s, Sears – a fixture for American consumers for decades – is being squeezed by the economy’s slow recovery and the growth of online retailing.In response, Mr Lampert, who is also the largest investor in Sears, has announced plans to close 130 stores and has spun off its Land’s End chain.The stock closed down 7.2 per cent to $33.38 in New York trading.Poor results from Staples also continued to affect the office supply chain store, which fell another 3 per cent to $10.97 after on Wednesday reporting weak earnings and plans to close an additional 140 stores.Faced with competition online and restructuring costs, net income in the quarter dropped 21 per cent to $82m. The office supplies company closed 80 stores during the quarter, contributing to a 2 per cent decline in sales.Chipotle Mexican Grill stock rose less than 1 per cent to $681.07, approaching record highs earlier in the day, as analysts raised expectations for third quarter sales.Steve Gojak of Cleveland Research predicted in a report released on Thursday that same-store sales would rise 19 to 20 per cent this quarter, higher than the average forecast of 15 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.The popular Mexican restaurant chain’s shares have jumped nearly 70 per cent in the past year, outperforming its fast food peers, despite price hikes in April, with sales climbing 29 per cent in the third quarter.Minnesota-based luncheon meat-maker Hormel Foods also beat estimates for third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, sending its shares 4 per cent higher.Hormel’s profits rose 21 per cent to a record $138m, from $113.6m a year ago, thanks to solid demand for pork and turkey and refrigerated foods, chief executive Jeffrey Ettinger said in a statement.Hewlett-Packard shares opened more than 5 per cent higher on Thursday after the PC maker reported late on Wednesday modest third-quarter revenue growth, defying analyst expectations for a decline.HP’s third quarter sales rose 1 per cent to $27.6bn, up from $27.2bn a year ago. Analysts had forecast a fall in revenue to $27.0bn.The unexpected growth was driven by personal computer sales, which jumped 12 per cent from the previous year.The company struggled to reinvent itself as personal computer sales shrank across the industry and cloud computing gained popularity. In May, HP announced it would cut as many as 16,000 more jobs, in addition to the 34,000 jobs lost in 2012, as part of restructuring plans.Shares in Hertz fell 1 per cent to $30.10 after a choppy day of trading the day before. The shares opened 12 per cent lower on Wednesday after the car rental company cut its forecast for the year, however later that day shares rebounded after activist investor Carl Icahn. disclosed an 8.48 per cent stake. The company has faced several operational challenges, including the effects of vehicle recalls by carmakers, and the fallout from accounting errors disclosed earlier this year.Overall, US equities were stronger. The S&P 500, up almost 8 per cent this year, touched a fresh intraday high on Wednesday after better news from America’s housing market and manufacturing sector.By close the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,992.37, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 17,039.49. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,532.10.
72;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-07-22T17:07:16Z;Chipotle outpaces rivals on strong sales;Results contrast with those from McDonald’s;Chipotle continued to outpace rivals in the fast food sector, reporting strong gains in same store sales as peers including McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fail to ignite consumer interest.Profits at the chain known for its steak and barbacoa tacos climbed 26 per cent to $110.3m, or $3.50 a share, in the quarter to June 30. Sales climbed 29 per cent to $1.05bn as same-store sales rose 17.3 per cent.Analysts on Wall Street had expected profits of $3.09 a share from sales of $990m.The results contrasted with those from McDonald’s, which once again saw tepid demand in the US for its burgers and fries. Same-store sales at the company’s US outlets declined 1.5 per cent in the quarter, a steeper dip than analysts expected.While McDonald’s has continued to focus its strategy around lower cost items through its dollar menu, executives at Chipotle have lifted prices at the chain’s 1,600 restaurants since April, a decision they argue has offset rising food inflation.The move received little push back from Chipotle’s fervent following and the company now expects same-store sales to increase by a “mid-teens” percentage over the remainder of this year.“We continue to believe Chipotle [is] the best growth story in restaurants,” Jeffrey Bernstein, an analyst with Barclays, said. “With most restaurants struggling to drive positive traffic, Chipotle remains an anomaly, justifying an outsized valuation.”Shares in the Mexican restaurant chain soared 12 per cent to $659.77 on the news, while McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $96.27. Taco Bell owner Yum Brands advanced 1 per cent to $74.84.Harley-Davidson led the benchmark S&P 500 lower on Tuesday after the company cut its outlook for full-year shipments.The motorcycle maker now forecasts a 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent rise in shipments this year compared to 2013. In April, it had predicted growth of between 7 and 9 per cent.The company pinned the blame on poor weather and a lull in sales of one of its models before the release of a new version later this year.Harley-Davidson shares fell 5 per cent at $63.46.Profits at Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest soft drinks maker, slipped in the second quarter as sales in the US failed to lift off.The company said net income fell 3 per cent to $2.6bn, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of June. Revenues were also under pressure, falling to $12.6bn from $12.7bn.Coca-Cola, which built its brand and fortune selling the world fizzy drinks, is grappling with a US market that is losing its taste for sugary drinks.The company said Coca-Cola volumes in North America edged up 1 per cent in the quarter, while overall sales in the region were flat.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $41.19 while rival PepsiCo declined 1 per cent to $89.17.Crocs, the struggling maker of colourful plastic clogs that were ubiquitous a decade ago, announced it will close or convert up to 100 of its stores and lay off 183 employees.The closures are expected to save $4m in 2014 and $10m in 2015, as Crocs seeks to save cash and revive its business.Crocs announced the move along with second-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations. Shares of Crocs advanced 13 per cent to $16.72.Netflix shares dipped 5 per cent to $431.09 after the company said its international expansion would drive losses in the division higher.The company, which started in the US, has expanded aggressively across Europe and racked up losses of $712m abroad since 2012.The initial losses have not dented Netflix’s ambition beyond the US. It plans to add service in France and Germany this September. Analysts with Jefferies said the expansion would “pressure” the company’s margins.Overall, US equity markets rose after a report showed the sale of previously owned homes recovered more than expected and core inflation in the country eased.The S&P 500 advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,983.53, touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,113.54.

73;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-07-09T16:40:57Z;Chipotle extends hot streak;;Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain that has developed a fervent following across the US, climbed on Wednesday after brokerage Wunderlich Securities said recent price hikes by the chain have not blunted sales.Wunderlich analyst Robert Derrington said traffic trends were little changed by an average 5.5 per cent increase to prices, sending shares 3 per cent higher to $604.11.Mr Derrington now expects the company to report same-store sales growth of 11 per cent in the second quarter, compared to an earlier 8 per cent forecast.“Operators in various geographies we recently spoke with mentioned little if any pushback from customers, perhaps aided by the fact that the company hadn’t raised prices in almost three years,” Mr Derrington said.The restaurant chain, which began increasing prices in April, has likely completed the roll out across its 1,600 locations, he added.Chipotle executives blamed rising food inflation for the need to increase prices, including a 25 per cent jump in beef costs in April from the end of 2013.Wunderlich lifted its price target on Chipotle to $560 from $542 and reiterated its hold rating.The company’s shares, which have advanced 12 per cent since the year’s start, have outperformed much of the fast food sector, including those of McDonald’s, Yum Brands and Domino’s Pizza. Chipotle has mapped out an aggressive expansion over the current year, expecting to open as many as 195 new restaurants.Since the year’s start, the Russell 3000 restaurant index – which includes the largest US restaurants and holds a market capitalisation totalling $286bn – has risen 3 per cent.Garmin shares led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Pacific Crest Securities lowered its rating to underperform from sector perform as inventory of its new vivofit fitness band accumulates.Analysts with Pacific Crest said Wall Street sales expectations for the fitness band were overestimated and a new, larger iPhone could weigh on sales of Garmin’s personal navigation devices.“We have concerns about the underlying strength of the outdoor and fitness businesses, which contribute over half of the company’s operating profit and are critical, in our view,” analyst Brad Erickson said.Garmin shares fell 5 per cent to $57.23 while Telenav slid 2 per cent to $5.47.Shares of Alcoa jumped 6 per cent to $15.67 after the metal mining company turned a profit following two straight quarters of losses.Profits in the quarter to June 30 were $138m, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $119m a year earlier. Sales were little changed from a year earlier at $5.8bn.Alcoa’s results come two weeks after it agreed to buy UK-based Firth Rixson, a maker of aeroplane engine and landing gear components, as the US company seeks to expand its divisions behind everything from aerofoils used in jet engines and sheets used in the auto industry.American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, was buoyed on Wednesday after the company said it expected second quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, to rise between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.The forecast followed a profit warning on Tuesday from Air France-KLM, which weighed on the airline sector.Shares of American Airlines advanced 4 per cent to $41.96 while rival Delta inched 1 per cent higher to $36.94.Container Store shares slid 9 per cent to $24.72, touching the lowest level since they began trading last November, after the retailer said sales in the three months to May 31 missed Wall Street forecasts.“Consistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail ‘funk’,” chief executive Kip Tindell said, referring to a 0.8 per cent decline in same-store sales.Overall, US equities snapped a two day losing streak ahead of and following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,972.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 per cent to 16,985.61.

74;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-05-16T17:34:57Z;Chipotle: the whole enchilada;Lower executive pay is more of moral issue for shareholders;Shareholders of Chipotle are unlikely to want another chief executive – it already has two. They just want the pair to make less money. This week the burrito chain decisively lost a non-binding “say-on-pay” vote after weeks of publicity about the tens of millions that had been allocated to bosses. But lost in the staggering pay packages is the equally staggering recent appreciation in Chipotle shares. The interplay of the two creates a conundrum: how shareholders should reconcile their big gains with deciding the right amount to pay the managers who ostensibly generate those gains.According to Chipotle filings, the pay packages for co-CEOs Steve Ellis and Monty Moran totalled $126m between 2011-2013. The true value of the full compensation is more complex. Packages include stock options and “stock appreciation rights” that may appreciate over time as well as cash and other benefits. The $126m figure cited is based on the “fair value” of the packages on grant dates each year.And so the incentive for management seems clear: boost the stock price so much that shareholders either do not notice or do not object to outsized pay. Shareholders, in contrast, should wish to maximise shareholder gains for minimum pay. At Chipotle, where management has previously won “say-on-pay” votes, the former previously had won out.Chipotle shares have risen 35 per cent annually between 2011 and 2013 but CtW Management, an advocacy group, has led the argument that those gains could have occurred under a more modest pay scheme.In 2013, Chipotle had $2.7bn in operating costs while Mr Ellis and Mr Moran’s pay was valued at $50m. Thus, at least at Chipotle, the controversy appears to be more about morality than economics. The debate about income inequality has crystallised just at the height of US shareholder meetings.With shareholders finally paying attention to the details of executive compensation and the advent of “say-on-pay” votes, bosses are destined to earn less than before. If that reflects the will of shareholders, so be it. But social justice alone won’t boost shareholder value.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
75;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-05-15T21:32:41Z;Chipotle investors vote down pay package;;Chipotle shareholders have rebuked the burrito chain’s executive pay plan with 77 per cent of the votes at its annual meeting cast against a package that could have paid its two chief executives $285m over three years.Thursday’s vote against the Denver-based company came as fast food workers protested for a higher minimum wage amid a public debate over income inequality and outsized executive compensation.It follows recent shareholder revolts over executive pay at companies including Reckitt Benckiser, Barclays, WPP and AstraZeneca.The protest at Chipotle was much larger than last year, when 27 per cent of the shares cast at the annual meeting opposed pay packages for Steve Ells and Montgomery Moran, co-CEOs who were paid around $25m each in cash and stock in 2013.In a statement, Chipotle said it took the non-bending vote “very seriously”. It added: “We . . . will continue to engage with our investors as we review our compensation programmes that build value for all of our investors.”Institutional investors, including the California State Teachers Retirement System, Calpers, New York City Pension Funds and the Florida State Board of Administration voted against the plan. Proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS also opposed the packages.Dieter Waizenegger, director of CtW Investment Group, which led the campaign against the packages, said in light of its overwhelming rejection, “we expect our board to get to work reining in runaway executive pay at Chipotle”.CtW noted in a release that the $67.3m paid to Chipotle’s top five executives in 2013 was 42 per cent more than Coca-Cola’s executive team was paid and nearly equal to that of General Electric, a company with 45 times the revenues of Chipotle.Since 2011, Mr Ells has received nearly $150m in Chipotle stock, while Mr Moran has received more than $100m. The company has also required that each receives stock appreciation rights of 0.48 per cent of Chipotle’s total equity every year, but the executives do not have to hold these for long and can sell stock soon after earning it.With over 1,600 stores, Chipotle is one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the US. Mr Ells started Chipotle in 1993 near the University of Denver, and the chain, known for its fresh, organic ingredients, has grown to become a leader in the fast-casual market that is dominating growth in the restaurant industry.Shares in the company were down 2.15 per cent, to $493.50, in early afternoon trading in New York.
76;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2014-01-31T22:02:06Z;Chipotle shares surge to record high;Analysts increase price targets on restaurant chain;Chipotle Mexican Grill shares surged to a record high on Friday as the company shrugged off broader weakness in the dining sector and reported the fastest pace of sales growth in more than a year.The restaurant chain rose 11.74 per cent to $551.96 by the close of trading in New York, off highs set earlier in the day.The gains follow Chipotle’s fourth-quarter results, which showed revenues rose 21 per cent from a year earlier to $844m, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Profits jumped 30 per cent to $79.6m, or $2.53 a share, a penny ahead of expectations.Analysts at a dozen investment banks increased their price targets on the restaurant chain following its results. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Kelter said improving traffic trends and the likelihood of price increases could boost the company’s profitability by the year’s end and into 2015.“Same-store sales are again bordering on double digits driven entirely by traffic growth,” Mr Kelter said. “While [Chipotle] does have a few drivers in place (marketing, catering, Sofritas), the reacceleration appears to be driven by a true underlying improvement in brand momentum and thus appears to be sustainable.”Toymaker Mattel shares fell 12 per cent to $37.84, leading the declines on the benchmark S&P 500, after the company said sales of its dolls came up short.Barbie sales were down a sharp 13 per cent in the final three months of the year and off by 6 per cent for the year.Total Mattel revenues declined 6 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn for the three months to December. Net income rose 20 per cent in the period to $369m, or $1.08 per share, although comparisons to a year ago were helped by past litigation expenses.Chief executive Bryan Stockton expressed his dismay on a call with analysts, noting that marketing and videos focused on Barbie’s “lifestyle and play patterns” had not been as successful as hoped.MasterCard shares were under pressure after the company missed fourth-quarter profit and sales expectations on Friday, which it blamed on rising operating and marketing costs as well as litigation expenses.The card processor said sales advanced 12 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn. Profits increased 3 per cent to $623m, or 52 cents per share. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of 60 cents a share. Shares fell 5 per cent to $75.68.Ajay Banga, chief executive of MasterCard, told analysts that the company continued to see subdued economic activity in Europe, as well as declining consumer and business sentiment in Asia. Mr Banga said the company saw conditions in the US improving.“Overall, it feels like the US and western Europe markets that generate well over half of our revenue are slowly starting to regain their economic footing,” he said.Amazon shares tumbled 11 per cent on Friday to $358.69, their steepest decline in more than two years, after sales growth decelerated in the final months of last year.The world’s largest online retailer reported net income of $239m, or 51 cents a share, compared to $97m a year ago. Revenues climbed 20 per cent to $25.6bn, shy of analysts’ forecasts of $26.1bn.Equity markets continued their slide as the week drew to a close, with the S&P 500 bringing its losses for the month to 3.5 per cent, even as a report from the US Department of Commerce showed a rise in consumer spending.Separate figures from the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters confirmed a dip in consumer confidence in January, although it was not as sharp as first thought.The S&P 500 declined 0.6 per cent to 1,782.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 15,698.85. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent lower to 4,103.88.
77;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2013-09-19T17:21:19Z;Chipotle serves up a masterclass in digital marketing;Fast-food chain’s viral video captures imaginations;Fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill is redefining how to market to consumers in the commercial-zapping, constantly distracted digital age with its latest viral campaign that attacks the processed food industry.“The Scarecrow”, a three-minute animated video, follows a worker at Crow Foods Incorporated, a dystopian factory that purports to feed the world. The scarecrow, who stands as a symbol of the protector of food, quickly learns that the food processed in the plant is anything but real.Set to a haunting Fiona Apple version of “Pure Imagination”, a song from the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the scarecrow discovers a conveyor belt churning out “100 per cent beef-ish” meat. Chickens, advertised as “natural”, are pumped full of a neon green liquid.The mood lifts when the scarecrow returns to his home on a farm, picks a red pepper – the Chipotle logo – and starts preparing his own fresh food.The video, which includes a companion mobile game, only makes subtle references to the Chipotle brand. Yet it is an extension of the company’s longstanding “Food with Integrity” initiative to serve fresh food from sustainable farms that respect animals. In 2006 McDonald’s disposed of its 65 per cent stake in Chipotle, which in recent years has been on a mission to define itself as a safe, healthy alternative to other fast-food outlets.In 2011 Chipotle made waves with its “Back to the Start” animated video set to Willie Nelson singing Coldplay’s “The Scientist”, which told the life of a farmer who converted his family farm into an industrial animal factory then returned to a more sustainable system.Branding experts say the campaign could leave Chipotle vulnerable to attack. “This lays down the gauntlet,” says Dean Crutchfield, an independent branding consultant. “It had better be true, otherwise it would really blow up in their face.”Yet it proves that in an age when consumers are inundated with marketing, creative, provocative and compelling stories are the messages that resonate.“Chipotle really has an authentic message. A lot of marketers are scared to say something,” says Jesse Coulter, co-chief creative officer at CAA Marketing, the agency behind Chipotle’s campaign.Within a week of appearing online, the video had attracted more than 5.6m views, 96,000 Facebook likes, 11,000 tweets and 8,000 comments, according to Visible Measures, an online measurement firm. The companion mobile game, which lets players explore the dystopian world, has been downloaded more than 300,000 times.Chipotle did not buy any ads to promote the video but rather relied on the message spreading across social media, particularly among its target audience of “millennials”, or people about 18 to 33 years old. Study after marketing study shows that people are more likely to pay attention to a message if it is coming from a friend, rather than straight from the marketer themselves.The campaign comes as brands increasingly latch on to larger social causes in efforts to unlock emotional stories that are more engaging than traditional ad campaigns. Dove pioneered the strategy with its nearly decade-old “Campaign for Real Beauty” that makes little mention of its soaps and lotions but rather attempts to convince women that they are more beautiful than they think.“When you move away to say why you do things and not just what you do, you open up the opportunity to unlock the power of a story,” says Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates, a branding firm owned by WPP. “Stories that touch on fears and concerns tend to explode faster than stories about happy endings.”
78;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2013-01-16T23:17:38Z;Wall St softens despite robust bank results;;US equity markets were mixed on Wednesday as investors greeted a batch of strong earnings results from some of Wall Street’s leading banks with muted enthusiasm.The benchmark S&P 500 rose fractionally to 1,472.63 as most sectors on the index finished in negative territory.Financial sector stocks saw limited gains and rose just 0.1 per cent despite robust results from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which reported their performance for the final three months of last year on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs rallied after the investment bank said quarterly net profits nearly tripled to $2.8bn. The results, which were helped by growth in the bank’s lending business, were the best for the bank since the first quarter of 2010. Shares in the company rose 4 per cent to $141.09, reaching their highest mark since May 2011.Roger Freeman, analyst at Barclays, said in spite of recent strength Goldman’s stock still looked attractively priced relative to the value of its assets. He added: “That said, macro conditions still remain somewhat murky, and core activity-based revenues still need to move higher.”Gains for JPMorgan Chase were more tempered as its shares climbed 1 per cent to $46.82. The bank’s stock had traded lower for much of the morning even as its fourth-quarter results comfortably beat consensus estimates.JPMorgan said it had decided to halve the bonus for its chief executive Jamie Dimon, for management shortcomings that allowed the bank to suffer more than $6bn in trading losses last year.Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, reported a 23 per cent jump in fourth-quarter earnings. But its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $26.04 as analysts said the low interest rate environment would continue to hamper the bank’s performance.Northern Trust Corp, the investment management company, lost 5.7 per cent to $49.78 as it fell short of analysts’ consensus profit forecasts due to weakness in its foreign exchange trading income.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 13,511.23 as the blue-chip index was dragged lower by losses in Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer.Boeing dropped 3.4 per cent to $74.34 after it suffered another setback when one of its new Dreamliner 787 planes was forced to make an emergency landing shortly after take-off in Japan.The move sparked a decision by Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways to ground their entire fleets of the Boeing aircraft for inspection. Analysts warned that shares would experience further near-term weakness as investigations into the incidents continue.The Dow Transportation index has set a record high for the second day running, and its 6.4 per cent gain for the year to date outsripped the main equity benchmarks. Transportation companies are seen as a barometer of the broader economy’s future performance.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.2 per cent to 3,117.54. Apple, which had fallen by more than a quarter from its September high, recovered 4.2 per cent to $506.09. The iPhone maker had come under increased pressure during the previous two trading sessions on worries that demand for its smartphone was waning.Dell remained volatile and fell 4.3 per cent to $12.61 as investors speculated on reports that the company may be taken private by Silver Lake Partners, a tech-focused buyout group.Research In Motion rose 1.8 per cent to $14.74, adding to its recent run ahead of the release of its latest smartphone.Genworth Financial, the life insurer, soared after it announced plans to spin off its mortgage insurance business. The stock added 8.9 per cent to $8.85.Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 5.5 per cent to $280.94 after the fast-food restaurant chain warned that fourth-quarter profits would miss estimates because of higher food costs.Fresh economic data released on Wednesday showed that consumer prices increased slightly in December while industrial production rose for the second month in a row, signalling a recovery after an uneven year.
79;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2012-10-21T19:28:40Z;McDonald’s – cause for indigestion;Latest disappointing results could see investors going elsewhere to satisfy their appetite;"Investors aren’t lovin’ it, but they aren’t absolutely hating it either. In the third quarter, McDonald’s served up its second consecutive set of disappointing results and warned of more pressure to come. Net income dropped 3 per cent to $1.5bn from the same period a year ago, while revenues slipped only marginally to $7.15bn. That follows a 4 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit and flat revenues in the second quarter.With more than two-thirds of its revenue coming from outside the US, McDonald’s has been hit by the faltering global economy. Meanwhile, competition is heating up at home as Burger King, Wendy’s and Taco Bell, owned by YUM! Brands, are luring customers by rolling out some of the same strategies that have helped McDonald’s to prosper. Burger King now serves chicken wraps alongside Triple Whoppers, and “premium blend coffee” is poured at some Wendy’s outlets. And the cost of commodities is high.With all of that to swallow, some indigestion from the McStellar stock performance of recent years is no surprise. McDonald’s shares topped $100 in January, more than double their 2008 low. This year’s rumblings have siphoned off 12 per cent, including Friday’s 4 per cent decline. At $89, McDonald’s trades at 17 times this year’s earnings. That is below Starbucks (26 times) and YUM! (21 times), which have higher projected growth rates, but still no value meal.McDonald’s has some leeway, particularly in uncertain times, as it is viewed as big and stable. (Shares in younger and scrappier Chipotle Mexican Grill, for instance, fell 15 per cent on Friday on warnings of slowing traffic; they are down almost 30 per cent in 2012.) The world’s largest restaurant chain also carries a dividend yield of more than 3 per cent. But any more bad news and more McDonald’s investors might just get hungry and start looking elsewhere to satisfy their appetite for stability.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
80;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2012-08-13T19:09:57Z;Growth investing – a case study;An example of growth investing in two US restaurant chains;If the markets were truly Darwinian, would growth investors exist? They pay up for stocks with strong prospects. That is, they shell out for something that might materialise, in contrast to value investors, who pay less for assets that exist now. Looked at this way, there is a reason that growth investing does not have a hero like Warren Buffett. It’s stupid.Then you look at Panera Bread. In August 2007 a starry-eyed growth investor would have coughed up 24 times forward earnings to own the restaurant chain. Five years later, he has a return of 260 per cent, all driven by fundamentals: same-store sales growth has averaged mid-single digits, the number of restaurants owned by the company has risen by nearly half, and margins have widened. Who’s stupid now, Warren?Well, a very similar story might be told about Panera’s competitor Chipotle Mexican Grill. The company has a history of great growth and profitability. Its stock chart looks very similar to Panera’s – until last month, when it reported a quarter that despite being very strong by normal standards (20 per cent revenue growth) featured softer than expected same-store comparisons. The stock lost a quarter of its value.Is it possible to tell a Panera from a Chipotle in advance? Maybe. It helps to know the difference between expensive and very expensive. Before its blow-up, Chipotle was at 40 times earnings to Panera’s 27. It also helps to watch where the growth comes from. Panera’s average earnings growth over the past half decade is lower that Chipotle’s (19 per cent a year versus 25 per cent) but it has increased profit per store more quickly – Chipotle’s growth comes more from adding new restaurants. Steady but not frenetic unit growth, backed by improving economics at the unit level, is something even a value investor might buy into.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
81;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2012-02-07T00:17:28Z;Yum’s China margins prove unpalatable;;Yum Brands, the US-based operator of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, said that profit margins at its restaurants in China, where it has a dominant presence, narrowed sharply last year as labour costs soared.Margins at the group’s China restaurants declined by 2.4 percentage points to 19.7 per cent in 2011 from the prior year. Yum on Monday pointed to 20 per cent wage rate inflation along with an 8 per cent increase in commodities costs.Analysts have predicted that the risings costs of doing business in China would shrink margins at companies such as Yum, which has been investing heavily in the country.According to an analysis by Bernstein Research, Yum’s labour costs are the result of its rapid pace of restaurant openings in China but the company should eventually see its margins re-expand after those stores are up and running.Keith Siegner, analyst at Credit Suisse, said that he also expects margins to widen again in 2012, suggesting that the additional purchasing power that Chinese consumers are gaining thanks to rising wages will benefit Yum.“KFC and Pizza Hut used to be premium priced in China,” Mr Siegner said. “With rising wages, a much larger percentage of the population is able to afford them.”In spite of narrowing margins, Yum’s reliance on China continued to be evident in its fourth quarter and full-year results.“The highlight of 2011 was again the exceptional performance of our China business,” David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said.The company opened 656 new restaurants in China last year, driving a same-store sales increase of nearly 20 per cent.Overall, Yum had a strong final quarter, with net income rising 30 per cent from the same period in 2010 to $356m, or 77 cents a share, and company sales up 16 per cent to $3.55bn. The results were stronger than Wall Street analysts predicted and sent Yum’s stock price up 2.39 per cent to $64.70 in after-hours trading.Although Yum’s international restaurants have been thriving, its US business continues to be a drag. During the fourth quarter, same-store sales were up 1 per cent, led by Pizza Hut, which helped offset declines at KFC and Taco Bell.Taco Bell has been under pressure from Chipotle, another Mexican fast-food chain, and weathered negative publicity last year due to accusations that it was not using real beef in its tacos. This year, the chain faced another storm when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked Taco Bell to a salmonella outbreak that sickened nearly 70 people across the US.

The S&P 500 closed at 1,277.3, less than a quarter of a point up for the day, with financials bearing the brunt of selling, off 0.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $15.94, while the afterglow from Citigroup’s $2.5bn bond offering on Tuesday, its largest such debt issue since 2009, did not last long. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2 per cent to 12,418,42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,648.36, although the Nasdaq had opened sharply lower as technology stocks suffered.Ebay, the auction website, fell 3.8 per cent to $30.16 after Yahoopoached Scott Thompson from Ebay-owned PayPal as its new chief executive. Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent. Mr Lampert also reduced ESL’s stake in car parts retailer AutoZone to 12.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent, but after falling sharply at the open, shares recovered to close 2.2 per cent higher at $326.96.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 2.2 per cent to $348.75 after Goldman Sachs analysts added the fast food restaurant to its “conviction buy” list, tipping the company for earnings growth of 35-0 per cent this year as food costs fall, boosting margins.Shares in Chipotle rose almost 60 per cent in 2011 after more than doubling in value in 2010.Ford Motors rose 1.5 per cent to $11.30 as December sales rose 10 per cent, beating most analyst estimates. General Motors saw December sales growth of 5 per cent, which gave shares a 0.5 per cent fillip to $21.15.

MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."
83;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2011-07-26T21:24:16Z;McDonald’s adds fruit to Happy Meals;;McDonald’s is phasing out fries in favour of fruit for its “Happy Meals”, acquiescing to calls from the US government and health activist groups to sell healthier food to children.The US fast-food restaurant chain said on Tuesday its new children’s meals would come with a side of sliced apples and low-fat milk and that it would reduce the size of the fries by more than half. The meal, which launches in September, will have about 20 per cent fewer calories.“McDonald’s will always try to do the right thing, and we know we can help make a difference in our communities,” Jan Fields, president of McDonald’s USA, said in a statement. “The commitments we’re announcing today will guide the future evolution of our menu and marketing.”The company, which has faced withering criticism from health advocates, has already announced plans to reduce sodium, calories and fat in its food this decade.The move comes as food companies have been under pressure over marketing of unhealthy food. In April, the US government issued a proposal asking food companies to curb marketing that entices children with products high in saturated fat, trans fat, sugars and sodium. Ronald McDonald, the corporate mascot of McDonald’s, has been targeted by health groups as an ambassador of junk food to children.Steve West, restaurant analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said the healthier McDonald’s offerings would put pressure on other fast-food chains such as Burger King and Wendy’s to improve their menus. Quick service chains have already been facing competition from casual dining rivals such as Chipotle and Panera, which have stepped up the quality of their food.“There’s been a lot of political pressure on McDonald's,” Mr West said. “This is part of the transformation they’ve been making.”Michelle Obama, US first lady, lauded the announcement on Tuesday, calling the changes “positive steps toward the goal of solving the problem of childhood obesity”.Meanwhile, critics of the company offered cautious praise.“McDonald’s deserves credit for not only taking these steps, but for acknowledging its role in today’s epidemic of diet-related disease in so doing,” said Kelle Louaillier, executive director of Corporate Accountability International. “It’s a good first step, however, the corporation has yet to address the central issue – its aggressive brand marketing to kids.”Walter Willett, chairman of the Harvard School of Public Health’s department of nutrition, said, “This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t begin to compensate for the huge amount of soda, fries and other junk that McDonald’s promotes and sells.”McDonald’s said it would continue offering toys with its meals for children, in spite of calls for the company to stop including such trinkets.“It wouldn’t be a Happy Meal without a toy,” said Danya Proud, a McDonald’s spokeswoman.
84;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2011-07-04T12:21:47Z;US restaurants;Industry is resilient even though Americans are feeling the economic pinch;"Americans are officially feeling the economic pinch. In response, they are rounding up the family and head out for dinner.US personal consumption is slumping. Housing prices have double-dipped, according to Case-Shiller. And when the painful topic of household cutbacks comes up, eating out less is everyone’s first suggestion. Yet the habit has proven hard to break: restaurants represented just under ten per cent of total retail spending in 2006, according to the Commerce Department. In the last twelve months, the proportion is more than ten and a half per cent.Of course, less expensive restaurants are well positioned for a stressful environment, and have done well recently. So-called “fast casual” chains – a step up from burgers and fries, but you still pay before you eat – have stood out. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, for example, are at an all-time high.One would also expect mid-tier chains to be struggling as customers trade down. Yet, for now, they are hanging in: same-store sales at “casual dining” restaurants (nothing fancy, but there is table service and you pay after) grew 2.2 per cent year-over year in May, and have been stubbornly positive since February, according to Knapp-Track. Darden, operator of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains, reported solid earnings last week, and shares have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date.The industry is resilient in part because it is doing a good job of shielding its customers from food price inflation. Prices for food eaten at home were 4.4 per cent higher than a year ago in May, according to CPI data; restaurant price inflation was two percentage points less. To the extent that restaurants are protecting hungry customers’ wallets, their success is well-earned. But it will be hard to maintain indefinitely."

This helped the index post a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,273.26, up 1.5 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,809.44, a gain of 1.4 per cent over the last five days.Markets were given a further lift after Hosni Mubarak stepped down as president of Egypt, ending the uncertainty that has worried the markets for 18 days. The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 2.6 per cent to 15.68.But the gains following the resignation were modest as investors struggled to work out long-term effects. “This is a short-term release for the markets, but it could be a long-term negative. We know we are losing a friend, but are we gaining an enemy?” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Biotechnology stocks lost ground after Cephalon said its profits had fallen in the fourth quarter and that it had received a subpoena from the US Postal Service’s investigative arm seeking information about its cancer-pain drug Fentora.The shares were down 2.6 per cent to $58.56. Related stock Amgen lost 1 per cent to $53.74.In other earnings news, Expedia, the online travel company, reported a 30 per cent drop in net income for the fourth quarter. This fell short of expectations and sent shares down 17.1 per cent to $21.31. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also cut its recommendation to “neutral” from “buy”.Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, saw a successful first day of trading after its initial public offering. The shares were up 3.5 per cent to $31.05 after the largest private equity-backed US offering at $30 a share, valuing the company at $21bn.US shares in Nokia were down 14 per cent to $9.36 after it announced a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft to make Windows its main phone operating system to compete against Apple and Google in the smartphone market.But investors in Apple and Google were unruffled, with Apple up 0.7 per cent to $356.85, while Google rose 1.3 per cent to $624.50. Microsoft, however, was down 0.9 per cent to $27.25.The wider markets were given little direction from the Commerce Department’s balance of payments data for December. The figures showed that the US trade deficit had widened more than economists had expected at the end of the year. However, exports as well as imports continued to rise, pointing to a strengthening economic recovery late last year.The week was dominated by a spate of deal activity which drove the S&P higher. In other earnings news, Panera Bread, a bakery chain, jumped 16.5 per cent to $116.11 after the company lifted its full-year earnings estimate for 2011 to as much as $4.45 a share.Another restaurant chain, Chipotle Mexican Grill, rose 4.7 per cent to $268.73 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings on an adjusted basis of $1.47, beating the average estimate of $1.30.On Monday Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore drilling company.Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.Danaher was up 5.3 per cent to $51.61 over the week while Beckman Coulter was up 0.2 per cent to $82.78. Pride International gained 0.7 per cent to $40.08.This mergers and acquisition theme continued on Wednesday when NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange. NYSE gained 13.5 per cent to $38.31 over the week.Strong earnings results from McDonald’s and Walt Disney, up 3.7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over the week, also helped the wider market push forward to 2½-year highs.
86;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

We might see technology pick up, as there are elements of a real cyclical recovery here.”But airline stocks were largely unaffected after the snow kept many aircraft grounded, with the S&P 500 airlines index rising 0.4 per cent.AMR Corp, parent of American Airlines, added 1.4 per cent to $7.89, Delta Air Linesgained 1.8 per cent to $12.45 but US Airways nudged down 0.4 per cent to $9.87.Financials, which have risen 10.8 per cent since the start of December on the back of hopes for an improved economy in 2011 and a steepening of the US Treasuries yield curve, edged up further.The S&P 500 financials sector added 1 per cent on Monday with AIG soaring 9.3 per cent to $59.39, the most in the S&P 500.The bailed-out insurer signed $4.3bn worth of credit agreements, seeking to replace government finance with private funds.The shares have gained 42.7 per cent in the past month as the group put together plans for paying back the US government.Goldman Sachs rose 1.3 per cent to $169.83 after the bank adopted a provision in its executive pay scheme that will reward senior staff on their ability to meet long-term performance goals without encouraging “imprudent risk-taking”.Electric carmaker Tesla Motors fell 15.1 per cent to $25.55 after the expiration of a 180-day lock-up period following its initial public offering, but it remained higher than the IPO price of $17 per share.Shares in casual dining chains slipped after a newspaper story suggested that they could fall 20 per cent or more if the expectations for 2011 earnings are not met.Chipotle Mexican Grilllost 2.5 per cent to $222.56 and Panera Bread, a bakery chain, was down 1.2 per cent at $102.86.
88;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2010-08-29T19:06:05Z;US consumers split into two camps;;Consumer spending in the US has turned into a tale of two cities in 2010, with an entire segment of consumers splurging confidently on the finer things in life, while another segment, concerned about unemployment and with little or no discretionary income, spends only on bare necessities.This bifurcation of the US consumer has become apparent across the spectrum, from restaurants and grocery stores to products such as coffee and beer.In each case, a consistent trend has emerged: people who have survived the worst of the economic downturn of 2008-2009 with secure jobs are spending the way that consumers normally spend at the tail end of a recession. But unlike the circumstances after previous US recessions, where spending rebounded across the board, an entire segment of American consumers has been left behind.Steven Burd, chief executive of the Safeway supermarket chain, described the situation in an earnings call with analysts last month.“There are some people that still feel challenged and there are others that don’t,” Mr Burd said in response to a question about consumer spending. “There’s an element of the economy [where people] haven’t been laid off, it’s been two-plus years, they’re comfortable it’s not going to happen [and there’s been] some recovery in their investment portfolio.“They feel safe. They’re starting to spend. And then you’ve got another chunk of the economy that isn’t quite in the same position. So I think really consumer behaviour is a bit bifurcated here”.Safeway’s same-store sales declined in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier results. Whole Foods, a pricier chain of grocery stores offering organic products, reported an 8.8 per cent increase in same-store sales for its most recent quarter compared with 2009.“At least over the past year asset prices have rebounded and that helps high income individuals that would seem to align with the gut instinct that the upper end is spending and the lower end isn’t,” says Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan.Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University and vice-chairman of Forever 21, the retailer, describes it as “barbell” shaped behaviour by consumers.“People with money are not accelerating spending but are spending probably at the same levels as they have in the past – Mercedes and BMW are still going well,” says Mr Sohn. “But the middle-income folks in America have become extremely value-conscious.”With the exception of McDonald’s, most low-priced fast-food restaurant chains have posted weak growth in the US in 2010. Large food companies, including Kraft and PepsiCo, have also struggled with domestic sales.By contrast, same-store sales at higher-end restaurant chains such as Starbucks, Panera and Chipotle – where prices are higher than at fast-food outlets – have grown this year.At the high end of the restaurant category, steak house chain Morton’s reported an increase in quarterly sales earlier this year.At a time when US unemployment is 9.5 per cent, and a similar-sized chunk of the workforce is underemployed or not showing up on the unemployment rolls, there’s a huge divide among consumers, says Al Moffatt, chief executive of Worldwide Partners, a network of owner-operated ad agencies.“You’ll be around employed people, and it’s like, what recession?” Mr Moffatt says. “It’s incredibly well disguised. There’s some conspicuous consumption, but people skimp in other areas”.Conventional wisdom holds that in a down economy, cash-strapped beer drinkers are likely to trade down for cheaper malt beverages, but that rule does not appear to be in effect in the US this year.“Selected brands are doing well, but the whole low end is doing poorly now,” says Bump Williams, a Connecticut-based beer industry consultant. So far this year, shipments of beer in the US are down 2.6 per cent, Mr Williams says.The exception is in the high end of the beer sector where selected imports and super-premium beers are growing. The craft brewing segment, which includes speciality beers that come in 750ml bottles, is growing at a 15 per cent clip in 2010, Mr Williams says.
89;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Appetite grows for US ‘fast casual’ food;;The restaurant business in the US remains challenged going into its all-important summer season, but in one segment of the industry, known as fast casual, several groups have outperformed the giant fast-food chains and taken significant business from higher-end restaurants.Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which together make up more than 25 per cent of the fast-casual segment – which sits between fast food and casual restaurant dining – both posted double-digit percentage increases in first-quarter sales over the same period the previous year, driven by the opening of new outlets and robust increases in same-store sales.By contrast, US revenues at McDonald’s suffered in 2009 and, for the first five months of this year, same-store sales are up 3 per cent over the same period a year ago.Burger King, the other large chain, has struggled, with revenues in the US and Canada down 4 per cent for the first three months of this year.Yum Brands, which includes fast-food chains such as KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, also suffered from weak domestic sales.The more upmarket casual dining sector, consisting of family-style restaurants with table service and beer and wine, has been hit hard by the recession and growing unemployment.The fiscal year at Darden Restaurants ended in late May, but during the nine months ending in February, same-store sales were off 2.8 per cent at its chains, which include Olive Garden, Red Lobster and Longhorn Steak House. Revenues have dropped at another casual dining group, Brinker International, owing to the sale of restaurant lines.Analysts said the leading fast-casual chains have thrived by focusing on their core consumers – who tend to be employed with some disposable income – rather than by cutting prices in an attempt to expand their customer base downwards.Panera, a chain of 1,388 restaurants specialising in breakfast and lunch offerings, reported $364m in revenues for the first quarter of 2010, a 14 per cent gain over the same period in 2009. Same-store sales in the quarter rose 9.5 per cent.“We didn’t have the dips that other people had” in 2009, said Ron Shaich, executive chairman of Panera. “We decided that value was not defined by how cheap you were but by how much people want to go to you.”The National Restaurant Industry reports that traffic across all types of restaurants declined in 31 of the past 32 months.“That’s basically all tied to the economy, the drop-off in jobs, disposable income and confidence,” says Bruce Grindy, senior director of economic analysis at the trade association.
90;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2009-01-04T18:47:56Z;Pfizer chief’s cure;;Jeff Kindler beckons from the far side of the boardroom table and gestures towards the empty seat next to him. “Come and sit over here,” he says, glancing mischievously at his head of communications. “Ray won’t like it because he can’t kick me under the table.”The chief executive of Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceuticals company in terms of sales, relaxes as he slips off the jacket he was advised to put on for photographs, looking more at ease once restored to his shirt-sleeves: informal, engaging and ready for business.Our meeting has been switched at the last minute from the company’s Manhattan headquarters to its office in the heart of Washington DC, where Mr Kindler has just attended a morning panel on healthcare reform. Before that, the 53-year-old, who says his hectic schedule has forced him to give up golf, flew in from a short tour of his French subsidiary.Mr Kindler says he relishes the peripatetic management style. He picked up the habit of spot visits to local offices at the start of the decade when running restaurant chains for McDonald’s, including Chipotle Mexican Grill and Pret A Manger. “I got to know people on the frontline, dealing with customers, and gaining a clear appreciation that you get a lot more value being in the stores than in your office,” he says.His background is unusual for the head of a drug manufacturer, an industry more used to promoting scientists and other medical specialists from within than hiring an outsider. A lawyer turned corporate executive, his only link to the sector in his earlier life was to have been raised in New Jersey, home to several powerful rival pharmaceuticals groups.“I think I’m somebody who’s learnt the business pretty well,” he says. “By virtue of not growing up in the industry, I raise ideas that provoke and think differently. In every job I have had, I have learned many things about leadership.”Born in Florida, he studied at Tufts University and Harvard Law School before clerking for US Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. “He was very well known for his belief that the best decisions are made from very open, robust debate,” he recalls. Practising as a partner with Williams & Connolly, the law firm, he says “I learnt a lot about the value of understanding the facts you need to make a decision – that’s a pretty important skill”.At General Electric, where he was vice-president of litigation and legal policy, he says that under Jack Welch, the former chief executive, “I saw the idea of a very large company with scale and resources, driving decisions down to more focused business units”.After McDonald’s, he joined Pfizer as general counsel in 2002, rising by 2005 to join the four-person top executive committee. Then in summer 2006 he beat two veteran managers in the race to take over from Hank McKinnell, the sometimes abrasive chief executive.The company, which has annual sales of nearly $50bn (£34.6bn), may have needed a fresh perspective, but any breathing space to celebrate his success was brief. His predecessor left swiftly, soon followed by his two rivals and many other senior executives. By early December that year, he faced a still more troubling departure: Torcetrapib, the experimental medicine that Pfizer had bet on to defer the pain of its expiring patents on Lipitor, its cholesterol-lowering blockbuster, fell by the wayside.Safety concerns identified during clinical trials meant that he had to abandon the drug, reducing the solutions to the company’s most pressing challenge: the $13bn in annual sales threatened when Lipitor’s exclusivity vanishes – and prices plummet – in 2011.“It will be a meaningful event,” he says with considerable under-statement. “We will advance strategies to generate new and diverse sources of revenue growth and cost structures to position us to be strong after Lipitor.”The cost-cutting is already under way. Pfizer has slashed 10 per cent of its workforce of 100,000 since the start of 2007, reducing annual costs by more than $2bn. It has closed and consolidated dozens of factories and research and development centres, as part of a broader process of restructuring.Mr Kindler argues the result has been greater effectiveness. “We’ve become much faster and more agile, and eliminated so much bureaucracy. I wanted seven to eight layers from me to the bench scientist or the sales rep. In some areas, we had as many as 14 or 15. Hundreds of committees have been eliminated, and people empowered.”Research for each medical therapy area is now concentrated on a single site, within entrepreneurial teams of fewer than 150 people, each led by scientists. “One of the things we’ve learned is that the entire organisation ought to be able to meet for lunch in the café, and know each other,” he says.He has closed some therapy areas entirely and broken with tradition by spinning out research units and products no longer pursued in-house, such as Esperion, a company developing cardiovascular treatments. He has introduced development projects where the risk is shared with others, including a joint project with Bristol Myers Squibb on Apixaban to prevent blood clots.But he stresses that Pfizer has also invested, expanding into vaccines and biological medicines, for instance, and in the fast-growing emerging economies such as India and China where it has been present for decades. He does not rule out future acquisitions of any size, as long as they provide “strategic value”.The company is now run in a more decentralised way around a series of business units, each run by executives with authority to innovate. “I want leaders to be empowered,” he says. “My job is to select the right people to lead, decide capital allocation. It’s their job to deliver.”He cites how within 36 hours, the head of Pfizer’s generic drugs arm was able to make good on shortfalls in US supplies from an Indian rival when the Food & Drug Administration banned its products after concerns over quality. “In the old days, meaning two years ago, Pfizer would not have been able to do that. No one would have had the authority,” he says.“One of the most important things we are doing is recognising that one size doesn’t fit all,” he says. “How we do chronic care in China is very different from our work with oncologists in the US. There’s been a really fundamental change in the last two years that positions us for success in a very uncertain world.”There is little doubt that he has brought about considerable change at Pfizer in little more than two years. But much more will yet be required if he is to stave off an absolute drop in sales when Lipitor’s patent expires.Asked whether he manages by consensus, a little ice glistens in his eyes. “I believe in holding people accountable, making it very clear as to what they are accountable for, and giving them the resources to deliver on the commitments that they make,” he says. By the end of 2011, the same criteria will be applied to him.
91;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2008-02-23T04:02:04Z;Mark Sellers: Take advantage when good companies come to market;;"When Google completed its initial public offering in August 2004, the stock seemed overpriced. Even after reducing its IPO price from $108 to $85, the company’s trailing price/earnings ratio was well over 200. Journalists, analysts and market pundits exclaimed that Google was the most overpriced IPO in years, and warned investors to avoid it.Shortly after the IPO, analysts were confused about how to model the company’s earnings. The average analyst estimate for Google’s first quarter as a public company was 56 cents a share, but the range of estimates was all over the map. Clearly, there was no “consensus” earnings number. Most analysts were cautious.When Google then reported earnings in October 2004, its earnings per share were 70 cents a share, and the stock jumped 15 per cent in one day. Analysts then rushed to increase their estimates for the following quarter, but were again too cautious. The next quarter, Google beat the average analyst estimate by 15 cents, earning 92 cents a share compared with estimates of 77. The quarter after that, Google earned $1.29 compared with the average estimate of 92 cents.As it turned out, Google’s stock was incredibly cheap at its IPO price of $85. Over the following year, the company’s actual (not estimated) earnings turned out to be $4.27 per share. This meant that it was priced at just 19.9 times its forward earnings on the date of its IPO, though no one knew that at the time.We can learn something valuable from this historical analysis: great companies are often treated by the market as if they are merely average companies when they first become public. Over the first four to six quarters as a public company, expectations rise as analysts come to appreciate the company’s competitive position. At the same time, analyst estimates become more clustered around a consensus, which gives investors more certainty about the company’s earnings outlook.The interaction of these two factors causes a “double-whammy” effect: not only do earnings expectations rise, lowering the forward p/e ratio, but the risk premium priced into the stock falls. In other words, both the earnings outlook and the p/e ratio go up. These two factors work like a slingshot, causing the stock price to rise dramatically. Google, for instance, saw its stock rise from $85 to $280 in its first year of trading as earnings estimates rose and the p/e ratio expanded.There are other examples of this phenomenon. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 at a price of $42 a share, which was about 18 times trailing earnings per share. That seemed a fair price to many pundits, who said the stock was fully valued at that amount. But the company continually beat estimates because of its operating leverage and ability to fend off would-be competitors. The stock price responded by rising more than 700 per cent over the next three years as earnings expectations continually rose and the p/e ratio expanded dramatically.Another good example of this “increasing expectations” phenomenon is Morningstar, which went public in May 2005 at $18. Today the stock is $66, a 270 per cent increase.There are two fundamental factors all these companies share. First, they have an “economic moat”, or natural defence against competitors, allowing them to generate high returns on capital. Second, they have lots of operating leverage (as opposed to financial leverage); in other words, a 10 per cent increase in revenue translates into far more than a 10 per cent increase in bottom-line profits. Operating leverage is almost always underestimated by analysts when they are not very familiar with a company.When a company with these two traits begins to trade publicly, analysts are too cautious at first. They do not know the company that well, so their estimates are all over the place. Investors can play this to their advantage by buying and holding great companies when they go public, ignoring what pundits or analysts say and betting that analyst estimates will rise and become more clustered, causing the p/e ratio to rise at the same time as earnings expectations.Excess investment returns come from buying an asset when the market’s expectations are too low, and selling when expectations are too high. Nowhere are expectations off so much as when a great company first trades publicly. In August 2006, I highlighted two stocks here that I felt were at the beginning of this “increasing expectations” cycle: Mastercard and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since then, Mastercard is up 314 per cent and Chipotle is up 92 per cent.A future IPO that I’m excited about is Visa, which plans to go public this year and is certainly a wide-moat company (even more so than Mastercard) and has oodles of operating leverage. It remains to be seen whether analysts will underestimate its potential or not. I will be sure to comment on this in future columns, when the IPO date is announced.The writer is a former equities strategist at Morningstar, who manages Sellers Capital, a hedge fundmsellers@sellerscapital.com"
92;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;McDonald’s in new franchise move;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, is to sell 1,600 restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean to a franchisee, in a transaction that it says will contribute to focusing management’s attention “on the markets with the greatest impact on our results”.The company said it expected to receive about $700m from the sale of the restaurants to Woods Staton, an entrepreneur who formerly led McDonald’s in Argentina, and that the money would be used for dividends and share repurchases. It said it would record a $1.6bn non-cash charge on its balance sheet from the transaction in its second quarter, due to currency losses and the difference between the restaurants’ book value and sale price.McDonald’s said it in October it hoped to sell 2,300 restaurants to franchisees, as part of a long-term plan to own less than 30 per cent of its restaurants in a given market.McDonald’s on Friday reported first quarter earnings per diluted share of 62 cents, up 38 per cent on a continuing operations basis against last year, when results included for the quarter included the Chipotle Mexican Grill chain, which was subsequently sold.Revenues rose 11 per cent to $5.4bn while income from contiuing operations rose 33 per cent to $762m, supported by a $20m exchange rate gain. Jim Skinner, chief executive, cited continued strong growth in the US, where the company has recorded 48 months of comparable store sales increases. He said he was also encouraged by growth in Europe.
93;CMG;Chipotle Mexican Grill;2006-07-17T22:14:50Z;McDonald’s gains boost from menu expansion;;McDonald’s on Monday forecast higher-than-expected second quarter earnings as breakfast offerings and a Happy Meal promotion in the US helped drive strong global sales in June.The world’s largest fast-food chain said preliminary earnings were expected to be about 67 cents a share, including 10 cents of income from the sale of its 65 per cent stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill and two cents of expenses.Excluding one-time items, earnings would be about 59 cents a share, beating expectations of 56 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the same quarter a year ago, McDonald’s earned 42 cents a share, including a nine-cent charge.McDonald’s shares closed 5.1 per cent higher at $34.72 in New York.Global same-store sales – from restaurants open at least 13 months – rose a stronger-than-expected 5.9 per cent in June and 5.5 per cent for the quarter.McDonald’s has raised sales significantly in the past year by expanding its menu beyond burgers and fries.

He had earlier helped turn round Continental Airlines.The company said on Friday Mr Brenneman had accomplished eight consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth. He had agreed to continue to work with the board as a consultant during the transition.Brian Swette, a current independent director, would serve as non-executive chairman, the company said. In addition, Ben Wells, 52, senior vice president and treasurer, has been promoted to chief financial officer and treasurer.Burger King said in February it was planning to raise $400m through an initial public offering of stock.If completed, the flotation would seal a turnround of the company four years after Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs bought it for $1.5bn from Diageo, the UK spirits group.The transaction would rank as the largest IPO of a US restaurant company, ahead of a $339m offering from Dominos Pizza in July 2004. BurgerKing said in a regulatory filing that proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt.The IPO comes amid signs of heightened investor appetite for fast-food stock. The capitalisation of Wendys International, another burger chain, has risen about 50 per cent in the last year while McDonalds market value has risen 13 per cent in that period. The shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, spun off by McDonald’s, doubled their value on their debut day in late January.The board of Burger King said in a statement on Friday it was “extremely pleased” with the progress the company had made under Mr Brenneman.“We are confident that now is the right time to set in motion the next phase of the company’s development,” the statement said.

The shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, spun off by McDonald’s, doubled their value on their debut day in late January.However, Burger King would become a public company amid increasing competitive pressures in the industry. Increased health consciousness among consumers has forced fast-food chains to expand menus beyond the traditional fare of hamburgers and fries.McDonald’s has been successful at luring more customers to its restaurants with new menu items such as premium chicken sandwiches and salads, at the expense of Wendy’s, which has struggled to boost sales.Burger King has also added new items including omelette sandwiches and steak burgers.Meanwhile, the potential of the sector was reflected in the interest from activist investors such as William Ackman and Norman Peltz, which have taken stakes in McDonald’s and Wendy’s respectively and put management teams under pressure to change.Burger King’s private equity owners have hired Greg Brenneman, the executive who helped turn round Continental Airlines, to lead the company’s revival.In the year to June 30, Burger King reported net profits of $47m on revenues of $1.94bn at its 11,104 restaurants. That compared with a net profit of $5m on revenues of $1.75bn the previous year.Sales at outlets open at least a year have risen in the last seven quarters and the company has $207m in cash and equivalents and $1.07bn in debt and capital lease obligations.The IPO is underwritten by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

It sold the Donatos Pizzeria business back to its founder in December 2003 for an undisclosed amount.McDonald's previously announced that it would limit development of Chipotle and its Boston Market chain to the US in order to ""remain sharply focused on revitalising sales and service"" at McDonald's restaurants outside the USLegg Mason said in a research note: ""Chipotle may be spun off soon, which is not a surprise to us, given the 400-unit chain's success and McDonald's focus on its core brands. We believe cash raised would eventually make its way back to shareholders in the form of an increased buyback.""McDonald's plans to announce a global program in the next six weeks that will include a new ad campaign and more health-oriented menu items.The fast food giant has been the recent target of anti-obesity litigation. Earlier this week a US appeals court ruled that McDonald's must face a suit by New York teenagers seeking billions of dollars for allegedly hiding the health risks of its Chicken McNuggets.McDonald's also on Friday reported fourth quarter net income of $397.9m, or 31 cents a share, from $125.7m, or 10 cents a share, the previous year.Earnings were affected by a change in the way the company accounts for leases. Excluding items, McDonald's earned 45 cents per share, a penny below analysts' estimates.Quarterly revenues increased 10 per cent to $5.01bn while comparable sales at restaurants open more than a year increased 5.1 per cent.Full-year earnings reached $2.27bn, or $1.79 per diluted share. Revenues rose 11 per cent to $19bn. McDonald's forecast system-wide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 per cent and operating income growth of 6 to 7 per cent. It expects to add 350 net new McDonald's restaurants this year."
