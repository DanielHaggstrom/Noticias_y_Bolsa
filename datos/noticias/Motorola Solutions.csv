CCS expects the niche to continue to expand rapidly, with volumes of 54.5m by 2021.This is in contrast to growth of less than 4 per cent for the global smartphone market, which has slowed as more consumers have opted to hold on to their phones for longer. Dixons Carphone issued a profit warning last week, saying a lack of innovation in the mainstream smartphone market had pushed more consumers to opt for SIM-only deals for their existing phones, rather than buying a new handset.Yet the makers of rugged handsets have proved more active, in adding useful new functions to their handsets such as thermal imaging cameras and barcode scanners.The market for rugged phones is split between consumer models and more expensive ultra rugged ones. Consumer rugged phones include the Cat Phone, made by Britain’s Bullitt Group, Samsung’s Galaxy Active and Xcover models, plus ones from Japan’s Kyocera and lesser known brands including Evolveo and RugGear. Ultra rugged models aimed at industry are made by Sonim, Motorola Solutions and Bartec Pixavi.Rugged phones represent a small portion of the overall smartphone market, which is expected to reach 1.6bn unit shipments this year. Yet CCS believes more consumers that work in manual labour are using their rugged phones as a primary device, given improvements in the design of rugged phones to make them less “thick and bulky”.Bullitt, which makes phones on behalf of brands including Caterpillar, Land Rover and Kodak, and is Britain’s only remaining phonemaker after the demise of luxury brand Vertu, will reveal two new rugged handsets at the IFA Consumer Electronics Show in Berlin this week.Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, said that the durability of rugged phones makes the devices more attractive to consumers who are fed up with fragile phones. “The mainstream Android smartphone market is now dominated by a small number of large players offering similar looking devices with near similar features. Differentiation is becoming increasingly challenging,” he said.Tim Shepherd, a director at Bullitt Group, said: “The research clearly identifies a problem with many mobile phones and it’s understandable that consumers are becoming increasingly frustrated with the fragility of their phones not coping with the demands of their daily lives.”

He expects investment management skills to edge out consultants’ engagement skills.“The model is created around the client need, so it is not fundamentally dependent on whether an asset manager or consultant is the fiduciary manager,” he says. “What differs is the skillset the parties bring to the table and, clearly, an asset manager is adept at taking advantage of market opportunities.”Motorola Solutions, the technology group, recently awarded GSAM a fiduciary mandate to manage its US pension scheme. Then, in an independent process, it awarded it a similar mandate in the UK.Robert O’Keef, corporate treasurer at Motorola Solutions, oversaw the process of deciding on fiduciary management and seeking out the best candidate to implement it.“Consultants are very good at putting together a user interface for this very sophisticated process so that lay people can understand it. That resonated at the beginning,” he says. “We were agnostic at the start, but by the end we wanted to lean in to the investment side.”Motorola decided fiduciary management made sense because its pension liabilities and asset base are significantly larger than the company. Since managing such schemes needs considerable expertise and resources, outsourcing that seemed like a good solution.For a lot of smaller schemes the same lack of resources is a motivator to move to fiduciary management. However, eyebrows have been raised as they frequently move seamlessly from a consultant relationship to a fiduciary relationship with the same provider, with no competitive tendering process.Mr Ford says this is reasonable. The cost of weighing the options would wipe out the savings of moving to fiduciary management. He adds that a consultant relationship usually builds up so much trust between the parties that the consultant would most likely win the tender in any case.Ralph Frank, an independent consultant, is less insouciant about this process. “I would be really sceptical about that [cost-benefit analysis],” he says. “The duties of the trustees are the same, irrespective of the size of the scheme.”Mr Frank is attempting to shed some light on the somewhat murky landscape by developing performance measurement standards for fiduciary management, but has found it difficult to obtain sufficient data from providers to create a robust methodology.Simone Lavelle, a partner at Avida, the advisory company that acts as a management consultant for pension schemes, is also dubious about pensions choosing to appoint their erstwhile consultants as fiduciary managers without shopping around. “It means consultants can move from an hourly fee to a basis-points structure [charging based on assets under management], but the jury is out as to whether this provides value for money.”In Ms Lavelle’s opinion, fiduciary management, or implemented consulting as it is often called, requires more consideration and understanding than this simple transition allows. “It is not choosing a service, it is really more thorough. And it always has governance implications.”Trustees choosing to go down the implemented consulting route need to understand what tasks they are outsourcing and ensure there is no unnecessary replication, she says.Those implications are not standardised, as not all fiduciary mandates are the same. In fact, the lack of clarity as to what fiduciary management actually is has been one of the drags on its progress in the UK. It can range from complete outsourcing of everything except the strategic asset allocation decisions to a less comprehensive version where the implementation of the investment strategy is the only part outsourced.This variation is not necessarily narrowing, but potential clients are becoming more familiar with the concepts, says Mr Curtis. “There has been slow, incremental adoption of fiduciary management over many years. Essentially, as DB schemes continue to mature, the timeframe to ensure that pensions can be paid is shorter.”So far, the take-up has mostly been at the smaller end of the market, where it is relatively clear that schemes do not have the resources to perform investment management, but Mr Curtis believes the popularity of fiduciary management will slowly move up the scale ladder."

Recent surveys suggest a hung parliament, forcing either the Labour or Conservative party into a coalition government. Sterling has come under pressure in the lead up to the election, and implied volatility in the pound-dollar currency pair — a measure of expected volatility in the future — has climbed.US Jobs ReportJobs growth in the world’s largest economy is thought to have bounced back after a disappointing report in March showed the slowest monthly gain in more than a year. Economists expect the closely scrutinised non-farm payrolls report will show a 225,000 increase in jobs from a month earlier, with the unemployment rate projected to fall from 5.5 to 5.4 per cent.Greek PaymentDespite a sharp drop in Greek bond yields, investors will be watching for any news on negotiations between Athens and its international creditors over the weekend. The country gathered enough money to pay obligations due to pensioners and people familiar with the matter have told the FT that Athens should be able to make a €200m interest payment to the International Monetary Fund due on May 6.EarningsEarnings season in the US roars on, with more than 80 companies in the S&P 500 reporting in the coming days. The list includes Loews Corp, Walt Disney, Mylan, Kellogg, Electronic Arts, Fossil, Chesapeake Energy, Motorola Solutions, Twenty-First Century Fox, Whole Foods Market, Priceline and Monster Beverage.The Week in Four ChartsEven Germany’s safe-haven government bond market can suffer a sell-off. That was the surprise for investors this week, after prices of both short- and long-dated German tenors slid following a lacklustre auction of new government debt. The yield on the 10-year note jumped roughly 20 basis points to trade at 0.37 per cent — earlier in the month the yield had fallen as low as 0.07 per cent.Greek bond yields tumbled over the course of the week after Athens reshuffled its team negotiating with international creditors on a list of economic reforms to unlock bailout funding. While a deal remains elusive, the yield on Greece’s 10-year note declined to 10.23 per cent, roughly 300 basis points below a high reached earlier this month.Apple once again eclipsed consensus expectations for revenues, earnings and iPhone sales with its results for the second quarter, as it increased its shareholder return programme to $200bn, briefly sending its stock to a record.Results from the wider tech sector did not prove as lively. Twitter shares tumbled more than 25 per cent over a two-day period after the messaging company missed revenue expectations, prompting downgrades from Barclays and Janney Montgomery Scott. Yelp and LinkedIn also suffered stock price drops following quarterly results.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
3;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2014-04-15T17:22:57Z;Zebra / Motorola: all stripes;Hardware deals sound better when they seems like software;The best way to dress up an expensive hardware transaction? Make it sound like it is about software. That’s how Zebra Technologies, best-known as a maker of bar code and receipt printers used by manufacturers and retailers, is presenting its $3.5bn acquisition of Motorola Solutions’ enterprise unit.The latter business makes hand-held computers carried by delivery drivers, or those found in stores or warehouses. Rather than just selling gadgets alone, Zebra wants to enable an “internet of things” from them. These connected devices can collect data that is sent back to managers making supply chain decisions. This sounds more glamorous than selling printers. Glamour aside, investors in Zebra – who sent its shares down a tenth on Tuesday – have a dilemma. The all-cash acquisition is a big bite for a company whose enterprise value lies just below the deal value.Motorola Solutions meanwhile will be left just with its radio business, which targets government customers such as police departments. The sale proceeds will add to the nearly $7bn that it has returned to shareholders since separating its consumer mobile business in 2011.While Motorola streamlines itself, Zebra is making a highly leveraged bet on growth. Its purchase is mostly financed with debt, which will rise to above five times its operating cash flow. Prior to the deal, Zebra had a net cash balance of $400m and had used its strong cash flow to buy back $300m of shares in the past three years. With $100m of synergies (or a third of the Motorola unit’s profits), Zebra says leverage will quickly recede. Before Tuesday, its shares had rallied 73 per cent since the start of 2013. One could wonder – why spoil that with a risky deal? There is a compelling opposing view, however. With momentum in the share price and inexpensive debt, now is the time to wager on a space-age deal.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
4;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2014-04-15T03:00:19Z;Zebra to buy Motorola Solutions enterprise unit;;Zebra Technologies, the inventory tracking company, has agreed to buy Motorola Solutions’ enterprise business in a roughly $3.5bn deal that marks the latest in what has already been a bumper year for technology mergers and acquisitions activity.The all-cash deal, announced Tuesday, would create a behemoth in the specialised industry for tracking everything from groceries to car parts and underscores the demand for businesses that sit at the intersection of technology and the distribution of physical goods.Zebra, which has a market value of $3.44bn, helps Amazon keep track of its inventory, while Motorola’s enterprise business provides barcode scanners to thousands of shops across the world. A combined group would employ about 7,000 people and generate annual sales of close to $3.5bn, according to the companies’ 2013 filings.The companies and their products are part of the “internet of things” – a catch-all term for physical goods, often appliances, that intertwine technology and hardware to simplify day-to-day human activities.Technology experts expect the sector – which spans wearable devices, driverless cars and kitchen appliances that can predict when their owner needs to stock up on certain items – to be an important battleground for Silicon Valley’s established companies over the coming years.As well as producing tracking systems for large retailers, Zebra builds human-tracking technology that is used by sports teams to assess individual player performance and the microchips used for ski-resort lift passes.The deal is the latest in a string of transactions involving technology-backed businesses this year.Global M&A activity has been dominated by the telecommunications, media and technology industry in 2014, with $174bn of transactions in the first three months of the year – about a third of the overall deal market.
5;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2013-05-24T14:46:59Z;Sourcing from Africa’s Great Lakes: conflict-free or Congo-free?;;"Suspecting that the minerals and metals trade was funding conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the US Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act last August, requiring US-listed companies operating in the region to carry out checks on their supply chain for commodities including tin, tantalum, and gold.This week, five months into the first reporting year of the law, a US House of Representatives’ subcommittee on monetary policy and trade heard ‘for and against’ testimony about the impact of Section 1502 so far.Major companies have been playing ball, identifying the origin of the metals they use and publishing the names of smelters and refiners in their supply chains. In April, Hewlett Packard published the names of 195 tin, tantalum and tungsten smelters and gold refiners identified in its supply chain. Apple has been tracking its sourcing since 2010, and its 2013 report identified 211 smelters and refiners in its supply chain. In its annual report for 2012, Philips identified 127 tin, tantalum, tungsten smelters and gold refiners that it uses. Motorola Solutions and AVX have launched an innovative ‘closed-pipe’ sourcing initiative in Katanga province, in which tantalum from specified sites is sold to certified smelters.Proponents of Section 1502 acknowledge there is some way to go before the legislation achieves its goals. “The number of companies carrying out due diligence and sourcing from eastern DRC is still limited, largely as a result of the uncertainty created by the SEC’s 16-month delay in publishing the final rule for Section 1502,” said Sophia Pickles of the NGO Global Witness, in one of four testimonies heard by the sub-committee.But Pickles added: “In sites where closed-pipe supply chains have been set up, there are indications that the implementation of due diligence is helping to establish and safeguard conflict-free supply chains. Moreover, local monitoring groups have begun to identify and flag risks as they arise.”Industry bodies are more critical, citing unfortunate unintended consequences. By adding administrative costs, the legislation is said to be encouraging companies to avoid the region entirely, according to Rick Goss, senior vice president of environment and sustainability at the Information Technology Industry Council, a global trade association representing the likes of Apple, Canon, Kodak and Microsoft.“Major smelters report that a majority of their direct customers are demanding metals that are Congo-free, rather than conflict-free,” he told the subcommittee. Section 1502 had “led to a de facto embargo on minerals from the covered region, with serious consequences for local populations.” As a result, exports of tin, tantalum and tungsten from the eastern DRC have all but halted, he claimed.Worse still, the militias and mafia-type networks that Section 1502 was meant to eliminate have reportedly adapted and are now seizing revenues from timber, charcoal, cannabis and ivory, and even turning to human trafficking, illegal roadblocks and extortion. Corporate effort, Goss argued, is no substitute for “comprehensive international engagement” to resolve the political crisis in one of the world’s most troubled regions.Adam Green is senior reporter at This is Africa, an FT publication, where a version of this post was previously published.Related reading:

6;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2013-02-13T14:04:43Z;Activists keep tech sector on its toes;;The last time David Einhorn, the hedge fund activist behind Greenlight Capital, tried to nudge a large and venerable technology company into action, his pleas fell on deaf ears.In May 2011 he urged Microsoft’s board to sack Steve Ballmer, the company’s longstanding chief executive. “Ballmer does not care what Wall Street thinks and maybe that’s a good thing,” said Mr Einhorn, but “his presence is the biggest overhang for Microsoft stock”.Mr Ballmer remains in place, suggesting that the west coast still thinks investors in general – and the money men of Wall Street in particular – are a necessary evil to be tolerated, not indulged.Now Mr Einhorn is going after Apple, where he is trying to persuade the iPhone maker to set aside more of its $137bn cash pile for investors. The record suggests that the tech world has been highly receptive to the urgings of activists.Since 2007, when the veteran corporate raider Carl Icahn became one of the first to target tech by buying up stock in Motorola Solutions, the struggling mobile phone maker, there have been 70 different activists involved in technology companies, according to Activist Insight.Mr Icahn fought a battle to install a nominee on the board and agitated for a split of the company that finally occurred in 2011. Then, as he pushed for the company to sell its valuable portfolio of patents, Google turned up to buy one of the two new companies, Motorola Mobility, for $12.5bn.Mr Icahn also emerged a hero in 2008, when he forced Larry Ellison, head of software group Oracle, to raise its offer price for BEA Systems.The great majority of activist positions since 2008 – 71 per cent according to Activist Insight – have at least made money.In part, this reflects the rapidly changing nature of the technology business, where companies can rapidly swing in and out of favour, as well as the lack of takeover defences at most tech companies.One verteran banker says “a lot of tech companies grew up without a proper capital structure”, and are now being forced into behaving like more mature companies in other industries.Elliott Management, the $20bn hedge fund run by Paul Singer that is making a $2.3bn offer for Compuware, has acted as a stalking horse to flush out buyers in the past, teaming up with technology-focused private equity groups.For instance, Elliott took part in the buyout of MSC Software by the Symphony Technology Group in 2009 after initially trying to buy the company itself.More conventional agitation tactics have also worked on tech companies. Thomas Ivey, a partner at the law firm Skadden, says that “activists tend to win more than they lose when they run or threaten to run a short slate” – the attempt to elect directors to the board without pushing for control.For instance, Ralph Whitworth’s Relational Investors took a stake in L-3 Communications and agitated for a break-up, leading to a $2bn spin-off.Mr Icahn stepped down from the board of Yahoo in 2009, where he had tried to push the group into the arms of Microsoft, but last year Dan Loeb picked up the baton. The head of the hedge fund Third Point joined the Yahoo board after a letter-writing campaign that questioned the veracity of the chief executive’s CV, which led to his departure.Even where activists have failed in their explicit goals, the market reaction can help them out. Starboard failed to win a board seat at AOL, but the share price nearly doubled in the process.But some attempts at activism remain very much a work in progress. Mr Whitworth was invited on to the board of Hewlett-Packard too late to affect the hardware company’s purchase of UK software group Autonomy, but well before the consequences of that takeover caused the share price to collapse.Mr Einhorn faces significant opposition to his idea that Apple issue preferred stock as a novel route to access its cash hoard, with both of the main corporate governance advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, in opposition.But it is another sign of tech maturity. The veteran banker says that he talked to Steve Jobs several times about returning cash, but “he believed giving cash back to shareholders was ridiculous.”The banker says that only works so long as the share price goes up. “Founders have a hard time accepting that.”Apple though has a share price in the doldrums and a new chief executive, Tim Cook, who said this week that he is “seriously” considering returning more of Apple’s $137bn cash hoard to investors. Like most activists, Mr Einhorn can still come out ahead – even if he does not get exactly what he wants.
7;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2013-01-23T21:32:32Z;Record orders boost Motorola Solutions;;Record government orders for two-way radios and other public safety communications equipment helped Motorola Solutions report strong sales growth in the fourth quarter, but Greg Brown, chief executive, warned that the company’s core government business was likely to slow this year.The results helped offset weakness in the enterprise business which covers the sale of portable computers and other devices to corporate customers.The company, which was spun out of Motorola at the beginning of 2011, said sales to government agencies rose 10 per cent in the quarter to $1.7bn helped by federally mandated equipment upgrades in the US. For the full year they rose 12 per cent to $6bn, accounting for 69 per cent of the company’s $8.7bn in sales overall, which were up 6 per cent from $8.2bn.Mr Brown said he did not expect the record growth to continue. Government sales would probably grow “between 3 and 5 per cent in 2013”, he said.Motorola Solutions said overall net income from continuing operations rose in the quarter to $336m, or $1.18 per share, from $177m, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter operating earnings rose 17.3 per cent to $423m.Overall, fourth-quarter sales increased 6 per cent to $2.44bn despite a 3 per cent decline in enterprise sales to $733m. Excluding Psion– the UK-based portable device maker that was acquired at the start of October – enterprise sales were down 12 per cent for the quarter from a year earlier and operating earnings fell 10.5 per cent to $77m. Mr Brown said he expected enterprise to improve gradually this year. “We are cautiously optimistic,” he said.Overall, the company forecast earnings of between 62 cents and 67 cents per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2013, and said it expected first-quarter revenue to increase 4-5 per cent from a year earlier to between $2.03bn and $2.05bn. For the whole of 2013, it expects revenue growth of approximately 5-5.5 per cent compared with 2012.Shares of the company, based in Schaumburg, Illinois, fell 3 per cent to $56.34 in early trading on Wednesday but ended the day slightly higher.

9;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

11;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Wearable devices aid UPS;;Growing demand among business customers for ‘real-time’ data that can be used to improve efficiency or help employees make better decisions is fuelling demand for a new class of technology tools – wearable technology.For example, last week UPS, the US parcels and logistics group, rolled out a new type of ‘wearable’ scanning system for employees that speeds up the loading of packages into vehicles and provides more accurate and timely tracking information for its customers.The new device, made by Motorola Solutions, the US electronics group spun off from the old Motorola group at the start of 2011, consists of a Bluetooth-enabled hands-free barcode scanner that is worn on a finger and a small terminal worn on the employee’s wrist or hip.The ‘ring’ imager or scanner, which fits over two fingers, represents a major advance over an earlier system used by UPS because, unlike the earlier equipment that required employees to press a ‘trigger’ in order to capture a barcode image, the new system includes label-sensing technology that automatically scans the barcode. This allows UPS employees to capture and process barcode images more quickly.Once the barcode image is captured, the ring scanner sends each package’s tracking information via Bluetooth to the terminal worn on the wrist or hip. The data are then transmitted over WiFi to the UPS facility network and ultimately to UPS’s global data centres to be stored and processed and made available for customers.“It really is a big improvement,” says Juan Perez, vice-president of information services. The improved technology enables UPS to accelerate the transfer of package tracking data to customers and improves reliability through the system. Internally referred to as ‘link and load’, the scans are key to providing the tracking data that feeds the 32.1m tracking requests viewed daily on UPS.com.Girish Rishi, corporate vice-president and general manager of mobile computing at Motorola Solutions, added: “The ring imager, in combination with our robust wireless network and wearable mobile computer, increases scanning efficiency and streamlines the barcode reading process, ultimately improving worker output and cost efficiencies.”By capturing the service level and destination ZIP codes embedded in a barcode, the system can also verify whether the package is being loaded into the proper trailer or air container. An audible and visible alert identifies any package that is about to be loaded incorrectly to help UPS avoid routing errors.UPS began using the new system based on Motorola’s RS507 Bluetooth ring imager last year and by the fourth quarter of 2013 all of its 1,383 facilities will be equipped with more than 38,000 such devices.IMS Research, a UK-based research firm, published a report this week estimating that 14m wearable devices were shipped last year and that by 2016 the market for wearable technology will be worth at least $6bn. To date, IMS noted there are relatively few wearable tech devices, mostly focused on the healthcare and medical, and fitness and wellness application areas.
12;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Motorola Solutions raises sales outlook;;State and local governments in the US and internationally are continuing to invest in essential communications equipment despite the uncertain economic outlook, Motorola Solutions’ chief executive said on Wednesday.Greg Brown, speaking after the communications company reported solid second-quarter sales and operating profits, said the company saw a slight slowdown in European and Chinese orders, but that the outlook remained strong.Net profit fell to $182m, or 61 cents a share, for the second quarter, down from $349m, or $1 a share, a year earlier when the company recorded $291m in net earnings from discontinued operations reflecting the sale its networks business to Nokia Siemens Networks.Operating earnings in the latest quarter increased to $278m, or 12.9 per cent of sales, compared with $159m or 8 per cent of sales in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings per share from continuing operations jumped to 60 cents a share, from 14 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.Despite the economic pressures in Europe, the company expects third-quarter sales to grow by about 3 per cent over the same period last year and raised its full-year sales forecast from 5 per cent to between 5 and 6 per cent. Operating margins are expected to rise to 17 per cent.Underscoring this confidence, Motorola Solutions, spun off from the old Motorola group at the start of 2011, raised its quarterly dividend payout by 18 per cent to 26 cents a share and expanded its share repurchase programme by $2bn to $5bn.“Our strong revenue and earnings growth continues to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business,” said Mr Brown.He added that the government segment of Motorola Solutions experienced growth in all regions as public safety agencies upgraded their equipment to replace ageing infrastructure or keep current with government-mandated technology requirements.Overall sales increased 8 per cent to $2.15bn, from $1.98bn a year earlier.A 14 per cent increase in the government segment, which reported sales of $1.5bn in the second quarter, offset a modest 2 per cent decline in the enterprise business. Enterprise sales dipped to $689m partly reflecting the decline in iDen equipment sales to Sprint Nextel, which is phasing out its iDen network.Among enterprise business contract wins, Motorola Solutions signed deals with Tesco, CVS Caremark and Dunkin’ Donuts and a service contract with UK Mail Group that includes asset tracking, security management, software upgrades and device management.During the quarter, Motorola Solutions also agreed to pay $200m in cash to acquire Psion, the UK-based personal digital assistant pioneer.
13;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2012-06-15T17:34:00Z;Motorola Solutions buys Psion for $200m;;Psion, a famous name in UK computing and the inventor of the personal digital assistant (PDA), has been bought by Motorola Solutions of the US for $200m.Motorola’s all-cash offer of 88 pence a share, representing a 45 per cent premium on Psion’s closing price in London on Thursday, was unanimously recommended by Psion’s board.Long before Apple produced its ill-fated Newton PDA and Palm its Pilot handheld device, Psion came up with the Psion Organiser in 1984 – the first handheld computer, which appeared in the same year as Apple introduced the first Macintosh personal computer.The Psion device, in particular the Psion Organiser II, was much loved by computer buffs in Britain in the 1980s. They could store contacts, create an electronic diary, do calculations and even play simple games on its small two-line display.Psion, which stands for Potter Scientific Instruments after its founder David Potter, first made its name producing software for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum – early home computers in the UK.A community of developers grew up round the programming language and operating system Psion created for its organisers, producing a wide range of programs.The operating system was eventually renamed Symbian in 1998 as a partnership was formed with Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola to develop it for smartphones.Psion sold its share in Symbian to Nokia in 2004 and the Finnish handset maker announced last year it was phasing out Symbian as it switched to Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system.Psion produced more advanced Series 3 organisers in the 1990s, but it began to face competition from rivals such as Apple and Palm.In 2000, it bought Teklogix of Canada, a maker of rugged, wireless products, and this niche sector of ruggedised mobile computing has become its core business.“The offer by Motorola Solutions provides Psion's shareholders with certainty in an environment where certainty is in short supply,” John Hawkins, chairman of Psion, said in a statement on Friday.Greg Brown, Motorola Solutions chief executive, said: “Psion is a compelling opportunity to strengthen our industry-leading, mobile-computing portfolio with ruggedised handheld products and vehicle-mount terminals.”Psion has about 830 employees, customers in more than 50 countries and recorded sales worth £176m in 2011.The 88 pence a share offer represents a 66 per cent premium to Psion’s average price over the past six months.Motorola has already acquired 10 per cent of Psion’s shares and secured irrevocable commitments for another 17 per cent. The deal depends on the tender of 90 per cent of the shares and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.Psion will be incorporated into Motorola Solutions' Enterprise Mobile Computing (EMC) business. The companies did not say whether the famous brand would be allowed to disappear.
14;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2012-04-25T13:30:43Z;Government demand lifts Motorola Solutions;;Strong global demand for its government and public safety communications equipment helped Motorola Solutions report a 7 per cent increase in first-quarter sales which grew to $2bn.The US electronics group that spun off from Motorola at the start of last year reported net earnings of $232m equivalent to11.9 per cent of sales, compared with $169m, or 9.2 per cent of sales, in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 50 cents a share, compared with $1.07 in the first quarter of 2011, when the company recorded a $244m gain equivalent to 69 cents a share.Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2012 of $290m, or 14.8 per cent of sales, compared with $266m, or 14.5 per cent of sales, in the first quarter of 2011.“Motorola Solutions had a great start to the year by posting record first-quarter sales and operating earnings while also returning approximately $1.4bn to shareholders,” said Greg Brown, chief executive.The company’s government segment, which won a string of new contracts with government departments in the US and elsewhere, reported sales of $1.3bn, up 11 per cent from the year-ago quarter and operating earnings of $150m compared with $99m in the year-ago quarter.Enterprise segment sales fell by 2 per cent to $655m from the year-ago quarter, however, reflecting a $31m decline in sales of iDen telecoms equipment. Sprint Nextel is phasing out its iDen network.Excluding iDen, sales were up, driven by growth in North America and Asia Pacific, and the unit recorded operating earnings of $82m, or 12.5 per cent of sales, compared with $70m, or 10.5 per cent of sales, in the year-ago quarter.During the first quarter of 2012, the company generated $69m in operating cash flow from continuing operations. Operating cash flows in the quarter took an approximately $200m hit related to the timing of certain annual incentives historically paid in the second quarter and a legal settlement.During the quarter, the company repurchased $1.4bn in stock, paid $70m in dividends and ended the quarter with total cash of $3.8bn.
15;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2012-02-27T22:49:01Z;Motorola Solutions to buy bulk of Icahn stake;;Motorola Solutions has agreed to spend nearly $1.2bn buying back the bulk of the stock held by Carl Icahn, the Wall Street activist investor who played a key role in prompting the old Motorola to split into two companies last year.The company, which makes public safety communications equipment, handheld computers for business and enterprise communications systems, is buying back the stock as part of a $3bn stock repurchase programme.Under the agreement with Mr Icahn, disclosed in a regulatory filing, the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company is paying $49.15 each for the 23.7m shares and Vincent Intrieri, Mr Icahn's representative, will resign from the board.The shares closed up 1.5 per cent at $50.15 on Monday.At the end of last year, Mr Icahn was Motorola Solutions' largest shareholder, with a stake of 11.76 per cent, or 38.3m shares. After the repurchase, he will hold less than 5 per cent of the stock.In a statement, Greg Brown, Motorola Solutions chief executive, thanked Mr Intrieri for his service and said “his contributions, along with Carl's, have been constructive and are appreciated.”Mr Icahn first began acquiring Motorola shares in 2008 and ultimately won board representation in exchange for the investor abandoning a proxy fight. He then argued strongly for the split up of Motorola into two separate units, which became Motorola Solutions and Motorola Mobility, a smartphone maker.In Motorola Mobility, where he was also the largest shareholder, Mr Icahn argued strongly that the company should seek to maximise the value of its large patent portfolio. Motorola Mobility subsequently agreed to a $12.5bn bid from Google, a deal which is expected to complete shortly.
16;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2012-01-30T21:41:30Z;US stocks lower amid caution on new year rally;Equities down on eurozone worries and analyst warnings;Several analysts urged investors into US pawn lenders on Monday, a group of stocks that have sat out the recent market rally but continue to exhibit strong loan growth.EZCORP, Cash America International and First Cash Financial Services, have all fallen at least 5 per cent since October 3, as the S&P 500 has rallied 18.9 per cent. Bill Carcache at Nomura noted they were “trading near the low end of their historical trading ranges”, although all three reported year-on-year growth of at least 13 per cent in the fourth quarter.Daniel Furtado at Jefferies dismissed concerns a recovery in the US economy would hit demand for pawn loans, noting that an estimated $55bn of credit had been withdrawn from non-prime borrowers since 2009.“As credit card companies and traditional banks continue to rein in lending we continue to see [pawn lenders] as a direct beneficiary,” Mr Furtado told clients.Both analysts warned of lingering regulatory risks: pawn companies endured their biggest one day sell-off this year on January 4, when President Barack Obama appointed Richard Cordray as a director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is leading a review of payday lending.Share price reaction was mixed, with EZCORP off 2.7 per cent to $26.69, Cash America International flat at $43.52 and First Cash off 1.5 per cent to $40.08.Elsewhere, US stocks opened sharply lower, as the latest eurozone summit exposed ongoing disagreements over Greece’s austerity programme and a planned fiscal discipline pact, while in the US analysts cautioned against new year exuberance.At midday in New York the S&P 500 was off 0.7 per cent at 1,307.10, having earlier touched 1,300 for the first time in a fortnight. But the benchmark US index remains almost 50 points above its 200-day moving average, an indicator of bullish sentiment, and is up 4 per cent for the year.“We suspect stocks are due for a near-term correction, driven by economic data and worsening seasonal supports,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior markets analyst at Wells Fargo, summing up the caution of most analysts.Jan Loeys at JPMorgan was a rare voice arguing the rally had further to run: “We are getting fundamental support, with improved economic data and central banks signalling even further easing. We … thus feel comfortable retaining a significant long in risk assets,” he told clients.With Monday signalling a relative breather in the S&P 500’s fourth-quarter earnings season, stocks shifted on analyst notes.Goldman Sachs updated its large bank recommendations, with analysts downgrading Bank of America shares to “hold”, citing “execution risks” as the bank seeks to reduce costs without reducing earning power. BofA shares were off 3.4 per cent to $7.04, the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The blue-chip heavy index was off 0.6 per cent to 12,581.94, while the Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.4 per cent to 2,605.77, as Apple continued to rally after the stellar results it announced last week. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $452.08, a dollar off last week’s all-time high.Morgan Stanley fell 1.5 per cent to $18.29 as Goldman’s bank analysts added their investment banking rival to a “conviction buy” list, arguing Morgan Stanley had successfully addressed “legacy issues from the financial crisis”.Motorola Solutions opened sharply higher after the company increased its stock buy-back programme to $3bn from $2bn. But shares pared gains and were off 0.2 per cent at $45.72. Among the few companies that did report results on Monday, shares in Gannett slumped 7 per cent to $14.15, as earnings at the media group fell by a third on lower advertising sales.US Steel fell 2.9 per cent to $29.02 after announcing it would sell US Steel Serbia to the Republic of Serbia for what it called a “nominal” price. The company expects to record a loss on the deal in results for the current quarter.Netflix continued to glide upwards, with shares climbing 1.2 per cent to $125.33. The stock has now rallied almost 80 per cent this year as positive fourth-quarter earnings added momentum to share price gains last week, forcing short-sellers to close out positions.As of mid-January, Netflix had been among the top five most-shorted shares in the S&P 500, but Data Explorers estimates the percentage of Netflix shares on loan to short sellers fell from 12.5 to 10.7 last week.Several analysts urged investors into US pawn lenders on Monday, a group of stocks that have sat out the recent market rally, but continue to exhibit strong loan growth.
17;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-11-16T00:15:14Z;The new crop of enterprise-class tablets;Motorola, Panasonic and HP take on the iPad;Over the past few weeks, I have been pondering the future of PC tablets in the workplace, spurred on in part by the recent unveiling of several tablets which, unlike Apple’s iPad itself, have been designed specifically for corporate use.Like Cisco Systems’ pricey Cius business tablet, two of the new tablets – Motorola Solutions’ ET1 Enterprise tablet and Panasonic’s 10-inch A1 and 7-inch B1 Toughpads – run the latest version of Google’s Android operating system, while Hewlett-Packard’s Slate 2 PC Tablet runs Microsoft’s Windows 7The ET1 and both Toughpad models are also designed to be a lot more rugged and durable than consumer-focused devices such as the iPad which their manufacturers claim will result in a lower total cost of ownership for the devices, despite their relatively high initial price.Despite their differences, all the new tablets owe a big debt to the iPad which, although it was never designed for the business market, has been widely adopted by corporate customers, particularly those in the financial services, healthcare and retail sectors.The overall market for tablets is expected to grow by 60 per cent next year, according to IDC. But despite this continued strong growth and the wider availability of a host of iPad rivals, mostly based on Android, almost all the tablets in use in companies today are iPads. Good Technology, which manages mobile device services for many business customers, suggested that the iPad represented more than 95 per cent of tablet activations for its corporate clients in the second quarter this year.Similarly, MicroStrategy, which build business intelligence applications for clients, says most of its deployments are on iPads.“We have seen demand for Android, particularly in Asia or from, let’s say, some of the device manufacturers themselves,” said Daniel Kerzner, senior vice president of MicroStrategy’s mobile division.“In particular, I’d say, Android comes up the most in environments where people are going to, what’s called BYOD, bring your own device,” he said. “In those ecosystems, we see more demand for Android because it just naturally reflects the percentages in the marketplace.”Nevertheless, when companies are buying the devices themselves, he says most are buying iPads. Apple itself has now acknowledged this corporate demand and has introduced a program that lets corporate customers write and distribute their own apps to employees without going the iTune store approval process.Some IT managers, however, are still not comfortable with Apple products and seek better integration with their mostly Windows-based existing infrastructure and features like enterprise-class security and device management, elements which HP touted this week in its new Windows 7-based Slate 2.The Slate 2 Tablet PC, introduced just over two months after HP abandoned it WebOS consumer tablet, is aimed at business users and vertical markets such as education, healthcare, government and retail. It comes with an 8.9-inch touch screen, solid state storage and weighs 1.5 pounds, slightly more than the 1.33 pound iPad 2.Android-based tablet vendors undoubtedly sense a market opportunity. Motorola Solutions and Panasonic are both betting that with devices more focused on the particular needs and requirements of business users, they can tap into this sentiment and tip the scales away from the iPad, at least a little bit.For example, Panasonic’s two new tablets both include enterprise features integrated deeply into an Android stack. In practical terms, that means they can be locked down from a security perspective and managed from an IT perspective. Manageability features such as remote software update, device wipe and status reporting increase the Toughpad’s control and security, reduce support costs, and minimise downtime.Panasonic has also chosen to differentiate its Toughpads by incorporating 4G wireless data modems, making the devices particularly attractive to mobile sales, maintenance or engineering staff who might, for example, want to view streaming video. The new tablets are due to ship in spring 2012.Like the Toughpads, Motorola’s ET1 Enterprise tablet is also built from the ground up to cope with the rough-and-tumble of life on a shop floor, warehouse or building site and has a hot-swappable battery pack designed to last a full work day.Motorola Solutions says the ET1 has been designed to provide the ease of use and familiarity of a consumer-class tablet along with enhanced durability, an optional barcode scanner and magnetic stripe reader and secure system software as demanded by business customers. The company will also be selling secure multi-slot recharging stations.I got to play with the device a few weeks ago and found it as easy to use as a consumer Android-based tablet like Samsung’s Galaxy tablet family. Aping its consumer counterparts, the ETI even has front-and-rear facing digital cameras. But my favourite feature was actually a decidedly low-tech option – a clever hand strap that enables a user to securely hold the device in one hand while using the other for navigating the screen.So for example, with the ET1 strapped to one hand, a retail store assistant could use the device’s 7.2-inch colour screen to help a customer find a particular product or look up inventory to see if an item is in stock.The WiFi-enabled ET1 is password-protected so it can be shared and provisioned for each employee according to his or her level of responsibility and access rights. Based on login information, IT managers can automatically control and monitor the use of approved applications to help ensure on-the-job productivity is not compromised.Along with the new hardware, Motorola also unveiled a web application development package based on the HTML5 standard called RhoElements which is designed to allow businesses to quickly and cost-effectively develop and deploy web-based applications. The toolset can be used to develop apps for existing Motorola Windows Embedded Handheld (formerly known as Windows Mobile) and Windows Embedded Compact (Win-CE) mobile computers as well as the Android-based ET1 enterprise tablet.Both the ET1, which is expected to cost around $800 in volume, and RhoElements will be available this quarter and should help expand the corporate market for PC tablets.
18;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-10-27T15:21:09Z;Motorola Solutions raises full-year outlook;Mobile computing and government orders drive earnings;Motorola Solutions, which provides telecommunications equipment, reported stronger-than-expected third quarter sales and profits and raised its full-year outlook, thanks to strong demand from companies for mobile computing and wireless networking equipment.Motorola Solutions, formed at the start of the year when the old Motorola company was split in two, reported a profit of $128m or 38 cents a share, up from $110m, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding stock-based compensation and certain other items, adjusted earnings per-share from continuing operations increased to 65 cents from 54 cents. Gross margin dipped slightly to 50.4 per cent from 50.5 per cent.Sales increased by 10 per cent to $2.1bn, boosted by particularly strong growth in Asia and Latin America. Product sales increased by 9.6 per cent, while service revenue rose 5.7 per cent. Government sales increased 8.8%, and the enterprise business posted a 13% jump.The company, which provides telecommunications equipment, such as two-way radios for police and emergency workers, and handheld mobile computers, PC tablets and WiFi equipment to corporate clients including retailers, now expects full year revenue to grow 7 per cent.Despite the uncertain global economic outlook, Greg Brown, chief executive, said demand for its core products and services remained strong, with sales to enterprise customers in particular growing by double digits in several markets, underpinned by the shift towards mobile computing.As a result the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company said fourth quarter sales are expected to grow by 2 or 3 per cent and earnings per share from continuing operations will be between 78 cents and 83 cents.
19;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-10-13T20:05:17Z;Visionary pushed bounds of wireless devices;;"Robert Galvin, the former chief executive of Motorola, who oversaw the company as it developed the first mobile phone and network, died on Tuesday in Chicago.Mr Galvin, who was 89, presided over the company for nearly three decades until 1990, after taking the helm in 1959 following the death of his father, Paul Galvin, who founded Motorola.During Mr Galvin’s tenure, Motorola pushed the bounds of wireless consumer devices, from pagers to hearing aids, computer circuits, television and radio communications equipment for police forces, the US military and for Nasa’s space travel programme, including the US Moon landing in 1969.“We lost a transformative leader and visionary,” said Sanjay Jha, chief executive and chairman of Motorola Mobility.The company grew from $290m of annual sales in 1959 when Mr Galvin became chief executive to $10.8bn in 1990 when he stepped down as chairman.Born in 1922 in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Robert William Galvin attended Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois. He attended college briefly before dropping out to join his father’s company in Chicago, which was then called Galvin Manufacturing Corporation.He began as a stockroom apprentice in 1940 and worked in all factory departments. He served in the Army Signal Corps, which tested and managed military communications, during the second world war. He was named a director in 1945.While ultimately best known for its mobile phones, Motorola brought out a wide range of familiar electronic devices under Mr Galvin’s tenure, from 8-track tape players to a TV business it sold in 1974.Among the lines of business he approved that went nowhere was Astronaut TV, a 19-inch cordless portable television launched in 1960, which failed to achieve much altitude with sales. But Motorola did provide communications for Nasa space missions for decades.The year he became president in 1956, the Handie-Talkie was introduced – its first radio pager.Motorola split into two companies last January: Motorola Mobility, which keeps the company’s mobile devices and TV set-top boxes and recently agreed a takeover by Google for $12.5bn, and Motorola Solutions. Motorola Mobility praised him for “leading the creation of the global cellular telephone industry from the introduction of the first portable cell phone prototype, the DynaTAC, to the first pocket-sized ‘flip phone’, the StarTAC, in 1996”.New management practices known as Six Sigma were developed under Mr Galvin in the 1970s to improve quality. They were adopted by other companies and have become a popular methodology in many industries to improve efficiency.Mr Galvin stepped down as chief executive in 1986 but remained as chairman until 1990. He continued to advise the board and his son, Christopher, when he became chief in 1997. Christopher Galvin was ousted by the board in 2003.In retirement, Mr Galvin founded an investment management group with his two sons, Harrison Street Capital, and created two think-tanks, the Galvin Electricity Initiative, now the Perfect Power Institute focused on developing clean power, and the Galvin Transportation Initiative, which sought to eliminate urban car congestion. He wrote several books, including America’s Founding Secret and The Idea of Ideas.In his spare time, Mr Galvin – who was known as Bob – enjoyed tennis, alpine skiing, water skiing, and wind surfing.He is survived by his wife of 67 years, Mary Barnes Galvin, and their four children, Gail, Dawn, Christopher and Michael; as well as 13 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.A wake will be held on Monday in Skokie, Illinois followed by a funeral mass and reception on Tuesday in Winnetka, Illinois."

BofA shares have lost more than two-fifths of their value since the last regulatory filing, when Paulson & Co was one of the top 10 shareholders in the bank.The $38bn hedge fund also cut holdings in Citigroup by 19 per cent to 33.5m shares, a stake now worth $1.05bn, but increased its stake in Wells Fargo by two-thirds to 33.6m shares, or $840m.Mr Paulson’s position in the banks has been based on a view that the true earnings power of US financial institutions has been understated by several years of loan impairments that would be reversed as the economy recovered.The filings capture Paulson & Co’s stock holdings before a turbulent August. As of August 5, Mr Paulson’s flagship Advantage Plus fund was down 31 per cent for the year so far, according to a letter sent to investors in which he reassured them that the funds had not been hit by significant redemptions.Paulson & Co declined to comment.The largest publicly disclosed position of the hedge fund remains its holding in the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund, worth $4.6bn at yesterday’s close in New York.In other regulatory filings released on Monday, the family office for George Soros also disclosed details of its positions. It appears that Mr Soros backed the wrong Motorola stock, selling down his stake in Motorola Mobility and raising it in Motorola Solutions just before Google announced the acquisition of the former.
21;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-07-29T18:30:27Z;Groups wary of parting with their money;;Companies round the world queued up this week to tell investors how tough life is, as the half-year reporting season got into full swing.In Asia, Sony reduced its full-year profit forecast by 25 per cent and Nintendo cut the price of its latest handheld console because of poor sales. In Europe, results from Alcatel-Lucent missed expectations, while Daimler and Peugeot warned of softening demand. In North America the chief executive of United Parcels Service warned that its customers lacked confidence and Ford said the second half of the year would be weaker than the first.There were some exceptions. Wealthy Asians keep buying luxury goods, helping profits at LVMH to rise by 25 per cent. Elsewhere, people are turning to comfort food for solace– US chocolate maker Hershey raised its earnings outlook while shares in Dunkin’ Brands, the owner of Dunkin’ Donuts, closed up 47 per cent after their New York debut on Wednesday.Such bright spots were few and far between though, and against a backdrop of debt crises on both sides of the Atlantic, chief executives are erring on the side of caution. There was more evidence this week that companies are hoarding cash. Moody’s said the US corporate cash holdings rose to $1,240bn (£754bn) at the end of 2010, an 11 per cent increase on the position at the end of 2009.Balance sheet strengthening has been a long-term trend, and aside from the odd acquisition – a foray into emerging markets here, a new product line there – companies have generally been reluctant to open the purse strings.Shareholders are getting restless though, and this week there was evidence that such restlessness can pay dividends. Verizon Communications, the US telecoms operator, had finally conceded to Vodafone’s demands that Verizon Wireless, the mobile business the two companies jointly own, should pay a dividend. Vodafone will receive $4.5bn, most of which it will pay out to its own shareholders.British Sky Broadcasting, after months of News Corp-related uncertainty, announced a £750m share buy-back programme. And Motorola Solutions, a telecoms equipment business, said it would buy back $2bn of shares.But such examples are still the exception, rather than the rule. Even in the oil and gas and mining sectors, where high energy and commodities prices are providing healthy earnings growth, companies are reluctant to part with their money. Investors hoping for a big increase in either investment or cash returns will have to wait.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent to 12,240.11, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.05 per cent to 2,766.25.Thursday’s fall brings markets to their fourth day of losses and sets up a week likely to end in the red ahead of a weekend expected to be full of last-minute negotiations before the August 2 deadline. Friday also includes the first reading of the US second-quarter gross domestic product figures, which economists expect to increase by just 1.8 per cent, below the lacklustre first-quarter reading of 1.9 per cent.“[An] impasse in Washington and risks of inaction crept into market sentiment, leading to weakness across asset classes, including falling equity prices, slightly wider corporate credit spreads and modestly higher rates in the Treasury markets,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Capital Markets.Improved weekly jobless claims and homes sales helped to boost sentiment somewhat.New claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, dropping below 400,000 for the first time since early April, though the moving average remained above the 400,000 mark. Data showed pending home sales rose 2.4 per cent in June, following an 8.2 per cent surge in May as more buyers signed contracts on houses.“This looks like very good news; a sustained drop in claims is essential if we are to be proved right in our view that the economy will rebound quite strongly in the second half,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “Claims are noisy on a week-to-week basis even when the underlying trend is clear, and right now it isn’t.”Following Dunkin’ Donuts debut on Tuesday, Teavana closed at $27.80 in its first day of trading, a 63.5 per cent premium over its initial offering of $18. The tea retailer was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile carrier, reported a loss for the 15th consecutive quarter as more customers dropped their contracts, with its second-quarter loss registering at $847m or 28 cents a share.The results, which were significantly worse than expectations, sent the shares down sharply, falling 15.9 per cent to $4.34 – its worst day of trading in nearly three years.The carrier dragged the S&P telecoms sector down 2.2 per cent. AT&T fell 2.3 per cent, the Dow’s worst performer of the day, and Verizon lost 1.5 per cent.Motorola Solutions, the non-handset business, reported strong results with increased sales due to healthy demand in its government and enterprise segments. Its shares rose 4.7 per cent to $46.37.US insurers also gained on strong results from Aflac late on Wednesday, which reaffirmed its full-year profit outlook. Shares in the insurer rose 4.2 per cent to $45.98.Among other insurers, Aetna gained 0.6 per cent to $41.99 and Cigna added 0.4 per cent to $50.21.The materials sector fared a little better in the S&P, led by DuPont and Dow Chemical.DuPont, which was little changed up 0.04 per cent, reported quarterly profits that beat expectations on strong sales, including those of Kevlar bulletproof vests.ExxonMobil announced earnings per share of $2.18, which missed expectations of $2.30 despite a 41 per cent rise in its second-quarter profits. The world’s largest publicly traded oil company said higher oil prices helped boost second-quarter profits. Shares fell 2.2 per cent to $81.46.Colgate-Palmolive‘s results just surpassed expectations, with sales rising in Latin America by 17 per cent. Sales in North America slumped 3 per cent. Shares in the household goods company fell, down 0.7 per cent to $84.88.“While we like to see Colgate trying to restore market share momentum in the US, we are also relieved that North America represents only approximately 20 per cent of [earnings], so weakness in this region doesn’t have an overwhelming impact on overall results,” analysts at Citigroup said.Amazon, the online retailer, also reported results after the bell on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, but showed lower margins. “Ancillary growth drivers”, including the Kindle and forthcoming tablet computer, as well as market-expanding opportunities, will help offset these margins, Canaccord Genuity analysts said.Shares were 0.6 per cent higher to $223.90 on Thursday."
24;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-07-28T21:37:57Z;Motorola Solutions plans $2bn buy-back;;Motorola Solutions reported strong second-quarter results, raised its full-year revenue and operating earnings guidance and announced it would buy back up to $2bn of its shares, underscoring the board’s confidence in the outlook for the company.The company, which provides communications products and services to business and government customers and is based in Schaumburg, Illinois, was spun off the Motorola Mobility smartphone business as a separate quoted company at the start of this year and subsequently sold its telecommunications network equipment business to Nokia Siemens Networks for $975m. It added that it would start paying a quarterly dividend of 22 cents a share in October.Operating earnings of $170m compared with $161m in the year-ago period, while earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.17, compared with $0.01. Sales increased by 6 per cent to $2.06bn.Greg Brown, chief executive, said: “Our solid revenue growth and improved operating leverage further demonstrate the strength of our business. Based on this performance, we have raised our full-year outlook. Additionally, the dividend and share repurchase programme reinforce our commitment to return capital to shareholders while maintaining strategic flexibility.”Mr Brown said that both the government and enterprise business segments performed strongly in the latest quarter. Sales to government, which include walkie talkie and other communications equipment used by public safety and emergency workers, increased by 4 per cent to $1.3bn from a year ago, while operating earnings were $111m compared with $117m a year earlier.Sales to enterprise customers, which include barcode scanners and other equipment manufactured by its Symbol unit, were $747m, up 11 per cent from the year-ago quarter, driven in part by strong sales of mobile computing equipment to retail customers such as Macy’s in North America, a leading Russian retailer, a major supermarket in the Netherlands and two big retailers in France. Operating earnings increased to $59m from $44m in the same period the year before.Second-quarter net earnings from discontinued operations – mainly the network equipment business – were $291m. Looking ahead, the company expects third-quarter sales to increase by between 7 and 8 per cent and by as much as 6 per cent for the full year. Third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $0.56 and $0.61.
25;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-04-28T14:45:33Z;Motorola boosted by European operations;;Motorola Solutions, the US electronics group formed when Motorola was split into two separate quoted companies at the start of the year, reported strong first-quarter results boosted by a 14 per cent increase in sales to business customers helped in part by key retail contract wins in Europe.In addition to strong first-quarter results, Motorola Solutions forecast a sales growth of between 4 and 5 per cent for the current quarter, underscoring its confidence in the market for its products which include wireless systems for enterprise customers and government, including emergency and public safety services.The old Motorola split in two in January to form Motorola Solutions and Motorola Mobility, which sells mobile phones and television set-top boxes. Motorola Solutions expected to complete the delayed sale of its 3G mobile telecoms equipment business to Nokia Siemens networks on Friday following approval of the deal by Chinese regulators last week.The Schaumburg, Illinois-based company posted earnings from continuing operations of $359m, or $1.06 a share, up from $96m, or 29 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. First-quarter sales of $1.9bn were up 8 per cent from the first quarter of 2010 and driven by solid demand across both its government and enterprise segments.Enterprise sales rose to $695m and were boosted by particularly strong growth in Europe, where Motorola won a series of big contracts such as transportation and logistics wins with General Logistics Systems in Germany and Correos in Spain. Sales to government increased by 5 per cent to $1.2bn.“Motorola Solutions had an outstanding first quarter with revenue growth in all four of our geographic regions,” said Greg Brown, chief executive. “We maintained our focus on solid earnings and cash generation as our government and enterprise customers continued to seek solutions that drive improved efficiency and strong return on investment.”Mr Brown added that the European retail sector had emerged as a significant growth market for Motorola and is leading the world in terms of the adoption of new technologies including radio frequency identification.Looking ahead, the company said it expected to see continuing growth across both government and enterprise segments. Excluding the network business being sold to NSN, second-quarter sales are expected to grow between 4 and 5 per cent over the second quarter of 2010 with earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.46 to $0.51. In addition, Motorola now expects full-year revenue growth to track toward 4 to 4.5 per cent with operating earnings of 16 to 16.5 per cent of sales.
26;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-04-13T18:33:53Z;Huawei declares truce with Motorola;;Huawei and Motorola have settled their intellectual property disputes, freeing the Chinese telecoms company from damaging US litigation and paving the way for Nokia Siemens Networks’ proposed acquisition of Motorola’s wireless assets.Huawei Technologies and Motorola Solutions said in a joint statement on Wednesday they had agreed to drop pending lawsuits against each other.Huawei expressed hope that the deal would “clear up certain misconceptions” in the US about the company, whose founder was formerly an officer in the People’s Liberation Army.Separately, Motorola Solutions reduced the price NSN will pay for its network infrastructure unit from $1.2bn to $975m. The deal will close on April 29.Motorola believes that with the lawsuits now settled, Chinese regulators will approve the sale of its mobile network business to NSN.When Motorola put the unit up for sale last year, Huawei had also vied for it. But Motorola announced it had chosen to sell to NSN instead and named Huawei as a defendant in a trade secrets lawsuit.The US company accused Lemko, a start-up whose staff included several former Motorola employees, and Huawei of conspiring to steal trade secrets. At the time, Huawei was struggling to win big network contracts in the North American market, where it had also been sued by Cisco for allegedly copying the router company’s technology. Cisco and Huawei settled in 2004.In January this year, Huawei won a Chicago court order to stop Motorola transferring certain intellectual property to NSN that had been developed in co-operation with Huawei.The Motorola-NSN deal was simultaneously delayed by a prolonged antitrust review by China’s commerce ministry. The regulator’s decision is due early next month.Motorola agreed to withdraw its claims and dismiss Huawei as a defendant in the trade secrets case. Huawei, in turn, said it would drop its lawsuit against Motorola and NSN in exchange for an agreement under which the Huawei technology is transferred to NSN for a fee.“Huawei had filed objections to the Ministry of Commerce, and it has already withdrawn its objections,” said Robert Haslam, a partner at Covington and Burling, which advised Huawei. “If their objections were the only ones, nothing should stand in the way [of the acquisition].”Motorola expressed confidence that the deal would now receive Chinese government approval in time to be completed by the end of the month. Once NSN takes over Motorola’s network infrastructure assets, it will overtake Huawei as the world’s second-largest telecoms network gear vendor after Ericsson.
27;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-04-13T18:33:53Z;Relief for Huawei as it settles with Motorola;;When Huawei announced the settlement of its intellectual property disputes with Motorola Solutions on Wednesday, company executives were triumphant.As part of a broader mutual agreement, Motorola also dropped its allegations that the Chinese telecommunications network equipment maker had stolen some of its trade secrets.“This is a very clear, comprehensive vindication of our brand and our legal claims,” said Bill Plummer, spokesman for Huawei’s US unit. “It puts an end to the unwarranted speculation about the integrity of our business practices.”The Chinese company could use some good news after a year in which it has been repeatedly set back in the US – a market it has long viewed as key to its global expansion aims.Last summer, it lost out to Nokia Siemens Networks in bidding for the wireless network assets of Motorola. Then 2Wire, a Silicon Valley internet software firm it had aspired to buy, went to Pace of the UK instead.In November, Sprint Nextel, the US’s third-largest telecoms operator, picked Samsung over Huawei as one of its suppliers for a $5bn infrastructure project to build a next-generation mobile network.Most recently, Huawei was in February forced to unwind a $2m acquisition of patents from a company called 3Leaf after the Committee on Foreign Investment (Cfius), the US body that scrutinises cross-border deals for potential national security implications, refused to endorse it.Wednesday’s news proved a rare positive moment in a market where Huawei feels it has been unfairly vilified. But it could be short-lived.While the settlement removes a commercial problem – a fight born out of fierce competition – Huawei’s troubles in America remain mostly political.The fact that Ren Zhengfei, the company’s chief executive, was an engineer in China’s People’s Liberation Army before founding Huawei, and that the firm’s ownership structure is not transparent, have created lingering suspicions that Huawei might be an agent for the Chinese military.Some security experts and politicians in the US argue that allowing a company such as this to build telecoms networks could mean putting critical infrastructure at risk.“[The settlement with Motorola] is one brick in a wall they’re trying to break down,” says Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA, a Beijing-based telecoms consultancy. “I am not very optimistic for their outlook in the US in the near term,” he added.Still, observers argue that Huawei’s settlement with Motorola signals the Chinese company’s determination to make inroads in the American market.When Motorola listed it as a defendant last summer in a case over alleged theft of trade secrets from Motorola, Huawei considered its options and decided to fight back. It argued that it had to protect intellectual property it had developed for Motorola in a long-running co-operation to delay the acquisition of Motorola’s wireless assets by NSN, its fiercest rival in network gear.People familiar with Huawei say this was necessary because the Motorola lawsuit was perceived as truly damaging. “Accusations of intellectual property theft are much worse for us than some empty political talk because they could shake the confidence our customers have in us,” says one Huawei executive.The company was especially sensitive to this risk because it has faced it before. In 2003, Cisco, the internet equipment company, sued Huawei over alleged intellectual property theft. Although the two companies settled a year later, the accusations have haunted the Chinese company in spite of the fact it has since built an impressive intellectual property portfolio of its own.For Motorola, the decision to settle the legal battles and accept a lower purchase price for its mobile network business is a pragmatic solution to two issues that had become a distraction to management and generated uncertainty.Greg Brown, chief executive of Motorola, acknowledged this year that the delayed closure of the deal could lead to customer losses and disaffection among the workforce.For its part, NSN has been keen to complete the transaction as quickly as possible in order to bolster its position in the US market and compete more effectively against Huawei for the number two slot in the global mobile infrastructure business.
28;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-04-05T19:43:15Z;Motorola hopes for end to deal delay;;Motorola Solutions now hopes to complete the sale of its mobile networks business to Nokia Siemens Networks by the end of June – almost a year after the $1.2bn deal was first announced.The sale was originally unveiled in July last year but has been delayed twice by Chinese antitrust regulators who have yet to approve the transaction.Greg Brown, Motorola’s chief executive, said the decision of the anti-monopoly department of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MofCom) to subject the deal to a “phase three” review had, “added more time” to the process.“The additional level of review and scrutiny now has us targeting the completion of deal in the second quarter,” Mr Brown said.“I do not know why they are taking more time, I have not been personally involved in the discussions with MofCom about this other than one basic conversation several months ago, so I can’t speak to the details or what they are thinking.”Mr Brown emphasised that the deal has already been approved by all other regulatory authorities.“We are still targeting Q2 and candidly there is not much more to say about it,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.Despite the latest delay, Nokia Siemens Networks said last month that it remains committed to the deal which would help it establish a stronger presence in North America and enable it to compete more effectively with rivals including Huawei.Earlier this year a US court granted a request from Huawei to block temporarily the transfer of certain technology from Motorola to Nokia Siemens Networks as part of the deal.In a separate lawsuit, Motorola Solutions, which spun off its mobile phone business at the start of the year into a separate company, has accused Huawei of conspiring with five former Motorola employees to steal trade secrets. Both cases continue.In the interview on Tuesday, Mr Brown said that Motorola Solutions was continuing to work with its suppliers in Japan where it has 1,000 employees and contractors, to minimise any disruption from the earthquake and tsunami last month.He said Motorola has a number of suppliers in Japan but does not undertake any manufacturing of its own there.“We have a team there this week assessing the situation,” he said.
29;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-01-25T18:19:33Z;Huawei wins block on Motorola-NSN deal;;A US court has granted a request from Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker, to block temporarily the transfer of certain technology from Motorola to Nokia Siemens Networks.The decision is set to further delay NSN’s $1.2bn acquisition of Motorola Solutions’ wireless telecommunications network business, a deal likely to create a stronger global competitor to Huawei.Following a hearing on Monday night, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordered Motorola, its two separately listed units Motorola Solutions and Motorola Mobility “not to disclose any of [the] plaintiff’s confidential information to defendants Nokia Siemens Networks”.Nokia Siemens Networks said on Tuesday it was “monitoring” the legal action between Huawei and Motorola. NSN stressed that it had obtained regulatory approval for the Motorola transaction in every relevant country apart from China, adding: “We are continuing to work with the authorities in China to get regulatory approval for the transaction.” Motorola declined to comment on the ruling.Huawei had filed a complaint earlier on Monday alleging that Motorola’s plans to transfer technology acquired from Huawei to NSN were “illegal” and asking the court to block such transfer until the matter could be arbitrated.Under a decade-long co-operation deal, Huawei had developed technology which Motorola then sold under its own brand in many markets.According to Huawei’s complaint, the two companies’ agreements ban Motorola from handing over any confidential information gained from Huawei to third parties unless Huawei approves it. The Chinese company said it had withheld this approval when asked by Motorola following the NSN deal.Huawei argues that while its past co-operation with Motorola was complementary, transferring details to NSN would cause “irreparable harm” because NSN directly competes with Huawei in the telecoms network infrastructure business.The court also ordered Motorola and NSN to notify it and Huawei immediately of any action taken by China’s Ministry of Commerce, the last anti-monopoly regulator which has yet to approve the acquisition.NSN said a month ago that it was still waiting for approval of the acquisition by Mofcom and expected to complete the deal in the first quarter.Huawei’s legal action marks a more aggressive response to the hurdles Chinese companies face in expanding abroad.Over the past decade, Huawei has rapidly climbed through the ranks of the global network equipment industry, reaching second position after Ericsson with Rmb149bn ($22bn) in revenues in 2009. NSN would take the second slot after acquiring Motorola’s assets.The Chinese company has also hit roadblocks in its attempt to conquer the US market. It lost out to NSN in an auction for the Motorola assets last year although it offered a higher price.Immediately after NSN’s agreement to buy the assets, Motorola sued Huawei over alleged theft of trade secrets.At the time, Huawei said it would “vigorously defend itself against baseless allegations.” This was the latest setback for Huawei in the US after a string of planned acquisitions broke down over national security concerns and a bid for a $5bn networking equipment contract for Sprint Nextel was blocked.Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in New York and Andrew Parker in London
30;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-01-24T19:51:33Z;Huawei sues over Motorola unit sale;;Huawei has asked a US court to block the $1.2bn sale of Motorola Solutions’ wireless telecommunications network business to its rival, Nokia Siemens Networks.The Chinese telecoms equipment maker, once a partner of Motorola on wireless networks, lost out to NSN in an auction for the Motorola assets last year, in spite of offering a higher price.Huawei claims that the sale of Motorola’s mobile network equipment business to NSN could lead to “trade secret misappropriation, copyright infringement and breach of contract”. It claims it would suffer “irreparable harm” if confidential information about its wireless telecoms business is not protected and is seeking an interim order blocking the sale “until this matter can be arbitrated”.The suit, which names Motorola Solutions, Motorola Mobility and NSN, represents the latest step in an increasingly bitter fight between the industry rivals. Shortly after the deal with NSN, Motorola sued the Chinese telecoms equipment maker for alleged theft of trade secrets.Huawei’s counter suit could further delay NSN’s acquisition of Motorola’s ‘2G’ and ‘3G’ mobile network infrastructure business, a deal that is expected to help NSN overtake its Chinese rival as the world’s second-largest supplier of telecoms network equipment. Motorola said in December that completion of the deal had been delayed because it had not received Chinese government approval.A succession of planned acquisitions by Huawei in the US have failed due to national security concerns. Late last year its bid to win a $5bn networking equipment contract for Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile network operator, was blocked.In the complaint, filed on Monday in the Northern District of Illinois, Huawei said Motorola’s plans to transfer information it had gained under a decade-long partnership with Huawei to NSN were illegal and would hurt its interests.“Such a transfer, if consummated in its originally contemplated form, will result in the massive disclosure of Huawei’s confidential information to NSN, with irreparable harm to Huawei,” read the filing.“Motorola is obligated to maintain the secrecy of the confidential information that Huawei provided to it under the agreements,” Huawei said.Motorola said: “We believe this lawsuit is without merit.“As previously stated, we are targeting to complete the sale of our Networks business to NSN in early 2011 following receipt of approval from China’s antitrust authorities.”NSN had no immediate comment.
31;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2011-01-04T21:48:54Z;Motorola split marked with S&P’s biggest rise;;"Newly formed Motorola Mobility soared while the S&P 500 edged lower, dragged down by falling commodity prices.In the first day of trading after Motorola was split in two, both the handset-focused Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions, which makes networking systems, rallied.Mobility jumped 9.5 per cent to $33.12, which was the biggest gain on the
S&P 500.Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse, gave the stock an “outperform” rating, saying that he expected smartphones to lead a recovery and the launch of Mobility’s first tablet device in early 2011 to add to earnings per share. He also said the company’s excess cash should not be ignored.But Ron Hall, an analyst at JPMorgan, rated Mobility “underweight”, citing concerns about smartphone and tablet competition, especially as Verizon starts to offer the iPhone. “We estimate that over 50 per cent of Motorola Mobility’s smartphone units sales could come from Verizon,” he said.“We believe the loss of around 4m smartphone units in 2011 would decrease our earnings per share forecast by around 55 per cent and that a larger share loss is possible given the continuing dominant position of Apple’s iPhone in the market.“In a worst-case scenario, we believe Verizon share loss could cause Motorola Mobility to fail to break even for full year 2011,”
he said.Mobility’s rivals edged higher with shares in Apple, which hit another all-time high on Monday, gaining 0.5 per cent to $331.21. US-listed shares in Research in Motion nudged up 0.3 per cent to $59.10.Analysts at JPMorgan were more positive about the prospects for Motorola Systems, initiating coverage with a “neutral” rating and a $38 price target.They said that, while the company’s enterprise assets were growing fast, investors should be more cautious about the government
division, where demand could be hit by tightening budgets.Shares in Motorola Solutions spent much of the session edging just slightly higher before a last-minute spurt to gain 6.6 per cent to $39.77 by the closing bell.The wider markets were mixed after Monday’s rally.

Motorola Mobility would “participate across the tiers” of different size tablets, from 7-inch to 11-inch screens, he added.Analysts at Jefferies said Motorola Mobility could launch a tablet using Google’s Honeycomb, a next-generation version of Android aimed at tablets, one or two months ahead of competitors.People briefed on the group’s tablet plans have also pointed to the likelihood that at least one device could lean heavily towards video consumption, tied to Verizon’s FiOS digital pay-television service.Mr Jha, brought in from Qualcomm in 2008 to engineer a comeback after heavy market share losses to Apple, Samsung and others, expressed confidence in its US mobile business, where analysts believe Verizon Wireless accounts for more than half of all the handsets Motorola sells.With growing expectation that Verizon will break AT&T’s exclusive grip on the iPhone in the US, and Verizon also supporting a rival Samsung LTE phone, Motorola Mobility is expected to diversify, working with additional carriers including Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and AT&T.Shares in both Motorola Mobility rose 9 per cent by lunchtime in New York after its split from Motorola Solutions, which focuses on public safety, data and advanced services for businesses. Shares in Motorola Solutions traded up 0.25 per cent.The Motorola split, initiated after pressure from investor Carl Icahn, would give Motorola Mobility currency to acquire companies and attract staff, ensure a more consistent pattern of innovation, and simplify the company’s message to investors, said Mr Jha.“You’ll see a board which is much more focused on understanding technology as opposed to managing a portfolio,” he said.Jefferies speculated that Motorola Mobility could be a target for Huawei, ZTE or Dell, or could merge with Sony Ericsson.
33;MSI;Motorola Solutions;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
